	<brief_title>Carfilzomib, Bendamustine, Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of carfilzomib based on when you joined this study. Up to 5 dose levels of carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine and dexamethasone will be tested. Up to 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of both carfilzomib and bendamustine. The second, third,, and fourth groups will receive higher doses of carfilzomib. The fifth and final group will receive a higher dose of bendamustine. The study will continue to move from group to group only if no intolerable side effects are seen in the previous groups. All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone. Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days. You will receive carfilzomib by vein over 30 minutes on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycles 1-12, and on Days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of Cycles 13 and beyond. The infusion will last about 30 minutes. You may remain on the Cycle 1-12 dosing schedule for the entire study if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will be monitored by the study staff for any side effects for at least 30-45 minutes after receiving carfilzomib during each dose you receive during Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycle 2. You will receive bendamustine by vein right after your carfilzomib infusion on Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 1-3 and Day 1 of Cycle 4 and each cycle after that. The infusion will last about 1 hour. You will take dexamethasone by mouth or by vein (over 20 minutes) at the following times: - On Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of Cycles 1-3. - On Days 1, 2, 15 and 16 of Cycles 4-12. - On Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 13 and beyond. Dexamethasone should be taken 30 minutes to 4 hours before the carfilzomib dose on the days you receive carfilzomib. If you are taking dexamethasone by mouth, it should be taken with food and a glass of water. Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycles 1-12, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including a neurologic exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. - You will collect your urine over 24 hours to measure your protein levels. You will be given a container for collecting the urine. - You will have a MRI or CT scan if the doctor thinks it is necessary. On Days 2, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-12, the following tests and procedures will be performed: ° Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycle 13 and each cycle after that, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. - You will collect your urine over 24 hours to measure your protein levels. You will be given a container for collecting the urine. On Day 15 of Cycles 13 and each cycle after that, the following tests and procedures will be performed: ° Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation in this study will be over after you have completed the end-of-study and follow-up visits. End-of-Study Visit: Within 30 days after you have stopped receiving the study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. - You will collect your urine over 24 hours to measure your protein levels. You will be given a container for collecting the urine. - If the doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to look for tumors caused by MM. Follow-Up: If you leave the study and the disease did not get worse while you were on study, the study staff will call you every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months every year after that to ask you about the status of the disease. The phone call will last about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. Carfilzomib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of MM. Its use in this study is investigational. Bendamustine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of rituximab-refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, slow-growing (indolent) lymphoma, and for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Its use in this study is investigational. Dexamethasone is FDA approved and commercially available in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. Its use in combination with carfilzomib and bendamustine is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 49 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
