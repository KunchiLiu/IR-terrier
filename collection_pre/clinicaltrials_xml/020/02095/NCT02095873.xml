	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to evaluate dietary inducers of glyoxalase 1 for effects on metabolic and vascular health in overweight volunteers at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The research objectives are: (i) To evaluate dietary inducers of glyoxalase 1 for effects on markers of glucose metabolism during an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), (ii) To evaluate dietary inducers of glyoxalase 1 for effects on vascular function on three levels, using finger fold capillary density by capillaroscopy (FFCD), arterial stiffness by aortal pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and flow mediated dilatation (FMD); and effects on metabolic and pro-inflammatory markers in circulating blood and urine.</detailed_description>
