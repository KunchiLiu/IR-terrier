	<brief_title>Effect of Rufinamide on Chronic Postthoracotomy Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic neuropathic pain after thoracic surgery will be evaluated and treated with oxycodone. Patients with a stable analgesic regimen, not reaching a good pain relief will be randomized to receive Rufinamide (Inovelon)vs. Placebo as an ad-on treatment to oxycodone. Neurophysiological and clinical data will be monitored.</detailed_description>
