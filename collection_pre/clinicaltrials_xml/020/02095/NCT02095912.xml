	<brief_title>Aggressive Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Organ Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCC) are one of the most common skin cancers. They belong to the epithelial neoplasm of the skin, which manifest a local aggressive growth and have potential for metastasis. Organ transplant recipients have a hundredfold higher incidence of SCC. Unfortunately the primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM)-Classification for the prognosis of SCC in this group of patient has not yet been established. Therefore there are no standardised criteria for evaluation of local recurrence or prognosis. The aim of this study is to identify criteria, which permit a risk assessment relating to aggressiveness of SCC.</detailed_description>
