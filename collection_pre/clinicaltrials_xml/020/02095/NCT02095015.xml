	<brief_summary>Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type II (MPS II; Hunter syndrome) is a rare, X-linked disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) and occurs almost exclusively in boys, with an incidence of approximately 1.3 per 100,000 live male births.1 Early identification of MPS II is challenging because some initial features, such as chronic runny nose, otitis media, and hernias, are commonly seen in the general population. As a result, even though the signs and symptoms of MPS II typically appear early in childhood, the diagnosis may lag behind by several years. The primary objective of this international multi-center study is to evaluate the positive screening rate of MPS II subjects by screening a high-risk male pediatric population who have had or are scheduled for 1 or more specific ENT surgical procedures (adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy and/or tympanostomy) and who have a previously repaired or present evidence of an inguinal and/or umbilical hernia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With evidence-based information from MPS registries regarding the types of surgical interventions that are most prevalent in MPS, this screening study is expected to provide the understanding of the role pediatric ENT surgeons can play in identifying young children with MPS.</detailed_description>
