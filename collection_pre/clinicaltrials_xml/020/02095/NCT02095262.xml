	<brief_summary>Tinnitus refers to a the perception of a ringing, hissing or buzzing sound despite there being no such sound in the external world. It is prevalent and for many individual is a distressing condition. Recent advances in the understanding of changes in the hearing brain and their relation to tinnitus perception has led to a focus on forms of active auditory training which might provide effective techniques for tinnitus management. Our recent trial of auditory training provided evidence that training using sounds where there is no hearing loss has benefit in terms of reduced tinnitus intrusiveness, above training at where there is some level of hearing loss. Our next challenge is to build on this finding in ways that might maximize the benefits we observe. The training software we used previously was developed for use with children. Past participants have given mixed reviews of this software. While some enjoyed the training or found it soporific, others reported that they found it too monotonous and un-motivating. We therefore wish to explore the impact of different game mechanics in the delivery of auditory training and have designed two different interactive games in the context of training for tinnitus benefit. These games will deliver the same type of auditory training as the software we currently use, but should be intrinsically motivating, i.e. be a game that the people are motivated to play irrespective of any potential benefit for tinnitus. The game we previously used is reactive, i.e. the sounds play and the player selects what they think is the correct answer (odd one out). The two new games we wish to test can be described as interactive, i.e. players control the sound delivery and actively seek the correct answer: this may have additional benefit for tinnitus.</brief_summary>
