	<brief_summary>With improvements in patient and graft survival, increasing attention has been placed on complications that contribute to long-term patient morbidity and mortality. New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a common complication of solid-organ transplantation, and is a strong predictor of graft failure and cardiovascular mortality in the transplant population. Risk factors for NODAT in transplant recipients are similar to those in non-transplant patients, but transplant-specific risk factors such as hepatitis C (HCV) infection, corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors play a dominant role in NODAT pathogenesis. The predominant factor for causing NODAT by corticosteroids seems to be the aggravation of insulin resistance; however several studies have displayed deleterious effects on insulin secretion and β-cells. Thus, adjusting the immunosuppressant regimen to improve glucose tolerance must be measured and defined from long term perspective. As recipients of organ transplants survive longer, the complications of NODAT have assumed greater importance; therefore, we designed a prospective study to compare the safety and efficacy of early versus late withdrawal of corticosteroids after liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
