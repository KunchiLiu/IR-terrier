	<brief_title>Oligosecretary Myeloma: Prevalence and Its Clinical Significance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oligosecretary myeloma is a subgroup of multiple myeloma (MM) characterized by low levels of serum and urine monoclonal (M) protein below thresholds of measurable disease (a serum M protein ≥ 1g/dL, a urine M protein ≥ 200mg/day). Patients with oligosecretary myeloma do not have established methods for disease monitoring and clinical informations regarding oligosecretary myeloma are still largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical course of oligosecretary myeloma.</detailed_description>
