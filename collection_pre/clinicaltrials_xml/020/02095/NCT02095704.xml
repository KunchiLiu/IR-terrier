	<brief_summary>Drug dissolution in vivo play a crucial role for the bioavailability and therapeutic of an orally administered solid dosage form. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a standard paracetamol tablet in comparison with oral solution in Chinese healthy volunteers. Based on the Noyes-Whitney equation and pharmacokinetics parameters, investigators trend to propose a method to estimate in vivo dissolution time and dissolution kinetics of solid dosage form.</brief_summary>
