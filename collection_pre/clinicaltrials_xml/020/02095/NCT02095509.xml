	<brief_summary>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the thromboprophylactic agent enoxaparin in critically ill patients by comparing plasma anti-factor Xa activity when enoxaparin is administered either as a continuous intravenous infusion or subcutaneous bolus once daily. To investigate possible ongoing coagulation by coagulation markers during antithrombotic therapy with standard doses of enoxaparin</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Body Mass Index between 1830 kg/m2 Critically ill patients requiring intensive care and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis Expected to remain in the ICU for at least 72 h Written informed consent obtained from the patient or his/her legal representative. Other indications for anticoagulant therapy than thromboprophylaxis Intracranial haemorrhage or central neurosurgical operation within three months prior to the admission Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) according to the international society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria Known heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or hypersensitivity to enoxaparin or heparin Treatment with enoxaparin or any other lowmolecular weight heparin (LMWH) or heparin within 24 hours prior to ICU admission. If patient has received thromboprophylactic dose of LMWH within 2472 hours before ICU admission inclusion can be done if measured antifactor Xa level is &lt;0.1 IU/ml at the time of admission Any longterm anticoagulant medication, expect lowdose aspirin Major bleeding within the last week unless definitively treated Blood platelet count &lt;50, Pthromboplastin time (TT) &lt;40% , international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.7 Glomerular filtration rate less than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 estimated from serum creatinine by applying CockcroftGault equation or chronic dialysis HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infection Pregnancy</criteria>
