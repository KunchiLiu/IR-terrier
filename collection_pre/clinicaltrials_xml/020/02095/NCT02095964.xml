	<brief_summary>High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is in the centrum of the process of reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral cells to the liver[10]. HDL-C promotes endothelial generation of nitric oxide (NO) and improves endothelial function and arterial vasoreactivity[11]. In several studies, lower HDL-C level was reported to be associated with increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk[12-14]. HDL-C also has anti- inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities[15,16]. Concerning anti-inflammatory activity, HDL-C inhibits the activation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils[17,18] and inhibits the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin[15]. In this study we aimed to investigate the relation of HDL-C level with systemic inflammatory markers in patients with cardiac syndrome X (CSX).</brief_summary>
