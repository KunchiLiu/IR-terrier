	<detailed_description>The first scan will take place before the first ECT session. The second scan will occur after a minimum of six ECT sessions (average 2.5 weeks). Secondary measures will include mood symptom severity, neurocognitive measures, peripheral inflammatory markers and TSPO genotype. The hypothesis is that neuroinflammation will be increased by ECT. There will be no alterations to standard care of depressed patients due to participation in the study.</detailed_description>
