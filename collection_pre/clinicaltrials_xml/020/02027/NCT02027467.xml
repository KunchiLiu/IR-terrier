	<brief_summary>Combination of various herbs is known to promote mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. Hence the current study has been intended to study the effect of Stem Alive® on mobilization of stem cells. Stem Alive® include ingredients like green tea, ashwagandha, etc which are known to be used as traditional medicine. They are also tested qualitatively in academic and nutritional science research centers throughout the world and which substantially according to those studies stimulate the augmented availability of circulating hematopoietic cells. This study is projected to investigate the mobilization of stem cells on healthy human volunteers.</brief_summary>
