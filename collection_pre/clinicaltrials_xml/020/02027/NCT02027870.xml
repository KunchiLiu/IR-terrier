	<detailed_description>1. A prospective, a single set, multicenter clinical trial; 2. The primary in situ in patients with coronary heart disease; 3. The center of: 28 (the actual number of center shall prevail);The plan selected 621 patients;(where the total number of cases in 2.25 mm specification not less than 30 cases, 5 cases each specification of not less than 2.25 mm.) 4. Clinical follow-up time points: 1 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months of a year and 2 years to 5 years follow-up; This test by an independent coronary angiography core laboratories, data management and statistical center, clinical end points to judge committee and clinical monitoring of all relevant clinical and imaging data collecting, sorting, statistical analysis and judgement.All the selected patients within five years continuous follow-up tracking (phone or outpatient follow-up), to observe the happening of adverse events to the forward of the second generation of EXCEL drug-eluting stents (des) system security to make more accurate and credible evaluation.</detailed_description>
