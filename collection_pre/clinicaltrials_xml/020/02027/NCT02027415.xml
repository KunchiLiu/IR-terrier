	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that drinking different juices will affect the body's responses to air pollution. Subjects will be exposed to air pollution during a 2-hour car ride on the NJ (New Jersey) Turnpike. Each subject will be asked to do this twice. Before one car ride, the subject will be asked to drink orange juice. Before the other car ride, the subject will be asked to drink beet juice. Samples of blood and exhaled breath will be collected before, immediately after, and 24 hours after each car ride. Levels of nitrites/nitrates will be measured in the blood and breath.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Juice Types on the Responses to Air Pollution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will participate in two exposure sessions. The air pollution exposure consists of a 2-hour car ride along the NJ Turnpike. Samples will be collected at 3 time points for each exposure session: pre-exposure, immediately post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure. Blood samples will be collected immediately before and after a 5-minute occlusion at each time point. The subject will also be asked to provide samples of exhaled breath and complete symptom and stress questionnaires at each time point. Blood samples will be analyzed for serum nitrite. Exhaled breath samples will be analyzed for nitrates and nitrites.</detailed_description>
