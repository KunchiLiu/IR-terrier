	<brief_summary>Until now, diagnosis of constriction was based on pressure changes of ventricle by conventional pressure-wide hemodynamic evaluation but not on ventricular volume change. This study will provide answers to persisting questions about volume changes during respiration in patients with constrictive pericarditis by directly measuring both right and left ventricular volume.</brief_summary>
