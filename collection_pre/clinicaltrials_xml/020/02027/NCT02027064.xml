	<brief_summary>molecular relapse in t (8; 21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still a problem even after donor lymphocyte infusion. Interferon seemed to augment graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in this part of patients. the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon for the intervention of molecular relapse in t (8; 21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT)</brief_summary>
