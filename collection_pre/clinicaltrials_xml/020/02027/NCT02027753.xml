	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To investigate the efficacy(HbA1c) at 6 months after adding basal insulin therapy (insulin glargine) to dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and metformin plus or minus sulphonylurea Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess the efficacy by adding insulin glargine 2. To assess insulin dose 3. Safety</brief_summary>
