	<brief_summary>HIP ATTACK is an international randomized controlled trial of 1200 patients with a hip fracture that requires a surgical intervention. This trial will determine the effect of accelerated medical clearance and accelerated surgery compared to standard care on the 30-day risk of a major perioperative complication (i.e., a composite of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, nonfatal pneumonia, nonfatal sepsis, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal life-threatening and major bleeding).</brief_summary>
