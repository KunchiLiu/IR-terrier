	<brief_summary>Patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer often have weight loss, swallowing problems, and poor appetite. This may affect their ability to tolerate cancer treatment. The purpose of this study is to see if the researchers can apply a set of nutrition guidelines designed specifically for patients with cancer who are older than 65 years of age. The questions will allow them to assess the nutritional status and make appropriate referrals. If the patients are having swallowing problems or losing weight, the researchers want to address the nutritional problems early in the course of their treatment.</brief_summary>
