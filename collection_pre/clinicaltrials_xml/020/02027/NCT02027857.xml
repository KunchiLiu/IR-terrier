	<brief_summary>Brain edema is the main reason for the disability and lethality in traumatic brain injury, which is the most difficult part of emergency rescue. Recently, there is no medical equipment to monitor the early brain edema in clinic. We have found that Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can perform the real-time and bedside monitoring of brain electrical impedance after single-dose mannitol treatment, which may be a new strategy for the surveillance of brain edema. In this study, we would like to compare the application in traumatic brain edema between EIT and Noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, including the progress of brain edema, the relationship between impedance and ICP, and the improvement for the patients' prognosis. EIT would probably be a new image strategy for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.</brief_summary>
