	<mesh_term>Hemophilia A</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Factor VIII</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Subjects must have participated in the "GreenGene™ F_P3", (with Eudra CT number 201200144540) or a pediatric study with GreenGene™ F 2. Have ≥50 previous exposure days to GreenGene™ F, as documented in the subject's medical records. 3. Negative assays for FVIII inhibitor at inclusion (&lt;0.6BU Nijmegen assay), i.e. at the end of study "GreenGene™ F_P3" for patients entering into this extension study immediately after finishing the previous phase III study. 4. Normal liver and kidney function 5. Platelet count ≥ 100,000㎕ 6. Normal prothrombin time or International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 7. Subjects receiving therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis must be on a stable treatment regimen 8. Subjects must be able to withhold FVIII infusions for approximately 72 h prior to each inhibitor assay 9. Absolute CD4 lymphocyte cell count ≥ 200㎕ 10. Signed the written informed consent form or informed consent was obtained from the subject's legal guardian 11. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at screening or Baseline (as documented by a negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of βhCG). A test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug 12. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (i.e. bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least one month before dosing) 13. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol 1. Presence at Screening of FVIII inhibitor ≥ 0.6 BU as tested with the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay. 2. Laboratory or clinical evidence of portal vein hypertension including, but not limited to, an INR &gt; 1.4, the presence of splenomegaly and/or spider angiomata of physical examination and/or a history of esophageal hemorrhage or documented esophageal varices 3. Uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg) 4. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL 5. Severe renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt; 2x upper limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin &gt; 2x the ULN) 6. Liver disease (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt; 3x the ULN) 7. History of diabetes or other metabolic disease 8. History of hypersensitivity or serious adverse reaction to recombinant or plasmaderived FVIII concentrates 9. History of pretreatment prior to the administration of FVIII products (e.g., antihistamines) 10. Regular use of antifibrinolytics or medications affecting platelet function 11. Hypersensitivity to hamster or mouse derived proteins 12. Blood transfusions within 30 days of enrollment into the study 13. Current participation in another investigational drug or device study, or participated in a clinical study involving an investigational drug or device within 30 days of enrollment into the study 14. Unable or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures 15. Females who are pregnant (positive βhCG test) or breastfeeding</criteria>
