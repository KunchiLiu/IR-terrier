	<brief_summary>The duration of sensory block after single dose of long acting local anesthetics is not sufficient to avoid the postoperative use of opioids. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as clonidine have been shown to increase the duration of peripheral nerve block. Dexmedetomidine is a more potent and selective Î±-2-adrenoceptor compared to clonidine. To the best of our knowledge, the use of Dexmedetomidine in different dose levels as adjuvant to local anesthetic was not previously reported for femoral nerve block.</brief_summary>
