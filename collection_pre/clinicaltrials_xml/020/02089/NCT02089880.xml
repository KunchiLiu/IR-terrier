	<criteria>Lower extremity functional impairment due to neurologic or neuromuscular disease, orthopedic disease or trauma. Prior active and compliant use of unilateral Kneeanklefoot orthosis (KAFO) or Stance control orthosis (SCO). Age 18 80 years. Demonstrate a reciprocal gait pattern using the SCO and CBrace trial tools. Cognitive ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Subjects must be able to demonstrate the ability to turn the global positioning sensor (GPS) and Actigraph units on and off and sufficient memory ability to wear the devices each day during use of the orthoses. Passive ankle range of motion (PROM) of the lower extremity requiring the kneeanklefoot orthosis (KAFO) of less than 2 degrees. Body weight &gt;275 pounds. Unstable neurological or cardiovascular/pulmonary disease, cancer. Knee flexion contracture resulting in the inability to actively use CBrace or SCO. Participating in physical therapy currently or within 1 month of starting protocol, specific to orthotic use and gait training.</criteria>
