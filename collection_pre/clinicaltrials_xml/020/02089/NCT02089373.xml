	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a study on genetic pathology, obtaining of pure cancer tissues is mandatory. Although the endoscopy with biopsy has been a gold standard for diagnosing gastric cancer, percentage of cancer cells in biopsy samples is usually 30% or less. Recently, confocal laser endomicroscopy has been introduced for real-time histopathologic diagnosis in various cancers. The investigators aim to evaluate that biopsy using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy will increase the percentage of cancer cells in biopsy samples.</brief_summary>
