	<brief_summary>Incisional hernias are one of the most frequent complications in abdominal surgery. Laparoscopic repair is widely used but even not standardized. Existing data from different study designs show no representative data resulting in a lack of comparability and evidence. Therefore the standardization of operative techique has been proposed by the LIPOM-study group and will be assessed in a prospective manner.</brief_summary>
