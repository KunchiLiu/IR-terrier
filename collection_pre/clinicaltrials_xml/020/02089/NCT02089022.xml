	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ice and shortwave diathermy in different regions of lower limb neuromuscular response and balance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Neuromuscular Responses and the Balance After the Application of Physiotherapy Resources</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Applying ice and shortwave diathermy was performed separately (on different days) in the foot, ankle and calf. To assess the neuromuscular response was evaluated electromyographic activity of the rectus femorals, biceps femorals, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. To assess the effect of applications on balance, through a force platform was evaluated oscillation of the center of pressure as well as ground reaction forces.</detailed_description>
