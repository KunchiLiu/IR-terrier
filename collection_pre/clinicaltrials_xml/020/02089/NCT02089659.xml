	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the influence of hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of doravirine (MK-1439). In Part 1, PK of doravirine in participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency will be compared with that of healthy control subjects matched with regard to mean age and weight. If a clinically meaningful increase in doravirine exposure is observed in participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency in Part 1, study Part 2 will evaluate PK of doravirine in participants with mild hepatic insufficiency.</brief_summary>
