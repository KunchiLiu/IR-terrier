	<brief_summary>Optimization of Pazopanib Exposition in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma by Therapeutic Drug Monitoring followed by Individual Dose Escalation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Pazopanib Exposure in RCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, multi-center, intraindividual dose-optimization study. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma receive 800 mg Pazopanib daily. After 14 days the Pazopanib plasma concentration is determined. In patients who show good tolerability and plasma trough levels of ≤ 20 µg/mLthe daily dose is increased in 200 mg steps until plasma trough levels of &gt; 20 µg/mL are achieved or dose-limiting toxicities occur, a daily dose of 1600 mg is reached, or there is disease progression. After each dose optimization the plasma concentration is determined after 14 days (day 11-15). If indicated, dose optimization is performed 21 days after the previous dose optimization (on day 18-24).</detailed_description>
