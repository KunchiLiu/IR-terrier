	<brief_summary>The consumption of milk and dairy products is recognised as an essential part of a healthy diet as it represents an important source of key micro- and macronutrients. Nevertheless, there is still a widespread conviction that the overall high energy density and concentration of long-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) present in dairy have detrimental health effects, contributing to the progression of cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. Supplementation of the bovine diet with a source of MUFA, such as rapesee oil, has become an achievable strategy in order to reduce the amount of SFA present in dairy products. The aim of this project is to observe the effects of three types of dairy products (UHT milk, cheese and butter) produced from milk derived from cows fed withhigh-oleic sunflower oil, on CVD risk biomarkers and plasma total cholesterol levels in adults with an increased risk of developing CVD. The aim is to determine whether an isoenergetic exchange of dairy products will affect vascular function and CVD biomarkers.</brief_summary>
