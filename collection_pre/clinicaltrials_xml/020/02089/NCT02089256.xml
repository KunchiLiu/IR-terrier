Study hypothesis: the effect of liraglutide on insulin release may change after repeated administration. The effect of liraglutide on insulin release will be tested using graded glucose infusion test (GGIT) in healthy volunteers. GGIT will be performed without medication and repeated 12 hours after first dose of liraglutide and after 3 weeks of treatment with liraglutide.</brief_summary>
