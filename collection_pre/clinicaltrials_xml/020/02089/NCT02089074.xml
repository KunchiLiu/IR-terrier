	<brief_summary>Use of drugs is an important factor in secondary prophylaxis after transient ischemic attack (TIA), but studies show that adherence to the prescribed drugs is often poor. This randomised controlled trial aims to investigate whether a systematic follow up of drug treatment using medication reconciliation, medication reviews and patient counselling by clinical pharmacists, improves adherence and/or decreases cardiovascular events the first three months and the first year after TIA. Patient satisfaction will also be compared between the two groups.</brief_summary>
