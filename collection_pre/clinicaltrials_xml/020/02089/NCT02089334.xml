	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of RX-0201, up to a target dose of 250 mg/m^2/day, when given in combination with everolimus (Stage 1), and to assess the safety and efficacy of RX-0201 plus everolimus, in subjects with metastatic renal cell cancer (Stage 2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Finding, Safety and Efficacy Study of RX-0201 Plus Everolimus in Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group study of RX-0201 in combination with everolimus, versus everolimus alone to treat subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma will be conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 will be an open-label, dose-escalation study of RX-0201 to identify a safe and tolerable dose of RX-0201 up to a target dose of 250 mg/m^2/day when given in combination with everolimus. Stage 2 will be a randomized, open-label, 2-arm study of RX-0201 in combination with everolimus versus everolimus alone. Subjects will receive RX-0201, at the dose identified in Stage 1, in combination with everolimus or everolimus alone, for up to 8 cycles to determine safety and efficacy of the combination.</detailed_description>
