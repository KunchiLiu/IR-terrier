	<brief_summary>Phase I, open-label study in 15 healthy adult subjects receive 6 mg of auranofin orally once every 24 hours for 7days. Blood samples will be taken for 17 weeks following the last dose of auranofin for determination of terminal phase pharmacokinetic parameters. Stool samples will also be obtained for the measurement of gold.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auranofin PK Following Oral Dose Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Auranofin is a gold-containing chemical salt, granted as an orphan drug status for use in the treatment of amebiasis. Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoon Entamoeba histolytica. It affects about ten percent of the world's population, being especially common in areas with poor health infrastructure. This is a Phase I open label, multiple dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Auranofin following oral dose administration for 7 days to healthy subjects. 15 healthy male and female volunteers age 18-45 years, inclusive enrolled in one site. The study duration is 48 weeks and up to 23 weeks of subject participation. The primary objective characterizes the pharmacokinetics of gold, given as auranofin, during and after 7 days of once daily oral dose administration. The secondary objective monitor the safety of Auranofin during and after 7 days of oral administration.</detailed_description>

Evidence or history of clinically significant hematologic, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, immunologic, neurologic or dermatologic disease (including drug allergies that are clinically significant) which in the opinion of the Investigator could impact the participation of the subject in the study or the assessment of the study endpoints. Current evidence of or history of malignancy (excepting completely treated cervical cancer in situ or intraductal carcinoma of the breast, or &lt;/= 2 basal cell and/or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin completely excised) in the 5 years prior to Day 1 with no evidence of recurrence. Breastfeeding or a positive serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit or Day 1. History of drug abuse within 6 months prior to study drug administration. A history of alcohol abuse, defined as regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14 drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor), within 6 months prior to study drug administration.

You must not change your use of tobacco from your first visit and through completion of the last visit of the study. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration. Prior exposure to goldcontaining products. Use of any prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins, or dietary or herbal supplements within 14 days prior to study drug administration. As exceptions, acetaminophen may be used at doses of &lt;/=1 g/day until 24 hours prior to study drug administration. Blood donation of &gt;/= 1 pint (473 mL) within 30 days prior to study drug administration. Plasma and platelet donation within 14 days prior to study drug administration. Screening liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) greater than upper limit of normal (ULN).

History of allergy to auranofin or any of the excipients in the capsules. (excipients per the package insert of auranofin are listed in Section 6.1) Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, poses a risk to the safety of the individual or the valid conduct of the study.</criteria>
