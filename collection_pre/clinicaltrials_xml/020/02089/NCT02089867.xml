	<brief_title>Plant Sterols Effect on Previous Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Consumption of food products enriched with plant sterols and treatment with ezetimibe both reduce cholesterol absorption in the intestine by different mechanisms and effectively reduce LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) plasma levels. Although, the associated usage of ezetimibe to plants sterols in coronary patients not reaching recommended lipid levels despite the use of statins has not yet been demonstrated. Objectives: Evaluate if ezetimibe 10mg associated to plant sterols spread enriched with 2g of plant sterols in coronary patients not reaching recommended lipid levels despite the use of statins is able to reduce cholesterol levels after 6 week treatment. Methods: Prospective, open-label study with both male and female patients with stable coronary disease and LDL &gt; 70mg/dL. Patients will be randomized for the following 6 week treatment: control group (CT) no additional statin therapy, ezetimibe group (EZ) 10 mg/day ezetimibe, plant sterol group (PS) spread enriched with 2g of plant sterols or ezetimibe+plant sterols group (EZ+PS) 10mg/day EZ + 2g PS. Anthropometric evaluations and laboratory exams (blood glucose test, total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides, and C-Reactive Protein) will be performed in all groups at baseline and after the sixth week intervention.</detailed_description>
