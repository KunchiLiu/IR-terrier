	<brief_summary>Main Objective: The main objective of this retrospective observational study was to describe the evolution of visual acuity measured on ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) scale, for patients with exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD), treated with Lucentis, under real conditions of care, in terms of mean change of the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), measured at 24 months (± 4 weeks).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with exudativesubfove ARMD, regardless the neovessel type or the initial visual acuity; 2 Patients treated in the department with intra vitreous injection of Lucentis ® during the study period (08/2011 and 02/2013); 3 If both eyes are eligible, both will be analyzed; 1. Patients who received, for the studied eye, a treatment with a Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) other than Lucentis ® in the three months preceding the start of the study. For those who received combination therapy, the nature of the treatment will be specified and taken into account in the subgroups for statistical analyzes; 2. Patients with high myopia or neovessel not related to exudativeARMD;</criteria>
