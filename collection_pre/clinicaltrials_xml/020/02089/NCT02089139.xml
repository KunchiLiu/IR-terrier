	<brief_summary>Discogenic low back pain is the most common form of chronic low back pain. Its diagnosis is mainly based on MR imaging, showing MODIC I or II changes in patients with concordant symptomatology. The treatment of discogenic low back pain is nevertheless difficult: intradiscal therapies (corticosteroids, methylene blue, radiofrequency) have a limited efficacy, and surgical procedures (arthrodesis or disc replacement) are a final recourse with notable risk of side-effects. In this study, the efficacy of intradiscal injection of gelified ethanol (DiscoGel) in patients with disabling discogenic pain is assessed.</brief_summary>
