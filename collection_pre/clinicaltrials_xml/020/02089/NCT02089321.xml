	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined assessment of lumbopelvic control during sagittal and frontal plane motion (using two common clinical observational assessments) discriminates between people with and without LBP than single plane assessment alone. It was hypothesized that the two tests used in combination (multiplanar) would perform better than each test used independently (single planar) in accurately discriminating patient cases from healthy controls.</brief_summary>
