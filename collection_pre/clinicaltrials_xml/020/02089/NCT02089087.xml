	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Dose CFZ533 in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Healthy Volunteer only study originally, but after an amendment to protocol, rheumatoid arthritis patients will be starting 7-Mar-2014 and thus, the protocol is now registered.</detailed_description>
