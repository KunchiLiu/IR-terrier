	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether Ataciguat (HMR1766) is well-tolerated in patients with mild to moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis. The primary focus of these studies will be on changes in blood pressure and orthostatic tolerance (i.e., ability to stand up without passing out), and determining whether treatment with Ataciguat results in significant reductions in blood pressure in this patient population.</brief_summary>
