	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of urinary neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) and other biomarkers (plasma renin, norepinephrine) to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) development in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infection and to predict response to AKI treatment with albumin and albumin with terlipressin in patients with suspected hepatorenal syndrome.</brief_summary>
