	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the mechanical angle opening in patients with angle closure due to a plateau iris configuration (elevated iris) using phacoemulsification combined with endoscopic cycloplasty versus treatment with phacoemulsification alone.</brief_summary>
