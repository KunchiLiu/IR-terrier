	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated that sniff dogs can identify cancer patients from healthy subjects through sniffing exhaled breath air or blood or serum or urine or feces. It is hypothesized that sniff dogs may be used as a tool in screening cancer patients in health examination. Trained dogs will sniff serum from participants who are attending the annual health examination to identify potential or high risk subjects, and the results will be compared with the outcome of the traditional health examination, and the high risk subjects will be followed periodically for at least five years.</brief_summary>
