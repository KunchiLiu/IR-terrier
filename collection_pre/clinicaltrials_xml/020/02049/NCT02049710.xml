	<brief_title>Teen Video Study to Reduce Risky Driving and Sexual Behavior in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor vehicle crashes cause one-third of teenage deaths and many serious injuries. Teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are four times more likely than older drivers to crash. Death and injuries could be reduced with a change in behaviors that include improved visual and attention skills while driving, more seat belt use, appropriate speed control, and not combining drinking or texting with driving. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancies are particularly common among adolescents. The U.S. adolescent birthrate is by far the highest among industrialized nations. These problems can be decreased by less sexual activity and better protection. This study uses a randomized controlled trial to measure how well interactive video interventions can reduce these common risks to adolescents. Adolescent females will be invited to participate if they are currently seeking care at a participating clinic. They will answer survey questions about their driving and sexual behaviors, and then a computer will determine whether they will be given a video about driving or a video about sexual behavior. Participants will have unlimited access to their video, which they can watch at their clinic or from any Internet-enabled computer, and will be followed for 6 months.</detailed_description>
