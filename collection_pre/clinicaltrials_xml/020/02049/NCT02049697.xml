	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption, metabolic pathways and excretion of JNJ-39823277 in healthy male adults after administration of a single oral dose of a 25 mg (0.5 mg/mL solution) of 14C-JNJ-39823277.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate of the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of 14C-JNJ-39823277 in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and single-arm (group) study. The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within 3 weeks prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (8 to 15 days), and the follow-up phase (up to 6 days after the discharge from the hospital). Approximately 6 participants will be receiving the 14C-JNJ-39823277 in the study. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study will be up to approximately 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
