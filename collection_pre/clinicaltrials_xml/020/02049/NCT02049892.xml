	<brief_summary>Does having a large diameter metal on polyethylene total hip replacement increase metal ion release. Larger metal heads are thought to have increased torsional forces on the trunion which would like release more metal ions. Increased metal ion levels have been associated with adverse local tissue reactions. Are there any differences comparing these groups to a dual mobility type total hip replacement.</brief_summary>
