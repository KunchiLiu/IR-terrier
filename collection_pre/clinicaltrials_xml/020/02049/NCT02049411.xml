This phenomenon has been observed as a decline of neurophysiological domains, especially memory, and the velocity of thought. - Anesthesia and surgery performed contributes to its development then, is named post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The incidence varies due to conditions of: 1. Anesthesia and surgery. 2. The time elapsed after surgery. 3.
