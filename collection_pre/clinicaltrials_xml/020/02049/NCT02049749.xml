	<brief_title>Parent Program to Improve Child Behavior Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CARE intervention. The study will include 2-6 year old children who receive their primary care at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, South Philadelphia Primary Care clinic and whose caregiver and/or doctor has concern about a behavior problem in the child. The caregivers will also be subjects in the study. Child-caregiver pairs who agree to be in the study will be randomly assigned to receive the CARE training immediately or in 3-4 months. The CARE intervention will last 6 weeks and child behavior and parenting will be measured at baseline, 6-8 weeks, and 14-18 weeks. Investigators will also measure parent satisfaction with the CARE intervention. - Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) is a group parent training program. - The goals of the program are to teach parents skills that help their children successfully reach developmental milestones while increasing positive behaviors. - The program also was designed to help parents manage and decrease negative child behaviors. - Each training will be led by 2 therapists and 4-10 parents will attend the CARE program together. - Children do not attend the training but parents are encouraged to practice the skills learned at CARE between the sessions.</detailed_description>
