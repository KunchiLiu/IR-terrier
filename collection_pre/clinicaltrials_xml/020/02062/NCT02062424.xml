	<detailed_description>225 participants will be included in the intervention. The intervention is planned to run for six months in a real life setting. The study is a randomized, parallel dietary intervention study. Dietary intake, selected IHD biomarkers and anthropometric measurements will be measured at two visits during the intervention period as well as 6 months after the end of the intervention. The study includes a baseline visit followed by a visit where web based dietary records will be completed by the subjects and blood samples and anthropometrics will be measured. The intervention will consist of information on dietary advice due to the specific IHD dietary guideline or the current national dietary guidelines. The information will be provided to the participants via leaflets and recipes. After the baseline visit the subjects will be randomized to group A, B or C: In group A the subjects will receive dietary advice, according to the specific IHD dietary guideline, in group B the subjects will receive dietary advice according to the current national dietary guidelines and in group C the subjects will be instructed to follow their normal dietary habits.</detailed_description>
