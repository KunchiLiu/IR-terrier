	<brief_title>Observational Study Evaluating Outcomes of Hip Arthroplasty Using Tornier Dual Mobility Acetabular Cup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PURPOSE of this study is to demonstrate the performance and reliability of the Tornier "Dual Mobility Cup" used during primary total hip replacement or hip replacement revision surgery at a minimum of 24 months post-implantation. The primary endpoint is to determine the dislocation rate observed during post-surgical follow-up. The secondary endpoints are to assess, in the short-term, the following: clinical performance on the basis of clinical scores and hip mobility; radiological performance, particularly in terms of positioning and fixation of the implant; as well as the reliability of the implantation of this acetabular cup on the basis of any complications observed</detailed_description>
