	<brief_summary>The 23-valent pneumococcal Polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) has been developed for children and adults to prevent pneumococcal diseases such as pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), meningitis (inflammation of the brain lining), and septicemia (blood poisoning) since 2006 in China. Also, the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) is frequently administered to the children and adults. The main objective of this study is to show that both vaccines can safely be administered together without affecting the immune response of protecting against disease.</brief_summary>

No history of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine. 1. Subject that has a medical history of any of the following: allergic history, or allergic to any ingredient of vaccine, such as egg, egg protein, etc. 2. Serious adverse reactions to vaccines such as anaphylaxis, hives, respiratory difficulty, angioedema, or abdominal pain. 3. Autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency. 4. Asthma that is unstable or required emergent care, hospitalization or intubation during the past two years or that required the use of oral or intravenous corticosteroids. 5. Diabetes mellitus (type I or II), with the exception of gestational diabetes History of thyroidectomy or thyroid disease that required medication within the past 12 months. 6. Serious angioedema episodes within the previous 3 years or requiring medication in the previous two years. 7. Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g. factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or platelet disorder requiring special precautions) or significant bruising or bleeding difficulties with IM injections or blood draws. 8. Any history of immunosuppressive medications or cytotoxic medications or inhaled corticosteroids within the past six months (with the exception of corticosteroid nasal spray for allergic rhinitis or topical corticosteroids for an acute uncomplicated dermatitis) 9. History of any blood products or seasonal influenza vaccine administration within 3 months before the dosing. 10. Administration of any other investigational research agents within 30 days before the dosing. 11. Administration of any live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the dosing Administration of subunit or inactivated vaccines, e.g., pneumococcal vaccine, or allergy treatment with antigen injections, within 14 days before the dosing. 12. Axillary temperature &gt; 37.0 centigrade at the time of dosing. 13. Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. 14. Any medical, psychiatric, social condition, occupational reason or other responsibility that, in the judgment of the investigator, is a contraindication to protocol participation or impairs a volunteer's ability to give informed consent</criteria>
