	<brief_summary>This pilot study is intended to assess feasibility of auricular acupuncture in NAS infants who require pharmacologic therapy at Tampa General Hospital (TGH). We intend to evaluate acceptability of auricular acupuncture, infant tolerance, recruitment strategies, and methodological issues. We plan to also test and generate hypotheses in preparation to apply for funding a larger randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
