	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a 3-dose regimen of RotaTeq™ (V260) in healthy Chinese infants. Approximately 4040 participants at least 6 weeks and up to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination with V260 or placebo will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive either V260 or placebo. Participants will also receive the routine China Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines (oral poliovirus vaccine [OPV] and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine [DTaP]) either staggered or concomitantly with V260 or placebo. All participants will be followed for efficacy and safety. Immune responses to OPV and DTaP will be evaluated in a subset of participants. The primary hypothesis of the study states that V260 will be efficacious in preventing any severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis as compared with placebo.</brief_summary>
