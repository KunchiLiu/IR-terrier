	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pattern of flavoring and drinking of laxatives for colonoscopy can improve the experience of patients when they are undergoing bowel preparation for the test. Investigators hypothesize that patients will have a better experience if patients taste the bowel preparation laxative with and without flavoring and then decide how they want to drink the rest of the laxative since taste preferences vary widely from person to person.</brief_summary>
