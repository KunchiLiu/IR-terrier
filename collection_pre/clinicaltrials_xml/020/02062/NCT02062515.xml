	<brief_title>Icotinib in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Hepatic Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with hepatic insufficiency is an important subgroup of who receive EGFR TKIs. Phase I/II studies showed that Icotinib has good security. Based on the above considerations, this single-arm, open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety of icotinib 125mg three times daily for histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC patients with hepatic insufficiency.</detailed_description>
