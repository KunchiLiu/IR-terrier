	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how simultaneous PET/MR acquisition can provide novel qualitative and quantitative biomarkers to guide clinical intervention and predict prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Combined PET-MR Quantitative Parameters for Cardiac Applications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To compare regional myocardial uptake of FDG on images obtained on a standard PET camera with the new PET/MR camera, in patients with coronary artery disease. - To compare viability maps obtained with cardiac MR images and FDG-PET for delineation of myocardial infarct core and border zone, in patients with coronary artery disease. - To correlate MRI myocardial strain with relative myocardial FDG uptake in patients with a previous myocardial infarction. - To interrogate if simultaneous acquisition of cardiac PET and viability cardiac MR differ from acquisitions obtained independently, with special focus on attenuation correction methods - To combined MRI scar map with FDG-PET uptake in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and myocarditis. - To correlate morphologic characteristics of atherosclerotic disease in the thoracic and abdominal aorta with FDG uptake and ferumoxytol enhancement, as a marker of inflammation. - To evaluate cardiac strain and myocardial scar burden in obese patients with and without diabetes.</detailed_description>
