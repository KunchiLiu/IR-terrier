	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of VARIVAX™ (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live) manufactured with a New Seed Process (NSP) compared with the VARIVAX™ 2007 process. The primary hypotheses being tested are that antibody response rate and mean antibody titer induced at 6 weeks after a single vaccination by VARIVAX™ NSP are non-inferior to those induced by VARIVAX™ 2007 process, and that antibody response rate induced by VARIVAX™ NSP is acceptable.</brief_summary>
