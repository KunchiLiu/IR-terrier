	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Markers in Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiometabolic disorders are prevalent in patients with hypogonadism. Endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance are used in determining cardiovascular risk. The role of markers of bone mineral metabolism in hypogonadism is not clearly presented. 49 male patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and 43 BMI and age matched healthy male subjects were enrolled. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), vitamin D and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels were measured. The insulin sensitivity was estimated by homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formula.</detailed_description>
