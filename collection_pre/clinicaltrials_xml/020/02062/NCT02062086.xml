	<brief_summary>Current methods for the quantification of muscle mass are indirect, lack precision, and often rely on expensive equipment that only provides limited (indirect) data on whole body muscle mass. Dual energy X ray absorptiometry has emerged as a potential precise measure of lean mass, easy to use in clinical practice and research. However, it assesses an indirect measurement of total-body skeletal muscle mass and its clinical use for determination of changes in muscle mass may be very limited due to instrumentation availability, particularly in field studies, and cost. Moreover, these methods provide estimates of fat free mass that is not skeletal muscle specific, and are influenced by changes in regional or total body water content. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has developed a novel technique using deuterium labeled creatine dilution for the estimation of muscle mass and has begun clinical evaluation of this muscle-measure in healthy young and older adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mobility disability in acute and chronic settings like the Frailty day Hospital or the rehabilitation units make it difficult to assess muscle mass other than the availability of imaging techniques. Often it is impossible to assess muscle mass due to accessibility and cost of actual techniques. Deuterium labeled creatine (contained in capsules to be swallowed) is an easy procedure to assess muscle mass that could avoid the existing difficulties when using imaging techniques. Capsules containing the deuterium labeled creatine will be administered to participants who will autonomously take them. The subsequent assessment of urinary deuterium dilution will provide the estimate of skeletal muscle mass of the individual. Primary outcome: Assess muscle mass quantity in older adults using the method of deuterium labeled creatine versus the DXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) total lean mass assessment.</detailed_description>
