	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy of 2 different hydration strategies, hydration according to clinical guideline and adequate hydration, on contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI to investigate the possible beneficial role of periprocedural adequate hydration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aggressive hydraTion in Patients With ST -Elevation Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention to prevenT Contrast-Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>all consecutive patients with STEMI，age at least 18 years, who were candidates for primary PCI at our institution were considered for enrollment in the present study. Initial exclusion criteria were contrast medium administration within the previous 14 days, end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis, and refusal to give informed consent. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive preprocedure and postprocedure hydration (adequate hydration group), hydration according to clinical guideline (guideline hydration group，control group )</detailed_description>
