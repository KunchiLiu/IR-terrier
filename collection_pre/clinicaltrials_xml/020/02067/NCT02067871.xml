	<brief_summary>- The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of low-level laser therapy in combination with neuromuscular electrical stimulation on neuromuscular (muscular strength and morphology) and functional parameters (pain and functional tests) in elderly with knee osteoarthritis. - The hypothesis is that the association of low-level laser therapy with neuromuscular electrical stimulation could reduce joint pain associated with the inflammation and consequently potentiates the effects of electrical stimulation on the muscular system.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants was randomized into one of three intervention groups (intervention period = 8 weeks after a 4 weeks control period in all groups). - Electrical stimulation group (18-32 min of pulsed current, stimulation frequency of 80Hz (Hertz), pulse duration of 200Î¼s and stimulation intensity fixed near to maximal tolerated), - Laser group (low-level laser therapy dose of 4-6J (Joules) per point, six points at the knee joint) - Combined group (electrical stimulation and low-level laser therapy).</detailed_description>
