	<brief_title>Clinical and Economic Outcome of Simvastatin in Critically Ill Septic Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective double blinded randomized controlled study Will be carried out at Ain-Shams university hospital Method: - After approval of the research ethics committee of Ain shams University and obtaining consent from each patient, 100 patients newly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) diagnosed to have sepsis/severe sepsis defined by American College of Chest Physicians (ACP) *will be randomized by the clinical pharmacist using a computer-generated randomization sequence with a block size of four into two groups. Group I (Control group):-50 patients will be treated according to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (SSCG) (Dellinger, et al. 2013) Group II (Intervention group):-50 patients will be treated according SSCG plus simvastatin. Outcomes:- Primary outcome measures: 28 day ICU and hospital mortality. Secondary Outcome Measures: - Requirement and length of renal replacement therapy, vasoactive agent support or mechanical ventilation - Total ICU length of stay.(LOS) - Number of patients alive 3, 6, and 12 months - Incremental cost effectiveness ratio</detailed_description>
