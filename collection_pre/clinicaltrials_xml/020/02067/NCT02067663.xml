	<brief_summary>The intrauterine device (IUD) is a safe, highly effective, long acting, and reversible form of contraception. The postpartum period is an important moment for contraceptive intervention; however there are many barriers to women obtaining birth control postpartum. The use of the IUD in the immediate postpartum setting offers many advantages and is considered safe, but the risk of expulsion appears to be higher than with interval insertion. Previous studies have shown the rate of expulsion of the copper IUD in the postplacental period to be in the range of 1-14% by 6-12 months, while the only study of the levonorgestrel IUD in the postplacental period documented a rate of expulsion of 24% by 12 months. While studies related to the copper IUD use ring forceps or the operator's hand for placement of the IUD, the only published study investigating immediate postplacental levonorgestrel IUD insertion utilized the manufacturer's inserter for IUD placement. The investigators therefore ask the question, is there a difference in expulsion rates between levonorgestrel and copper IUDs placed post-placentally when all providers undergo a standardized training, use a standardized insertion technique, and when patient level characteristics are controlled by randomization? The investigators propose to perform a prospective cohort trial comparing the rates of expulsion for the levonorgestrel and the copper IUD by 3 months postpartum when placed in the uterus within 10 minutes of the delivery of the placenta, using a standardized technique (placement with a ring forceps or the operator's hand) after all providers undergo a formal didactic and skills training. The investigators hypothesis is that the levonorgestrel IUD has a higher rate of expulsion as compared to the copper IUD. Additional objectives include a comparison of the rates of complete IUD expulsion, partial IUD expulsion, unrecognized expulsions, complications, IUD continuation, pregnancy, and satisfaction. Additionally, the investigators will document the natural history of the location of the IUD within the uterus when placed in the immediate postpartum period, utilizing ultrasound at 24 hours, 6 weeks, and 3 months postpartum, to better understand the relationship between position of the IUD and subsequent expulsion.</brief_summary>
