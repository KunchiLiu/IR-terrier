	<brief_summary>Both intravenous and oral acetaminophen have been shown to reduce post-operative pain scores when given preoperatively. This study investigates if there is a difference between the intravenous and the oral forms when given preoperatively to patients undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy. We hypothesize that the intravenous formulation does not improve pain scores or decrease opioid consumption during the first postoperative day compared to the oral formulation.</brief_summary>
