	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies contrast enhanced ultrasound and shear wave elastography in measuring response in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy before surgery. New imaging procedures, such as contrast enhanced ultrasound and shear wave elastography, may predict treatment response earlier and more accurately than contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound and Shear Wave Elastography in Measuring Response in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish a quantitative prediction rule for accurate and early prediction of the pathologic tumor response assessed post-surgery, using the change of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) assessed tumor size and perfusion characteristics before (baseline) and 2-3 weeks following initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). II. To assess the agreement between CEUS based classification rule and pathologically determined treatment response (baseline versus pre-surgical scan). III. To establish a quantitative prediction rule for accurate and early prediction of the pathologic tumor response assessed post-surgery, using the change in propagation velocity of a shear mechanical wave in tissue before (baseline) and 2-3 weeks following initiation of NAC. IV. To assess the agreement between shear wave elastography (SWE) based classification rule and pathologically determined treatment response (baseline versus pre-surgical scan). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the role of combined CEUS + SWE features obtained at early treatment phase (2-3 weeks following initiation of NAC), in accurately predicting the pathologically determined tumor response. II. To investigate the agreement in assessment of therapy response to NAC between CEUS versus contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE MRI) and SWE versus CE MRI for baseline versus pre-surgery scan and to identify discordant cases using scatter plot and contingency tables. OUTLINE: Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging and shear wave elastography at baseline, 2-3 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, and before surgery.</detailed_description>
