	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of JNJ-42847922 on sleep latency (latency to persistent sleep) in participants with major depressive disorder who are stably treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor who suffer from insomnia (inability to fall asleep).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Effect of JNJ-42847922 on Polysomnography Measures in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder With Insomnia Who Are Stably Treated With Antidepressants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants to 4 different arms in a clinical study), and a single dose study. This study will consist of a screening phase (between 28 to 2 days prior to the study medication), a treatment phase of 4 double blind study periods (2 days), and a follow-up phase (within 7 to 14 days after last dose of the study medication). Approximately 20 participants with major depressive disorder will participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts (groups) (Cohorts A, B, C, and D) to receive JNJ-42847922 (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) and placebo. Each cohort consists of 4 treatment periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4). Safety will be evaluated by the assessment vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing, physical examination, and neurological examination. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be approximately 9 to 10 weeks.</detailed_description>
