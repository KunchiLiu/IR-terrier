	<brief_title>Myofascial Release and Kinesio Taping on Autonomic Nervous System in Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Objective: to determine the effects of myofascial soft tissue release and kinesio taping on pain, disability, quality of life, and autonomic nervous system indicators. Methods and Measures: sixty-four individuals will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Intervention: For 10-week, the group 1 will undergo treatment comprising a myofascial soft tissue release protocol (1/week) and the group 2 will recieve a kinesio taping treatment (1/week). Main Outcome Measures: Intensity of pain, disability, quality of life, biochemical stimation intertitial fluid, body mass indicators, hormonal indicators, indicators of autonomic nevous system, and indicators of oxidative stress will be collected in both groups at baseline, 10 weeks and 15 weeks after the last intervention. Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be examined between both groups with an independent Student t-test for continuous data. Separate 2x3 model ANOVA with time (baseline, 10 weeks and 15 weeks) as the within-subjects factor, group will be to determine the effects of the treatment.</detailed_description>
