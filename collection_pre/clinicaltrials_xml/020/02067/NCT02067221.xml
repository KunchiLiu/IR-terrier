	<brief_title>Comparison of Surgical Outcomes Between MPCNL and RIRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is pointed out that there is the disadvantage of conventional PCNL technique which showed dramatic decrease in Hb and renal damage even though it has some advantages of a short operation time and a high stone-free rate. MPCNL and RIRS has recently been considered as very efficacious methods.</detailed_description>
