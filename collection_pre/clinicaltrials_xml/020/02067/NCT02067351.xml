	<brief_summary>There is evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and yoga might improve Quality of Life (QOL) and reduce stress in breast cancer survivors. These interventions are becoming increasingly popular in cancer survivors. However, little is known about the feasibility and effect of MBIs administered during the interval of time of chemotherapy, on QOL and stress. The investigators are planning a MBI intervention study developed specifically for breast cancer survivors receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) at the investigators institution, for at least 8 sessions combined with at least 8 weeks of home-practice, in 25 women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
