	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the use of a medical food, oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI), in helping patients with advanced COPD with cachexia (a wasting syndrome) improve their nutritional status and gain weight. The medical food is in powder form and is mixed with a liquid such as water or orange juice and consumed by swallowing. The primary hypothesis is that SBI protein isolate (SBI) will improve the nutritional status of cachexic patients with advanced stages of COPD.</brief_summary>
