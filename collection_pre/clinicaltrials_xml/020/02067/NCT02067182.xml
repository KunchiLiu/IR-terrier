	<brief_summary>Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAC) following clinically successful catheter abla-tion of atrial fibrillation (AF) is controversial. Recent guidelines recommended con-tinuation of OAC in all patients with CHA2DS2VASc score ≥2 even if there is no evidence of recurrent AF (Camm JA et al., Eur Heart J 2012). The net clinical ben-efit of OAC after successful ablation in these patients remains to some extent un-clear. As OAC bears the risk of bleeding events, the ODIn-AF study aims to evalu-ate the positive effect of OAC on the incidence of silent cerebral embolic events in patients with a high risk for embolic events, free from AF after successful pulmo-nary vein ablation. ODIn-AF aims to determine that continued administration of dabigatran is superior in the preven-tion of silent cerebral embolism to discontinuation of OAC after 3 months in pa-tients free from symptomatic AF-episodes with a CHA2DS2VASc score ≥2 after the first pulmonary vein ablation for paroxysmal AF.</brief_summary>
