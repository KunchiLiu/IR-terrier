	<brief_summary>Abacavir/Lamivudine + Nevirapine (ABC/3TC + NVP) is a very effective and well tolerable regimen on the long-term. However this regimen comprises 2 pills per day. Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) offers simplification with a single pill per day with no food constraints, Dolutegravir (DTG) having the advantage over Nevirapine (NVP) of high potency, higher genetic barrier to resistance, with a very good safety profile. The objective of this study is to evaluate the virologic safety (maintenance of virologic suppression) after switching from ABC/3TC + NVP to ABC/3TC/DTG in 50 HIV-1 infected adults with prolonged HIV RNA suppression on ABC/3TC + NVP, as well as clinical and laboratory safety. Because nevirapine is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes, pharmacocinetic (PK) assessment will be performed in all patients in the first weeks after switch and 24-hours PK in a subset of 10 patients after 5 days of DTG addition to current regimen, before switching to ABC/3TC/DTG.</brief_summary>
