	<criteria>Patients aged over 18 and under 75 years hemodynamically stable patients (systolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg and no hemorrhagic shock) Achieved a splenic trauma closed for less than 48 hours A high risk of splenectomy: Reaching spleen Moore graded 4 and 5 of the abdominal CT injected or Reaching spleen Moore 3 and at least one of the following characteristics: Important Hemoperitoneum (when visible in the pelvic area). Severe impairment associated (NISSNew Injury Severity Score greater than or equal to 15) Volunteer to participate in the study, who signed the consent form with the agreement of the family if the patient is not capable of giving consent after adequate information and delivery of the Circular, one member of a social security scheme or beneficiary of such a plan. Patients whose usual residence is outside the European Economic Community Patient with hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure &lt;9 despite resuscitation maneuver) Patient with open splenic trauma Patient with surgical indication excluding the possibility of monitoring splenic trauma Patient with an indication of embolization of a body other than the rate at the time of inclusion Patient with an indication of splenic embolization as a result of posttraumatic vascular anomaly (active leakage of contrast, pseudoaneurysm or splenic early arteriovenous fistula). Patients less than 18 years and an age ≥ 75 years Patients with a rate previously disease (tumor, infection, vascular anomaly intrasplenically) Patient with trauma Moore grade I, II Patient with trauma grade Moore V with total ischemia of the spleen Patients who underwent partial or total splenectomy before inclusion Patient holder acquired or innate immune deficiency All indications against the achievement of embolization Pregnant woman Private person of liberty by judicial or administrative decision, person subject to a measure of legal protection.
