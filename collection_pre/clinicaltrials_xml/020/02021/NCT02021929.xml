	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and effects of the study drug, sorafenib, in adults diagnosed with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The study will evaluate how well the drug is tolerated and its effect on the level of oxygen in the blood and the function of the lung vessels.</brief_summary>

Active coronary artery disease 2. Unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), newonset angina within 12 weeks before randomization, or myocardial infarction within 24 weeks before randomization Liver or other solid organ transplant recipients Expectation of liver transplant within four months of randomization Hepatocellular carcinoma that does not meet all of the following criteria: 1. Single lesion ≤ 3 cm documented by LIRADS criteria 2. Complete response to ablative therapy (TACE, RFA, alcohol ablation) using the modified RECIST criteria one month after therapy with no more than two treatments 3. No other lesions develop after initiation of HCC therapy Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure &gt;140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg on repeated measurement) despite optimal medical management. Any hemorrhage/bleeding event of NCICommon Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects v4.0 Grade 3 or higher within 4 weeks before randomization Presence of a nonhealing wound, nonhealing ulcer, or bone fracture Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Major surgery 28 days prior to randomization Subjects with any previously untreated or concurrent cancer except cervical cancer insitu, treated basal cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumor. Subjects surviving a cancer that was curatively treated and without evidence of disease for more than 3 years before randomization are allowed. All cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization) must be completed at least 3 years prior to study entry (i.e., signature date of the informed consent form).
