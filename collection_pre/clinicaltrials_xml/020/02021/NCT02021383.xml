	<brief_title>Lose 2 Win A Novel Method to Motivate Weight Loss Maintenance Among College Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30% of college students are overweight or obese. Intervening on excess weight early may eliminate obesity-related morbidity. Evidence supports use of monetary incentives to encourage weight-loss; questions remain about the efficacy of contingency management on weight loss maintenance. "Lose 2 Win" contests in which participants who achieve weight-loss goals are eligible for cash prizes, appear well-suited for implementation on campuses. Our objective in this two-phase trial is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of Lose 2 Win for weight-loss maintenance among college students.</detailed_description>
