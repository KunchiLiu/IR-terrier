	<brief_summary>The study's overall objectives are to evaluate the safety of anakinra in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarinoma, as well as to collect preliminary immune modulation and clinical activity information, overall survival, and serious adverse events related to the study drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot, Prospective, Non-randomized Evaluation of the Safety of Anakinra Plus Standard Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kineret (anakinra) is a FDA-approved drug indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra is a recombinant, nonglycosylated form of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Anakinra blocks the biologic activity of IL -1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic effects including inflammatory and immunological responses. This is a pilot, prospective, non-randomized, consecutive enrollment study that will enroll up to 12 subjects who meet the study defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will undergo standard of care chemotherapy treatment/regimens (i.e., modified FOLFIRINOX). Subjects will be dispensed a 2 weeks supply of anakinra the day they begin chemotherapy. They will be instructed to begin self-administering the anakinra (study drug) injections the day after their first dose of chemotherapy. They will have a blood sample collected at baseline and 6 months follow up. If they have surgery for their disease, they may have a tissue sample collected for later analysis.</detailed_description>
