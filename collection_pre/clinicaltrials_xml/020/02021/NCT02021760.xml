	<brief_summary>- Trial objective: To test the hypothesis that remote per-postconditioning in connection with primary PCI will reduce myocardial infarct size patients with STEMI. - Trial Design: Placebo controlled randomized study with parallel groups - Primary Endpoint: Myocardial infarct size expressed as a percentage of the myocardium at risk determined by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) day 4-7 - Efficacy Parameters: Myocardial infarct size expressed as a percentage to the myocardium at risk determined by CMR at 6 months. - Global left ventricular function determined by left ventricular ejection fraction determined by CMR. - Microvascular obstruction determined by CMR day 4-7. Quantified ECV (extracellular volume) in left ventricular as myocardium at risk day 4-7 and remodelling parameters day 180. - Safety Parameters: Major adverse cardiovascular events.</brief_summary>

ST elevations &gt;0.1 mV (&gt;0.2 mV in V2V3) in &gt; two contiguous leads in V1V6. Informed consent. Previous myocardial infarction based on medical history or Qwave on ECG in other area Left Bundle Branch Block on ECG. Previous CABG Cardiac arrest Any contraindication for CMR. Clinical symptoms of claudication Treatment with glibenclamide or cyclosporine on admission. Any condition that may interfere with the possibility for the patient to comply with or complete the study protocol.</criteria>
