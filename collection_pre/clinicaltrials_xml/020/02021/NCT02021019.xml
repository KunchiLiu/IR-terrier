	<brief_summary>Sympathetic activation is a hallmark of end-stage renal disease and adversely affects cardiovascular prognosis. Hypertension is present in the vast majority of these patients and plays a key role in the progressive deterioration of renal function and in the exceedingly high rate of cardiovascular events. Selective catheter-based renal denervation has been shown to be safe and effective in attaining improved and sustained blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension and normal renal function. The investigators hypothesize that catheter-based renal denervation is a safe and effective intervention to achieve sustained reduction in sympathetic nerve activity, BP and target organ damage in hypertensive End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients, which will result in improved cardiovascular outcomes.</brief_summary>
