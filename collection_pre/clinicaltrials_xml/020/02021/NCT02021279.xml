	<criteria>Subject's leading edge of POP is at or beyond the hymen. At or beyond the hymen is defined as POPQ scores of Ba ≥ 0 or Bp ≥ 0 or C ≥ 0 (for prolapse of the apical compartment alone) or C ≥ ½ total vaginal length (for a multicompartment prolapse that includes the apical compartment). Subject is seeking surgical intervention for symptomatic POP, which is defined as experiencing symptoms of vaginal bulging or pelvic heaviness. Vaginal bulge or pelvic heaviness will be considered present if a subject responds "yes" (≥1) to PFDI20, question 3. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative is willing to provide written informed consent. Subject is willing and able to comply with the followup regimen. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to porcinebased materials (relevant to subjects in MatriStem Pelvic Floor Matrix Group only). Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study. Subject has an active or chronic systemic infection including any gynecologic infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), or tissue necrosis. Subject has a known neurologic or medical condition affecting bladder function (e.g. multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or stroke with residual neurologic deficit). Subject has chronic systemic pain syndrome (e.g. fibromyalgia, painful bladder syndrome). Subject has a systemic connective tissue disease (e.g., scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), Marfans syndrome, Ehlers Danhlos, collagenosis, polymyositis or polymyalgia rheumatica). Subject has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM). Subject has a history of pelvic organ cancer (e.g. uterine, ovarian, bladder, or cervical). Subject has had prior or is currently undergoing radiation, laser therapy, or chemotherapy in the pelvic area. Subject has taken systemic steroids (within the last month), immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment (within the last 3 months). Subject is seeking obliterative vaginal surgery as treatment for POP (colpoclesis). Subject is not able to conform to the modified dorsal lithotomy position. Subject is currently participating in or plans to participate in another device or drug study during this study. Subject is to planning to undergo concurrent surgical treatment of prolapse using mesh other than the MatriStem Pelvic Floor Matrix.</criteria>
