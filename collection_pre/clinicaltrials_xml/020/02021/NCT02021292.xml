	<criteria>Written informed consent Subject with CTEPH (WHO Group 4) judged as inoperable due to the localization of the obstruction being surgically inaccessible (i.e., distal disease). Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pretreatment serum pregnancy test, be advised on appropriate methods of contraception, and agree to use 2 reliable methods of contraception. Previous pulmonary endarterectomy. Recurrent thromboembolism despite sufficient oral anticoagulants. Symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism in the 6month period prior to randomization. Known moderatetosevere restrictive lung disease (i.e., TLC &lt; 60% of predicted value) or obstructive lung disease (i.e., FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted, with FEV1/FVC &lt; 65%) or known significant chronic lung disease diagnosed by chest imaging (e.g., interstitial lung disease, emphysema). Acute or chronic conditions (other than dyspnea) that limit the ability to comply with study requirements in the 3month period prior to Screening visit or during the Screening period.</criteria>
