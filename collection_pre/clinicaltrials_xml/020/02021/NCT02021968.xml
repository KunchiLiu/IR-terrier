	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Effectiveness of a Dengue Virus Vaccine in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 4 types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4); each can cause dengue illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. More than 2 billion persons in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are at risk for acquiring dengue, which is why development of a dengue vaccine is a top public health priority. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a single dose of TetraVax-DV-TV003 (TV003) vaccine to protect against infection with rDEN2∆30, an attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine. This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous infection with a flavivirus (any of a group of viruses that includes the dengue virus). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the TV003 vaccine or placebo vaccine on Day 0 (study entry). At Day 180, all participants will receive an injection of the "challenge" virus, rDEN2∆30, an attenuated (weakened) DENV-2 vaccine. For at least 30 minutes after each vaccination, participants will remain in the study clinic to be monitored for any adverse effects of the vaccines. Participants will record their temperature at least 3 times a day for 16 days after the first and second vaccinations. In addition to vaccination visits at Day 0 and Day 180, participants will attend study visits at Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. At all study visits, participants will give a medical history and undergo a blood collection; at most study visits, participants will undergo a physical examination. Female participants will have a pregnancy test at select study visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Good general health as determined by physical examination, laboratory screening, and review of medical history Available for the duration of the study, approximately 26 weeks after second inoculation Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent document Females Only: Female participants of childbearing potential willing to use effective contraception. Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization, intrauterine device, and abstinence (6 months or more since last sexual encounter). All female participants will be considered having childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or postmenopausal status documented as at least 1 year since last menstrual period. Females Only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive betahuman choriogonadotropin (HCG) test, breastfeeding Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator affects the ability of the participant to understand and cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol Screening laboratory values of Grade 1 or above for absolute neutrophil count (ANC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine as defined in the study protocol. Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a participant participating in the trial or would render the participant unable to comply with the protocol Any significant alcohol or drug abuse in the past 12 months which has caused medical, occupational, or family problems, as indicated by participant history History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis Severe asthma (emergency room visit or hospitalization within the last 6 months) HIV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, by screening and confirmatory assays Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening Any known immunodeficiency syndrome Use of anticoagulant medications Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 28 days prior to or following vaccination. Immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids is defined as greater than or equal to 10 mg prednisone equivalent per day for 14 days or longer. Receipt of a live vaccine within 28 days or a killed vaccine within the 14 days prior to vaccination or anticipated receipt of any vaccine during the 28 days following vaccination Asplenia Receipt of blood products within the past 6 months, including transfusions or immunoglobulin or anticipated receipt of any blood products or immunoglobulin during the 28 days following vaccination History or serologic evidence of previous dengue virus infection or other flavivirus infection (e.g., yellow fever virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus) Previous receipt of a flavivirus vaccine (licensed or experimental) Anticipated receipt of any investigational agent in the 28 days before or after vaccination Participant has definite plans to travel to a dengue endemic area during the study Refusal to allow storage of specimens for future research Inclusion Criteria for Second Vaccine Good general health as determined by physical examination and review of medical history Available for the duration of the study, approximately 26 weeks after the second dose Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent document Females Only: Female participants of childbearing potential willing to use effective contraception for the duration of the trial. Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization, intrauterine device, and abstinence (6 months or more since last sexual encounter). All female participants will be considered having childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or postmenopausal status documented as at least 1 year since last menstrual period. Exclusion Criteria for Second Vaccine Anaphylaxis or angioedema following the first dose of vaccine Females Only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive betaHCG test, breastfeeding Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator affects the ability of the participant to understand and cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a participant participating in the trial or would render the participant unable to comply with the protocol Any significant alcohol or drug abuse in the past 12 months which has caused medical, occupational, or family problems, as indicated by participant history History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis Severe asthma (emergency room visit or hospitalization within the last 6 months) HIV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays HCV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays HBV infection, by HBsAg screening Any known immunodeficiency syndrome Use of anticoagulant medications Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 42 days prior to or following vaccination.
