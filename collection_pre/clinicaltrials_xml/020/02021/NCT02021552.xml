	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this is to establish a cohort of severely injured patients admitted to our trauma center. Investigators will collect DNA, utilizing discarded blood samples, from 3000 injury victims in an effort to identify perhaps 50 - 100 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (out of 1000s) that can be used, when taken together, to identify patients at highest risk for developing complicated sepsis and death.</brief_summary>
