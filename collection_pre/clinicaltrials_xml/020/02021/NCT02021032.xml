	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the post-marketing study is to collect safety and effectiveness data for 5 years on subjects treated with Prolieve®. The collection of 5-year safety information will be used to evaluate the occurrence of any long-term side effects from the treatment. The collection of long-term effectiveness data on subjects treated with Prolieve® will provide information on the long-term effects of treatment and time to re- treatment (any treatment initiated for BPH since Prolieve'" treatment, including a second treatment with Prolieve").</brief_summary>
