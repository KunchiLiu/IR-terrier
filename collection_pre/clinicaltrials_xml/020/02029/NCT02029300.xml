	<brief_summary>There are two routes in which a fiberoptic intubation can be performed - oral and nasal. In general, nasal intubation by any conventional method may be the preferred choice for certain procedures such as intra-oral surgeries, or for anatomical reasons such as limited mouth opening. If nasal intubation is not indicated or preferred, then oral intubation is usually performed. This study is looking to explore whether or not the nasal route significantly improves the ease and time for successful fiberoptic intubation compared to the oral route in children less than or equal to 2 years of age. This study will also examine if operator experience influence time to tracheal intubation with either route? The investigators hypothesize that the nasal route of fiberoptic intubation will be faster than the oral route, for both the trainee and the expert, and that there will be minimal differences between experts and trainees with nasal fiberoptic intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Nasal Versus Oral Fiberoptic Intubation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare the effect of nasal fiberoptic intubation versus oral fiberoptic intubation in children less than 2 years of age. Other factors that will be assesed include operator experience, the ease and time for fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, time for fiberoptic tracheal intubation, and complications. This study is looking to explore whether or not the nasal route significantly improves the ease and time for successful fiberoptic intubation compared to the oral route in children less than or equal to 2 years of age. While also asking, will operator experience influence time to tracheal intubation with either route? The investigators hypothesize that the nasal route fiberoptic intubation will be faster than the oral route, for both the trainee and the expert, and that there will be minimal differences between experts and trainees with nasal fiberoptic intubation.</detailed_description>
