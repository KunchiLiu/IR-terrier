	<brief_summary>Main objective: Determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) in late pregnancy in a population of obese patients . Secondary objectives : - Identify risk factors for OSA during pregnancy (age, parity, high blood pressure, snoring , weight, neck circumference, scores on symptoms of sleep apnea, ... ) . - Compare perinatal morbidity among obese patients with OSA in late pregnancy with case-controls. - Evaluate the evolution of a moderate or severe OSA 6 months after pregnancy. Material and methods Characteristics of the study: - Interventional biomedical research - Prospective Multicenter nonrandomized study Flow chart - Patients will be included between 30 and 36 weeks of amenorrhea (WA) . - Will rated from inclusion: age, parity, weight, height, BMI in early pregnancy, neck circumferrence, treated high blood pressure. - As recommended in France, the main test results during the pregnancy follow-up will be recorded. - At the inclusion visit will be conducted a Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Score. - Screening for OSA by nocturnal polysomnography will be performed between 30 and 36WA. This screening can be performed as an outpatient. - In case of proven OSA patients will be offered an appropriate care by today's standards. - Whatever the outcome of pregnancy, a second polysomnography will be performed 6 months after childbirth in case of OSA during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
