	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1: A quantifiable difference in inflammatory cytokines exist in women with burn injury and this correlates with clinical markers of outcome Hypothesis 2: The amount of adipose tissue contributes to the severity of cellular immune response (CMI) dysregulation in response to burn injury Skin-fold caliper measurements will be taken on consented patients (both male and female) to determine body fat percentage. Serum samples will be obtained from these patients. The level of inflammatory cytokines in the serum will be measured to determine if there is a link between body fat percentage, pro-inflammatory cytokines and the ability of women to survive burn injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gender Disparity in Burn Injury Survival</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consented patients admitted to University Medical Center with greater than 15% total body surface area burns will participate in this study. A skin-fold caliper measurement will be performed to determine body fat percentage. Serum samples will be obtained and assayed for inflammatory cytokines to establish whether or not a link between obesity in women and pro-inflammatory cytokines exists. If so, obesity may be a factor which contributes to the gender disparity in burn wound survival.</detailed_description>
