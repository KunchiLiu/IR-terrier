	<brief_title>The Effect of Food and Beverage Based Nutritional Supplements in Recipients of Home Care Services at Risk of Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malnutrition is a complex state described as a deficiency of energy, protein and other nutrients causing measurable adverse effect on body tissue, function and clinical outcome. Oral nutritional supplementation has in multiple individual trials and meta-analyzes shown an increased total energy intake and protein intake in patients in hospital settings as well as in the community. The largest producer of dairy products in Norway, TINE AS released a new milk based energy- and nutrient dense product, called E+. The initiative behind this was Haukeland University Hospital and the municipality of Bergen. The product were developed to prevent malnutrition in the elderly and patients with a low food intake and high energy requirements. The overall contribution to this study will be to provide new insight on how to offer malnourished patients the best available treatment.</detailed_description>
