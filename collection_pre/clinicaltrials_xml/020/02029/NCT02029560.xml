	<brief_title>Observational Study to Evaluate Effect of Thrupas® Capsule on Cardiovascular System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BPH and hypertension are chronic senile diseases that increase in prevalence with age. It is reported that 25% of men over 60 years old suffer from both BPH and hypertension. Though these two diseases differ in nature, there is a hypothesis advanced from recent studies that for both diseases, increase in sympathetic tone plays an important role in pathophysiology. As a medical treatment of BPH, α-blockers are widely selected in clinical studies as a first line treatment in patients with LUTS, for its non-invasiveness and superior clinical efficacy [1, 5]. Such α-blockers increases urine flow and decreases residual urine by controlling excitement of the sympathetic nervous system distributed around smooth muscle of prostate and bladder neck. Through this, α-blockers improve conditions of clinical symptoms of patients suffering from LUTS due to BPH, and decrease need for invasive surgery related to BPH, and also have medical action to decrease morbidity rate of secondary complications of BPH such as acute retention of urine, deterioration of renal function, bladder stone and urinary tract infection. However, in the case of patients who are on hypertension medication, when considering concomitant administration with α-blockers, adverse events such as orthostatic hypotension and dizziness due to drop in blood pressure is most concerned. In this regard, silodosin, as an alpha 1A adrenoceptor antagonist, has been proven have low occurrence of adverse events related to cardiovascular system and have little effect on blood pressure compared to other α-blockers. Thus, in this study, we aim to see the effect on cardiovascular system(blood pressure) Thrupas® capsule is administered every day for 12 weeks in patients with LUTS suggestive of BPH.</detailed_description>
