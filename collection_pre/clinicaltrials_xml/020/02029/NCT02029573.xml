	<criteria>Histologically proven newly diagnosed Malignant Glioblastoma Multiforme or variants (gliosarcoma, glioblastoma with oligodendroglial features, giant cell glioblastoma). Age ≥ 18 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2. Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Stable dose of steroid for ≥ 14 days prior to registration. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (e.g., hemoglobin ≥10 g/dl, absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, and platelet count ≥100 x 109/L. Adequate liver function (SGPT, SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times upper limits of normals (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN), and adequate renal function (BUN or creatinine ≤1.5 X ULN) prior to starting therapy. Paraffin embedded tumour sample available for study. Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional requirements. The patient must sign the consent form prior to registration. Protocol treatment is to begin within 10 working days of patient registration. Pregnant or lactating women; men and women of childbearing potential must agree to practice an effective method of birth control. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within 14 days prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or anticancer therapy. Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt; 5 years. Prior radiotherapy or systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows: Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or oxygen, Hepatic insufficiency or Active liver disease resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects, Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) , Significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the ability to obtain informed consent, Active uncontrolled or serious infection, active peptic ulcer disease, Any medical condition which could interfere with oral medication intake (e.g., frequent vomiting, partial bowel obstruction), Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to registration, Congestive heart failure, unstable angina, active cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, Skeletal muscle disease and other related reticuleendothelial diseases. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or their components.</criteria>
