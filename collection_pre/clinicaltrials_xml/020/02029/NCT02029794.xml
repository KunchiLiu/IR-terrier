	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer remains a public health burden, particularly in developing countries such as sub-saharan Africa where the infrastructure for organized screening programs does not exist. As a result, other screening modalities (visual inspection with acetic acid) are the standard of care in such regions. It is now known, persistent infection with an oncogenic Human papillomavirus (HPV) type is a necessary precursor of cervical cancer and evidence is showing HPV testing is a potential, safe and effective alternative to cytology testing (The Pap smear). This study is evaluating the feasibility and acceptance of HPV self-collection vs. VIA in a cohort of women from Kisenyi, Uganda.</brief_summary>
