	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the benefit of GYNEFFIK®, a perineal electro-stimulator, during this home-care phase. Women with stress urinary incontinence (UI) or with mixed UI (composed predominantly of stress UI), that responded to physiotherapy were included in this study in two parallel groups. The groups followed a self-reeducation program, with or without GYNEFFIK® electro-stimulation sessions. The comparison of the two groups was based on the rate of women for whom the benefit of the initial perineal reeducation was maintained.</brief_summary>
