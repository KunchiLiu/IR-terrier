	<brief_summary>Electronic Vapour Products (EVPs) is a relatively new class of consumer products that are otherwise known as electronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery devices/systems. These may look like conventional cigarettes but do not contain tobacco. The 'vapour' produced by such devices typically consists of humectants (propylene glycol or glycerol), nicotine, water, and flavours. This trial is to evaluate the safety of an e-vapour product.</brief_summary>
