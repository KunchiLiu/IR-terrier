	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial of 30 elderly type 2 diabetes patients conducted at the MODEL Clinical Research (MODEL), Research Division of Bay West Endocrinology Associates in Baltimore, Maryland. The investigators hypothesized that compared to a regimen base solely on traditional drugs, a regimen including newer drugs will achieve glycemic target faster and induce less hypoglycemia, weight gain, and other side effects, over the short run.</brief_summary>
