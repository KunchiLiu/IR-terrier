	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well omacetaxine mepesuccinate, cytarabine, and decitabine work in treating older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate, cytarabine, and decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate, Cytarabine, and Decitabine in Treating Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study the complete response rate following OAG (omacetaxine mepesuccinate, cytarabine) in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive induction therapy. II. To assess the toxicity of OAG using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study the disease-free and overall survival of OAG and decitabine in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive induction therapy. OUTLINE: INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) and omacetaxine mepesuccinate SC BID on days 1-14. Treatment for induction therapy repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses or until patients achieve complete response (CR) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients alternate courses between decitabine and OAG. Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-5. Patients alternate with OAG courses, comprising cytarabine SC BID on days 1-7 and omacetaxine mepesuccinate SC BID on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are not eligible for standard induction chemotherapy (or any standard therapy known to be life prolonging) because of poor performance status, significant tissue comorbidities, or unfavorable risk of disease Have an unequivocal histologic diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (including secondary AML) No prior therapy for AML except hydroxyurea to control counts Must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an independent ethics committee/institutional review board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure Subjects with the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (t[15;17]) Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements Any condition which in the investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable candidate to receive study drug Patients with sickle cell disease and sickle cell crisis Received an investigational agent for another disease within 30 days prior to enrollment The patient has an uncontrolled and active infection that would preclude study conduct and assessment</criteria>
