	<brief_title>Hospital-Community-Family-Care Management Platform for Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>(1)Indication:Chronic Heart Failure.(2) Objectives: Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the Hospital-Community-Family-Care Management Platform online compared with the regular clinic follow up in subjects with CHF (II-III class by NYHA).Secondary objectives is to assess the safety of the Management Platform online in subjects with CHF.(3) Study design: Prospective, randomized,controlled study with two follow up management groups: 1) the Hospital-Community-Family-Care Management Follow up Online;2) the regular monthly clinic follow up.Study population:Totally 1000 male and female subjects with CHF (II-III functional classes according to NYHA classification).(4) Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any plans for site monitoring and auditing.(5) Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry.(6) Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources.(7)Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management.(8)Duration of follow up: The total follow-up time shall be 12 months.(9)Safety Assessment:Safety of the study will be evaluated by the following assessments: 1)Subject examinations (during the follow up period and extending up to 2 week after the end of the study) consisting of a subject interview (including direct questioning about adverse events), physical examination, assessment of body weight, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (UCG), Left ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by echocardiography, The N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a peptide hormone whose plasma concentration is inversely related to the severity of HF, NYHA functional status, assessed by subject interview, Quality of life (QoL), assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ), a validated questionnaire assessing QoL in subjects with heart failure. 2)Evaluation of clinically relevant safety laboratory parameters, such as complete blood count, serum creatinine, electrolytes, and liver enzymes.Any Adverse Events (AE) or Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and its potential causal relationship with the study will be recorded and evaluated.(10)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>to be considered eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet the inclusion criteria listed below at the time of screening and randomization: 1. Male and female subject≥18 years of age. 2. History of CHF for ≥3 months with NYHA functional class IIIII. 3. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45% as assessed by echocardiogram. 4. Treatment of CHF with stable and optimal pharmacological therapy according to Chinese guidelines for treatment of CHF. In general, optimal treatment will include a betablocker and an ACE inhibitor and/or an angiotensin receptor blocker, unless not tolerated. Medical therapy is defined as stable, if the subject has not started a new CHF drug class and the dose of drugs taken have not been changed during the 3 months prior to screening and randomization. 5. Ability to understand the requirements of the study and willingness to provide written informed consent (IC), and agreement to abide by the study restrictions and return for the required assessments. 6. Subjects are located in our coverage of the remote monitoring system. To be eligible for entry into the study, the subject must not meet any of the exclusion criteria listed below at screening and randomization: 1. Abnormal renal or hepatic function, defined as ALT≥100 u/L, serum creatinine &gt;3.0mg/dL, serum albumin ＜2.5g/L. 2. Hemoglobin concentration≤8.0g/dL. 3. Obesity (body mass index &gt;35kg/m2). 4. Heart failure primarily due to valvular heart disease, or clinically significant valvular heart disease that is expected to require surgical correction within 12 months after randomization. 5. Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) within 30 days prior to randomization, or initiation of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT with/without ICD) within 30 days prior to randomization. 6. Routinely scheduled IV infusions for HF (e.g., inotropes, vasodilators, diuretics). 7. Acute myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to randomization. 8. Percutaneous intervention (coronary, cerebrovascular, aortic) within 6 months prior to randomization. 9. Major surgery, including thoracic or cardiac surgery, within 3 months prior to randomization. 10. Symptomatic tachyarrhythmia with an uncontrolled ventricular response (&gt;100 bpm at rest) or an untreated symptomatic bradyarrhythmia within 1 month prior to randomization. 11. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, active myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis. 12. Likelihood of cardiac transplantation within 12 months after randomization. 13. Peripheral artery disease, which interferes with 6 minutes walking test. 14. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which interferes with 6 minutes walking test. 15. History of major organ transplant (e.g., lung, liver, heart, bone marrow) or renal replacement therapy. 16. Serious anaemia secondary to acute or chronic bleeding. 17. Whole blood or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 8 weeks prior to randomization. 18. Severe concomitant noncardiovascular disease that is expected to reduces life expectancy to less than 3 years. 19. History of any neoplastic disease. 20. Known active systemic hematologic disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, hematologic malignancy, myeloma, hemolytic anemia), hemolysis due to any cause, thalassemia. 21. Untreated hypo or hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, active vasculitis due to collagen vascular disease. 22. Use of any erythropoietic protein (eg, rHuEPO) within 12 weeks prior to randomization. 23. Pregnancy (e.g. positive human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] test) or active lactation. 24. Currently or recently (&lt;30 days) enrolled in clinical trials or other investigational devices, or currently receiving other investigational agent(s) or procedure(s). 25. Disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent or to comply with study procedures.</criteria>
