	<brief_summary>Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of acute neuromuscular weakness in the Western World and can occur at any age. GBS is a rpadily progressive 'inflammatory' disorder of the perihperal nerves often leading to sever paresis of the limbs. Most GBS patients also have sensory disturbances (tingling or dull feeling) and pain. Some patients also have double vision or problems with swallowing. GBS mau also involve the respiratory muscles, leading to insufficient ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. GBS pateints have a vairable prognosis; 20-30% require mechnical ventilation for a period ranging from weeks to months, 20% are unable to walk after 6 months nad 3-5% dies. Progression of weakness in GBS is usually rapid and reaches its peak within 4 weeks in the majority of patients, but many develop their maximum deficit within 2 weeks. Thereafter, the patients have a variable prognosis. GBS is a treatable disorder. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2g/kg administered in 5 days was shown to be effective when administered within the first two weeks after onset of symptoms, and is considered the treatment of choice by most experts in the field. Although the standard treatment for GBS is a single course of IVIg (2g/kg administered in 5 days), many patients fails to recover abd remain with substantial disability. Patients with GBS and especially those with a poor prognosis potentially may benefit from more powerful abd when possible a more mechanistically rational therapy. Recent experimental evidence suggests that complement activation palys a crucial role in the development of neuromuscular weakness in GBS making complement inhibitors and regulators attracive therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis is that Eculizumab, with its function as a complement inhibitor, will be very effective in preventing progression of weakness in patients with GBS.</brief_summary>
