	<brief_title>Observational Study of Insulin Resistance and Muscle Wasting After Burn Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Burn injury induces insulin resistance and our investigators have previous shown the importance of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-mediated pathways. This project will establish the inhibitory effects of burn injury on IRS-1 mediated signaling in human skeletal muscle of burn patients.</detailed_description>
