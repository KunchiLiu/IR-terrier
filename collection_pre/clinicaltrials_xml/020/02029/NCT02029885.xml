	<brief_title>Sham Controlled Study of Renal Denervation for Subjects With Uncontrolled Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a sham controlled, double blind study of subjects with uncontrolled hypertension consisting of two arms, sham and therapy. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed non-invasively using the Kona Medical Surround Sound System which delivers focused ultrasound therapy to ablate the nerves surrounding the renal artery utilizing real time ultrasound for targeting and tracking.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is at least 18 years of age and no more than 90 years of age 2. Average SBP ≥ 160 mmHg 3. 24 hour average ABPM daytime SBP ≥ 135 mmHg. 4. No medication changes for a minimum of 1 months prior to screening. 5. At minimum, subject must be on at least three antihypertensive medications, with one being a diuretic, and each must meet one or more of the following full dose criteria: 1. Highest labeled dose according to medication's labeling; 2. Highest usual dose per clinical guidelines JNC7; 3. Highest tolerated dose; and/or 4. Highest appropriate dose for the subject per the PI's clinical judgment. 6. Subject has two functioning kidneys. 7. Subject has an eGFR value of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (MDRD formula). 1. Subject has any secondary cause of hypertension 2. Subject has evidence of clinically significant renal artery stenosis as determined by flow rate, velocity and Doppler analysis on ultrasound 3. Subject has kidney stones that are of a size and location that are determined at discretion of the investigator to potentially interfere with treatment 4. Subject has a history of intraabdominal surgery within the past six months 5. Subject has heterogeneities in the kidney such as large cysts or tumors that are determined at discretion of the investigator to potentially interfere with treatment. 6. Stenotic valvular heart disease for which BP reduction would be hazardous as determined by referring physician. 7. MI, unstable angina, or CVA in the prior 6 months. 8. Known severe primary pulmonary HTN 9. Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or cerebrovascular accident within the last six months. 10. Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease. 11. Subject has BMI over 40 km/m^2 12. Subject has a target treatment depth over 13 cm. 13. Subject has anatomy that precludes treatment with the Kona Medical Surround Sound System. 14. Subject is pregnant, nursing, or intends to become pregnant during the trial period. 15. Subject is currently enrolled in other potentially confounding research. 16. Subject has any condition that, at the discretion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the trial. 17. Subject is unable, or unwilling, to comply with the protocolrequired followup schedule</criteria>
