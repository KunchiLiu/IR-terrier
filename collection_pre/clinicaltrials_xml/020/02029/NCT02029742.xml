	<brief_summary>The investigators propose that culturally aligned community-based interventions in our multi-ethnic sickle cell disease (SCD) population, augmented by task-focused communication technology, can improve self-managed adherence to hydroxyurea (HU) by decreasing barriers to use, supporting parent-youth partnerships for chronic disease self-management and reinforcing the behavior of daily medication use. Culturally aligned community health workers (CHW) are a well-established means to support chronic disease self-management by underserved families, in partnership with medical homes. CHWs can identify and address multiple barriers and reinforce developmentally appropriate self-management to help youth reach and maintain their best fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. However, this strategy alone may be insufficient to achieve daily HU adherence. The investigators therefore propose a feasibility trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of a structured intervention of CHW support to address existing barriers to improve HU use, augmented by daily cue-based parent and youth text message reminders, to efficiently extend CHW family support and reinforce family partnerships for self-management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea Adherence for Personal Best in Sickle Cell Treatment: HABIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder affecting the blood and causes anemia, painful sickle crises, organ damage, reduced quality of life and high health care use. Hydroxyurea (HU) is an oral medication that reduces disease symptoms and improves quality of life by increasing the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. Despite the clinical promise of hydroxyurea, many children with SCD do make taking hydroxyurea a daily health habit. General barriers to medication adherence in underserved populations include lack of trust of medical staff, incomplete knowledge regarding benefits of hydroxyurea, and other factors that impede access to care such as transportation difficulties. Challenges specific to hydroxyurea use include understanding the importance of maximizing fetal hemoglobin levels and addressing concerns about hydroxyurea. Children and adolescents also require that a developmentally appropriate transition of self-management be established with their parents. Community-based health workers are a well established means to provide support for chronic disease management for underserved families and address multi-faceted barriers through culturally, behaviorally and developmentally aligned intervention. The investigators hypothesize that Community Health Workers support, augmented by daily task-focused communication technology, can improve self-managed adherence to hydroxyurea.</detailed_description>
