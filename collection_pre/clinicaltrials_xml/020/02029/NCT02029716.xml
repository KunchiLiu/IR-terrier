	<brief_summary>This study is a first-in-human study of a topical dermal lotion formulation of RTA 408, a novel small molecule which suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation. In this study, the safety, local pharmacodynamics (PD), and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of RTA 408 will be evaluated following topical application of RTA 408 Lotion to healthy volunteers. This study will be conducted in three parts. In Part A of the study, healthy volunteers will have RTA 408 Lotion Vehicle and RTA 408 Lotion (0.5%, 1%, and 3%) applied to a small skin surface area (four individual 4-cm2 sites; 16 cm2 total area) twice daily for 14 days to assess the local skin tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of these treatments. Part B will be conducted after completion of Part A and will assess the safety, tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily for 14 days to a larger skin surface area (~100 cm2). Part C will be conducted after completion of Part B and will assess the safety, tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily for 28 days to a larger skin surface area (~500 cm2). The maximum tolerated drug concentration in Part A will be used in Part B and Part C. Approximately 32 healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in this study with 12 volunteers in Part A and 10 volunteers each, in Parts B and C.</brief_summary>

Use of substances known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (eg, ritonavir, ketoconazole, nefazodone, grapefruit juice) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug through the last study visit. Chronic exposure to enzyme inducers such as paint solvents or pesticides or other investigational drug use within 30 days prior to study drug administration; 12. Use of prescription drugs, dietary supplements, or herbal remedies (including products applied topically) within 14 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug; use of nonprescription drugs or vitamins (including products applied topically) within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug; or unwillingness to refrain from taking any such medication until after the last protocol specified blood sample; 13. Donation of whole blood &gt;450 mL or blood products within 56 days prior to admission to the investigational site; 14. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives of the previous investigational drug prior to the first dose of study drug in this study, whichever is longer; 15. Positive screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C at the Screening Visit; 16. Acute illness accompanied by temperature ≥101○F within 5 days prior to study drug administration; 17.
