	<brief_summary>Musculoskeletal dysfunction is considered as a major public health problem affecting about one third of the adult population. Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) characterized by myofacial trigger points as well as fascia tenderness are thought to be the main cause of musculoskeletal dysfunction. The aim of the treatment for musculoskeletal dysfunction is to reduce pain and restore normal function. Clinically, some evidence supports the application of kinesio tape in these patients. The underlying mechanism, however, is not clear. The investigators goal was to validate proposed mechanism of kinesio tape in these patients. The primary outcome are muscle stiffness, pain intensity and sensitivity.</brief_summary>
