	<brief_summary>There are no guidelines for the management of glucocorticoid- (henceforth steroid) induced elevated blood sugars (henceforth hyperglycemia). Oncology ward patients have particularly high rates of hyperglycemia and are frequently exposed to high dose steroid therapy. A prior study by Muthala et al. (unpublished data) found a relationship between insulin requirements needed to maintain normal blood sugars, patient weight, and mg of steroid administered. In this pilot study, through an endocrine consult team, a weight-based, steroid dose-based insulin protocol will be implemented for the management of hyperglycemia in lymphoma patients requiring high dose steroid therapy, with the goal of reducing hyperglycemia incidence.</brief_summary>
