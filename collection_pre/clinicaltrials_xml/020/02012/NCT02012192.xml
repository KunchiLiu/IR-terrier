	<brief_summary>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy causing 41900 deaths annually in Europe. The predominance of aggressive Type II tumours, which are characterised by a high frequency of p53 mutations, and primary or acquired resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy profoundly contribute to the high mortality rate. With current standard therapy the median overall survival of metastatic platinum-resistant (Pt-R) ovarian cancer patients is only 14 month. There is a pressing need for more effective, innovative treatment strategies to particularly improve survival in this subgroup of EOC patients. This is a drug strategy targeting a central driver of tumour aggressiveness and metastatic ability, namely mutant p53, via an innovative new Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibition mechanism. The most advanced, second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor will be used, Ganetespib. The first part (Phase I) of the GANNET53 trial will test the safety of Ganetespib in a new combination with standard chemotherapy (Paclitaxel weekly) in Pt-R EOC patients. The second part (randomised Phase II) will examine the efficacy of Ganetespib in combination with standard chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy alone in EOC patients with Pt-R tumours.</brief_summary>

Adequate organ functions: Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl (&lt;177 µmol/L) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal SGOT ( serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase)/SGPT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase) (AST/ALT) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal Urinanalysis or urine dipstick for proteinuria less than 2+. Patients with ≥ 2+ on dipstick should undergo 24hour urine collection and must demonstrate &lt; 1 g of protein/24 hours. Alternatively, proteinuria testing can be performed according to local standards Negative urine/serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP, see section 5). WOCBP who are sexually active, agree to use highly effective means of contraception during the study and for at least 6 months poststudy treatment. Allowed are accepted and effective nonhormonal methods of contraception and sexual abstinence or vasectomised partners (&gt;3 months previously). Vasectomy has to be confirmed by two negative semen analyses.

More than 4 previous lines of chemotherapy. Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to first dose of ganetespib PRIOR OR CONCOMITANT CONDITIONS OR PROCEDURES: Patients with a history of prior malignancies, except, diseasefree timeframe of ≥ 3 years prior to randomisation. Patients with prior insitu carcinomas, except: complete removal of the tumour is given Known history of severe (grade 3 or 4) allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to excipients (e.g., polyethylene glycol [PEG] 300 and Polysorbate 80) History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to paclitaxel and/or adverse events related to paclitaxel that resulted in paclitaxel being permanently discontinued Peripheral neuropathy of grade &gt; 2 per NCI CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects), version 4.03, within 4 weeks prior to randomisation Clinical symptomatic bowel obstruction at time of screening Left ventricular ejection fraction defined by MUGA (multigated acquisition)/ECHO below the institutional lower limit of normal Patients with symptomatic brain metastases Significant cardiac disease: New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; unstable angina; coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within the past 6 month; or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. History of prolonged QT syndrome, or family member with prolonged QT syndrome QTc (corrected QT interval) interval &gt; 470 msec when 3 consecutive EKG values are averaged Ventricular tachycardia or a supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment with a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III antiarrhythmic drug (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide). Use of other antiarrhythmic drugs is permitted Second or thirddegree atrioventricular (AV) block, except: treated with a permanent pacemaker Complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety, compliance of the patient, or would preclude the patient from successful completion of the study.
