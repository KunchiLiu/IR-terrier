	<brief_summary>The intention is to compare prospectively operative and conservative early functional rehabilitation protocol in treatment of total achilles tendon rupture. To compare these treatments, the investigators use 1998 published Leppilahti-score, Rand-36 quality of life-questionnaire and MRI. The Leppilahti-score includes both subjective and objective items (pain, stiffness, subjective calf muscle weakness, footwear restrictions, active range of motion between ankles, subjective result, isokinetic calf muscle strength). The investigators also study MRI-imaging for both legs and compare including achilles tendon elongation and muscle volume correlations to Leppilahti-score results between these two treatments. Follow-up time is 18 months. Hypothesis is that operative treatment offers no benefit in comparison conservative treatment, with identical rehabilitation protocol.</brief_summary>
