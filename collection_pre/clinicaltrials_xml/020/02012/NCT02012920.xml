	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Oral VT-464 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2 study of VT-464 in treatment-naïve patients CRPC and CRPC patients who have failed prior therapy with abiraterone, enzalutamide, and/or chemotherapy. The study consists of 2 phases: a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1) and a cohort-expansion phase (Phase 2). Phase 1 will be an open-label, multicenter, sequential-dose cohort design in treatment-naive patients and Phase 2 will be an open-label, multicenter, parallel-group design and treatment-naive and treatment-failure patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Patients must have documented histological or cytological evidence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients must have a minimum serum PSA level of &gt;2 ng/ml that is rising based on the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria. Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl [1.74 nmol/l]). Patients must have undergone orchiectomy, or have been on LHRH agonists or antagonists, for at least 3 months prior to study entry. Patients on LHRH agonists/antagonists must remain on these agents for the duration of the study. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Score of 0 or 1. Key Patients who have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer unless enrolled in a previous chemotherapy cohort. Patients who have received secondline antihormonal therapy, including ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, or highdose estrogen within 30 days of study entry. Patients who have completed sipuleucelT (Provenge ®) treatment within 30 days of study entry. Patients who have received abiraterone (Zytiga®), TAK700 (Orteronel®), TOK001 (Galeterone®), or MDV3100, or any other investigational product directed towards the androgen receptor or androgen biosynthesis. Previous abiraterone and enzalutamide are allowed in certain treatmentfailure cohorts Patients who have received antiandrogens such as flutamide (EULEXIN®), bicalutamide (CASODEX®), or nilutamide (NILANDRON®) for &gt; 3 months must be off treatment for 6 weeks and demonstrate a continued rise in PSA after withdrawal. Patients on antiandrogens for &lt; 3 months must be off medication for 2 weeks. Patients on 5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride (PROSCAR®, PROPECIA®), or dutasteride (AVODART®) must stop medication at least 3 months from study entry. Patients who require pharmacological or replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids or who have received systemic corticosteroids within 30 days of study entry; use of topical, inhaled or ophthalmic steroids is permitted. Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry. Patients with a history within the last 3 years of another invasive malignancy.</criteria>
