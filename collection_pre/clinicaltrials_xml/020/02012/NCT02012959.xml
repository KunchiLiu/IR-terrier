	<criteria>Inclusion: Male and female subjects ≥ 4 weeks (or ≥44 weeks adjusted gestational age) to &lt;18 years old Subjects hospitalized with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia resistant to initial standard background therapy Persistent euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia defined as being documented as &lt;130 mEq/L and present for at least 48 h, evidenced by at least 2 serum sodium assessments (12 h apart) Ability to maintain adequate fluid intake (orally or IV) Ability to take oral medications Ability to comply with all requirements of the trial Completion of the trial specific informed consent/assent as age appropriate Ability to commit to remain fully abstinent or practice doublebarrier birth control as required by the trial. Exclusion: Evidence of hypovolemia or intravascular volume depletion Serum sodium &lt; 120 mEq/L Use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in subjects &lt; 12 kg or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in subjects &lt; 6 kg Lacks free access to water or without ICUlevel fluid monitoring and management History or current diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome Transient hyponatremia likely to resolve Hyperkalemia eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m² Acute kidney injury Severe or acute neurological symptoms requiring other intervention Prior treatment for hyponatremia with hypertonic saline within 8 hours of qualifying serum sodium assessments; Urea, lithium, demeclocycline, conivaptan, or tolvaptan within 4 days of qualifying serum sodium assessments; any other treatments for the purpose of increasing serum sodium concurrent with dosing of trial medication. Anuria or urinary outflow obstruction, unless subject is/can be catheterized History of hypersensitivity and/or idiosyncratic reaction to benzazepine or benzazepine derivatives Psychogenic polydipsia Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (defined as fasting glucose &gt; 300mg/dL). Screening liver function values &gt; 3 x ULN Subjects who have cirrhosis and meet any of the following conditions: a major GI bleed within the past 6 months, evidence of active bleeding, platelet count &lt; 50,000 /μL, or use of concomitant medications known to increase bleeding risk Hyponatremia due to the result of any medication that can safely be withdrawn or that is most appropriately corrected by alternative therapies History of drug or medication abuse within 3 months prior to screening or current alcohol abuse Subjects who require suspension formulation and have a Hereditary Fructose Intolerance Has hyponatremia that is more appropriately corrected by alternative therapies Is pregnant or currently breastfeeding Has any medical condition that could interfere with evaluation of trial objectives or subject safety Has participated in another investigational drug trial in the last 30 days Weighs &lt; 3 kg Unable to swallow tablets, if suspension unavailable Is deemed unsuitable for trial participation in the opinion of the PI</criteria>
