	<brief_summary>Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) is considered by many a contraindication to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). However, of the few studies that have investigated the relationship between LSG and GER the majority reported only changes in symptoms and manometric data, while assessment of GER using 24-hour pH monitoring is lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of LSG on GER in morbidly obese patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive morbidly obese patients selected for LSG are included in a prospective clinical study. Gastroesophageal function is evaluated using a clinical validated questionnaire, upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry and 24-h pH monitoring before and 24 months after LSG.</detailed_description>
