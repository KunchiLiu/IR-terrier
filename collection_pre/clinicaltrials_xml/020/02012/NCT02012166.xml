	<brief_summary>This is a study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of sequential single oral doses of MK-8093 10 mg, 40 mg, 200 mg, or placebo to MK-8093 (Part 1) depending on treatment assignment in young healthy male participants. In Part 2 of this study, sequential single oral doses of MK-8093 200 mg, 1000 mg or placebo to MK-8093 depending on treatment assignment will be evaluated. The primary hypothesis of the study is that at least one dose of MK-0893 will produce greater reduction of glucagon-induced glycemia as compared to placebo following the infusion of glucagon, Sandostatine®, and basal insulin.</brief_summary>
