	<brief_summary>The study is to evaluate whether concurrent nimotuzumab could decrease the severe acute treatment-related toxicities compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced NPC. Three hundreds and twenty patients will be recruited into this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase â…¢ Study of Neoadjuvant TPF Chemotherapy Followed by Radiotherapy and Concurrent Nimotuzumab or Cisplatin for Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scheme: Eligible stage III and IVA/B NPC patients will first be stratified by institution, then randomized to 2 arms at 1:1 ratio. - Arm Cisplatin: Neoadjuvant TPF chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cisplatin 75 mg/m2, 5-FU 2500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles), followed by cisplatin 40 mg/m2/week in concurrent with IMRT - Arm nimotuzumab: Neoadjuvant TPF chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cisplatin 75 mg/m2, 5-FU 2500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles), followed by weekly nimotuzumab 200mg in concurrent with IMRT</detailed_description>
