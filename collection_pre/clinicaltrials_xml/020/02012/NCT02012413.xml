	<brief_summary>PST (pulsed signal therapy) is a unique form of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) for stimulating healing of damaged structures such as cartilage, bones and soft tissues. The physical effect of the pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been focus of research in various studies, with cartilage being the most studied, and which has demonstrated an increase in the synthesis of proteoglican and collagen in vitro. A T2 MAP diagram MRI is considered a method in evaluating the indirect biochemical quantity of articular cartilage which may traduce functional behavior of the articular cartilage. This is an randomized, control and double blind clinical trial. The main objective is to evaluate in vivo the effect of PST on patella cartilage in patients with chondromalacia through the T2 MAP diagramed MERI technique. The secondary objective is to evaluate clinical improvement regarding anterior knee pain after PST intervention.</brief_summary>
