	<brief_summary>Undernutrition and growth restriction due to poor diet and inadequate nutrient intake continues to be a global challenge, particularly in the developing countries including Uganda. The etiology of inadequate nutrient supply to infants may relate to lack of resources or knowledge or a combination of both. Poor nutrient intake and impaired growth may affect brain and cognitive development. This study aims to evaluate nutrient intake, growth and cognitive function among children between 6 and 36 months living in the fertile Kabale and Kisoro region in south-western Uganda. The investigators hypothesize that nutrition education to mothers can bring about improved dietary intake and nutritional status among children aged 6-36 months.</brief_summary>
