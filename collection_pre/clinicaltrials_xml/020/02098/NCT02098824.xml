	<brief_title>Symptomatic Treatment of Vascular Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular Cognitive Impairment is an important cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Till now, there are no approved symptomatic treatments for Vascular Cognitive Impairment. Research on novel pharmacological treatments that may reduce clinical symptoms in these patients is needed. Evidence suggests that executive dysfunction and memory impairment in Vascular Cognitive Impairment are caused by damage to monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter-systems, respectively. However, patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment form a clinically heterogeneous group, i.e. the extent to which executive function and memory are affected differs from patient to patient. Previous intervention studies have not taken this inter-patient variability into account. Individually tailored pharmacological interventions, aimed at the affected neurotransmitter systems, may ameliorate cognitive symptoms in patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment. Using a pharmacological challenge, it is possible to detect individual sensitivity to specific pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, with the use of novel MRI techniques, it is possible to correlate the location and severity of cerebrovascular lesions to impaired structural and functional connectivity in each subject. The investigators will recruit 30 patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (according to the criteria of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association), at the Alzheimer Center of the VU University Medical Center and the Utrecht University Medical Center. They will also undergo MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging MRI (DTI)/'fiber tracking'; and resting state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI). In a double-blind, three-way, case cross over trial, the investigators will study the effects of methylphenidate on executive function and of galantamine on episodic memory function. During three separate visits, patients will receive the pharmacological interventions (placebo, methylphenidate, and galantamine) at the investigators Clinical Research Unit. Also, during a study day the investigators will collect blood samples at different timepoints.</detailed_description>
