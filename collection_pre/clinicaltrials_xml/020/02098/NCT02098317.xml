	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions and is rapidly becoming the one of most common causes of chronic liver disease in children. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is generally considered the result of a series of liver injuries, commonly referred as "multi-hit" hypothesis. Several studies suggest that inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress could be responsible of disease progression. The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Vitamin D in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DHA and Vitamin D in Children With Biopsy-proven NAFLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty-six children or adolescents (4-16 years) with liver biopsy proven NAFLD will be enrolled. They will be randomized to treatment with DHA and Vitamin D (n=33) or an identical placebo (n=33) given orally for a period of 6 months. All patients will be included in a lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements and physical exercise. Patients will undergo a medical evaluation at 3-6 and 12 months during the 12-months study period. Liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 12 months. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests, including liver enzymes, gluco-insulinemic profile and lipids will be performed at baseline and repeated at 6-12 months</detailed_description>
