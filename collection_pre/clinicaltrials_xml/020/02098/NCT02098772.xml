	<brief_summary>The objective of this investigation is to compare the cardioprotective effects and safety of two cardioplegic solutions, HTK Cardioplegic Solution (Custodiol) and Custodiol-N in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery. The study design is a prospective, double blind, multicenter, randomized, Phase III comparison study intended to demonstrate superiority in surgical outcome between Custodiol and Custodiol-N as determined by CK-MB peak value 4-24 hours after opening of the aortic cross-clamp (primary endpoint), catecholamine requirement (cumulative dose) and cardiac Troponin T, occurrence of comorbid events postoperatively (e.g., myocardial infarction).</brief_summary>
