	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Steroid Therapy in Vestibular Neuritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was a prospective, randomized controlled study. The enrolled vestibular neuritis patients were randomized to conservative treatment or steroid treatment when they are diagnosed with caloric test. After initial vestibular work-up including caloric, video head impulse tests, and a questinnaire (DHI), the patient was examined with the same tests again at 6 months later. The efficacy of steroid for the patients with vestibular neuritis would be determined by the comparison of the data of each group.</detailed_description>
