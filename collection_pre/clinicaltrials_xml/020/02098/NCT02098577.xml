	<brief_title>Crossover Versus Stabilometric Platform in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by different motor symptoms (rigidity, akinesia, tremor and impairment of balance and gait). Even though pharmacological treatment has changed the natural course of the disease, balance worsens over time and leads to falls. The aims of this study is to assess the efficacy of the crossover (group 1) on balance in Parkinsonian patients and compare this results with the results of a control group of patients treated with a stabilometric platform (group 2). The group 1 executed 6 days/week for a 4-weeks cycle a crossover protocol based on the first 4 level of resistance and a training which lasts at most 5 minutes. The group 2 executed 6 days/week for a 4-weeks cycle different exercises with the stabilometric platform in monopodalic and in bipodalic standing.</detailed_description>
