	<brief_summary>Objective: To analyze different parameters in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) obtained through the use of a stabilometric platform and compare them with those of a control population. To interpret the data in order to find some postural instability indicators that can become useful to build a rehabilitation strategy for balance disorders in PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of the Parameters Obtained on Stabilometric Platform in Patients With PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Posture and balance are the foundation on wich upright stance and walking are executed. Postural instability is the impairment in balance that compromises the ability to maintain or change posture such as standing and walking. It is considered to be one of the cardinal features of PD. In such patients it is present even at diagnosis and worsens with disease progression. It correlates with falls representing a major source of disability and reduced QoL in PD. In this course, the study of balance is important to identify patients who can benefit from specific rehabilitative treatment. Objective: To analyze different parameters in patients with PD obtained through the use of a stabilometric platform and compare them with those of a control population. To interpret the data in order to find some postural instability indicators that can become useful to build a rehabilitation strategy for balance disorders in PD.</detailed_description>
