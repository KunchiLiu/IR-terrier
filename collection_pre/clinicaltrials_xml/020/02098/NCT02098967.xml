	<brief_summary>This open label, Phase I study of RO6839921 is a dose-escalation study with two arms. Prior to investigations in either arm, patients in a single cohort, Cohort 0, will receive non-escalating, intravenous (IV) doses of RO6839921 daily on Days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. Interim PK and safety data from this cohort will be evaluated before initiating dose-escalation. In arm A, RO6839921 will be given to patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. In Arm B, RO6839921 will be given to patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The arms will escalate independently. Escalation will begin in solid tumor patients (Arm A) in single patient cohorts, using a new Continual Reassessment Method (n-CRM). Escalation for AML patients will be initiated at or below the dose level that causes &gt;/= Grade 2 hematologic side effects in Arm A. Escalation in AML patients will follow a rolling 6 design. In both arms, RO6839921 will be administered by IV infusion on Days 1-5 of 28-day cycles. There will be no intrapatient dose escalation. All patients may be treated until disease progression/relapse or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
