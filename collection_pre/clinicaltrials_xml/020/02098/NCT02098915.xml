	<brief_summary>Infants with gastroschisis typically have poor intestinal motility for the first weeks to months after birth. Prokinetic agents are often used in these infants to improve intestinal motility in an attempt to quicken the attainment of enteric feeds. However, the evidence to support this practice remains weak. Investigators hypothesize that a prokinetic agent given intravenously (infused into a vein) may be effective in improving gut motility in children with gastroschisis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metoclopramide Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research question will be addressed in a pilot randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of metoclopramide.Investigators will recruit 30 neonates (15 per arm) diagnosed with gastroschisis. There will be two arms to the trial: the experimental arm will receive intravenous metoclopramide and the control arm will receive placebo. Patients will receive prokinetic agent therapy, dosed according to weight, or placebo. Each subject will receive the intervention for 28 days or until achievement of full enteral feeding, whichever comes first. Primary outcome: Days to achieve full enteral feeding when all intake (at least 150 ml/kg/day for 72 hours) is given as breast milk or formula by gavage or by mouth. Secondary outcomes: 1. Duration (days) until initiation of enteral feeds. 2. Duration (days) on parenteral nutrition. 3. Weight gain, measured by grams per day per week during therapy. 4. Occurrence of adverse effects associated with the use of metoclopramide. 5. Rate of catheter-related sepsis episodes (line positive blood cultures necessitating antibiotic treatment or catheter removal). 6. Incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) based on clinical criteria and presence of pneumatosis intestinalis on an abdominal X-ray. 7. Duration of hospitalization (number of days from admission until final hospital discharge). Subjects can be withdrawn from the study if meet one of the following criteria: - Subject develops extrapyramidal symptoms - Subject has not established full enteral feeding by the end of day 28 of therapy - Withdrawal of informed consent or refusal of further study participation by parent/legal guardian - Serious adverse event which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject - Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject - Unpredictable discontinuation of metoclopramide drug supply</detailed_description>
