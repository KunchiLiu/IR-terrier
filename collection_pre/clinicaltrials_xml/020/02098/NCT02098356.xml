	<brief_summary>This study will compare hemodialysis treatment with a standard, high-bicarbonate dialysis bath versus a lower bicarbonate dialysis bath, and will compare intradialytic acid-base changes and overall control of metabolic acidosis with the 2 treatment regimens. These parameters will be assessed in patients currently receiving high-bicarbonate hemodialysis as part of usual care. They will then be switched to a lower bicarbonate prescription, after which these parameters will be reassessed. The study will also examine changes in inflammatory markers, glycemic control, ketogenesis, and lipolysis.</brief_summary>
