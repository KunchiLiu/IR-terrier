	<criteria>1. Patients give fully informed consent and are willing and able to comply with all study procedures. 2. In the study eye: There are primary or recurrent subfoveal or parafoveal active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions secondary to wAMD. The criterion of active CNV should meet at least one of following three conditions : fresh bleeding; neurosensory detachment showed on optical coherence tomography(OCT); leakage showed on fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). 3. BCVA in study eye &lt; 19 letters (approximately 20/400 Snellen equivalent). 1. Past or existing nonexudative AMD in study eye decided by investigator that have affected macular detection or central vision; 2. Subretinal hemorrhage in study eye and bleeding area ≥6 disc areas; 3. History of vitreous hemorrhage within last month; 4. The maximum diameter of scar and fibrosis area ≥500μm at subfoveal in study eye; 5. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) or drug treatment of CNV within last 6 months in study eye, or antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in fellow eye within last month; 6. History of glaucoma in study eye; 7. Aphakia (excluding artificial lens) in the study eye.</criteria>
