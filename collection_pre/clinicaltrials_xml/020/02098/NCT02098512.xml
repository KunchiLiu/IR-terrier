	<brief_summary>Patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma who are CD30+ will receive a standard of care reduced intensity regimen and an allogeneic stem cell transplant (from another person, related or unrelated). Following recovery, patients will receive a medication called Brentuximab Vendotin which is targeted against CD30+ cells. The study hypothesis is that this treatment will be safe and well tolerated in children and young adults.</brief_summary>
