	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine if functional muscle stimulation, in addition to non-invasive neurostimulation through the tongue, directed by electroencephalogram (EEG) output, can increase the extent of stroke recovery on behavioral measures and induce brain plasticity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Forty-four adult stroke patients and 5 healthy controls will be recruited in this study.</detailed_description>
