The study will evaluate the effects of CAT-2003 on fasting total and chylomicron triglyceride levels, as well as postprandial total and chylomicron triglyceride clearance. This is a single-blind study. All patients will receive placebo for 1 week, and CAT-2003 for 12 weeks during the 13 week treatment period.</brief_summary>
