	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of auricular autonomous nervous system stimulation on vital parameters of wound healing in diabetics. It is investigated if auricular vagal nerve stimulation has an effect on heart rate variability as well as peripheral local blood perfusion, and if this effect depends on the health status of the study participants (diseased/healthy).</brief_summary>
