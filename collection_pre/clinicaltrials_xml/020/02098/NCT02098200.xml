	<brief_summary>The TriCinch System™ is intended for percutaneous treatment of tricuspid regurgitation. It is a percutaneous catheter-based device designed for tricuspid valve repair in order to decrease effective cross-sectional area and relieve symptoms in patients with tricuspid valve regurgitation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Treatment of Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation With the TriCinch System™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantation Procedure: Unlike the standard open chest, arrested heart approach, the 4TECH TriCinch System™ provides a percutaneous solution for tricuspid valve regurgitation treatment: this procedure is performed through deep sedation, while the heart is beating, without the need for respiratory assistance. The TriCinch System™ consists of a Delivery System that enables transcatheter placement of an implant that can be adjusted to correct Tricuspid valve regurgitation. The TriCinch Delivery System is inserted from the femoral vein to access the right atrium of the heart. At the end of the correction process, the TriCinch Delivery System and the venous introducer are removed and the procedure is concluded.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Functional symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) 2+ to 4+ on a scale of 4+ (moderate to severe), with annular dilatation greater than 40mm. Signed informed consent form prior to any studyrelated procedure. Available and able to return to the study site for postprocedural followup examination Eighteen (18) years of age or older. Requirement for concomitant cardiac procedure (other than atrial fibrillation correction surgery, closure of PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) or ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), or PTCA (percutaneous treatment of coronary artery) or CAD (coronary artery bypass surgery) from 1 to 3 months after or before other procedure. Presence of any known life threatening (noncardiac major or progressive disease), noncardiac disease that will limit the subject's life expectancy to less than one year. Cerebrovascular event within the past 6 months. History of mitral/tricuspid endocarditis within the last 12 months. Organic tricuspid disease. Contraindication or known allergy to device's components, aspirin, anticoagulation therapy or contrast media that cannot be adequately premeditated. Severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg, measurement done by sphygmomanometer with stethoscope, allow the patient to sit for at least 5 minutes before beginning BP measurements). Female patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive) or lactating. Known alcohol or drug abuser. Currently participating in the study of an investigational drug or device. At heart team's judgement, patient IVC dimension is not adequate for device implantation.</criteria>
