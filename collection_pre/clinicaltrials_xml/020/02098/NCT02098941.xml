	<brief_title>Evaluate Retention Rate of Topiramate, Levetiracetam and Oxcarbazepine in a Long-term Epilepsy Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective The Objective of this study is to compare 2-year retention rate of topiramate, levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine in a long term epilepsy treatment. Secondary objective The main secondary objective of this study is to evaluate confounding factors associated with retention rate of topiramate compared with other anticonvulsants. 1. Baseline characteristics - Seizure Type - Gender - Age of onset 2. Treatment regimen - Number of concomitant medication - Type of drug combination - Final target dose - Titration speed Other secondary objectives The other secondary objectives of this study are to compare followings by each medication: - Rate of seizure reduction (≥75%, ≥50%) - Rate of seizure freedom</detailed_description>
