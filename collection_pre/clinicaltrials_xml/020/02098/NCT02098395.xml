	<criteria>Informed consent obtained before any trialrelated activities. Trialrelated activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial, including activities to determine suitability for the trial Male or female, aged equal to or greater than 18 years at the time of signing informed consent Type 1 diabetes mellitus (as diagnosed clinically) 12 months or longer prior to Visit 1 (i.e. screening) Treatment with basal bolus or CSII (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, insulin pump) treatment 6 months or longer prior to Visit 1 (i.e. screening) Stable insulin treatment 3 months or longer prior to Visit 1 (i.e. screening), as judged and documented by the investigator HbA1c 7.010.0 percent (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)), both inclusive, by central laboratory analysis (Visit 1, screening) corresponding to 5386 mmol/mol (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC)) Prior use of glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonist or dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors Use of any medication, which in the investigator's opinion could interfere with the glycaemic control (e.g. systemic corticosteroids, pramlintide (SymlinÂ®)) or affect the subject's safety. Premix insulin is not allowed Known proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment Severe neuropathy, in particular autonomic neuropathy, i.e. gastroparesis, as judged by the investigator Uncontrolled/untreated blood pressure at screening (Visit 1) (after resting for 5 minutes) while sitting greater than 160 mmHg for systolic or greater than 100 mmHg for diastolic (repeated measurement at Visit 2 (prior to performing the trial related activities) is allowed to exclude whitecoat hypertension) History of acute or chronic pancreatitis Screening (Visit 1) calcitonin value equal to or greater than 50 ng/L</criteria>
