	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of a combined APR-246 and carboplatin/PLD chemotherapy regimen, compared with carboplatin/PLD chemotherapy regimen alone, in patients with platinum sensitive recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) with mutated p53. In addition, the study aims to assess the safety profile of the combined APR-246 and carboplatin/PLD chemotherapy regimen compared with carboplatin/PLD chemotherapy regimen alone, to evaluate potential biomarkers, and to assess the biological activity in tumor and surrogate tissues. The trial will enroll up to a maximum of 400 patients.</brief_summary>

Phase II patients only Adequate organ function prior to registration Toxicities from previous cancer therapies must have recovered to grade 1 (defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) Chronic stable grade 2 peripheral neuropathy secondary to neurotoxicity from prior therapies may be considered on a case by case basis ECOG performance status of 0 to 1 Prior exposure to cumulative doses of doxorubicin &gt;400 mg/m2 or epirubicin &gt;720 mg/m2 History of allergic reactions to carboplatin, platinum containing compounds or mannitol and/or hypersensitivity to PLD or to any of the excipients Unable to undergo imaging by either CT scan or MRI Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, infectious diseases, neurological conditions, physical examination or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the planned treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatment related complications Concurrent malignancy requiring therapy (excluding noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ) Is taking concurrent (or within 4 week prior to registration) chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy that is considered to be investigational (i.e., used for nonapproved indications(s) and in the context of a research investigation).
