	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that a garment-integrated sensing system will be able to detect with clinical accuracy the position of the spine. The investigator will evaluate this using healthy adult volunteers, who will don sensing garments and assume a series of spinal postures. Concurrent with garment sensing, the participant's spine position will be measured using a motion-capture system that uses reflective markers to detect positions of markers in 3D space. The motion-capture system provides a gold-standard reference measure to which the sensing garments will be compared. Because the investigators are evaluating the accuracy of the sensing garment, it is only necessary that the investigator test the garments on participants with subtly different body shapes. Healthy adult volunteers provide an adequate input to the sensing signal.</brief_summary>
