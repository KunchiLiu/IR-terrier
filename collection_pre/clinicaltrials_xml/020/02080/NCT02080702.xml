	<brief_summary>The aim of this non-interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy of a monofilament, mid-term absorbable suture material (Monosyn®) for anastomosis performed in the gastrointestinal tract using the frequency of anastomosis leakage as a primary parameter. Postoperative complication rate, length of hospital stay, costs, time to perform the anastomosis and handling will serve as secondary endpoints. The question is addressed, whether a monofilament suture material is as effective as a braided suture material for anastomosis construction within the gastrointestinal tract.</brief_summary>
