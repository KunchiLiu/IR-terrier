	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Interaction Potential of Clarithromycin XL on Diltiazem Hydrochloride Cream 2% in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to investigate the potential effect of clarithromycin XL at steady state (administered orally, once daily on Days 4 through 9 as 2 x 500 mg tablets, 1000 mg per day, for a total of 6000 mg) on the PK of a single topical dose of diltiazem hydrochloride 2% cream applied to the perianal area (~2.5 cm [1 inch]; ~8.5 mg). This was a Phase 1 study with a single treatment arm. Efficacy was not assessed; therefore the study was of open-label design.</detailed_description>
