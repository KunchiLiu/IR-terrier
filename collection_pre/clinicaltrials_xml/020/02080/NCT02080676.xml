	<detailed_description>Purpose of study: to check the effect of medical cannabis given for approved medical indications on ocular parameters including intra ocular pressure, Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, optic nerve fibers thickness and choroidal thickness. Adult patients with no ocular pathology that are being treated in the neurology or pain clinics with medical cannabis for different indications, were examined in the eye clinic. First examination took place after the patient was not smoking for 5 hours. Three more examinations took place 1 hour 3 hours and 5 hours after smoking cannabis.
