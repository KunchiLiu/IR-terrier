	<brief_summary>The incidence of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation has been reported to be 17 to 95 percent, but no definite treatment has been reported yet. Therefore, it is important to identify and prevent reversible risk factors for acute kidney injury after liver transplantation. Previous studies have reported several preoperative clinical risk factors, but preoperative medication and intraoperative colloid administration and hemodynamic parameters have not been evaluated. Therefore, we attempt to evaluate perioperative risk factors and develop simplified clinical risk scoring model.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence, Risk Factors, and Risk Model of Acute Kidney Injury After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemia/reperfusion injury occurs during graft harvesting, cold storage, and surgical procedures in liver transplantation. Ischemia/reperfusion injury in liver graft results in major organ damage including kidney, lung and heart as well as graft dysfunction. Graft dysfunction and renal injury after liver transplantation are major clinical issues and are associated with prognosis and low survival rate. The incidence of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation has been reported to be 17 to 95 percent, but no definite treatment has been reported yet. Therefore, it is important to identify and prevent reversible risk factors for acute kidney injury after liver transplantation. Previous studies have reported several preoperative clinical risk factors, but perioperative medication, metabolic variables (albumin, glucose, uric acid), intraoperative colloid administration and hemodynamic parameters have not been evaluated. In addition, a neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which has been reported to be related to systemic inflammation and associated with prognosis of cardiac and cancer patients, might be related to the development of AKI after LDLT. Therefore, we attempt to evaluate these perioperative risk factors and develop simplified clinical risk scoring model.</detailed_description>
