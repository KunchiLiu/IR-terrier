	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) on the heart. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used to treat specific types of breast cancer and is known to cause weakening of the heart. Unfortunately, little is know as to why this this happens. The investigators want to identify any factors that may lead to the early detection, treatment and prevention of the cardiotoxicity (heart problem) associated with this drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strain Imaging in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a subject participating in this study the following information will be collected: complete past medical history including age, height, and weight will be done with each echocardiogram; blood pressure at clinic visits during treatment with trastuzumab, type of cancer will be noted, type of chemotherapy, doses of chemotherapy, type and dose of chemotherapy in the past, type and dose of radiation therapy received, names and doses of cardiac medications, results of cardiac tests, results of lab tests, family history of heart disease, and social history which will include risk factors for developing heart disease including tobacco and alcohol use. This information will be entered into a database for the investigators to try and detect any factors that may lead to the cardiotoxicity (heart problem) that may be caused by Trastuzumab (Herceptin). Any transthoracic echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) ordered will be further evaluated for special parameters that may help to detect weakening of the heart earlier than a normal ultrasound. An echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) is when a probe is placed on the chest and pictures are taken using sound waves and a special camera.</detailed_description>
