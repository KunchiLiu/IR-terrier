	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that has been used to decrease post-operative blood loss. This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial investigating the use of tranexamic acid in fracture surgery around the hip and knee, in which significant blood loss (&gt;300mL) is expected. The hypothesis of this study is that tranexamic acid will be associated with a decrease in post-operative blood loss, as well as a decreased need for allogenic blood transfusion, in patients who have fracture surgery around the hip and knee.</brief_summary>
