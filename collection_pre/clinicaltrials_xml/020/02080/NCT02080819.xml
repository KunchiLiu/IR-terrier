	<brief_title>Striatal Effective Connectivity to Predict Treatment Response in Cocaine Misuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will use stochastic DCM, which is a recent DCM extension that takes into account hidden fluctuations in neuronal and vascular responses, and thus is especially suited for investigating effects of disease or drugs. In addition, this project will use nonlinear DCM, a DCM extension that can measure gating effects by striatum on cortico-cortical pathways. The overall aims of this project are: (1) To conduct functional magnetic resonance imaging-based DCM studies of working memory and impulsivity in order to determine the effective (directional) connectivity between PFC and striatum in treatment-seeking Cocaine Dependent (CD) subjects compared to non-drug using controls. We hypothesize that DLPFC causally affects ventral striatum in CDs, and that the strength of this connection is lower in CDs compared to controls. (2) To determine whether the pretreatment gating effect by the dorsal striatum, as a reflection of pretreatment hypodopaminergic state associated with chronic compulsive drug use, predicts the treatment response to dopaminergic pharmacotherapy in CDs. We hypothesize that lower pretreatment gating by the dorsal striatum on prefrontal-parietal effective connectivity predicts greater 8-week improvement from treatment of CDs with DA enhancing medications (combined with cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]), but not from treatment with placebo (combined with CBT).</detailed_description>
