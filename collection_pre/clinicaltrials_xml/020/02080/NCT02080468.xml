	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of ethinyl estradiol (EE)/norgestimate, a weak cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lomitapide and 2 primary metabolites, M1 and M3.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be a single center, randomized, open-label, 2 arm study to evaluate the effects of EE/norgestimate, a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of lomitapide in healthy female subjects when EE/norgestimate is administered simultaneously with lomitapide and when administration is separated by 12 hours.</detailed_description>
