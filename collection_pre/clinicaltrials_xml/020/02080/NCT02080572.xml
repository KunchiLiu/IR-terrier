	<brief_summary>Changes in deep brain stimulation (DBS) settings can have a delayed effect on gait function, which makes it impractical to optimize DBS for gait parameters in the clinic. Wearable movement sensors could be used to assess gait impairment in the patient's home hours after treatment adjustments are made in the clinic. This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the effects of turning off deep brain stimulation on lower extremity and gait function over three hours. This study will provide vital information about our patient worn system's ability to detect changes in lower impairment over time, which could be used to assist with DBS tuning for the lower extremities and gait in the future.</brief_summary>
