	<brief_summary>The surgeon places the catheter in the thickness of the oblique internal and transverse muscles at the moment the wall is closed, under visual control. A multiperforated catheter whose length corresponds to that of the incision is chosed. The catheter will deliver one of two products chosen at random: either ropivacaine or placebo. This study will evaluate postoperative pain during the first 24 hours thanks to a recognized indicator the VAS (Visual Analogue pain Scale). The total consumption of analgesics will also be recorded, starting with the titration of morphine in the post-op room, and then the consumption of classical analgesics in the nephrology department. These will only be given if the VAS score is equal to 4 or above. This is a prospective, single-centre, controlled, double blind study of ropivacaïne 0.2% versus placebo in continuous TAP block during the first 24 hours after the operation in patients undergoing kidney transplant surgery.</brief_summary>
