	<brief_summary>In this study the following hypotheses will be tested: Electrical stimulation of the gluteal muscle (buttocks) leads to 1. an increase in the thickness of the gluteal muscle 2. a decrease in the thickness of the fat of the buttock area 3. a change in the distribution of the middle and maximal seating pressure to a more consistent pressure 4. an increase in well-being of the patients.</brief_summary>
