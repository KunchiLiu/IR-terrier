	<brief_summary>This study will include 100 patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, split into 2 groups of 50 patients according to their behaviour type, and their adaptation to different factors of stress encountered in their lives: - the first group will consist of patients with a characteristic Type A behaviour profile, that is to say patients with a "proactive, impatient" behaviour pattern - the second group will consist of patients with a characteristic Type B behaviour profile that is to say patients with a "calm, slow" behaviour pattern The objective is to know if the different behaviour patterns are associated with distinct biological markers likely to influence the evolution of the diabetes. Participation in this study will be approximately 1h30, patients will participate ONCE ONLY: 1. they will answer simple questions about their disease and then complete 3 questionnaires each with 14 items. 2. they will meet a clinical psychologist for an interview lasting approximately 45 minutes recorded on an audio recorder. The consultation will be used to seek links between the psyche and the disease. 3. they will provide one blood sample of 12 ml (equivalent to a soup spoon) drawn in the morning.</brief_summary>
