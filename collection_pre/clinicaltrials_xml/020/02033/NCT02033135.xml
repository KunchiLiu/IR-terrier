	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical study is intended to evaluate the use of Zilver PTX stents for treatment of thigh atherosclerosis. Research question: Is there an adjuvant benefit of angioplasty and stenting using the new paclitaxel eluting stent, Zilver-PTX, over risk factor modification and medical therapy alone in patients with stable, mild to moderate intermittent claudication caused by femoropopliteal lesions suitable for endovascular management.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient has signed and dated the informed consent. Patient has 1 2 documented stenotic or occluded atherosclerotic lesions (up to 18 cm long) of the abovetheknee femoropopliteal artery, that meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Reference vessel (the abovetheknee femoropopliteal artery) diameter of 4 mm to 9 mm. Taget lesion(s) should be accessible for stenting, as imaged with angiography (digital subtraction, MRI or CTI), i.e. proximal cm of SFA must be open Patient has a de novo or restenotic lesion(s) with &gt;50% stenosis documented angiographically and no prior stent in the target lesion. Patient has symptoms of peripheral arterial disease classified as Rutherford Category 2 (moderate claudication) or 3 (severe claudication) lasting for at least 3 months. (Positive Claudication Questionnaire) Exercise therapy, smoking cessation advise and best medical therapy must have been implemented at least 3 months ago and without significant clinical effect. Patient has a resting ABI &lt;0.9 or an abnormal exercise ABI (decrease of more than 0.15) if resting ABI is normal. Patient with incompressible arteries (ABI &gt;1.2) must have a TBI &lt;0.8. Patient agrees to return for a clinical status assessment and duplex ultrasound at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and at 24 months. Patient is pregnant, breastfeeding or under 18 years of age. Patient unable to understand and sign informed consent forms Patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational drug or device study. Patient has any planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days after the study procedure. Patient in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated. Patient has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, antiplatelet medication, contrast dye, paclitaxel or nitinol. Patient 23 patent crural vessel runoff with &lt;50% stenosis throughout its course. Activity limited by comorbid condition other than claudication, for example: severe coronary artery disease; angina pectoris; chronic lung disease; neurological disorder such as hemiparesis; arthritis, or other musculoskeletal conditions including amputation and BMI &gt; 40 Other active significant medical problems such as cancer, known chronic renal disease (serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl within 60 days or renal replacement therapy), known chronic liver disease or anaemia, active substance abuse, or known history of dementia</criteria>
