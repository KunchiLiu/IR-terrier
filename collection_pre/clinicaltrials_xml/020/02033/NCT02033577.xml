	<brief_summary>Surgical bypassing of a longer section of the small bowel (when doing a gastric bypass operation) gives better results on body weight in the superobese. We do not yet know whether it is beneficial to exclude more of the proximal small bowel or more of the distal. Side effects of bypassing can also be different. Study aims at clarifying possible differences in effects and side-effects of these two surgical-technical variations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Long Biliopancreatic Limb Versus Long Alimentary Limb in Superobesity, a Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomisation in the OR between long biliopancreatic limb and long alimentary limb. GAstric component identical. Perioperative biopsies to assess mucosal properties at the gastrojejunostomy and the enteroanastomosis. Repeat biopsies (gastroscopy) at one year to identify changes in the mucosa at the Gastroenteroanastomosis.</detailed_description>
