	<criteria>Must have confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic, and standard curative measures or other therapy that may provide clinical benefit do not exist or are no longer effective. For Veliparib monotherapy (must have tumor with defects in DNA repair mechanisms (BRCA mutation or high grade ovarian cancer or solid tumors for combination therapy. If the subject has known brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable neurologic function and no evidence of Central Nervous System (CNS) disease progression as determined by comparing a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed during screening to a prior scan performed at least 4 weeks earlier and provided that the subject is asymptomatic, has no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage, and does not require corticosteroids (must have discontinued steroids at least 3 months prior to study drug administration). Subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function per local laboratory reference range. Subject has a clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical condition(s) including but not limited to: Uncontrolled seizure disorder, including focal or generalized seizure within the last 12 months; Uncontrolled nausea/vomiting/diarrhea; Active uncontrolled infection; Symptomatic congestive heart failure; Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia; Psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements; Any medical condition, which in the opinion of the study investigator, places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities. Subjects who have hypersensitivity to Carboplatin, Paclitaxel or Cremophor should be excluded from arm B. Subject has received any of the following anticancer therapies 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug or a biologic agent for antineoplastic intent within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subject who requires parenteral nutrition, tube feeding or has evidence of a partial bowel obstruction or perforation within 28 days prior to study drug. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past 3 years except for any cancer in situ that the Principal Investigator considers to be cured.</criteria>
