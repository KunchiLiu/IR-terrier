	<brief_summary>The first purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a 24-session, 6-month family-based behavioral intervention (FBBI) - as compared to a delayed treatment group which later receives the same FBBI - that targets weight loss in adolescents/young adults with intellectual disability aged 15-22 years. The second purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of a 12-session, 6-month Maintenance intervention that targets maintenance of weight loss in the same population of adolescents/young adults with intellectual disability. The Maintenance condition follows the completion of each FBBI group and involves a re-randomization to either the Maintenance intervention or no further intervention. Outcome measures include Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, physical activity/sedentary behavior (measured via accelerometry), dietary patterns (3-Day Food Records), self-efficacy and psychosocial characteristics (Adolescent Depression and Anxiety Scale). Hypotheses are that (1) participants in the FBBI condition will lose more weight (reduced BMI) than participants in the delayed treatment condition, and that (2) participants in the Maintenance condition will maintain weight lost (reductions in BMI) or experience less weight regain, as compared with participants who receive no further intervention following FBBI.</brief_summary>
