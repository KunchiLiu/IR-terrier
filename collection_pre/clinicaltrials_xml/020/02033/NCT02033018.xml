	<brief_title>Aflibercept Intravitreal Injection for Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty consecutive patients (30 eyes) with subfoveal PM-CNV, 9 of whom had been unsuccessfully treated with Visudyne PDT, were treated with IVT of 0.5mg ranibizumab. ETDRS best corrected visual acuity, macular thickness on OCT scans, and angiographic features were recorded and evaluated. The aspect of OCT scans passing across the PM-CNV was also analyzed. IVTs were repeated only in case of persistent angiographic leakage and if OCT scans showed retinal thickening or edema and serous retinal detachment. The follow-up period was at least 6 months</detailed_description>
