	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To study the difference in dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedure time following overnight cervical preparation with laminaria or Dilapan-S™. The investigators hypothesize procedure time will be less with Dilapan-S™. Secondary objectives: To compare the use of laminaria and Dilapan-S™ for differences in: (1) initial cervical dilation before D&amp;E; (2) need for mechanical dilation to accomplish D&amp;E and ease of dilation if required; (3) number of osmotic dilators placed; (4) ability to complete the D&amp;E procedure without further cervical preparation; (5) complications; (6) pain and other side effects; (7) patient acceptability; and (8) provider acceptability.</brief_summary>
