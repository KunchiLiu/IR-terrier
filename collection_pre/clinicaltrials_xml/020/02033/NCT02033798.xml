	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether medical treatment for bladder outlet obstruction is effective in improvement of glomerular filtration rate and/or proteinuria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Daily Tamsulosin 0.2mg Administration on Renal Function in Patients With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urodynamic parameters including maximal flow rate, compliance (infused volume gradient divided by bladder pressure gradient during cystometry), maximal detrusor pressure, bladder outlet obstruction index and Schäfer grade will be checked. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary protein to creatinine ratio will be checked. International prostate symptom score will be checked.</detailed_description>
