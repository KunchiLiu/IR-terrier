	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to describe a patients' fitness before and after treatment (whether that treatment be chemotherapy or a transplant). Fitness is a way of measuring a patient's current quality of health. With surveys, questionnaires and blood tests, we hope to create a tool that will give a good picture of patients' ability to tolerate treatment. In the future, we hope to devise the best treatment for a patient based on their "fitness".</brief_summary>
