	<brief_summary>Healthcare-associated infections are a major cause of morbidity among critically ill patients. Bathing critically ill patients with cloths impregnated with the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine-gluconate may decrease healthcare-associated infections. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily bathing with disposable chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths, as compared to daily bathing with disposable standard non-chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths, on the rates of healthcare-associated infections in critically-ill patients. Hypothesis: Daily bathing of the skin with chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths will result in reduced rates of healthcare-associated infections in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU).</brief_summary>
