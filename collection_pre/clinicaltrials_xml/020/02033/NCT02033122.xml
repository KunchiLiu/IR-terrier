	<brief_summary>Exercise training has been proposed as adjunctive therapy in asthma to improve many clinical outcomes; however its effects on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation, characteristic features in asthma, remains poorly understood. We aim to investigate the effects of aerobic training on BHR (primary aim) and systemic inflammation (secondary aim). In addition, clinical control and health related quality of life (HRQoL) will be also assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Aerobic Training in Moderate or Severe Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled and single-blind trial whose intervention will be an aerobic training. Fifty -eight patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma will be recruited at a university hospital and randomly assigned in two groups: control (CG) or training (TG) .The study will be performed between two medical visits with intervals of six months and during this period the same medication dosage will be maintained. Patients in CG will perform (an educational program + breathing exercise; n=28) and TG patients will perform (an educational program+breathing exercises+aerobic training; n=30).The sessions will be conducted twice a week, for 3 months. Before and after the intervention, all patients will be evaluated by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, serum cytokines levels, total immunoglobulin E, induced sputum, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), asthma clinical control (daily symptoms dairy, exacerbations and asthma control questionnaire - ACQ), health related quality of life (HRQoL); asthma quality of life questionnaire-(AQLQ), pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All the patients will be evaluated by specific immunoglobulin E (atopy) through (skin prick test or Phadiatop).</detailed_description>
