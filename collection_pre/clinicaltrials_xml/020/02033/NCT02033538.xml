	<brief_summary>Albumin-bound paclitaxel regimen in advanced NSCLC has a better tumor response rate and safety than solvent-based paclitaxel. However, the safety and efficacy is uncertain in neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer. The objective of this single-arm phase II trial was to evaluate the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Nanoparticle Albumin-bound Paclitaxel in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, or both, for patients with surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma, but have all failed to demonstrate a consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, preoperative chemotherapy followed by radical surgery became one of the treatment strategies for resectable, clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil as perioperative therapy for patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma.</detailed_description>
