	<brief_summary>Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease generally known as senile dementia. Our proposed study will establish safety and pharmacokinetics of Meganatural-AZ GSPE in AD subjects. As secondary measures, we will also provide the essential human data to guide the design of future studies to test the efficacy of GSPE in mitigating cognitive deterioration in AD patients.</brief_summary>
