	<brief_title>Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Adolescents With Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD) and functional abdominal pain (FAP), are common in adolescents and associated with impaired quality of life. In adults with IBS, internet-delivered CBT leads to reduced symptoms and increased quality of life, but studies in children are lacking. This pilot-study aim to evaluate the treatment effects and feasibility of an internet-delivered CBT-program for adolescents with FGID. Method: Pilot study with a pre-post-design and no control group. The internet-delivered CBT-program lasted for 8 weeks and included weekly therapist support, consisting of online messages and telephone calls. Assessment points were baseline, post-treatment and 6 months follow-up. Analysis: Effect sizes and within-group differences were calculated in an intent-to-treat analysis using Cohens' d and Student's t-test.</detailed_description>
