	<brief_summary>In this study, the bioavailability of a specific orange peel extract is tested. The composition and morphology of the test product is altered compared to the generic product, which is used as a control. Due to intellectual property issues, more information cannot be given at this moment. Also the difference in bioavailability between a capsule and a lozenge is tested. The hypothesis is that the bioavailability of the altered extract will be improved compared to the control.</brief_summary>
