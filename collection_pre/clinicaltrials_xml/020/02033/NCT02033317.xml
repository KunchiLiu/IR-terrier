	<brief_title>An Open-Label, Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacology, Safety, and Tolerability of Patiromer in Participants on Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial intent was to enroll 12-24 adult male and female participants on hemodialysis into the study. Due to significant recruitment challenges, the study was discontinued after six participants were enrolled in the study. This was an open-label, multiple-dose, adaptive-design study in participants on hemodialysis. Eligible participants on hemodialysis were to remain in the Clinical Research Unit for 2 weeks (Day -7 to Day 8) and were required to consume a potassium, magnesium, calcium and sodium-controlled diet.</detailed_description>
