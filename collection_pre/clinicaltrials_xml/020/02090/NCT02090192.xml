	<brief_summary>Objective: To study the acute and chronic effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) exercises on the lower extremity blood flow, mobility function, balance, muscle strength, bone density, and general health status, and its feasibility as an intervention in frail elderly patients. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: The frail older persons meeting the Fried Frailty Criteria. Interventions: All eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 4 groups: (1) WBV group: Subjects received a whole-body vibration exercise alone; (2) Progressive resistance training (PRT) group: Subjects received progressive resistance training; (3) WBV+ PRT group: Subjects received the whole-body vibration and progressive resistance training; (4) Control group: Subjects received no intervention/training. The periods of intervention are 12 weeks. Main measures: The lower extremities blood flow (the diameters and red blood cell velocity of the common femoral artery), timed up and go test, 30-second chair stand test, five times sit to stand test, lower extremities muscle strength, balance function, balance confidence, bone density, and general health status was assessed at the beginning of the study, at instant, 12 weeks and 24 month after the intervention. Study hypothesis: Whole-body vibration exercise is a safe and effective method that can improve the lower extremity blood flow, mobility function, balance, muscle strength, bone density, and general health status in the frail elderly.</brief_summary>
