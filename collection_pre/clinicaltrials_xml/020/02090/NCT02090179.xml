	<criteria>Subject and/or subject's parent or legal guardian provides informed consent Subject is â‰¥5 years of age. Subject has a definitive diagnosis of MPS IIIB, as determined by either a documented deficiency in alphaNacetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme activity or documented functionallyrelevant mutations in both alleles of the NAGLU gene. The subject has any internal or nonremovable external metal items that may present a safety risk (for MRI), or any other medical condition or circumstance in which an MRI is contraindicated. The subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to anaesthesia, a bleeding disorder, or any other medical condition or circumstance in which a lumbar puncture (for collection of CSF) is contraindicated. Previous allergic reaction to gadoliniumbased MRI contrast media.</criteria>
