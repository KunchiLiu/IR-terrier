	<brief_summary>Dystrophinopathy is a disease continuum that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which develops in boys. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of dystrophinopathy in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. The main goal of this Phase 3 extension study is to obtain long term safety of ataluren in boys with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy as determined by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in physical function, pulmonary function and other important clinical and laboratory measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Extension Study of Ataluren (PTC124) in Patients With Nonsense Mutation Dystrophinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3, open label safety and efficacy study will be performed at participating sites worldwide. The study will enroll ~ 220 boys with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy who participated in a previous Phase 3 study of ataluren (Protocol # PTC124-GD-020-DMD). Patients will receive 10, 10, 20 mg/kg of ataluren TID at morning, midday, and evening for approximately 96 weeks. Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Completion of study treatment in the previous Phase 3, doubleblind study protocol (Protocol PTC124GD020DMD). Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the patient (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial. Willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ an approved method of contraception during the period of study drug administration and 6week followup period. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions. Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug Ongoing participation in any clinical trial (except for studies specifically approved by PTC Therapeutics). Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition, behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or followup would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.</criteria>
