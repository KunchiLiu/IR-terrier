	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether 150 mg enteric-coated aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) taken twice a day (BID) with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) administration or 75 mg enteric-coated ASA taken once daily in the morning (QAM) with DMF administration reduces the incidence and/or severity of flushing events in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) compared with ASA-placebo administered with DMF in the clinical practice setting. Secondary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DMF administered with and without enteric-coated ASA in the clinical practice setting; to evaluate the impact of DMF administration on quality of life as measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36®) and European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions - 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires.</brief_summary>
