	<detailed_description>This study supports the collection of tumor specimens for CLIA-certified genomic testing and research testing in parallel. CLIA-certified tests have established measurements of accuracy and precision which allow for return of results. This study does not involve treatment, only testing, which could be used to meet eligibility criteria in other trials.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. A histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer 2. Patients with any malignancy. 3. Patients must have tumor suitable for research tumor biopsy (as assessed by trained specialists in interventional radiology) and Patients are medically fit to undergo a tissue biopsy or surgical procedure to get tumor tissue OR If Patients do not have a tumor suitable for biopsy but have another tissue available for molecular evaluation. OR Patients are undergoing standard of care surgeries or procedures where fresh specimens will be first used for routine pathologic assessment and only then will leftover tissue be used for research purposes. 4. Procedurespecific signed informed consent prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedures. 5. Women and minorities are included in this protocol. 6. Patients with multiple malignancies remain eligible. 7. Patients with an inherited cancer syndrome or a medical history suggestive of an inherited cancer syndrome remain eligible. 1. It is the enrolling study physicians discretion to decide if a patient is not fit enough to undergo tissue biopsy. 2. Patients who are incarcerated are not eligible to participate.</criteria>
