	<brief_summary>Data from subjects who had previously been dosed with Flutemetamol (18F) Injection and imaged in Study GE-067-007, and who died on or before 10 June 2013, will be analyzed. The PET brain images previously obtained in Study GE-067-007 will be interpreted visually in randomized by 5 independent readers who are blinded to all other subject information, and the images will be classified as abnormal (positive for abnormal neuritic plaque density) or normal (negative for abnormal neuritic plaque density). The numbers of images in each category will be used to calculate sensitivity and specificity.</brief_summary>
