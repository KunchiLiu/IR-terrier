	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies demonstrated an inverse associations between cardiovascular events and milk and dairy product consumption. Evidence from human intervention studies suggests that both whey and casein may be effective in blood pressure-lowering, however there is limited data on the impact of milk proteins on vascular function. This research aims to compare the potential acute and chronic impacts of the two main milk proteins (whey and casein) with maltodextrin on blood pressure and vascular function. Furthermore, the effects of these proteins on the markers of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammatory status will also be investigated in 'at-risk' individuals. This research includes both an acute and chronic intervention study which have been independently powered on the appropriate outcome measures. This has generated different sample size requirements for the two studies (Actual participants on the acute study: n=27, and on the chronic study: n=38).</brief_summary>
