	<brief_summary>The experiences of learning from paediatric physiotherapists were explored through unstructured interviews applying Colazzi's method to interpret the data. In this hermeneutic phenomenological study, six parents responsible for a physiotherapy home programme for their child were selected through convenience sampling. The purpose of this study was to obtain rich and valid information that could be analysed. The phenomenon of their learning experiences was formed and explored, its implications discussed and inferences made in light of current physiotherapy service delivery.</brief_summary>
