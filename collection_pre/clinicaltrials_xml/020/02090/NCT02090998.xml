	<brief_summary>This study will compare a local anesthetic technique that has been used to treat subjects suffering from transformed migraines (chronic migraines) versus medical management with traditional antidepressant Amitriptyline / Elavil. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups to compare the safety and efficacy of the therapies. Subjects will recieve either sphenopalatine ganglion nerve block with 5% lidocaine gel into the nasopharynx or medical management with traditional antidepressants, Elavil, to produce a reduction in the frequency and severity of the headache. We propose that there will be a difference in the outcomes when comparing the two methods of treating transformed migraines and that one research arm will result in more patient satisfaction and greater efficacy in the treatment of subjects</brief_summary>
