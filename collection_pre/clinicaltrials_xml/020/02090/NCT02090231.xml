	<brief_summary>Dysphagia is one of severe complications among stroke survivors. Dysphagia is usually associated with high levels of morbidity, mortality, and financial cost. In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown promise to facilitate poststroke dysphagia. However, most researches were preliminary studies in the past. The present study aims to investigate the immediate and long-term efficacy of high frequency rTMS on chronic dysphagic patients.</brief_summary>
