	<brief_summary>In the diagnosis of renal colic gallstone , in addition to clinical and biological factors, it is a key : medical imaging. Currently , the French recommendations require at least a couple of Abdomen radiography Without Preparation lying face (ASP ) associated with abdominal ultrasound . "The abdominopelvic CT scan without injection of contrast is the examination of choice. Current recommendations in the management of gallstone colic simply based on the joint use of analgesics , anti inflammatory drugs and control of water intake . The mechanism of analgesic action of this treatment is a decrease in the pressure in the cavities by decrease in diuresis and inflammation treatment of ureteral permitting passage of urine . ) The expulsive medical therapy remains under evaluation. The French Association of Urology does not recommend at this time for lack of evidence deemed sufficient. For foreign companies Urology (EAU , AUA) , the use of calcium channel blockers or alpha blockers in the treatment of symptomatic lower ureteral stones (4 to 10mm ) is recommended (grade 1A) . However, there are less formal studies of their effectiveness . Investigators wish to demonstrate the effectiveness of alpha in medical expulsive therapy for pelvic stones 4 to 10mm .</brief_summary>
