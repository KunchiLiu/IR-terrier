	<brief_title>Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for Youth With Anxiety at Risk for Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children who have parents with bipolar disorder are at risk for developing anxiety disorders. Typical treatments for anxiety in children are SSRI antidepressants. However, these medications may accelerate the onset of mania or hypomania in children with a family history of bipolar disorder or cause suicidal thinking in children. Studies trying alternative treatments to anxiety and possible bipolar disorder in children are needed, to establish other methods for treating childhood mental health. These studies can also help with early intervention and possible future prevention strategies for bipolar disorder. This study involves treating anxious children with Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy. They will have 12 weeks of mindfulness therapy in a group with other children where they will be led by a trained group leader, how to pay attention to anxiety cues and react differently.</detailed_description>
