	<brief_summary>Hypothyroidism is risk factor in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, but there is a controversy in effect of subclinical hypothyroidism on cardiovascular diseases. We aim to estimate the relation between subclinical hypothyroidism and endothelial dysfunction and the effects of levothyroxine therapy on it. Patients with confirmed subclinical hypothyroidism by lab results will be randomized to two groups of treatment with one daily dose of 100 mg Levothyroxine or placebo. The flow-mediated dilation and intima media thickness are evaluated before and after the study.</brief_summary>
