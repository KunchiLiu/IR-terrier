	<brief_summary>Parathyroid (PTH) hormone has been shown to enhance fracture healing in animal studies. There are so far only three published papers concerning humans. Postero-lateral fusions have shown a healing rate of less than 50% after bone. The purpose of this study is to determine if PTH 1-34 (teriparatide) improves the healing rate and the clinical course after spinal stenosis surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>100 patients undergoing surgery due to spinal stenosis and intraoperatively treated with autologous bone graft, will be randomised to either 4 weeks of daily injections with teriparatide or control. Primary outcome: The rate of healing at 6 months on CT Scans. Secondary outcomes; Pain (VAS), function (Oswestry Disability Index), quality of life (EQ-5D) at 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
