Healthy adult subjects will be assigned to either follow their usual diet, or to replace sugar calories with fats or starch. The investigators hypothesize that eating less sugar will: 1. cause foods and drinks with a given amount of sugar to taste sweeter 2. cause people to prefer lower levels of sugar in foods and drinks</brief_summary>
