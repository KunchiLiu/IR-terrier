	<brief_summary>The overall research aim of this study is to investigate changes in measures related to the risk of falls among elderly with dementia participating in animal-assisted interventions. Also relatives' experience of own and the elderly's situation during and after the intervention will be examined. The design will be a prospective and cluster randomized multicenter trial, but mixed-methods will be used to target different outcomes. The study population will be elderly (age above 65) at day care centers diagnosed with dementia, or having a cognitive deficit. The intervention will consist of 30 minutes sessions with animal-assisted activity or animal-assisted therapy two times a week for 12 weeks in groups of 4-6 participants. Control groups will receive treatment as usual. Research questions: 1. Is there an effect in use of ordinary and optional medication among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers participating in animal-assisted interventions compared to a control group? 2. Is there an effect on social interaction, quality of life, activeness and wellbeing among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers participating in animal-assisted interventions compared to a control group? 3. Is there an effect on balance among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers participating in animal-assisted therapy compared to animal-assisted activity or a control group? 4. Do relatives of elderly persons with dementia at day care centers experience a change in their own and the elderly's situation after the intervention compared with before the intervention started?</brief_summary>
