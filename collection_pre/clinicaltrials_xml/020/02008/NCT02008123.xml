	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding primidone will improve the metabolism of clopidogrel thereby increasing metabolite levels within the blood stream and platelet response to clopidogrel in patients who were previously found to lack adequate response to clopidogrel. This information could help overcome clopidogrel resistance in patients who are at risk for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).</brief_summary>
