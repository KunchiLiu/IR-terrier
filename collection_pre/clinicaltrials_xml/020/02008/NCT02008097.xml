	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of the B-flow capability on the LOGIQ E9 system in three clinical focus areas. 1. Liver transplant patients: Improved real-time visualization of liver vessels is needed to improve diagnosis and assessment following stenting or angioplasty. 2. Renal artery disease: Improved real-time visualization of the renal arteries would enable a more rapid and accurate assessment of renal artery disease (stenosis, dissection, occlusion, aneurysm) and facilitate follow-up evaluations after renal artery interventions. 3. Pregnancy: We are proposing to use B-flow ultrasound as a way to evaluate placenta perfusion and assay for potential ischemia.</brief_summary>
