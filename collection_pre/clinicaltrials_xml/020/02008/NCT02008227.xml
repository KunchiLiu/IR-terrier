	<brief_summary>This global, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) or Atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenous infusion) every three weeks. Treatment may continue as long as patients are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression.</brief_summary>
