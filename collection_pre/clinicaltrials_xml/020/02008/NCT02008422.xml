	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this control, single-center clinical study of EndostarTM Injection with/without SOX protocols to treat advanced gastric cancer were to evaluate the clinical response rate of Endostar injection concomitant with SOX on patients with advanced gastric cancer, observe the progression-free survival time (PFS) of tumor and evaluate the safety and tolerance of Endostar injection, while the secondary objectives were to observe the influence of Endostar injection on chemotherapy-induced adverse reactions and evaluate the overall survival time of EndostarTM injection concomitant with SOX on patients with advanced gastric cancer by evaluating the response rate (RR) clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Endostar Injection Concomitant With SOX Protocols to Treat Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple pre-clinical studies have indicated that in dozens of animal tumor models and human tumor-metastatic mice tumor models, the effective rate of Endostar was 47%～91% in daily dosage of 10～100mg/kg, and covered human commonly seen malignant tumors, such as lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, malignant melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, etc.. The development and progression of gastric cancer was in association with angiogenesis. An animal research observed the influence of Endostar on tumor strains in nude mice with gastric cancer, and the results showed that tumor size shrunk rapidly and the expressions of VEGF, bFGF, VEGF-C, VEGFR-3, bcl-2 and PDGF decreased significantly after treatment in experimental group, demonstrating that Endostar could reduce angiogenesis, increase tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in gastric cancer. An investigation of small-sample Endostar concomitant with chemotherapy on patients with advanced gastric cancer primarily indicated the efficacy and feasibility of Endostar concomitant with chemotherapy in treating gastric cancer. With the expanded application of Endostar in clinic, it also obtains certain effect in treating patients with lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The safety, efficacy, evaluation of relationship between benefit and risk in common or special population as well as the modified dosage of administration of Endostar in wide application should be further explored to provide sufficient scientifical basis for the safety, efficacy, applicable rule in special population and investigation of optimal administrative protocols for Endostar in wide application. This control, single-center clinical study of EndostarTM Injection with/without SOX protocols to treat advanced gastric cancer was conducted to explore the feasibility, efficacy and safety of Endostar concomitant with SOX protocols, and to provide more evidence-based medical basis for the clinical application of Endostar.</detailed_description>
