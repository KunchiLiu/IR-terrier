	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the effectiveness of a youth-led animal husbandry microfinance program, Rabbits for Resilience, combined with the adult microfinance, Pigs for Peace (PFP), program on youth, family and community resilience outcomes. The following aims will be completed over the five-year longitudinal, mixed-method, cluster randomized community trial: Specific Aim 1: Determine the relative effectiveness of a youth-led microfinance combined with the adult microfinance on youth and family resilience outcomes (reduced mental health distress, increased economic stability, improved family functioning) compared to a youth-led microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches. - We hypothesize that at six, twelve and 18-months post-baseline youth and adults in households in the youth-led and adult microfinance approach will report improved individual and family resilience outcomes compared to households in the youth-led microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches. Specific Aim 2: Determine the relative effectiveness of a youth-led microfinance combined with PFP microfinance on community resilience (e.g. social capital and participation in community groups by youth and adults) compared to youth-led microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches. - We hypothesize that at 18-months post baseline in households in the youth-led and adult microfinance will report improved community resilience compared to households in the youth-led microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches Specific Aim 3: Determine if changes in youth resilience (caregiving ability, empathy and outlook for the future) mediate the relationship between youth engagement in microfinance and outcomes, as measured by reduced mental health distress, improved family functioning and improved social capital. Specific Aim 4: Examine youth perspectives on resilience in the context of multiple adversities (war, poverty, loss of family, displacement, victimization). Youth participants (N=50, ages 10-15 years) will be invited (with parent/caregiver consent) to complete at baseline and 18 month post-baseline qualitative interview/group discussion to examine individual, family and community resilience and what that they perceive as key to buffering the negative health and social consequences of prolonged conflict and other adversities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Youth and Adult Microfinance to Improve Resilience Outcomes in Democratic Republic of Congo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congolese youth, families and communities have survived the 16 years of conflict and are now faced with significant challenges for rebuilding their futures. Developing, implementing and evaluating microfinance programs that combine youth and adults is an innovative strategy to assist households and community efforts by focusing on existing strengths. The study will advance knowledge for youth, families and communities impacted by armed conflicts in six critical areas: - 1) increase our knowledge of youth and adult resilience (mental and physical health, family functioning, social capital) in context of multiple adversities; - 2) measurement of resilience from a social ecological and longitudinal, mixed-method perspective; - 3) expand our understanding of resilience to develop prevention interventions for youth in early adolescence (ages 10-15 years), an important time to develop healthy transitions to young adulthood (ages 15-10 years); - 4) test a youth-led microfinance program combined with an existing and successful adult microfinance program, Pigs For Peace (PFP), that is sustainable and appropriate to the context of a war-affected population; - 5) detail resources and infrastructure needed for conducting research in challenging field settings with diverse cultures and languages as well as with limited resources, such as access to mental health professionals; - 6) provide guidelines for the ethical conduct of research in settings where participants of diverse ages and backgrounds may have limited knowledge of human rights and ethical research concepts, such as informed consent and assent.</detailed_description>
