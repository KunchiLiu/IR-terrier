	<brief_summary>Keratoconus is a chronic progressive non - inflammatory disorder characterised by progressive steepening and thinning of cornea and high myopic astigmatism, accounting for poor visual acuity in such individuals. Keratoconus seems to be more advanced on presentation, in young patients. The investigators intend to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional collagen cross linking in young patients diagnosed with keratoconus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Collagen Crosslinking in Young Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keratoconus is progressive ectatic corneal disorder characterised by progressive corneal thinning, steep corneal curvatures and usually associated with high irregular myopic astigmatism. The major problems concerning keratoconus in young patients are; 1. Rapid rates of progression in young keratoconic corneas as compared to adults. 2. Poor biomechanical properties of young corneas. 3. Poor quality of vision, which predisposes to a very poor quality of life. 4. High rates of complications and failure post keratoplasty in young patients. The investigators intend to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional collagen crosslinking in young patients with keratoconus with regards to keratometric indices and visual acuity.</detailed_description>
