	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the onset and duration of the initial dose of medications given through three different epidural (conventional epidural, combined spinal epidural and dural puncture epidural) techniques for labor pain relief. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the fetal effects of these three epidural labor analgesia techniques.</brief_summary>
