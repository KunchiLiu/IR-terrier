	<brief_summary>Several studies showed that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for development of diabetes mellitus. However none of the previous studies have investigated the effect of lowering serum uric acid levels on insulin resistance of which is also named as prediabetes. With this background in mind, we aimed to test the effect of lowering serum uric acid level with allopurinol on insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
