	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Asian male aged at least 20 years at the time of signing the informed consent form Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate Evidence of metastatic disease (bone and/or visceral), excluding node lesion only, on radiographic examination, whether from bone scan (bone lesions) or other imaging modality (computed tomography [CT] scan/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) Chemical or surgical castration verified by levels of serum testosterone ≤50 ng/dL (1.75 nmol/L), Evidence of progressive disease after castration levels of testosterone have been achieved Cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer within 2 years prior to the start of study treatment Previous anticancer therapy using radiation, biologics or vaccines and including sipuleucelT (Provenge®) within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment and abiraterone, TAK700 or MDV3100 within 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment. Before inclusion, abiraterone, TAK700 or MDV3100 related adverse effect must have been resolved to NCICTCAE v4.03 Grade ≤1. If radiation therapy is applied after Baseline scan, a new Baseline scan needs to be done at least 4 weeks after the radiation therapy Therapy with antiandrogens within 4 weeks (within 6 weeks for bicalutamide e.g. Casodex®) prior to the start of study treatment Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the exception of ongoing treatment with luteinising hormonereleasing hormone agonists or antagonists, denosumab (Prolia®) or bisphosphonate (e.g. zoledronic acid), which are allowed. Ongoing treatment should be kept at a stable schedule; however, if medically required, a change of dose, compound, or both is allowed Prostate cancer pain that requires ongoing treatment with narcotic analgesics or warrants the initiation of radio or chemotherapy ProstateSpecific Antigen (PSA) &gt;100 ng/mL</criteria>
