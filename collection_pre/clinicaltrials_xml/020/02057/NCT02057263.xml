	<brief_summary>Vaccines are one of our most effective public health tools but many who need them don't respond well and are not protected. Adjuvants boost immune responses and are commonly included in vaccine preparations. Bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed treatment for osteoporosis and may represent a new class of adjuvant. Bisphosphonates are well tolerated with chronic administration and have very few adverse effects. Research suggests that these medications can stimulate the immune system. Bisphosphonates are of special interest in populations with impaired immunity and an inability to amount protective antibody responses following immunizations. We propose a pilot study to evaluate the clinical relevance of this finding in humans. We will study the effect of bisphosphonates on quantitative humoral immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in healthy older volunteers who have not previously received this vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Alendronate on the Immune Response to Hepatitis B Vaccine in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Immunization is one of the most beneficial and cost-effective disease prevention measures available, but is not always efficacious, especially in older and immunosuppressed populations. This commonly encountered failure to produce protective antibodies following immunization leaves large parts of the population vulnerable to serious morbidity and mortality resulting from potentially preventable communicable diseases. Bisphosphonates, a commonly prescribed treatment for osteoporosis that is well tolerated with few adverse effects, has recently been shown to enhance B cell expansion and antibody production after vaccination in mice, and may represent a new vaccine adjuvant. Aims: The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effect of bisphosphonates on the immune response to vaccination in adults using two complementary research methodologies: 1. Evaluating the effect of bisphosphonates on quantitative humoral immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in healthy older volunteers through a randomized clinical trial. 2. Evaluating the effect of bisphosphonate treatment on protection against influenza and influenza-like illness after seasonal Influenza immunization in the adult population through a population-level retrospective analysis. Methods: The first part of the study consists of a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in which 20 healthy adults 40-70 years of age who are seronegative for Hepatitis B, will be randomized to receive either two doses of intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine with alendronate or hepatitis B vaccine with placebo. The primary outcome evaluated will be quantitative anti-HB surface IgG antibody titers in the study group compared to the placebo group at week 8 and at 6 months. The second part of the study is a retrospective population based case-control study utilizing extensive available data repositories. Rates of influenza, influenza-like illness and lower respiratory tract infections per 1000 subjects will be ascertained and compared between study and control populations for each year, while adjusting for potential confounders.</detailed_description>
