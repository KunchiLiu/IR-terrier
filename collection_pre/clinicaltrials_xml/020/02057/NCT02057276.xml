	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) can augment occupational therapy in improving motor function in children (10 years of age or older) and young adults (&lt; 21 years of age) with chronic hemiparesis from either stroke or cerebral palsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive TMS and Occupational Therapy in Children and Young Adults With Chronic Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RTMS is a noninvasive technology that can induce changes in brain function that may lead to functional improvement in people with hemiparesis. This is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled rTMS study in conjunction with intensive daily occupational therapy (OT) for 2 weeks to improve motor function in hemiparetic patients. Participants will be followed for at least 12 weeks after rTMS to detect any clinical change. The sham group participants will be offered an open-label active rTMS treatment plus OT after the 12 week assessment.</detailed_description>
