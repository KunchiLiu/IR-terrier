	<brief_summary>Maternal depression and mother-infant relationship dysfunction have reciprocal effects on each other. An integrated approach addressing both problems simultaneously may improve outcomes. Perinatal Dyadic Psychotherapy (PDP) was developed to prevent/decrease postpartum depression and facilitate optimal mother-infant relationships. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PDP. Depressed first-time mothers (meeting diagnostic criteria for depression and/or with high depression symptom levels) and their 6-week-old infants will be randomized to receive either the PDP intervention or a control condition. The PDP intervention consists of 8 home-based, nurse-delivered mother-infant sessions consisting of (a) a supportive, relationship-based, mother-infant psychotherapeutic component, and (b) a developmentally based infant-oriented component focused on promoting positive mother-infant interactions. Control mothers will receive usual care plus depression monitoring by phone. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 month follow-up. Assessments included maternal depression (diagnosis and severity), maternal anxiety (diagnosis and severity), parenting stress, and mother-infant interaction.</brief_summary>
