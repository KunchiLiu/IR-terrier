	<brief_summary>This study addresses the neglected topic of sleep disturbance in older caregiving dyads-a topic that has important implications for the safety, health, functioning and quality of life of older Veterans living at home and being cared for by a family caregiver (CG). The purpose of the first phase of this study is determine the relationship between CG and care recipient (CR) sleep and describe the impact of dyadic sleep to daytime functioning and well-being for Veterans and their caregivers. The information from phase 1 will inform the next study phase in which the investigators develop and field test non-pharmacological, technology based, sleep hygiene, exercise and meditation interventions to improve sleep in Veteran caregiving dyads.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: The primary objective of this study to develop and field test non-pharmacological, technology based, psycho-educational and behavioral (exercise and meditation) interventions to improve sleep in Veteran/caregiver dyads. Research Plan: The specific objectives will be accomplished through the execution of a three phase strategy: 1) an evaluation phase, 2) a development and preliminary intervention field testing phase, and 3) an intervention refinement, revision and re-testing phase. All studies will use samples of Veteran care receivers (CR s) over the age of 60 who require assistance from a spousal or cohabitating caregiver (CG). A sub-study will include the same collection of data, however using non-Veteran care receivers (CR) over the age of 60 who require assistance from a spousal or cohabitating caregiver (CG). Study 1 is a cross-sectional study which focuses on the Sleep Evaluation of 124 CG/CR Dyads. In SLEEP-E Dyads 1 actigraphy will be used to objectively and contemporaneously measure dyadic sleep. Daily journals will be used to collect CG/CR self-reported sleep quality, daytime mood and behavior and to identify the nature and types of sleep disturbance. Electronic Tablets (E-Tabs) will be introduced, evaluated and validated with half the dyads. Pre and post journal video greetings will be tested and evaluated during this phase. Data from SLEEP-E Dyads 1 will be analyzed and inform the developmental tasks and activities for the next phase of the study. An additional sub-sample of caregiving dyads (non-Veterans) will be recruited to implement the same study design and to compare data to Veteran caregiving dyad data. The focus of SLEEP-E Dyads 2 is on Sleep Enhancement for CG/CR Dyads. This phase involves the adaptation, implementation and field testing of interventions with proven efficacy in other populations for use with Veteran dyads and the development of new interventions using selected components from evidence based sleep interventions. The intervention will be tested on 12 dyads stratified by dementia status. The tele-health device will be used to collect daily diary information during this phase and to deliver the sleep hygiene educational and cognitive behavior therapy components of the intervention. In SLEEP-E Dyads 3 feedback from the CGs regarding the acceptability of the intervention will be processed and analyzed in addition to preliminary outcome data. The intervention will be refined accordingly and the revised intervention will be tested with 44 dyads stratified by dementia status. Methods: All study phases involve comprehensive assessments of sleep and daytime functioning, mood and behavior using standardized validated instruments in addition to subjective data from the dyad as well as objective sleep evaluations with contemporaneous wrist actigraphy measured over seven days. Clinical Relevance: This study addresses the neglected topic of sleep disturbance in older caregiving dyads-a topic that has important implications for the safety, health, functioning and QOL of older Veterans living at home and being cared for by a family caregiver. Because of the inter-related, bi-directional nature of sleep to stress, burden and depression, the most efficacious interventions should be ones which consider risk factors as they relate to the sleep of both members of a dyad. Yet, this study is the first to attempt to elucidate the dynamic relationship between CG and care recipient sleep and the impact of dyadic sleep to daytime functioning and well-being with Veterans and their caregivers. These activities will lead to the implementation and evaluation of a definitive randomized clinical trial for CG/CR dyads and make a significant and important contribution to complement the emergent program of caregiver research in the VA devoted to improving quality of life for Veterans and their families.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Care recipient must be age 60 and over and require assistance from the identified caregiver with more than one Activity of Daily Living or three or more Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, have a life expectancy of greater than or equal to six (6) months, have no plans for transitioning out of home in the next six months, and have approval from the primary care provider to participate in the research. Caregivers must live with care recipient Caregivers must obtain a negative minicog assessment or negative TICSm assessment. Caregivers can be any relation (spouse, child, sibling, friend, etc.) to the care recipient so long as the two are cohabitating. Caregiver can be any age. For Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the study, either the care recipient or the caregiver must have difficulty sleeping as indicated by scores on the Insomnia Severity Index. Parkinson's with tremor or other movement disorder that would invalidate actigraphy Untreated diagnosis of sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome Inability to tolerate actigraphy CG and CR sleep efficiency &gt; 85% and/or both members of dyad report sleeping well Caregivers must have a negative screen with the MiniCog or the TICSm to demonstrate cognitive capacity to provide informed consent</criteria>
