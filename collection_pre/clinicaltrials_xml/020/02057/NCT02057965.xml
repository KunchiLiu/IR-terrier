	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy in Renal Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term survival of transplanted kidneys has not improved accordingly in the last decades. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for many years, due to their efficacy in preventing acute rejection. However, CNI have nephrotoxic side effects that can directly contribute to renal dysfunction and compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently there is a strong interest in immunosuppressive (IS) regimens that maintain efficacy for the prevention of acute rejection, whilst reducing nephrotoxicity. In this perspective the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with a mTor inhibitor (Everolimus (Certican®)) might be an optimal strategy to facilitate CNI (tacrolimus) withdrawal. MSCs have IS properties and roles in tissue repair and everolimus is a proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects. In experimental studies the combination of mTor inhibitor and MSCs was shown to attenuate alloimmune responses and to promote allograft tolerance. In total 70 de novo renal recipients, 18-75 years of ages will be recruited from the transplant clinics of the LUMC. Thirty five of these patients will be included in the Certican/ and MSC group and 35 patients in the Certican/ standard dose tacrolimus group. Patients of the MSC treated groups will receive two doses of autologous BM derived MSCs IV, 7 days apart, 6 and 7 weeks after transplantation in combination with Certican® (1.5 mg b.i.d.). At the time of the second MSC infusion tacrolimus will be withdrawn in 2 weeks (after 1 week dose of tacrolimus will be halved, after 2 weeks stopped). Patients in the control group will receive Certican® (1.5 mg b.i.d.) and standard dose tacrolimus (through levels 6-8 ng/ml after 6 weeks). Primary goal is evaluate whether concentration-controlled Certican® with MSCs compared to Certican® with standard tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients reduces fibrosis by quantitative Sirius Red scoring.</detailed_description>
