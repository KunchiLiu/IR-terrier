	<brief_summary>The objective of the project is to investigate the influence of application of Kinesio Taping in young athletes in football, muscle strength and muscle activation in the performance of the Single Leg Hop Test tests and Triple Hop Test methods: will be conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind. 24 individuals will be athletes who fit the criteria for inclusion will be randomized into 2 groups (Placebo, Kinesio Taping Taping) and will be submitted to the tests of Single Leg Hop Test, Triple Hop Test, the isokinetic evaluation and electromyographic of Rectus Femoris dominant lower limb. Then the intervention shall be carried out with application of Kinesio Taping for activation of rectus femoris muscle group and placebo intervention Kinesio Taping with application of Kinesio Taping of transverse way the rectus femoris without tension in the Placebo group Taping. The volunteers will be re-evaluated 30 minutes after application of the technique and 12:0 am after with the same tests for that later can be compared the results obtained in each group. Analysis: will be achieved statistical tests and adopted a significance level of 5 percent</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The method of bandage with Kinesio Taping created by Kenzo Kase in 1996, it is the application of a thin, elastic tape with a thickness similar to the epidermis, on the skin. Being that it can be stretched up to 140 of its original length making it elastic enough compared to the conventional bandages. Kenzo still claims that the tape is able to reduce pain, swelling, muscle spasms and prevent injury. As much as there is today a widespread use of this technique mainly in the context of sports and orthopedics, still lack reliable studies to support the theory described by this method. Objectives: to investigate the influence of application of Kinesio Taping in young athletes in football, muscle strength and muscle activation in the performance of the Single Leg Hop Test tests and Triple Hop Test methods: will be conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind. 24 individuals will be athletes who fit the criteria for inclusion will be randomized into 2 groups (Placebo, Kinesio Taping Taping) and will be submitted to the tests of Single Leg Hop Test, Triple Hop Test, the isokinetic evaluation and electromyographic of Rectus Femoris dominant lower limb. Then the intervention shall be carried out with application of Kinesio Taping for activation of rectus femoris muscle group and placebo intervention Kinesio Taping with application of Kinesio Taping of transverse way the rectus femoris without tension in the Placebo group Taping. The volunteers will be re-evaluated 30 minutes after application of the technique and 12:0 am after with the same tests for that later can be compared the results obtained in each group. Analysis: will be achieved statistical tests and adopted a significance level of 5 percent.</detailed_description>
