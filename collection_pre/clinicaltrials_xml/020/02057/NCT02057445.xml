	<brief_summary>The administration of allogeneic third party derived LMP specific-CTLs (special peripheral blood cells from another person) that are made specific to fight EBV infection) in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults (CAYA) with EBV-associated refractory or relapsed lymphoma will be feasible ( able to be done), safe and well tolerated (no unexpected serious events will occur). In addition, potential donors who are EBV positive will be enrolled to donate peripheral blood to help build a bank of these specific EBV fighting cell lines.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must be at least 1 year of age. Patient or the patient's legally authorized guardian must be fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of the study protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible side effects), and must sign an informed consent in accordance with the institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Patients should have been off other investigational therapy for one month prior to entry in this study. Patient must have adequate organ function as below: Adequate renal function defined as: Serum creatinine &lt;2.0 x normal, or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt; 40 ml/min/m2 or &gt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or an equivalent GFR as determined by the institutional normal range Adequate liver function defined as: Total bilirubin &lt;2.0 x normal; and SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) &lt;5.0 x normal Adequate pulmonary function defined as: Pulse oximetry &gt;94% in room air. Lansky (&lt; 16yr) or Karnofsky (&gt; 16 yrs) performance status ≥ 50% Life expenctancy ≥ 6 weeks. Women of child bearing age require a negative urine pregnancy test. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids to less than 0.5mg/kg/day prednisone at time of treatment. 4.5 Disease Status (Eligibility) 4.5.1 Any patient, with one or more of the following EBVpositive type II latency or associated disorders, regardless of the histological subtype: Hodgkin lymphoma NonHodgkin lymphoma Lymphoproliferative disorder Severe chronic active EBV infection syndrome (SCAEBV), defined as high EBV viral load in plasma or PBMC (&gt; 4000 genomes per μg PBMC DNA) and/or biopsy tissue positive for EBV The disease needs to be in one of the following stages: At diagnosis who would be unable to receive conventional chemotherapy or in first relapse AND the patient is not a candidate for HSCT Partial response after conventional therapy. Refractory to conventional therapy for his/her condition. In second or subsequent relapse. Residual disease after autologous, syngeneic or allogeneic HSCT. All patients entered into the study ideally will have tumor tissue from the original diagnostic specimen and/or relapse reviewed centrally for confirmation of EBV positive disease. If no specimen is available, local pathology report documenting EBV positivity is acceptable. Appropriate immunophenotyping to confirm the diagnosis will be performed. In addition, in situ hybridization for EBV (LMP1, and/or EBER positivity) will be performed. All central morphologic analysis and immunohistochemical/insitu hybridization staining will be performed in the laboratory of Sherrie Perkins and Rodney Miles at the University of Utah. Donor Eligibility for LMPCTL Third Party Banking (Aim 2.1.2) Donor must be HIV negative. Donors must have adequate hematopoietic function defined as absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl, and platelet count &gt;50,000/mm3 and be EBV IgG seropositive. Donors will have peripheral blood collected for LMP specific CTL production. A minimum of 60 cc of peripheral blood x 2 for a total maximum amount of blood of 120cc, will be collected from the donor (subjects must be at least 12 kg or 24 pounds). (See Appendix B) For donors &lt;18 years a maximum of 3cc/kg blood will be taken in an 8 week period. For donors that are to undergo stem cell collection, the peripheral blood for LMP specific CTL production will be collected prior to the stem cell collection and without a specific day specification. Donor eligibility must meet criteria as per 21 CFR 1271. Currently receiving any investigational agents or have received any tumor vaccines within previous 4 weeks. Active acute grade IIIIV graftversushost disease. Severe refractory intercurrent infection other than EBV. Received alemtuzumab or other antiTcell antibody within 28 days. HIV seropositivity. Pregnancy (due to unknown effects of this therapy on a fetus) or lactation. Patients with PTLD post solid organ transplantation eligible for the COG PTLD LMP/CTL protocol.</criteria>
