	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at overall health status and how acute myeloid leukemia (AML) responds to a stem cell transplant when followed with cyclophosphamide. Some participants enrolling in this study may receive a transplant from a sibling, some may receive a transplant from a matched unrelated donor, and some may receive what is called a haploidentical transplant. A haploidentical stem cell transplant is a type of transplant that occurs when a person who needs a transplant cannot find a donor who exactly matches their tissue type (either among family members or through a matched unrelated donor). When no matched donor is available, half-matched related (haploidentical) donors may be used. Haploidentical donors are first degree relatives such as siblings, children, or parents. People who undergo a stem cell transplant can experience complications such as rejection of the stem cell transplant or severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when some of the cells from the donor attack the recipient's tissues, resulting in mild, moderate, or even life-threatening side effects to the recipient's skin, stomach, intestines, and liver. However, recent research has shown that receiving cyclophosphamide after stem cell transplant can improve the outcomes of the transplant, and that is the purpose of this study.</brief_summary>
