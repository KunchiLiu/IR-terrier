	<detailed_description>Aim: In this study the investigators aimed to compare the time of antagonism and intensity of effect of sugammadex which is used for antagonism of rocuronium on diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Methods: Included patients were divided into 2 groups: diabetic (n=21) and non-diabetic (n=20). All patients were premedicated. After arrival in the operating room, all patients were monitorised with Datex Ohmeda S/5 Anesthesia Machine and electrocardiography (DII derivation), hemodynamic variables, respiratory rate, and inspiratory sevoflurane concentrations were recorded. Neuromuscular monitoring system was used. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mcg/kg. After the loss of eyelid reflex the neuromuscular monitoring system automatically identified supramaximal stimulating currents and after that rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg was given. Train of four (TOF) stimulation with the supramaximal current were applied and by recording of second TOF value (TOF2) the patient was intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% O2 + 50% air and sevoflurane of 1-2 % concentration. TOF stimulation was applied and recorded every 20 seconds. Intraoperatively by return T2 rocuronium 0,15 mg/kg was given. T2i time was recorded as intubation time and T2d time was recorded as clinical effect time. At the end of the operation sugammadex 2 mg/kg was given. When TOF rate reached 0,9 patients were extubated and the time was recorded.</detailed_description>
