	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial examines how well different imaging biomarkers acquired using 3-Telsa magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods perform in determining treatment response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Compared to conventional imaging, multi-parametric 3-Tesla MRI offers the ability to quantitatively measure tissue structural, functional, cellular, and molecular properties, providing a more robust, clinically relevant method for assessing cancer response to therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must have signed an institutional review board (IRB)approved informed consent document Subjects must have verified unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diagnosed on the basis of clinical and imaging criteria Subjects must be classified as TNM stage I, II, or III; alternatively, subjects may be classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or B Subjects must be scheduled to undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) Subjects must have at least 1 lesion being targeted by TACE that is &gt; 2 cm in the longest crosssectional (axial plane) diameter Subjects must satisfy one of the following conditions pertaining to their eligibility to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT): HCC that is within Milan Criteria, i.e., TACE is indicated as a "bridge" to OLT (Group I); or HCC that is outside Milan Criteria, i.e., TACE is indicated as a means of "downstaging" into transplant eligibility (Group II) Subjects who have received prior treatment for HCC (prior surgical procedures not related to HCC are allowed) Subjects who have undergone prior radioembolization Subjects with a central venous line Subjects who have any type of biomedical implant, device and/or ferromagnetic material that can be displaced, perturbed, or otherwise malfunction due to mechanical, electronic, or magnetic means; these items may include: Metallic fragments or shrapnel (such as from war wounds) Cerebral aneurysm clips, biopsy marker clips Vascular access ports (as are used with intravenous chemotherapy) Cochlear implants, pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulators, and electronic infusion pumps **Implanted materials other than those verified as being rated "magnetic resonance [MR] Safe" or "MR Conditional 6" will not be allowed on study Creatinine &gt;= 1.5 times upper limit of normal Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min Subjects who are pregnant or nursing Subjects who have had past allergic or other adverse reactions to intravenous injection of MagnevistÂ® (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or other gadoliniumcontaining contrast agents Subjects who exhibit noticeable anxiety, claustrophobia, or vertigo when moved into the scanner Subjects incapable of giving informed written consent, for the following reasons: Inability to adhere to the experimental protocols for any reason Inability to communicate with the research team Mental disability, altered mental status, confusion, or psychiatric disorders Prisoners or others susceptible to coercion</criteria>
