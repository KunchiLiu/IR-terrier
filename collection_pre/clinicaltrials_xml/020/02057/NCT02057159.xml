	<brief_title>A Study of NeuroVax™, a Therapeutic TCR Peptide Vaccine for SPMS of Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives:The primary objective is to compare between treatment groups the cumulative number of new gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions on brain MRI at weeks 24, 32, 40 and 48 i n subjects with secondary progressive MS. Secondary objectives include additional MRI measurements, analyses of clinical relapses, measures of neurologic disability, immunologic evaluations, and safety. Study Design: Multi-center, randomized , double-blind, placebo-controlled , two arm parallel design study of NeuroVax™ vs. Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant ( I F A) placebo. Subject Population: 200 subjects with Secondary Progressive SPMS MS, with an EDSS score &gt;= 3.5 , and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enroll in this study. Subjects will be randomized equally to NeuroVax™ or I F A ,1 0 0 per arm .</detailed_description>
