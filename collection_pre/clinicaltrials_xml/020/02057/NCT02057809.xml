	<brief_summary>Developmental disability is a severe chronic disabled condition caused by mental or physical impairments. Children with developmental disabilities may face life-long difficulties in motor functioning, self-care, condition, communication, and independent living. They often receive rehabilitation services to promote daily functions and participation in home, school, and community lives. "Family-centered" service has been considered as "best practice" in pediatric rehabilitation. Therapists encourage children with developmental disabilities and their parents to participate in decision making and implementing process of intervention, and provide intervention plan that best fit their family needs. Research shows that for children with developmental disabilities, family-centered services can enhance children's development, decrease parenting stress, promote emotional wellness, and increase parental satisfaction to services. Though the "family-centered" concept has been considered as relevant in pediatric rehabilitation, there are still difficulties, as well as a lack of evidence regarding its implementation in practice. Reflecting the trend of family-centered medical care, the benefits of national health insurance in Taiwan for early intervention outpatient care will emphasize on family-centered intervention. The range of benefits may include communication with parents, parental education, consultation and instructions for home programs. Besides, outcomes of family-centered intervention will be treated as an important index for monitoring the quality of medical services. Given that there is a lack of investigation regarding the family-centered pediatric rehabilitation, the purposes of this one-year research project are to investigate the implementation of family-centered pediatric rehabilitation for children with developmental disabilities and to identify related influencing factors. This study will provide empirical evidence for family-centered services in Taiwan.</brief_summary>
