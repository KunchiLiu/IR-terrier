	<criteria>1. Adult patients (age over 21 years), undergoing short (4 or less consecutive vertebrae) lumbar or lumbosacral percutaneous/MIS spinal fixation surgery. 2. May include surgeries involving iliac screws, although these screws will not be included in the data analysis. 3. Primary fusion surgery 4. Patient capable of complying with study requirements 5. Signed informed consent by patient 1. Pregnancy 2. Revision surgery (prior laminectomy or discectomy is not excluded). 3. Infection or malignancy 4. Primary abnormalities of bones (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta) 5. Primary muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy 6. Neurologic diseases (e.g. CharcotMarie Tooth, GuillainBarre syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida or neurofibroma) 7. Spinal cord abnormalities with any neurologic symptoms or signs 8. Spinal cord lesions requiring neurosurgical interventions, such as hydromyelia 9. Paraplegia 10. Patients who have participated in a research study involving an investigational product in the 12 weeks prior to surgery 11. Patients requiring anterior release or instrumentation 12. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may influence the result of the study. 13. Patient cannot follow study protocol, for any reason 14. Patient cannot or will not sign informed consent</criteria>
