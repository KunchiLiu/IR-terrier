	<brief_summary>BI 691751 is currently being developed to inhibit growth and prevent rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and to consequently reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic disease. 1334.5 is a Pan Asian Phase 1 study to investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI 691751 in healthy Chinese and Japanese male volunteers.</brief_summary>

Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with GCP and local legislation. Exclusion criteria: 1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the investigator. Pulse rate outside the range of 5090 bpm or blood pressure outside the ranges of 90140 for systolic and 5090 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure if confirmed by repeat measurement. 2. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be of clinical relevance 3. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator 4. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 5. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the study drug 6. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), central neurological disorders or psychiatric disorders 7. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts 8. Relevant chronic or acute infections 9. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial medication or its excipients) 10. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (greater than 24 hours) within 30 days or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to study drug administration 11. Use of drugs that might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/QTc interval within 14 days prior to study drug administration 12. Participation in another trial with investigational drug administration within 60 days prior to administration of trial medication 13. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) 14. Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days 15. Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than30 g/day) 16. Drug abuse or positive drug screen 17. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication or intended during the trial) 18. Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial 19. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site 20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as repeated demonstration of a QTc interval greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding 21. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome) 22. Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance, because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study.</criteria>
