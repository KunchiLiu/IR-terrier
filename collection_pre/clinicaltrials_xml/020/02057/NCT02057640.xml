	<brief_summary>This study will look at the safety and tolerability of the new drug MLN9708 in combination with the existing drugs panobinostat and dexamethasone among patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also look at the response and clinical benefit of the treatment and the progression-free survival and overall survival of study participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN9708 (Ixazomib) in Combination With Panobinostat and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to define the tolerability and safety of MLN9708 (ixazomib) administered on a day 1,8,15 every 28 day schedule up to 4mg in combination with fixed doses of panobinostat and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess response and clinical benefit response rates according to international uniform response criteria and adapted EBMT criteria, respectively. And to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to provide written informed consent obtained prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed Patients must carry a diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma according to international myeloma working group criteria and have relapsed or refractory disease according to international uniform response criteria and must have previously received therapy with a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD™ Must have measurable disease defined as any of the following: Serum mspike &gt;= 1g/dL, 24 h urine mspike of at least 200mg/d, involved serum free light chains &gt;= 100mg/L with abnormal serum free light chain ratio, bone marrow plasma cells of at least 30% ECOG PS ≤ 2 No gastrointestinal condition, that in the opinion of the treating physician or the principal investigator significantly limits oral absorption No serious uncontrolled coexisting medical condition Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria: ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L without use of pegfilgrastim in the preceding 21 days and without nonpegylated GCSF or GMCSF within 7 days prior to study entry Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl (may be after transfusion of packed red blood cells or use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents) Platelets ≥ 70x 10^9/L without platelet transfusion 7 days prior to study entry AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum potassium ≥ LLN and serum magnesium ≥ LLN (electrolyte levels may be achieved with repletion or other supportive medications like potassium sparing diuretics) Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to CockroftGault formula Clinically euthyroid. Note: Patients are permitted to receive thyroid hormone supplements to treat underlying hypothyroidism. Baseline MUGA or ECHO must demonstrate LVEF ≥ 45% Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to start of study treatment Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy), have to either: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study treatment, OR Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatmentspecific pregnancy prevention program, if applicable, OR Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female patients have to fulfill one of the following: Be postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the Screening visit, OR Be surgically sterile, OR If of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment Oral contraceptives are generally metabolized by CYP3A4. Since the induction potential of panobinostat to induce CYP3A4 is unknown, patients who are using oral contraceptives as a method of contraception, and are sexually active, should use another effective contraceptive method, AND Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatmentspecific pregnancy prevention program, if applicable, OR Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) At least 7 days must have passed since the last treatment with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide, proteasome inhibitors, or low dose cyclophosphamide (up to 50mg daily), at least 21 days must have passed since the last treatment with investigational therapy and most conventional chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide above 50mg per dose, bendamustine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide; and at least 35 days since the last treatment with melphalan. Prior anticancer treatment with MLN9708 (ixazomib), HDAC, DAC, HSP90 inhibitors or valproic acid Prior participation in a randomized controlled study that included MLN9708 (ixazomib) in one of the treatment arms independent of whether assigned to MLN9708 (ixazomib) or not Patients who will need valproic acid for any medical condition during the study or within 5 days prior to first panobinostat treatment Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening period. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any one of the following: History or presence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

Patients with pacemakers are eligible if HR ≥ 50 bpm. Screening ECG with a QTcF &gt; 470 msec (QTcF=QT/3√RR). If potassium or magnesium blood levels are below normal limits, consider repeating ECG after correction of these electrolytes Right bundle branch block + left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block) Patients with myocardial infarction or unstable angina ≤ 6 months prior to starting study drug Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g., CHF NY Heart Association class III or IV , uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen) Impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the swallowing absorption of panobinostat and MLN9708 Patients with diarrhea &gt; CTCAE (version 4.03) grade 2 Patient has ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, or ≥ Grade 2 with pain on clinical examination during the screening period. Patients with known metastasis of malignant plasma cells to the central nervous system (if not suspected nonspecific testing is required) Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes or active or uncontrolled infection) including abnormal laboratory values, that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol Patients using medications that have a relative risk of prolonging the QT interval or inducing torsade de pointes if treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug. If an alternative medication that does not risk QT prolongation can safely be used in the opinion of the treating physician and the treatment is changed to that medication, the patient may be enrolled. Patients who have not passed the nadir of bone marrow suppression from previous antimyeloma therapy yet. If in doubt, serial CBCs with differential should be obtained.
