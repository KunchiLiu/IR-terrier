	<brief_summary>This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of autologous mesenchymal stem cell treatment to preserve insulin production and beta-cell mass in recently diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The hypothesis to be tested is that an increased number of circulating mesenchymal stem cells will provide immune modulatory properties, and thereby stop the immune process in islets causing progressive beta-cell death.</brief_summary>
