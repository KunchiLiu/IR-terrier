	<brief_summary>G (guanine nucleotide binding) proteins associating with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are key players in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes and are targets of pharmacotherapeutic inter-ventions. In addition, G proteins binding to GPCRs either directly or permissively determine the efficacy of lifestyle interventions and drugs aiming at weight management and diabetes treatment. Polymor-phisms of the fat mass and obesity-related protein (FTO) gene have been also well characterised and linked to energy intake, body fat mass as well as CVD risk and the susceptibility to weight-reducing interventions. Stratifying patients according to G protein and FTO-related genotyping may enable a more accurate prediction of individual disease courses and responses to therapeutic interventions in terms of safety and tolerability as well as efficacy. Although the objectives primarily refer to the analysis of G pro-tein and FTO-related genotypes, also other genes of potential relevance for the evolution of obesity and/ or diabetes and the response to lifestyle and pharmacological interventions may be analysed.</brief_summary>
