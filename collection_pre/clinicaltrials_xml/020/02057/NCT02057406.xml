	<brief_title>Omega 3 for Treatment of Depression in Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether (Hypothesis 1a) and how (Hypothesis 1b) the two omega 3 supplements will reduce depressive symptoms in heart failure (HF) patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder (MDD). Hypothesis 1a: Omega 3 supplements will improve depressive symptoms to a greater extent than placebo; Hypothesis 1b: Pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) will be superior to the EPA: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 2:1 in depression improvement.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult male and female patients, age greater than or equal to 21 years Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder determined by the DSMIVTR criteria with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score greater than or equal to 18* New York Heart Association Class greater than or equal to II For patients with with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40 %, abnormal brain natriuretic peptide and/or previous hospitalization due to heart failure is also required For inpatients, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores need to be remain at 18 or above for two weeks following the discharge Significant cognitive impairment, indicated as a MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) total score of 23 or lower History of alcohol or other drug dependence within the past 90 days Severe physical disability (visual, sensory, or motor) that may interfere with psychiatric assessment History or presence of psychoses, bipolar disorder, and/or severe personality disorders Lifethreatening comorbidity with the likelihood of 50% mortality in one year Active suicidal ideations Current use of antipsychotic medications or psychotropic medications except SSRIs and /or benzodiazepine Female patients who have a positive pregnancy test or are lactating. If female patients are of childbearing potential, they must use an effective and accepted means of contraception, such as oral contraceptives or a doublebarrier method (condom and diaphragm) to protect against pregnancy Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to omega 3 products; or use of omega 3 supplement for greater than or equal to 3 months at an equivalent or greater dose of the proposed study Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) within 90 days* Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Treatment with any investigational agent within 1 month before randomization Acute coronary syndrome, i.e., MI or unstable angina, revascularization procedure within the preceding month, or planned cardiac surgery within 3 months postrandomization The exclusion of patients who received ECT or TMS within 90 days is adopted from other depressionintervention trials and meant to eliminate confounders. It is believed that the effects of ECT on mood and cognition may last for a couple of months, and duration of TMS effects is poorly known and may be similar to the ECT intervention.</criteria>
