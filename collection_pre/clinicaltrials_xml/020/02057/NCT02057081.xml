	<brief_summary>This project addresses the rehabilitation and mental health needs of married combat Veterans post-deployed from Iraq or Afghanistan with a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) by providing psychoeducation, communication and problem solving skills in a multifamily group (MFG) setting. In this group, Veterans and spouses/cohabiting partners learn customized therapeutic strategies to help compensate for mTBI deficits and promote Veteran community integration, interpersonal and emotion regulation skills, and marital satisfaction. The effectiveness of the skills-based MFG will be compared to that of a health education group which offers a supportive environment and basic education without skills training through a randomized clinical trial. As there is currently no family-based intervention for Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans with mTBI offered within the VA spectrum of services, this intervention fills a crucial gap in healthcare for our newest Veterans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multifamily Group to Reduce Marital Conflict and Disability in Veterans With mTBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), an injury or concussion associated with brief loss of consciousness or altered mental state, has affected as many as 35% of soldiers wounded during recent military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Up to 30% of those injured report persistent somatic, emotional and cognitive post-concussive symptoms (PCS) which may adversely impact family life and community re-integration. Marital conflict and intimate partner violence, reported by 54% of OEF/OIF couples, and co-occurring mental health problems may exacerbate cognitive dysfunction and delay rehabilitation. A key contributor to marital conflict is a lack of knowledge about the Veteran's condition and the skills needed to help him compensate for common deficits in memory and planning which create challenges in household management. Despite a growing evidence base for couples treatment for PTSD, there is no established family-based treatment for OEF/OIF Veterans with mTBI, creating a critical research and services gap. The proposed research aims to fill this gap by evaluating a novel form of multi-family group treatment designed to improve community integration (CI) among married/cohabiting OEF/OIF Veterans with mTBI and/or significant posttraumatic stress (PTS) or combat-related stress (CS) by training spouse/partners to aid with rehabilitation and employing disability-adapted communication and problem-solving skills to reduce marital conflict and improve marital satisfaction. Veterans (N=150) with a positive Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) screen for mTBI sustained during the OEF/OIF era, confirmed by the VA Identification Clinical Interview and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score 19 or if they either meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD or have trauma- or CS of at least moderate severity, as defined by either a) PTSD Checklist (PCL) score &gt;34 or b) Customer Effort Score (CES) score of &gt;23, will be randomized to receive either: 1) Multifamily Group for TBI for Couples (MFG-mTBI-C), a psychoeducational, rehabilitation and skills-building intervention consisting of a 2-session multifamily educational workshop providing information about TBI and 12 bi-monthly multifamily group meetings providing skills training in problem-solving and communication related to cognitive/emotional deficits; or 2) 14 bi-monthly multifamily group sessions delivering health education without skills training. Both treatments will be preceded by 2-3 individual couples sessions. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment and 6 months post-treatment. Data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat analysis with paired comparisons between treatment groups on primary (Veteran CI, caregiver burden) and secondary (anger management, use of social supports) outcome variables using mixed effects regression models. It is hypothesized that: 1) Veterans treated with MFG-mTBI-C will show improved CI, anger management and use of social support, and spouse/partners will show reduced burden compared with those treated in the health education group; 2) that improvement in CI will be mediated by improvement in marital satisfaction and Veteran anger management and social support; 3) that Veterans with more intact cognitive functioning at baseline will show greater improvement in CI, anger management, social support and marital satisfaction. If efficacious, MFG-mTBI-C has the potential to assist Veterans with mTBI and their partners throughout the VA Health Care System.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible Veterans must have a diagnosis of mTBI in accordance with the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: injury or concussion associated with at least one of the following: brief (&lt; 30 minutes) loss of consciousness or altered state of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia for &lt; 24 hours following the injury, or they either meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD based on the MINI or have trauma or CS of at least moderate severity, as defined by either: a) PCL score &gt;34; or b) CES score of &gt;23. The TBI must be either blastrelated or attributable to another discrete event (e.g., fall, fight, injury) sustained during deployment in the OEF/OIF era. Postconcussive symptoms (e.g., sleep or memory problems, headache) must not be attributable to a subsequent injury or other preexisting or concurrent neurologic disorder: Eligible Veterans must also have a consenting, qualifying spouse/cohabiting partner and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine,2005) score 19. The 30item MoCA screens for impairment in specific areas of cognitive functioning deemed necessary for participation in a 90minute, structured group including attention and concentration, executive functions, language and conceptual thinking. We have specified a MoCA cutoff at the lower end of the range for mild cognitive dysfunction (19), in order to exclude Veterans with severe memory and/or other cognitive deficits, while admitting those with more mild deficits, as these represent our target population, i.e. Veterans with a history of mTBI. Inclusion criteriapartners: Legally married to or coresiding with Veteran for at least 6 months, with no plans for divorce or separation. Exclusion criteria for Veterans and partners are: a lifetime diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder with psychotic features) or active psychosis based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIVTR (SCIDL) (First et al., 2007). alcohol or drug abuse or dependence with past 6 months defined by a Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) (Selzer, 1975) 3, based on the recommended cutoff for TBI survivors (Gentilello et al.,1995) or a Drug Abuse Screening Test10 (DAST10) (Skinner, 1982) 3. "severe" interpartner violence as defined by the revised 20item Conflict Tactics Scale Short Form (CTS2S) (Straus &amp; Douglas, 2004). a suicide attempt within the past 6 months (aborted and interrupted attempts) as assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating scale (CSSRS). medical condition or life event (e.g., ongoing or pending legal action in another state) that would compromise participation. participation of either the caregiver or Veteran in another psychosocial intervention trial or couples' treatment six months prior to or during study or followup. Participation in individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are permitted: use of and starting/stopping these services will be tracked. Participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion as described above immediately after giving consent.</criteria>
