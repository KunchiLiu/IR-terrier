	<brief_title>Carbohydrates to Prevent Hypoglycaemia During Physical Activity in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research design and methods: 24 patients with type 1 diabetes participated in one experiment without physical activity and in three experiments with a 4 km, 60 min hike starting at 2 p.m., either administering 2 x 10 g or 2 x 20 g carbohydrates (muesli bars) before starting and at 30 min (during the hike). Plasma glucose was determined with a laboratory method and additional carbohydrates needed to treat hypoglycaemia between 2 and 8 p.m. were recorded.</detailed_description>
