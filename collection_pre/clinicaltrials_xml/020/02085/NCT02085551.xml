	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this retrospective case review study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra and Indigo Systems for mechanical thrombectomy in a cohort of patients with confirmed peripheral or visceral arterial occlusion or embolus. This is a retrospective, single arm, multi-center trial. Up to 100 patients at up to 10 centers will be enrolled. Angiographic assessment of vessel patency at immediate post-procedure as measured by TIMI scores and procedural serious adverse events are assessed and recorded.</brief_summary>
