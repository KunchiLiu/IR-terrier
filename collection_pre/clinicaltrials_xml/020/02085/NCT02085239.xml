	<brief_title>Comparison of Long vs. Short Acting Anesthesia for Improving Pain Management After Breast Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential role of a long acting anesthetic (ropivacaine) in providing an extended period of pain relief for patients undergoing ultrasound guided core biopsy of the breast. One group of patients will receive lidocaine alone for local anesthesia. A second group of patients will similarly receive lidocaine prior to tissue sampling, followed by infiltration of the biopsy area with ropivacaine. Our hypothesis is that patients who receive a long acting anesthetic (ropivacaine) along with the popular short acting anesthetic (lidocaine), will be pain free after the breast biopsy procedure for a longer period of time than the patients who only receive lidocaine (the short acting anesthetic). This will lessen the emotional and physical trauma associated with the procedure and give patients a better experience thereby improving patient care.</detailed_description>
