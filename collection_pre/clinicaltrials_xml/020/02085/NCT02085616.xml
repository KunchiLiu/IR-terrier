	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the high-intensity proactive service with the low-intensity reactive service at the Swedish National Tobacco Quitline (SNTQ). Our hypothesis was that the effectiveness is about 5% higher in proactive than in reactive service. The structured treatment protocol is a mixture of motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavior therapy, and pharmacological consultation.The standard process at the SNTQ is to offer the client a choice of callback (proactive service) or no callback (reactive service). In the present study clients were not offered a choice, but were randomized to proactive service on even dates and to reactive service on odd dates. Data are collected through postal questionnaires, one baseline and one follow-up after 12 months.</brief_summary>
