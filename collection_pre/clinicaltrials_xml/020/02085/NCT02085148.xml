	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine at which dose regorafenib is safe for children and adolescents and also to investigate the pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the drug) of regorafenib (study drug) in children and adolescents. Additional objectives of the study are: - To assess the tolerability of regorafenib in children and adolescents - To assess whether there is any tumor response to regorafenib - To assess the palatability and acceptability of regorafenib tablets in children</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Dose Finding Study in Children With Solid Tumors Recurrent or Refractory to Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Age: from 6 months to less than 18 years old Diagnosis: subjects must have had histologic verification of solid malignancy at original diagnosis. Subjects with recurrent or refractory solid tumors are eligible, including primary CNS tumors or subjects with known CNS metastases Subject's current disease state must be one for which there is no known effective therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life. Effective therapy may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or any combination of these modalities. Subjects must have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. For neuroblastoma subjects with osteomedullary disease, the SIOPEN (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma Group) score will be used. Bone scans (if clinically indicated) should be obtained ≤ 12 weeks prior to the start of treatment. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks from the time of signing informed consent/assent Performance level: Karnofsky ≥ 70% for subjects &gt; 12 years of age and Lansky ≥ 70% for subjects ≤ 12 years of age. Note the performance level should not be considered reduced by limitations to movement or play caused by motor paresis or paralysis due to disease. Any neurological deficits in subjects must have been stable for a minimum of 1 week prior to first dose of study treatment. Adequate renal, hepatic and hematologic function Prior treatment with regorafenib. Subjects permanently withdrawn from study participation will not be allowed to reenter the study. Other anticancer treatment, including any investigational new drugs within 28 days or 5 drug halflives (if drug halflife in subjects is known), whichever is shorter (or within 6 weeks for mitomycin C), before start of study treatment Subjects with uncontrolled baseline hypertension higher than Grade 1 NCICTCAE v.4.0 (recurrent or persistent [≥24 hours] blood pressure [BP] &gt;ULN: BP &gt; the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender measured) Unresolved toxicity higher than NCICTCAE v. 4.0 Grade 1 attributed to any prior therapy/procedure (excluding alopecia, chemotherapyinduced ototoxicity, Grade 2 chemotherapyinduced neuropathy and, as per above eligibility criteria, anemia with hemoglobin ≥ 8 mg/dL and ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10 9/L ). Any other malignant disease treated prior to the study</criteria>
