	<brief_summary>Since the recommendations of the French Society of Digestive Surgery 2010, cholecystectomy can be performed as outpatient surgery. This approach is difficult in many centers because of post operative pain and nausea/vomiting. The use of postoperative morphine may be responsible for the state of nausea. The use of ropivacaine allows a reduction of the morphine consumption and thus may allow the patient to have their surgery as an outpatient. Currently, ropivacaine is used randomly during the investigators surgeries. Initially, it was used for the infiltration holes trocar. In recent years, ropivacaine is used for the reduction of intra-abdominal postoperative pain. Its use is made of parietal surgery ( hernia ) in cholecystectomy and colonic surgery. This mode of administration is allowed to view the many publications made on this subject. Its use in the investigators daily surgery, however, has not been evaluated in ambulatory surgery.</brief_summary>
