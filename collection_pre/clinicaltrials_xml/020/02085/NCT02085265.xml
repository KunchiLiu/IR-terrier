	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to conduct a proof of concept study in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease who have mild to moderate hypertension, in order to determine if there is less global brain atrophy over one year, as measured by ventricular enlargement as a primary outcome measure, when patients are randomized to treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker compared to an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACEI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telmisartan vs. Perindopril in Hypertensive Mild-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a simple validated measure of brain atrophy as a surrogate marker in a repurposing effort that could recast an antihypertensive medication as a cognitive enhancer /neuroprotective agent and possibly as a drug of choice for Alzheimer patients and patients at risk for AD. If the proof of concept result is positive, a larger study would be warranted with potential practice-changing impact.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Previously established clinical diagnosis of probable AD dementia by the new McKhann criteria63 2. Previous brain MRI or CT scan within the last 2 years to rule out exclusionary pathology, such as cortical stroke, tumour, subdural hematomas, malformations, etc. 3. Age 55 years or older 4. Established diagnosis of hypertension and on at least one hypertensive medication 5. Standardized Mini Mental State Examination (SMMSE) score of 1627 at screening visit 6. Sufficient hearing and vision to participate in testing as per investigator's judgement 7. Sufficient fluency in English to be able to complete language and other cognitive tests 8. At least 8 years of education 9. A study partner who in the opinion of the study investigator has regular interaction with the patient, can be present for all clinic visits, can provide a collateral history and can assist in compliance with study procedures 10. Stable dose of a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) and/or memantine for at least 3 months prior to the randomization visit 11. HbA1C &lt;8.5%. Patients with stable type II diabetes are eligible for the study if the following conditions are met: there have been no severe hypoglycemic events requiring third party intervention (e.g. emergency department visit) within 6 months, and medication therapy has been stable for at least 3 months and is limited to oral antidiabetic agents and/or basal insulin therapy no more than once per day 12. Patients on medications for vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, cholesterol) must be on a stable dose for ≥3 months prior to randomization. Exclusion criteria 1. Intolerance, or any contraindications, to study medications 2. Familial autosomal dominant form of Alzheimer's disease 3. Creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30ml/min 4. Serum potassium &gt; 5.5 mEq/L 5. ALT &gt; the upper limit of normal (ULN) 6. History of angioedema 7. Comorbid acute or chronic conditions (including type I diabetes mellitus, stroke, other neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders, and severe or unstable medical conditions) that could confound assessments or would, in the judgment of the investigator, make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study 8. Severe periventricular white matter disease (Fazekas score 3), cortical infarction, lacunar infarcts &lt;1.5 cm diameter in basal ganglia or thalamus or &gt;2 lacunar infarcts (&lt;1.5cm diameter) elsewhere on screening MRI 9. Inability to perform the study procedures, including claustrophobia or contraindications for MRI 10. Currently on or has taken an angiotensin receptor blocker within 12 months of randomization visit 11. Resides in a nursing home (participants who reside in retirement homes may be included if they have a study partner who meets inclusion criterion #9) 12. Current major depression by clinical history or score greater than 18 on the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia 13. Documented potential cardiac source of brain infarction such as mechanical valve or any type of atrial fibrillation 14. Regular use of psychotropic medications, other than a shortacting benzodiazepine for sleep or nonanticholinergic antidepressants (stable dose for 3 months at time of randomization); exceptions (e.g. for antipsychotic medication) may be permitted on a casebycase basis, upon consultation with Dr. Krista Lanctôt</criteria>
