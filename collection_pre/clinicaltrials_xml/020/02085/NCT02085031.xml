	<brief_summary>- To date, Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy transabdominal extracorporeally by circular stapler was the most common used method during laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, even though it was not totally laparoscopic surgery in which intracorporeal anastomosis should be performed. - To gain potential clinical benefits from a smaller length of minilaparotomy and an easier anastomosis technique than extracorporeal anastomosis, intracorporeal Roux-en-Y anastomosis using a transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™) during totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy was adopted by experienced surgeons recently. - However, the safety of intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy using a transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™) has not yet been evaluated. Thus, the study comparing the safety of intracorporeal versus extracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy by circular stapler based on a well designed randomized controlled trial is needed.</brief_summary>
