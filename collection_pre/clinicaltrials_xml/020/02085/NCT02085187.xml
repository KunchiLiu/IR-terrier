	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease that can have a major impact on the lives of individuals. An essential element in the treatment of COPD is rehabilitation of which supervised training is an important part. However, not all individuals with severe COPD can participate in the rehabilitation provided by hospitals and municipal training centres due to distance to the training venues and transportation difficulties. The aim of the feasibility study was to evaluate an individualised home based training and counselling programme via video conference to patients with severe COPD after hospitalization with regard to safety, clinical outcomes, patients' perception, organisational aspects and economic aspects.</brief_summary>
