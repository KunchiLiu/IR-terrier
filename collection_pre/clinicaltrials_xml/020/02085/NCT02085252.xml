	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess two treatment strategies (leuprorelin treatment and active surveillance without androgen deprivation) for indolent prostate cancer and to compare their therapeutic benefit for management of patients with low-risk, localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Effect of Enantone LP 11.25 mg (Leuprorelin) on the Histological Progression of Indolent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called leuprorelin. Leuprorelin is being tested to treat people who have prostate cancer. Study assessments will include adverse events, prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and prostate biopsies. The study will enroll approximately 120 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to a treatment group that will receive leuprorelin 11.25 mg (as one injection) or to an untreated observation group. Patients in the leuprorelin group will also receive bicalutamide 50 mg, a non-steroidal antiandrogen, once daily for 15 days to prevent a flare-up. This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this study is 12 months. After the screening visit, participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.</detailed_description>
