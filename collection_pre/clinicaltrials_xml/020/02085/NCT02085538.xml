	<brief_summary>Since the amount of palbociclib eliminated in urine is 6.9%, renal impairment is not expected to have much impact on palbociclib. However, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance recommends a study in subjects with renal impairment when the drug is likely to be used in patients with impaired renal function. Palbociclib is intended for chronic use in cancer patients who may have some degree of impaired renal function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Personally signed and dated informed consent document. Renal function calculated by the Cockcroft Gault equation: normal function (CLcr &gt;=90 mL/min), mild: CLcr &gt;=60 mL/min and &lt;90 mL/min, moderate: CLcr &gt;=30 mL/min and &lt;60 mL/min, severe: CLcr &lt;30 mL/min but not requiring hemodialysis. Subjects with normal renal function matched for age, weight, gender and race to subjects in impaired renal function groups. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption. Renal allograft recipients.</criteria>
