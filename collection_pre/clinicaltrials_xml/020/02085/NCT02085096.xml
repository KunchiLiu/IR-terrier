	<detailed_description>Problem-solving therapy programs have been shown to be effective among parents of children diagnosed with cancer. Efforts have been made to apply this same strategy to spouses/significant others of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of problem-solving therapy on the spouses of prostate cancer patients. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group which received problem-solving therapy, or to a control group which relied on their standard methods of coping (e.g. their normal therapist, family and friends). Participants completed baseline surveys regarding their distress and coping prior to randomization. They then completed these surveys again 2 months and 6 months after participation to determine lasting effects of the intervention.</detailed_description>
