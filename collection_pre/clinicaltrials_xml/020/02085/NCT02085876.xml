	<brief_summary>This is a single centre prospective open-label, non-randomised pilot study whose aim is to identify MRI parameters to better evaluate inflammation and liver fibrosis and thus, in the near future, to avoid the need for liver biopsy. To achieve this: - The MRI study will be completed by adding two sequences: Measurement of T1 and multiecho T2*. The other data will be extracted from usual sequences. - Part of the histological samples will be used for the weighted levels of fat and iron, and for the lipidomic study. - Usual blood samples will be completed by samples for the serum library</brief_summary>
