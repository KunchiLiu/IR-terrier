	<brief_summary>A retrospective chart review of patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for oropharynx cancer was performed to compare clinical data for patients treated prior to the initiation of the NP clinic with those subsequently seen weekly in the NP clinic. The variables studied included; rate of hospitalization, dose completion and dose reductions. The results revealed an overall improvement in all variables for those patients seen in the weekly NP clinic. To further analyze this data a randomized, prospective study is proposed to validate the findings of the retrospective study. It is predicted that a weekly NP led clinic will decrease costly hospitalizations, increase patient treatment completion and improve overall patient quality of life and satisfaction.</brief_summary>
