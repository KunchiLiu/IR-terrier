	<brief_title>Analysis of Angiogenic Factor Levels in Eyes With Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, case-control study included 50 patients(50eyes) with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 50 patient with nondiabetic retinopathy or cataract. Aqueous humor was taken before injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent or pars plana vitrectomy for other retinal disease. Angiogenic and non-angiogenic proteins were analyzed.</detailed_description>
