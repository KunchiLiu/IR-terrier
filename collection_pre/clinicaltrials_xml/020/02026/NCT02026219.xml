	<brief_summary>Ticagrelor is a non-thienophyridine, direct P2Y12 blocker that is more potent than clopidogrel and is associated with less interindividual variability. In the PLATO trial, it was found to be superior to clopidogrel with respect to cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality without increasing the risk of bleedings. More potent and reversible receptor bindings are possible explanation for the superior outcomes. Beside the potent effect on inhibition of antiplatelet function, ticagrelor has previously been demonstrated to increase adenosine levels by inhibiting adenosine re-uptake in tissue level and can induce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from human red cells, which both stimulate vasodilation of in red blood cells.</brief_summary>
