	<brief_summary>The FloRite™ device is a disposable urine flow meter, indicated for use in a home setting. The device provides Urofowmetry measurements, similar to clinic's measurements. Clinic-based uroflowmetry has some flaws; the setting is artificial and often it is difficult to void at the desired moment. Moreover, a single measurement of the voided parameters is a poor representative of the patient condition due to high variability of the measured parameters. Performing multiple Urofowmetry measurements provides representative and more accurate results, in a more patient-friendly, cost effective method.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The FloRite™ product is a disposable urine flow meter. The patient needs to urinate into the device and at the end of urination the patient needs to disconnect a USB drive from the device, dispose the device's container and keep the USB drive that contains the test data. Primary objectives: • Usability evaluation of the FloRite™ system with LUTS patients. Secondary objectives: - Comparison of uroflowmetric parameters obtained using home disposable digital uroflowmetry device with standard clinic-based uroflowmetry. - Evaluation of diurnal variations in uroflowmetric parameters obtained using home uroflowmetry Primary outcome measures • Successful use of FloRite™ system in LUTS patients, defined as: - Successful unpacking and installation - Successful understanding of the user manual - Ability of the patients to operate the device as define by a successful test completion and data transmission - Successful retrieval of the DOK - Absence of: - Device dropping down - Urination outside the container - Urination on the electronic unit Secondary outcome measures: • Comparison of uroflowmetric parameters as measured by FloRite™ system and standard clinical uroflowmetry as defined by [Time Frame: Days 0, 1, 6 and 7]: - Qmax - Max Flow Rate • Evaluation of diurnal variations in uroflowmetric parameters obtained using home uroflowmetry as defined by [Time Frame: Days 1, 6]: - Urine flow graph - Tdelay - Delay time - T100 - Voiding Time - TQ - Flow Time - Tqmax - Time to max Flow - Qmax - Max Flow Rate - Qave - Average Flow Rate - Vcomp - Voided Volume Up to 30 completed patients Inclusion criteria - LUTS patients - Male 18&lt;Age &lt;65 - Ability to speak, read and understand instructions - Patient willing to sign an Informed Consent Exclusion criteria - Mentally disabled patients - Infectious diseases - Catheterized patients - Buried penis due to obesity The patients will be consented if found eligible. Prospective, self- controlled, interventional, clinical study On the baseline visit, after eligibility is confirmed and after consenting the patients, the following steps will be taken: - Standard clinical uroflowmetry - Training how to use the system - Unpacking and setting up the device (supervised by an observer) The following day, the patient will perform home test with the FloRite™ system. Similar test will be conducted on Day 6 of the study. The test results will be transferred either by e- mailing the data stored on the DOK or by bringing the DOK itself to the clinic on the 7th day. On Day 7 of the study, the patients will be asked to return to the clinic for standard clinical uroflowmetry. In addition, the patient will fill a satisfaction questionnaire. All the measurements must be standard and performed at around the same time.</detailed_description>
