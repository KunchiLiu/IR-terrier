	<brief_summary>The study hypothesized that a relative low oxygen concentration (40%) supplemental would be advantageous to protect the pulmonary function of patients, comparied with conventional high oxygen concentration (80%). Therefore we raise this prospective randomized controlled research.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Optimal Intraoperative Supplemental Oxygen Administration During Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy in Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University will be enrolled and be randomizedly assigned to low oxygen concentration (40%) supplemental or high oxygen concentration(80%) supplemental group. Intra-operative and post-operative pressure of Oxygen in Arterial Blood will be examined, and the surgical outcome will be recorded in the two groups.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Clinical Staged T13N0M0 esophageal cancer patients or: patients who were restaged as T13N0M0 esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. 2. Patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy(Thoracolaparoscopic McKeown procedure). 1. Patients with previous thoracic surgery history. 2. Patients with severe Comorbidity. 3.
