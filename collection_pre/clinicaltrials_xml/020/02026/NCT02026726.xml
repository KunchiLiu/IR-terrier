	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study is to show whether a standard oral steroid dose pack can be used as a screening tool to assess the effectiveness of a subsequent epidural steroid injection (ESI). If an oral steroid does not give a patient significant temporary relief of pain from a herniated lumbar disc then an epidural steroid injection will not either. Therefore the risk and expense associated from the interventional pain management procedure for those patients could be avoided and other treatment modalities pursued.</brief_summary>
