	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of Hydroxychloroquine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxychloroquine is a medicine that has been used for a long time to treat patients with malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other conditions. It is closely related to chloroquine but with a better side effect profile for long term use. In treating these conditions it was discovered to have some beneficial properties like lowering cholesterol and lowering sugar in the blood of those who have diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. In animal studies, we have discovered that chloroquine appears to decrease glucose, lower blood pressure and decrease atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). This collection of problems commonly occurs in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, which affects over 20% and 7% of adults in Western countries respectively. We have recently looked at the effects of chloroquine on the metabolic syndrome in humans which showed that small doses given for a short period of time would reduce insulin resistance in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Several population studies have shown similar effects with hydroxychloroquine. Since hydroxychloroquine is similar to chloroquine, we thus expect similar effects on blood glucose, blood pressure and blood cholesterol in type 2 diabetes. This offers a unique opportunity to develop a novel approach for lowering blood pressure, lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), and glucose in people at risk for heart disease</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects between the age of 18 and 75, either gender, any ethnic group Subjects must have type 2 diabetes and the following: A1c of 6.59.0% Treated with at least 1000 mg of metformin daily with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase4(DPP4)inhibitor, a sulfonylurea (glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride),bromocriptine or colesevelam. Subjects should have a BMI &gt;27 Prior treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as follows: 1. any exposure in the past 2 years, 2. &gt;30 days of therapy if exposure was between 2 and 5 years ago, 3. &gt;90 days of therapy if exposure was between 5 and 10 years ago, 4. &gt;6 months of therapy if exposure was 10 to 20 years ago, 5. &gt;1 year of therapy if exposure was 20 to 30 years ago, 6. No limit if last exposure was &gt;30 years ago, e.g. during the Vietnam conflict.

Seizure disorder History of psoriasis Hematologic disorders, including anemia (WHO criteria for anemia:hemoglobin &lt;13g/dL in men and &lt;12 g/dL in women) Current malignancy or active treatment for recurrence prevention,e.g. tamoxifen. Cancer considered to be cured, either as a result of surgery or other treatment is not exclusionary. Asthma requiring daily beta agonist therapy or intermittent oral steroids is exclusionary. Inhaled steroids are acceptable. Obstructive sleep apnea will be allowed if continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) or other therapy has been stable for 6 months. Other active respiratory diseases are excluded.

Treatment with any other medication for psychiatric illness, unless on a stable dose for 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients with unstable psychiatric disorders are excluded per the decision of the study MD regardless of medication history.
