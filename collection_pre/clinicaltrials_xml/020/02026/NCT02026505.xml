	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how a drug commonly used to treat multiple myeloma can affect the heart. In this study, the investigators will learn whether a drug called how a drug (called bortezomib, or Velcade) receive for multiple myeloma affects the heart. Bortezomib is part of the standard treatment and its effects on multiple myeloma is not being studied here. The investigators want to learn whether damage occurs to the heart after taking bortezomib for multiple myeloma, whether it is reversible, and we can predict damage to the heart before it occurs.</brief_summary>
