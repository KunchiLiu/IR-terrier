	<brief_title>Analgesic Effect of Intra-articular Dexamethasone and Dexamethasone Added to Bupivacaine in Interscalene Brachial Plexus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>shoulder surgery can be very painful and interscalene brachial plexus block is the gold standard in the management of acute pain after shoulder surgery. various local anaesthetic mixtures can be used to prolong local anaesthesia duration and epinephrine , opioids and dexamethasone are frequently used for this purpose. dexamethasone has also been found the prolong the duration of lidocaine axillary blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia. intraarticular administration of medicines can be used for management of joint pain and opioids , local anaesthetics and dexamethasone are used for this purpose.In addition, there are no studies available to compare the different treatment methods used in clinical practice directly.</detailed_description>
