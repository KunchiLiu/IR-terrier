	<brief_summary>The incidence of sudden hearing loss is rising obviously resent year, Glucocorticoids have obtained obvious effect in the treatment of sudden deafness. Postauricular hypodermic injection is the latest findings in clinical work and a new noninvasive way of administration which is gradually expanding research. The aim of this experiment is to verify and explore the efficacy and safety of the postauricular injection treatment with different doses of Glucocorticoids.</brief_summary>
