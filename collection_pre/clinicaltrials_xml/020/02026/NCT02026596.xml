	<brief_summary>Subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH) is a cause of long-term disability and death. Annually about 1000 people in Finland suffer from SAH, their average age being under 50 years. SAH has a mortality rate of 12 % acutely and 40 % of patients die within a month from admission to hospital. In addition, 30 % of the surviving patients remain with neurological deficits. Most survivors of the primary insult suffer from secondary injury during the first 2-3 weeks from the insult. Despite the advances in neurosurgical and -radiological techniques and intensive care, the mortality and morbidity rates in SAH have not changed in recent years. There is still only limited understanding of the mechanisms of secondary insults causing brain injury after SAH. In this study the investigators are aiming to clarify the timescale and mechanisms contributing to the secondary insults. The investigators also explore usability of novel biomarkers to guide treatment of the patients suffering from SAH.</brief_summary>
