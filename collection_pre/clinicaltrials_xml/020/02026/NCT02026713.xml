	<brief_summary>All consecutive patients undergone PTCA in the period between July 2013 and December 2013 are eligible to be enrolled. Study population are divided in : Group 1: smokers on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA (100 mg once a day) and Prasugrel (10 mg die); Group 2: smokers on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA(100 mg once a day) and Ticagrelor (90 mg twice a day); Control group: smokers on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA(100 mg once a day) and Clopidogrel (75 mg once a day). Platelet function is evaluated using a validated method: the VerifyNow System (Accumetrics Inc., San Diego, CA), which is a point-of-care turbidimetry-based optical detection system that measures platelet-induced aggregation. These value are measured Platelet function, measured with the VerifyNow P2Y12. All patients on chronic dual antiplatelet therapy (&gt;1 month) quit smoking for a 2 weeks period. Therefore PRU values are obtained at baseline (at the enrollment time) and after 2 weeks after smoking cessation. Platelet reactivity are expressed in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). PRU values &gt;240 are suggestive of high platelet reactivity. Primary outcomes: P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) at baseline and two weeks after quitting smoking.</brief_summary>
