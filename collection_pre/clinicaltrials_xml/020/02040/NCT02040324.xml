	<brief_summary>We measure in this study lung function of 100 patients immediately after major lower abdominal surgery. We compare lung function, when either endotracheal intubation, or laryngeal masks are used for airway protection during surgery. The hypothesis is that the use of laryngeal masks is associated with less impairment of lung function in the immediate postoperative phase.</brief_summary>
