	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to determine the performance of a salivary hormone competitive immunoassay for monitoring patient estrogen and progesterone levels during treatment for infertility using controlled ovarian stimulation (COH) and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Specifically, inter- and intra-assay precision, correlation with serum measurements (the gold-standard), and user satisfaction will be determined. Ultimately, the potential applicability and reliability of salivary steroid monitoring in IVF cycles will be assessed.</detailed_description>
