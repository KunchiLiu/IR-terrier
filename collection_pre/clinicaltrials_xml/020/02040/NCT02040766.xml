	<criteria>Written informed consent Asthma diagnosis: The patient has a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the National Institute of Health (NIH). The asthma diagnosis has been present for a minimum of 3 months and has been stable (defined as no exacerbations and no changes in medication) for at least 30 days before screening visit Severity of disease: The patient has persistent asthma, with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 40% to 90% of the value predicted for age, height, and sex at screening visit (SV) Current asthma therapy: The patient is currently being treated with 1 of the following: 1) a stable daily dosage of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in the range of 88176 mcg/day of fluticasone propionate (or equivalent) for a minimum of 4 weeks (28 days) before screening visit 2) a stable daily dosage of noncorticosteroid therapy 3) a daily dose of ICS plus a longacting beta2agonist (LABA) (at a dose less than or equivalent to fluticasone propionate 100 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily) Reversibility of disease: The patient has demonstrated at least 12% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes after 24 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) MDI (90 mcg exactuator) or equivalent at screening visit or on retesting. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information The patient has a history of lifethreatening asthma, defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures. The patient is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the study period or for 30 days after the patient's last studyrelated visit (for eligible patients only, if applicable). Any patient becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the study drug or rescue medication formulation. The patient has used tobacco products within the past year (eg, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, or pipe tobacco, as applicable). The patient has had an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 30 days before screening visit, or has had any hospitalization for asthma within 2 months before screening visit. The patient has historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease. Significant disease is defined as any disease that in the medical judgment of the investigator would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or that could affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the study. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
