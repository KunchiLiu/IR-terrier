	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effectiveness of Pralidoxime, a drug used for treatment of pesticide poisoning (Organophosphorous poisonings)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is the WHO Recommended Dose of Pralidoxime Effective in the Treatment of Organophosphorus Poisoning?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study was designed to critically analyze the role of pralidoxime in patients with moderate to severe poisoning by dividing them into two comparable groups in all aspects and using WHO recommended dose of pralidoxime (30mg/kg bolus I.V over 20 min followed by 8mg/kg/hr continuous infusion). This dose and continuous infusion protocol is more likely to maintain adequate blood concentrations of pralidoxime throughout 24 hours and thus would avoid any failures in effectiveness of pralidoxime because of inconsistent blood levels.</detailed_description>
