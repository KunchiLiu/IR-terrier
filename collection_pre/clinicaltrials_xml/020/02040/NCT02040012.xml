	<brief_summary>Objectives: Primary Objectives - To investigate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of AZP- 531 in healthy volunteers. - To investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of AZP-531 in overweight/obese volunteers. - To investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of AZP-531 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary Objectives • To determine the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZP-531 after single and multiple doses. Exploratory Objectives • To obtain exploratory data on the effects of AZP-531 on the pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of blood glucose, interstitial glucose, insulin, and plasma acylated ghrelin (AG) and unacylated ghrelin (UAG)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part A: Healthy male volunteers, aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive) with a body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 28 kg/m2 (inclusive). Part B: Female (of nonchildbearing potential) and male overweight/obese volunteers, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with a BMI of 28 to 38 kg/m2 (inclusive). Part C: Female (of nonchildbearing potential) and male patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 3 months Part A: Females and male volunteers who smoke and/or use other nicotine products within 6 months of screening are excluded. Part B: Current or exsmokers with a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year) and any clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation or urinalysis results at screening or on admission, as judged by the Investigator. Part C: Current or exsmokers with a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year), any clinically significant abnormalities other than those attributed to type 2 diabetes mellitus in physical examination, ECG, clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation or urinalysis results at screening or on admission, as judged by the Investigator, and estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;40 mL*min1*1.73m2 calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.</criteria>
