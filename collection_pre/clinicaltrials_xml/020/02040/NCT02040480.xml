	<criteria>Provided signed written informed consent Healthy Male or female between 18 and 40 years of age inclusive, at the time the informed consent is obtained. Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) of &gt;=18 and &lt;= 32 kg/meter square (m^2). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of (A) Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (B) Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at Screening and prior to dosing, AND: agrees to use one of the acceptable contraception methods Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods. Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xupper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Based on single or averaged QT interval corrected (QTc) values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period: QTcB &lt;450 millisecond (msec); or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. Able to swallow and retain orally administered study treatment and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach and/or bowels. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of gastroesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, GI surgery that could affect motility. History of atrial arrhythmias History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent to 10 grams (g) of alcohol: 270 mL of full strength beer (4.8%), 375 mL of mid strength beer (3.5%), 470 mL of light beer (2.7%), 250 mL premix full strength spirit (5%), 100mL of wine (13.5%) and 30 mL of spirit (40%). History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of Screening. Smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. A positive drug/alcohol screen at Screening or upon checkin to the clinic on Day 1 of each Dosing Period. A positive test for human immuno virus (HIV) antibody. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at Screening or prior to dosing. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Lactating females. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric disorder or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures. Any prohibited medications or recent consumption of citrus products.</criteria>
