	<brief_summary>Thoracic surgery correlates with significant pain in postoperative period. In order to alleviate the pain various combinations of pharmaceuticals and administration methods are employed. So as to reduce the extent of surgical trauma and, consequently, correlated pain various operation techniques are used. In traditional thoracotomy epidural anesthesia remains a golden standard. Epidural anesthesia however demands high skills to be performed correctly and presents an increased risk of grave complications. In videothoracoscopic (VATS) operations paravertebral blockade can be employed, yet there is no certainty if its efficacy after lung lobectomy. We therefore designed a prospective, randomized, parallel group, single site study to test the hypothesis, that continuous paravertebral blockade is as efficient in postoperative pain reduction as continuous epidural blockade and possesses a higher safety profile.</brief_summary>
