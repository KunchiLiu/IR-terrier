	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire differences between patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes or healthy controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequencing T-cells in Type I Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a systems biology approach by combining high-throughput sequencing, cytometry, gene expression, transcriptome profiling, HLA typing, single cell analysis, and TCR affinity assays, the investigators will define a set of immune metrics for the prediction or early diagnosis of disease that is superior to the current examination of auto-antibodies, which is a fairly late stage in the disease development. This can also be used to guide therapy in advanced disease.</detailed_description>
