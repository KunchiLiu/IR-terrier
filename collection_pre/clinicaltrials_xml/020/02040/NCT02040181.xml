	<brief_summary>It's important to dose according to renal function in who has impaired kidney function. There are two common methods estimating renal function: one is creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation; another is glomerular filtration rate estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. The previous study (not published) showed that CG underestimated 24 hour measured urine creatinine clearance by our team. The difference may be due to ethnicity. Thus we want to establish a estimated creatinine clearance equation fitting in Taiwanese. Besides, there are lots of studies discussing difference between CG and MDRD. We have found that MDRD overestimated CG in patients who were older or thin. Therefore, we want to analysis which characteristics of patients the difference are largest or smallest.</brief_summary>
