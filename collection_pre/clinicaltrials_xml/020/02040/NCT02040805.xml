	<brief_summary>This study proposes to compare two forms of treatment for Hoarding Disorder (HD), a common and impairing neuropsychiatric syndrome that has a profound impact on the lives and functioning of individuals, families, and society. Specifically, we will compare a novel community-based group treatment led by individuals from the community who are not mental health professionals to the current standard of care treatment for Hoarding Disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted by psychologists in a group setting. We hypothesized that both treatment types will be similarly effective in reducing hoarding severity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design for this proposal is a stratified, randomized, single-blind, non- inferiority trial comparing the current standard of care for treatment of Hoarding Disorder (HD), Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (G-CBT), to an innovative and promising community-based treatment, Group Buried in Treasures (G-BiT). Participants will be stratified by gender, psychiatric status (high vs. low burden of psychiatric symptoms) and insurance status (insured vs. under- or un-insured) so that equal numbers of individuals with each of these characteristics are randomized to each treatment arm. They will then be randomly assigned (randomized) to either G-CBT or G-BiT. Participants will know which treatment group they are assigned to, but those members of the research team who are conducting clinical or neuropsychological assessments or analyzing the data will not; they will be blinded to participant group assignment, and group leaders will be blinded to the psychiatric status, neurocognitive status, insurance status, etc, of participants. The study is a non-inferiority trial, that is, the hypothesis to be tested is that G-BiT is as effective, or no less effective, than G-CBT. We chose a non-inferiority design because we have no reason to believe G-BiT is better than G-CBT and our preliminary data, as well as outcomes previously reported for G- CBT and G-BiT, suggest that these treatments may have similar efficacies.</detailed_description>
