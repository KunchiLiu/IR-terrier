	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate at a dosage of 80 or 160 mcg/day delivered via a Breath-Actuated Inhaler (BAI); or a matching BAI placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio after a 14- to 21-day run-in period. Participants and investigators will remain blinded to randomized treatment assignment during the study. The study consists of 3 periods: - run-in period: Screening visit (SV) to randomization visit (RV), 14-21 days (2-3 weeks) prior to study start - double-blind treatment period: RV through the final treatment visit, 85±3 days or 12 weeks after study start. - follow-up period: a follow-up visit/telephone call, 7±3 days after the treatment period ends.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Severity of Disease: The patient has persistent asthma, with an forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 40%85% of the value predicted for age, height, sex, and race as per the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reference values at screening visit (SV) (Hankinson et al 1999). Current asthma therapy: The patient is currently being treated with 1 of the following: 1) inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) at a stable daily dose of less than or equal to 220 mcg/day fluticasone propionate via metered dose inhaler (MDI) or equivalent for a minimum of 4 weeks (28 days) before screening visit, or 2) a stable daily dosage of noncorticosteroid therapy, including leukotriene modifiers, theophylline, chromones, or shortacting beta2 agonists (SABAs) alone or in combination for a minimum of 4 weeks (28 days) before screening visit (SV). Reversibility of disease: The patient has demonstrated at least 15% and at least 200 mL increase from baseline FEV1 (patients age 18 and older) within 30 minutes after 24 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) MDI (90 mcg exactuator) or equivalent at SV or on retesting. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information The patient has a history of lifethreatening asthma, defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures. The patient is a pregnant or lactating female or plans to become pregnant. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the study drug or rescue medication formulation. The patient currently smokes or has a smoking history of 10 packyears or more (a packyear is defined as smoking 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 1 year). The patient may not have used tobacco products within the past year. The patient has had an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 1 month before SV, or has had any hospitalization for asthma within 2 months before SV. The patient has historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease. Significant disease is defined as any disease that in the medical judgment of the investigator would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or that could affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the study. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
