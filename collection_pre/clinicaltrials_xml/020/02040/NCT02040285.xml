	<brief_title>Low-dose Laxative Improves Performance and Feasibility of Computed Tomography Colonography (CTC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computed Tomography Colonography (CTC) is a valid alternative to colonoscopy in the detection of cancer, polyps and other colon lesions. High volume cathartic preparations, low volume cathartic solutions with oral tagging agent and tagging agent only are the procedures available for CTC. High volume preparations are a considerable burden for patients. Low volume cathartic solutions are more accepted by the patients, reduce the amount of tagging agent and the waiting time to the exam. Tagging agent only preparations represent a risk if they are taken without medical supervision.</detailed_description>
