	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate the safety, tolerability and early effects on cardiac function of the partial A1 agonist BAY1067197 in patients with chronic heart failure. BAY1067197 will be applied once daily over 7 days in addition to standard therapy including a beta-blocker. The aim of the study is to assess if a 7 day treatment with BAY1067197 is well tolerated when given on top of standard therapy for heart failure. Furthermore, the study aims to assess if cardiac function improves in the early course of therapy.</brief_summary>
