	<brief_summary>Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy with the symptom scores (RSS), visual analog scale (VAS) and medication scores (MS) and the impact on quality of life with rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) in allergic rhinitis patients sensitized to different allergens. Also the development of new sensitizations and asthma during the immunotherapy were determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allergen Immunotherapy in Allergic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis patients sensitized to at least one common aero-allergen who completed a three or five year period of allergen immunotherapy in our outpatient clinic between 2002-2013 were enrolled in the study and patients with allergic rhinitis who received only medical treatment were chosen as the control group. Patients were separated in two groups according to sensitization patterns including pollens or house dust mites. All patients were evaluated before immunotherapy, in the first and the fifth years of treatment and two years after the treatment.</detailed_description>
