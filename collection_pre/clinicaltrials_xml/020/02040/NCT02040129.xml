	<brief_title>Reduction of Corneal Astigmatism With Toric Intraocular Lens Implantation in Congenital Cataract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This retrospective study included 6 eyes from 4 patients (mean age 7.2 years) with congenital cataract who had an astigmatism of 2.5 to 4.0 D prior to cataract surgery. Review of preoperative and postoperative visual acuity (UCVA), refraction, toric axis was performed.</detailed_description>
