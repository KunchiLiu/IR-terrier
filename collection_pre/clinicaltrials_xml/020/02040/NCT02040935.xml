	<brief_summary>This single-arm, open-label, local multicenter study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Herceptin (trastuzumab) administered subcutaneously by a single-use injection device (SID) in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Following surgery (and neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy), patients will receive Herceptin 600 mg subcutaneously by SID every 3 weeks for a total of 1 year, unless disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity occurs. After the first 3 cycles, patients will be permitted to self-administer Herceptin under supervision of a HCP.</brief_summary>
