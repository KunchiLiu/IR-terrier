	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on FDG-PET/CT after induction chemotherapy (IC) for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Tumor Response and IMRT Treat Plan After IC Based on FDG-PET/CT for Locally Advanced HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current guidelines define that pre-IC target volumes must be used for radiotherapy (RT) planning. This prospective, phase II trial assessed the results of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck treatment with IC following by chemoradiotherapy (CRT), using post-IC PET/CT images for IMRT planning.</detailed_description>
