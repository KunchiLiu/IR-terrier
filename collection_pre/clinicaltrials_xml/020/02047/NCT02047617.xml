	<brief_summary>Critically ill patients frequently develop muscle weakness due to critical illness-related acute neuropathy and/or myopathy. This disorder is associated with difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay, and increased mortality rates. In addition, many patients continue to suffer from decreased exercise capacity and quality of life for months to years after the acute event. Besides controlling risk factors, no specific prevention or treatment exists. Recommendations advice to start early with active and passive exercise in critically ill patients (1). Having critically ill patients alert and engaged in progressive rehabilitation leading to mobilization, despite the use of life support therapies may reduce muscle atrophy and lead to improved strength and physical function (2). This randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate whether a daily training session using a tilt table, started early in stable critically ill patients with an expected prolonged ICU stay, could induce a beneficial effect on exercise performance, quadriceps force and functional autonomy at ICU and hospital discharge compared to a standard physiotherapy program.</brief_summary>
