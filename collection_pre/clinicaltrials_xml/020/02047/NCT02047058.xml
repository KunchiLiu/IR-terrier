	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Q cells separated from the glioma sample are determinants in treatment response and prognosis of glioma patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Response and Prognosis in Glioma Patients: Q Cell and Its Biological Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The unique markers of Qcell were screened using the method of genomics and proteomics, then these markers will be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in glioblastoma patients by comparing their relationship with overrall survival/progression-free survival and treatment response.</detailed_description>
