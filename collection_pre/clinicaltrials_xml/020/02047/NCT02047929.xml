	<brief_summary>Asthma is a common disease that affects people of all ages and has significant morbidity and mortality. Poor outcomes and health disparities related to asthma result in part from the difficulty of disseminating new evidence and paradigms of care delivery such as shared decision making (SDM) into clinical practice. This study will evaluate a novel mechanism for dissemination of an evidence-based SDM Toolkit for asthma care in primary care practices. The study is ideally suited to study dissemination methods because it will leverage a partnership between an established consortium of practice based research networks (PBRNs) and an advanced Medicaid Network. This study will evaluate a novel dissemination process (FLOW) to spread an Asthma Shared Decision Making Toolkit to practices within a Medicaid network using a consortium of practice-based research networks (NCNC). The knowledge gained from this proposal and the partnerships formed between practice-based research networks and NC Medicaid will facilitate widespread dissemination to almost 300 practices.</brief_summary>
