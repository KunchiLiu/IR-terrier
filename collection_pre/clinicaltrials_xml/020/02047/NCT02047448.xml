	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if medication adherence is improved by a transitional care pharmacy practice model designed to integrate hospital and community pharmacists in the care and education of patients with heart failure or COPD who are discharged from a community hospital to home. The hospital and community pharmacists will collaborate with each other, the patient, and other practitioners including the primary care physician, nurse, and case manager to prevent and correct medication-related problems and attempt to improve patient outcomes especially during the error-prone transition from hospital to home.</brief_summary>
