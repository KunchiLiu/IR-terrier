	<brief_summary>NEONAX is an interventional, prospective, randomized, controlled, open label, two sided survival phase II studies against a fixed survival probability, with an unconnected analysis of the results in both experimental arms. Determining the impact of 2 cycles of Perioperative nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine followed by surgery and 4 cycles of adjuvant nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine or 6 cycles of adjuvant nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine on the Disease free survival (DFS) rate at 18 months post randomization</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The planned trial will enable us to address the following issues: - Identification of patients who benefit from surgery. Tumor progress during intensified Perioperative chemotherapy is likely to indicate a particularly poor prognosis suggesting that these patients would not have benefitted from immediate surgery. - Assess tumor response/downsizing using nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine also at the molecular level - Can we achieve a better systemic tumor control or reduce the metastatic spread using nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine compared to adjuvant gemcitabine - Examining the effect of a more efficacious chemotherapy regimen (nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine) in the adjuvant setting - Defining the impact of a perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel on DFS and 3-year Overall survival (OS) Histopathological tumor regression will be evaluated in addition to tumor size measurement according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). We will establish a histopathological tumor regression score to evaluate the efficacy of the neoadjuvant treatment. For this score we will examine tumor core biopsies obtained prior to neoadjuvant treatment and histological tumor specimen after surgery in both arms. To reliably determine R0 resections, the resected specimen will be prepared for pathology in a defined manner according to the procedure set out in the German S3 guidelines for pancreatic cancer. This trial provides the unique opportunity in pancreatic cancer to obtain material prior to and after surgery for biomarker analysis and correlation with outcome. We will perform pharmacogenomic candidate gene analysis of hENT1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1), CDA (cell differentiation agent), DCK (Desoxycytidin-Kinase) and 5´nucleotidase in both arms.</detailed_description>

Preexisting neuropathy &gt; grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) Allogeneic transplantation requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other major immunosuppressive therapy Severe nonhealing wounds, ulcers or bone fractions Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation must have an INR &lt; 1.5 ULN and PTT &lt; 1.5 ULN within 28 days prior to randomization. The use of full dose anticoagulants is allowed as long as the INR or PTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard in the institution) Major surgical procedures, except open biopsy, nor significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization, or anticipation of the need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study except for surgery of pancreatic cancer with curative intent and central intravenous line placement for chemotherapy administration.

Current or recent (within the 28 days prior randomization) treatment with another investigational drug or participation in another investigational study. Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially compromising compliance with the study protocol and the followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient prior to registration in the trial</criteria>
