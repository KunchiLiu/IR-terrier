	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open label, Phase II study in KRAS-positive and KRAS-negative patients with stage IV (including pleural effusion) non squamous NSCLC who have failed two lines of anti-cancer therapy. A maximum of 60 evaluable patients with NSCLC will receive antroquinonol, of which 30 patients will be KRAS-positive and 30 patients KRAS-negative. An evaluable patient will have received at least one dose of antroquinonol and have a valid baseline tumor assessment. Enrollment will continue until the target number of evaluable patients has been enrolled.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Progression free survival rate at 12 weeks, defined as the proportion of patients alive and progression free at Week 12. Patients will be progression free if they have no tumor assessments of progressive disease (defined according to RECIST guidelines, version 1.1) at any point from the start of treatment to Week 12. 2. Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1. The best overall response is the best response recorded during the first 12 week treatment cycle. 3. Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR, PR and SD during the first 12 week treatment cycle according to RECIST version 1.1. 4. Duration of overall tumor response (DR), defined as the interval between the date of the first observation of tumor response (CR or PR) and the date of disease progression or death. 5. Progression free survival defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression by RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 6. Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. 7. Time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression by RECIST version 1.1.</detailed_description>
