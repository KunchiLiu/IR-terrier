	<brief_title>Effect of Electroacupuncture Versus PFMT Plus Solifenacin for Mixed Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants experiencing mixed urinary incontinence will be recruited from 10 centers. A gynecologist or urologist will make the diagnosis. Central randomization will be performed by the Clinical Evaluation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing. Sample size: Sample size is based on the primary outcome. According to literature, the investigators predict that MUI patient's average 72-h incontinence episode frequency of the week 1-12 will decrease by 60% from the baseline after treatment of PFMT plus solifenacin. The number of the acupuncture group is 57%. For the assessment of noninferiority, 250 participants will be needed for each group allowing for a 15% dropout (α=0.05，β=0.2，δ=15%). Quality control: A 3-level monitoring system (monitors responsible for one center, monitors responsible for all centers and monitors responsible for the whole trial) will be established to check the performance of the trial in time. Outcome assessment, completion of case report forms and data management will be under strict supervision. Data management: The Remote Dara Capture (RDC) system will be used for data entering. Both paper and electronic case report form will be reserved. A data verification plan is made.</detailed_description>
