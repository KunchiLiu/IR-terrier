	<brief_summary>This retrospective case-control study was performed in an Academic centre for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. It included patients with recurrent unilateral endometriomas who were previously operated for the same condition (cases) and patients without recurrency who previously underwent surgery for unilateral endometrioma (controls). The primary outcome of the study was to assess the impact on ovarian reserve of second surgery for recurrent unilateral endometriomas. The evaluation of ovarian reserve was performed by assessing serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) level, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level, 17-beta estradiol level and antral follicle count (AFC).</brief_summary>
