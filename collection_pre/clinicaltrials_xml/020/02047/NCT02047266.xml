	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare three different revascularization strategies in patients with multi-vessel coronary disease: MICS CABG, OPCABG and ONCABG. The study hypothesis: MICS CABG (Minimally invasive cardiac surgery coronary artery bypass grafting) has advantages in comparison with conventional off-pump (OPCABG) and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (ONCABG) concerning major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) and procedural success.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective, single-center, randomized trial, intended to compare three different revascularization strategies in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease: 1. MICS CABG. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery coronary artery bypass grafting (complete multivessel minimally invasive off-pump revascularization via left minithoracotomy). (MICS CABG group, n=50). 2. OPCABG. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting treatment (OPCABG group, n=50). 3. ONCABG. On-pump coronary artery bypass grafting treatment (ONCABG group, n=50). The endpoints: The primary endpoints will be death, MI, stroke, or new myocardial ischemia and will be target vessel revascularization and non-target vessel revascularization at 30 days, 12 months and 3-year follow-up. The secondary endpoints: Procedural success, Procedural and post-procedural blood loss and number of transfusions, Wound complications, Recovery time, Heart Failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA)), Life quality assessed by one of the life quality questionnaires.</detailed_description>
