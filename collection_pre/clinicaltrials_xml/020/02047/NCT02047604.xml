Swollen joint count of ≥ 6 (66joint count) and tender joint count of ≥ 6 (68joint count) at Screening and randomization 4. Inadequate response to therapy or discontinuation of therapy because of unacceptable toxicity from at least one prior traditional or biologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) 5.

History of significant systemic involvement secondary to RA (e.g., vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or Felty's syndrome) 3. History of malignancy or carcinoma in situ within the 5 years before Screening or any history of melanoma. Patients with history of excised or adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer are eligible 4.

History of recurrent clinically significant infections 6. Current active infection or serious local infection (e.g., cellulitis, abscess) or systemic infection (e.g., pneumonia, septicemia) within 3 months before randomization 7. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to other biologic agents 8. History of allergies to murine protein 9. Surgery within 3 months before randomization (other than minor cosmetic surgery or minor dental procedures) or plans for a surgical procedure during the Treatment Period or Followup Period 10. History of tuberculosis or latent infection currently undergoing treatment 11. History of malaria 12. Treatment regimen with prednisone that is either over 10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) or is not taken at a stable dose of ≤ 10 mg/day for at least 4 weeks before randomization 13. Intraarticular corticosteroid injection(s) within 4 weeks before randomization 14. Any live immunization/vaccination, including against Herpes zoster, within 4 weeks before randomization. Live vaccinations must also be avoided throughout the study 15. Abnormal laboratory value at Screening or Day 1 considered clinically significant 16. Positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 17. Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody 18.
