	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study has two major goals: 1) to measure the amount of two specific hormones interleukin (IL)-10 and interleukin (IL)-12p70 in mucous and blood; and 2) compare the hormone levels in two specific areas of the lung called the trachea (upper airway) and the bronchioles (lower airway). The hormones IL-10 and IL-12p70 are cytokines, special hormones cells use to communicate with each other during inflammation or infection. Cytokines can be measured in mucous and blood. The balance of one cytokine compared to another help doctors to understand how people respond differently to infection. Unfortunately, the amount of IL-10 and IL-12p70 is not known in children, especially children with a lung infection. In addition, we do not know if the balance of these cytokines differ in various regions of the lung. We believe the balance of IL-10 and IL-12p70 is similar whether measured in the upper or lower airways.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is designed to measure the concentration and describe the distribution of cytokine IL-10 and IL-12p70 in a previously healthy pediatric population suffering direct lung injury by an infectious etiology, not yet described in the literature. In addition, this study seeks to determine whether tracheal aspirates (TA) obtained in early acute respiratory failure can be substituted for distal airway aspirates, obtained by non-bronchoscopic broncho-alevolar lavage (nb-BAL), for the purposes of investigating markers of inflammation. We will compare the ratio of IL-10 to IL-12p70 at each time point measured in tracheal secretion, bronchial secretion, and blood to assess for sample equivalence. Finally, this study will affirm the safety profile for repeated nb-BAL, establish a protocol for respiratory sample collection and storage for future larger scale studies, and generate feasibility data regarding consent rate, estimates of data completion, and fraction of missing data for us to determine whether a future study involving the ratio of IL-10 to IL-12p70 can be used as a predictor of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in this population. The data generated by this study regarding safety, comparison of nb-BAL and TA, and cytokine concentrations will be used as preliminary data informing the design of a larger multicenter study testing the hypothesis that IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels in airway secretions can predict risk for ARDS in this population. This may be approached via application to the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis (PALISI) clinical research network group.</detailed_description>
