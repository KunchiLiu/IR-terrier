	<brief_summary>Our long-term goal is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin treatments as an intervention for reducing childhood mortality. We propose a single multi-site (multi-country), cluster-randomized trial comparing communities randomized to oral azithromycin with those randomized to placebo. We hypothesize that mass azithromycin treatments will reduce childhood mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin: Mortality Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will assess childhood mortality over two years, comparing communities where children aged 1-60 months receive biannual oral azithromycin ("Azithromycin" arm), to communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo ("Control" arm). This is a cluster-randomized trial; at each site, communities within a contiguous area of 300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized to azithromycin or placebo using simple random sampling. Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that mass distributions of oral azithromycin targeted to 1-60 month old children reduces childhood mortality, in a cluster-randomized trial Specific Aim 2: To assess the cost-effectiveness of mass azithromycin in reducing childhood mortality</detailed_description>
