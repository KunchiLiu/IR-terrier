	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and highly disabling disorder with considerable social impact and economic consequences. It is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. Different areas are affected, including manual dexterity, strength, coordination and function. The objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement in these variables in patients with multiple sclerosis after a 8-weeks intervention focused on upper limbs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The total estimated prevalence rate of multiple sclerosis has been reported to be 83 per 100 000 for the past three decades. It is also higher in northern countries and between females with a male ratio around 2.0. The highest prevalence rates have been estimated for the age group 35-64 years. The estimated European mean annual Multiple Sclerosis incidence rate is 4.3 cases per 100 000. Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms: hypoesthesia, muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty moving; difficulties with coordination and balance; dysarthria, dysphagia, visual problems fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties,cognitive impairment, or emotional symptomatology. The investigators focus on the benefits of an intervention on dexterity, strength, coordination and functionality.</detailed_description>
