	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether aspirin is effective in alleviating symptoms of the clinical high risk (CHR) syndrome for psychosis. The investigators further aim to determine whether it may delay or prevent the onset of psychosis in those currently experiencing CHR symptoms. As secondary measures the investigators aim to collect laboratory studies of inflammation markers and genetic samples to determine whether certain genetic profiles correlate with risk for psychosis, or response to aspirin treatment.</brief_summary>
