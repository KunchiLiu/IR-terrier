	<brief_summary>We have several ways to appropriately determine renal function in healthy patients and in several diseases, in cirrhotic population we dont have a precise tool that has sufficient precision that reflects glomerular function, although it has been reported that cystatin C, because of its nature could improve diagnostic accuracy to determinate the renal function in this population. The investigators hypothesize that glomerular filtration obtained from cystatin-C-derived formulas are more accurate when compared to creatinine-derived formulas with DTPA-Tc99 (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate- technetium-99) as gold standard.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to determine if the formulas for glomerular filtration are close to the estimation of actual renal function in mexican cirrhotic patients of different etiologies.</detailed_description>
