	<brief_summary>Static postures, repetitive work tasks, and work stress increase the risk for musculoskeletal disorders and sickness absence. Objective measurements of occupational loadings - EMG for muscular activity, EEG for cognitive activity, ECG for cardiovascular activity and heart rate variability, actigraphy for bodily movements - may provide useful early indicators of muscular, cognitive and cardiovascular overload. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored bio-psycho-social intervention strategy versus "usual care" ergonomics and standard physical exercises (reference group) on these risk factors in lab technicians with a history of work-related musculoskeletal pain.</brief_summary>
