	<brief_summary>In this study the Investigators are examining the effects of a 12-week exercise program (intervention) on measures of appetite and food intake regulation in overweight to mildly obese healthy adults. The Investigators hypothesize that individuals who lose a significant amount of weight in response to the intervention will show a reduction in the brain response to food cues as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when compared to those who do not lose weight. These changes in neuronal activity will be associated to physiologic and behavioral measures.</brief_summary>
