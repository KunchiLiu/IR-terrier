	<brief_summary>The investigators proposes a prospective cohort study in patients with high risk bladder cancer who have opted for radical cystectomy. The investigators aim to correlate pre-operative measures of body composition, cognitive and functional status with impaired survival at 6 months after cystectomy. Impairment in this context will be a compilation of several specific objective measures including: 1) death from any cause, 2) major complication (Clavien score7 â‰¥ 3), 3) loss of independent living status, 4) performance status, and 5) global well-being. The study team believes that Impairment Free Survival is an important endpoint as it accounts for many aspects of a patient's functional status that might alter a patient's choice to proceed with radical surgery.</brief_summary>
