	<brief_summary>In this multicenter project, we will introduce AWARE (electronic interface) Using a cloud-based technology . The goal of this project is to improve compliance with best practice through the use of a new acute care interface with built-in tools for error prevention, practice surveillance and reporting (ProCCESs AWARE - Patient Centered Cloud-based Electronic System: Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation).The goal of this project is to develop and test a novel acute care interface with built-in tools for error prevention, practice surveillance, decision support and reporting (ProCCESs AWARE - Patient Centered Cloud-based Electronic System: Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation). In preliminary studies, these novel informatics supports built on an advanced understanding of cognitive and organizational ergonomics, have significantly decreased the cognitive load of bedside providers and reduced medical errors. Using a cloud-based technology, AWARE will be uniformly available on either mobile or fixed computing devices and applied in a standardized manner in medical and surgical ICUs of five geographically diverse acute care hospitals predominantly serving Medicare and Medicaid patients. The impact of ProCCESs AWARE on processes of care and outcomes in study ICUs; expected to enroll more than 10,000 critically ill patients during the study period.</brief_summary>
