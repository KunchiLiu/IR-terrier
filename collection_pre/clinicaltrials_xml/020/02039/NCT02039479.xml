	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis of this confirmatory study is that lithium therapy will acutely decrease suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behaviour in inpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE, unipolar and bipolar disorder according to DSM IV criteria). The specific aim is to test the hypothesis that lithium plus treatment as usual (TAU), compared to placebo plus TAU, results in a significantly greater decrease in suicidal ideation and/or behaviour over 5 weeks in inpatients with MDE.</brief_summary>
