	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of left atrial appendage occlusion in comparison to oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (INR 2-3) related to the frequency of occurrence of at least one bleeding classified as moderate or major within 24 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion vs. Usual Care in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Severe Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical investigation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for all patients within 14 days of the Enrolment Visit. Patients randomized to oral anticoagulation (OAC) will receive standard of care (SOC) vitamin K antagonist treatment throughout the 24 months clinical investigation period, managed by the primary care physician, with the goal of achieving and maintaining an INR of 2-3 (INR monitoring by the primary care physician every two weeks throughout study period). Patients randomized to the WATCHMAN device will undergo device implantation within 48 hours of the screening TEE and after confirmation of INR ≤ 1.7 in the catheterization laboratory with a subsequent hospitalization for 24-48 hours. Concomitant treatment with Aspirin/Clopidogrel (managed by the patient's primary care physician) will be initiated on the day prior to device implantation, and will be continued for 6 months after the procedure, at which time Clopidogrel will be discontinued; administration of Aspirin will be continued indefinitely. Follow-up visits for all patients will take place on Day 45, and at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 24 (End of Study). Routine safety and efficacy assessments at each visit will be the same for all patients regardless of treatment group. Follow-up- visits at day 45, months 6, 12 and 24. Patients randomized to the WATCHMAN device will have additional TEE imaging performed at the Day 45 and Month 6 visits. An independent Data Monitoring Committee will monitor safety. A blinded and independent Endpoint Committee will evaluate end-points throughout the entire study period.</detailed_description>
