	<brief_summary>To test the effects of low frequency deep rTMS using the novel HCERMJD-coil on cerebellar deficits in patients with SCA3 and to establish its safety in this population. Investigator is anticipate that stimulation of the cerebellum with the novel HCERMJD-coil may induce significantly therapeutic effects in patients with SCA3 and will pave the way for establishing a novel and effective treatment for this disorder.</brief_summary>
