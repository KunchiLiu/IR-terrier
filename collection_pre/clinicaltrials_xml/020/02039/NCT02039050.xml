	<brief_summary>In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the airways of the lungs are narrowed or blocked. Bronchodilators are drugs usually delivered through inhalers which help open up the airways. Tiotropium is a type of bronchodilator drug known as a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). For a long time tiotropium was the only available LAMA. More recently, a new LAMA called aclidinium has been approved for use in COPD. There are potentially important differences between these two medications that might have an impact on the treatment of COPD patients. In this study we aim to compare the effects of tiotropium and aclidinium in people with COPD. The main comparison will be done using a very sensitive breathing test called impulse oscillometry</brief_summary>
