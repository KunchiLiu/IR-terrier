	<brief_summary>During sedative colonoscopy, use of propofol have been increased world wide. The onset time of propofol is shorter than midazolam. However the most popular additive pain killer, pethidine show different pharmacodynamic feature. The pethidine has longer onset time than propofol (nearly 30 minutes) and require more time to recovery. For this reason, the use of fentanyl has been increased world widely. However, exact comparison of pethidine and fentanyl was not studied. Therefore, we designed this study to compare both drug to check satisfaction of this drug.</brief_summary>
