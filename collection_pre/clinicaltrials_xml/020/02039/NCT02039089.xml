	<brief_summary>This study will be a single-center, multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in healthy male and female subjects. The study will consist of 2 parts: Part A (3 cohorts of healthy Japanese subjects dosed in the evening) and Part B (one cohort of healthy white subjects dosed in the evening). The cohorts will be conducted sequentially. Part A will be started first with the 2.5-mg dose cohort, followed by the 10-mg dose cohort and then the 25-mg dose cohort. Part B will be conducted in parallel with the 10-mg cohort of Part A, with the possibility of overlap.</brief_summary>
