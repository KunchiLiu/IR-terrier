	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are persisting antibodies against Japanese Encephalitis 6 years after the last vaccination with IXIARO(R) and to adapt or confirm mathematical models accordingly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6-year Antibody Check After Third Vaccination Against Japanese Encephalitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a potentially devastating mosquito-borne viral disease. The JE virus (JEV), a Flavivirus, is endemic to many regions in Asia, and while JE is primarily a pediatric disease in the endemic regions, travelers from non-endemic regions to Asia are usually na√Øve to the virus and may be at risk for contracting JE at any age. The present study aims to investigate antibody titers at approximately 6 years after the third dose of JE vaccine (JE-VC), in a cohort of participants from an earlier booster dose trial, to strengthen the statistical model of the duration of protection after the booster.</detailed_description>
