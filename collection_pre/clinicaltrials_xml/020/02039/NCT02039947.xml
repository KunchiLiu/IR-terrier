	<brief_summary>This is a multi-cohort, open label, Phase II study with Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and Trametinib (GSK1120212) combination therapy in subject with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma that has metastasized to the brain. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4 cohorts. Cohorts will consist of; V600 E, D, K, R mutations, metastases to the brain, symptomatic and asymptomatic, with or without prior local (brain) therapy, with or without prior local (brain) therapy, and range of ECOG scores from 0-2.</brief_summary>
