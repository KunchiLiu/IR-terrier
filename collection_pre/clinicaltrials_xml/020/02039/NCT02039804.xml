	<brief_summary>Trochanteric pain can be caused by osteoarthritis of the hip, fracture, tendinitis, nerve pathology and trochanteric bursitis. Trochanteric bursitis is often seen at the outpatient clinic and is characterized by chronic lateral hip pain in the vicinity of the trochanter major, overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. When pain is persistent after conventional therapies, anesthetic and corticosteroid (CS) injections can provide short term to intermediate relief of pain, but relapse is common. Only one retrospective study showed the efficacy of intra-bursal trochanteric injections with HA and CS. They concluded that the pain release is significant with large effect sizes for both treatment. However, the efficacy of CS appeared to be short lived and it was shown that the efficacy of HA at 6 and 12 months is significant compared to CS (p&lt;0.05). In this study we want to compare the efficacy of corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid in the treatment of trochanteric bursitis.</brief_summary>
