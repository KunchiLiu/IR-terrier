	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether ARA 290, a new class of compound, is effective in the treatment of the neuropathic symptoms of sarcoidosis. Brief interaction of ARA 290 with the innate repair receptor results in anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities in myriad of cells, tissues and organs throughout the body to activate repair mechanisms and accelerate healing, including the nerve damage that can be associated with sarcoidosis. In this study, subjects with sarcoidosis and symptoms of small fiber neuropathy will administered ARA 290 or placebo by subcutaneous injection daily for 28 days. In addition to monitoring the safety of the treatment, the symptoms of the subjects will be assessed with several questionnaires, function tests, and measurement of nerve fibers in their cornea and skin (via a non-invasive test and a biopsy, respectively). The total participation time for each patient will be 16 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Sarcoidosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>â€¢ Established diagnosis of sarcoidosis with both of the following two criteria: 1. Score of 4 or greater on Brief Pain Inventory "pain now" or "average pain" questions (BPI; 0 (least discomfort)10 (worst discomfort)) 2. Discomfort defined as distal pain/discomfort plus one of the following: 1) dysesthesia, 2) burning/painful feet worsening at night, or 3) intolerance of sheets or clothes touching the legs or feet AND either of the following two criteria 1. Corneal nerve fiber density reduced compared to normal (i.e., greater than 1 standard deviation less than the mean of a normative population) 2. A previous skin biopsy (obtained within the prior 2 years) showing a reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density ((i.e., greater than 1 standard deviation less than the mean of a normal age and gender relevant population) In addition, subjects must: Be able to read and understand the written consent form, complete studyrelated procedures, and communicate with the study staff Be willing to comply with study restrictions Be willing to check in with the study center via the telephone Between 18 and 70 years of age (inclusive) Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 40 kg/m2 (inclusive) If female of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and acceptable contraception will be maintained during the screening and dosing period and 1 month beyond. Acceptable contraception consists of hormonal methods such as oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives for a minimum of 1 full cycle (based on the subject's usual menstrual cycle period) before study entry, intrauterine device (IUD), or double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream). Able to complete selfadministered questionnaires (RAND36, SFNSL, BPI, FAS, NPSI) Refrigerator and freezer at home for storage of study medication. Clinically relevant abnormal history of physical and mental health other than conditions related to sarcoidosis, as determined by medical history taking (as judged by the investigator) Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results, vital signs, or physical findings other than conditions related to sarcoidosis or could interfere with conduct of 6minute walk assessment (as judged by the investigator) Other medical conditions known to be associated with small nerve fiber loss, except for diabetes in good control (as judged by the investigator) Known clinically relevant abnormalities in ECG (as judged by the investigator) Illicit drug abuse or excessive alcohol consumption (as judged by the investigator) History of serious malignancy within the last 5 years other than a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been removed History of severe allergies, or has had an anaphylactic reaction or significant intolerability to prescription or nonprescription drugs or food (as judged by the investigator) AntiTNF therapy, other biological antiinflammatory agents, or immunoglobulins administered within the 3 months prior to screening. Use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents within the two months prior to screening or during the trial Participation in an investigational drug trial in the 3 months prior to administration of the initial dose of study drug or more than 4 times in the calendar year preceding study enrollment Inadequate venous accessibility as judged by clinicians (physician or nurse) Inability or unwillingness to selfadminister ARA 290 via subcutaneous injections (or not have access to home health care for assistance in administration) If female, pregnant or breastfeeding Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would complicate or compromise the study, or the wellbeing of the subject</criteria>
