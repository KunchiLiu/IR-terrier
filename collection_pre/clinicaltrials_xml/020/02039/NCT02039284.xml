	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood motor disability. Weakness, spasticity, and loss of dexterity are the major problems in patients with CP. A novel virtual cycling training (VCT) program for lower limb was to enhance promising muscle strength through promoting the participant compliance and motivation. Sensory electrical stimulation(SES) of whole hand is a novel technique and is commonly used to treatment of spasticity for patients with stroke. Constraint-induced therapy (CIT) is a method for treating developmental disregard and learned non-use of affected limb and improving motor efficiency, functional performance, and activities of daily living for patients with CP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of New Protocols in the Treatment of Upper Limb Dysfunctions in Patients With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will proposed 3 novel protocols, including upper extremity (UE) VCT, UE SES, and virtual reality based CIT (VRCIT) in the treatment of upper limb dysfunction in patients with CP. investigators hypothesize that the functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will improve through biomechanical and physiological changes after different treatment protocols in patients with CP. The biomechanical and physiological changes varied depending on different treatment protocols. This project aims to: 1. the immediate effects of new protocols in these patients through biomechanical, physiological, and clinical measures; 2. the maintaining effects of new protocols in these patients through biomechanical, physiological, and clinical measures;3. the most effective treatment protocol; 3. the biomechanical and physiological mechanism underlying clinical improvement; and 5. the clinical predictors influencing the outcome for new protocols. This 4-year project will recruit an estimated 92-100 patients with CP. A blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was designed. In the phase I (1st year), investigators will set-up the experimental protocols and perform pilot study. Twenty patients will be randomized into 4 groups: SES, VCT, VRCIT, and shame control groups. In the phase II (2nd -3rd year), 36-40 patients will be randomized into 2 groups: SES and shame control groups. In the phase III (3rd -4th year), 36-40 patients will be randomized into 2 groups:VCT and VRCIT groups. The outcome measures include biomechanical, physiological (muscle tone, muscle strength and endurance, kinematics, bone density, body compositions, metabolism), and clinical assessments, including functioning (motor impairment, movement and participation) and HRQOL, based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. The outcome measures will be administered at before, immediately after 12-week intervention, and 3-month follow-up assessments. This project is significant for the translational and evidence-based medicine on CP neurorehabilitation. The research will offer valuable biomechanical and physiological biomarker that support motor control models proposed to account for motor problems and new protocol intervention in these patients.</detailed_description>
