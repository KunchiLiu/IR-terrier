	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, open-label, 5-treatment-period study to evaluate the PK and PD of avatrombopag following a single administration of avatrombopag in the fed and fasted condition, or the fed condition, to healthy Japanese and white subjects. A standard high-fat, high calorie breakfast will be used to assess the fed condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Five-Treatment-Period Study to Evaluate the Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Avatrombopag in Healthy Japanese and White Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will comprise a Prerandomization Phase and a Randomization Phase. The Prerandomization Phase will include 2 periods, Screening and Baseline 1. The Screening Period will be up to 3 weeks (21 days) in duration. The Randomization Phase will consist of 5 single-dose treatment periods, of which 3 will include administration of avatrombopag in the fed condition and 2 will include administration of avatrombopag in the fasted condition. Each treatment period will be separated by a wash out interval of at least 28 days. Before each treatment period, subjects will complete a baseline period (Baseline Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5), during which baseline assessments will be collected. A Final Visit will occur 28 days (+/- 1 day) after dosing in Treatment Period 5.</detailed_description>
