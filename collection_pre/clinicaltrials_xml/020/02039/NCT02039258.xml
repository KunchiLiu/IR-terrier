	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (a sequence of fasted and fed periods accompanying study drug intake will be assigned by chance), open-label (physicians and participants know the identity of the assigned treatment), single-center, single-dose, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study of Canagliflozin/extended release Metformin (CANA/MET XR) fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet of 150 mg/1,000 mg. Approximately 24 healthy adult participants will be enrolled to ensure that at least 20 complete the study. After a screening period, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Period 1. Treatment A means a participant will receive a single 150/1,000 mg CANA/MET XR FDC tablet under fasted conditions, and Treatment B means that a participant will receive the same drug under fed conditions. Participants will need to remain at the study center for 4 days (72 hours postdose) after the drug administration for collection of blood samples in each treatment period. There will be a 10- to 14-day washout period between Period 1 and Period 2. On Day 4 (72 hours postdose) of Period 2, when participants are discharged from the study center, they will be given instructions to return for a follow-up visit 7 to 10 days later. For Treatment B (in fed state), participants will be provided with a standardized high-fat breakfast. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
