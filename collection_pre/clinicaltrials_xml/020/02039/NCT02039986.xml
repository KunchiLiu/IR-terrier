	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at better understanding the impact of ivacaftor upon insulin and incretin secretion and glucose tolerance in patients with Cystic Fibrosis with a glycine (G551D) mutation. Investigators hypothesize that treatment with ivacaftor improves insulin secretion in individuals with CF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and Insulin in Cystic Fibrosis (CF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) is associated with worse nutritional status, greater pulmonary function decline, and increased mortality, highlighting its relevance in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CFRD arises primarily from compromised insulin secretion - traditionally considered a by-product of pancreatic exocrine tissue damage and fibrosis. Recent developments in the field of diabetes are propelling a re-examination of this basic explanation. The impact of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator, ivacaftor, upon insulin secretion and glucose regulation has not been examined, but improved glucose tolerance has been appreciated anecdotally. This study aims to understand the impact of ivacaftor therapy upon blood glucose and insulin and incretin secretion.</detailed_description>
