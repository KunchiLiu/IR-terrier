	<brief_summary>Sore throat is one of most frequent complaints related to general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. Although sore throat is regarded as a minor and short-lasting discomfort after surgery, its incidence and intensity in high risk patients such as female gender, head and neck surgery and difficult laryngoscopy or intubation may attribute to prolong postoperative recovery and give patient dissatisfaction. Even though the pathophysiology of post-intubation airway symptoms is not completely clarified yet, the mucosal damage related inflammation at the cuff of endotracheal tube has been thought to be an essential trigger. Thus anti-inflammatory medication has been commonly used strategy to prevent postoperative airway discomfort after intubation. The preoperative administration of dexamethasone has been reported to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat, but it is accompanied with the adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, delayed wound healing and increased infection in surgical patients. Ketorolac, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is an analgesic that commonly used for postoperative pain control and has anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, the investigator designed to evaluate the effect of ketorolac on sore throat in comparison to dexamethasone after thyroidectomy in female adult patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Prophylactic Ketorolac on Sore Throat After Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ketorolac, NSAID, has not been evaluated as a pharmacologic strategy to reduce postoperative sore throat yet. The investigator will explore how the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of ketorolac influence airway symptoms following general anesthesia with tracheal intubation.</detailed_description>
