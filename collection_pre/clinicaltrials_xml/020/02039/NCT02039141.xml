	<detailed_description>Obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions and Latinos youth are disproportionally impacted. Pediatric obesity is associated with several chronic health conditions including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, very few interventions specifically targeting diabetes prevention for obese Latino adolescents have been developed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects a culturally-grounded, community-based lifestyle intervention on psychosocial and health outcomes among obese Latino adolescents. Eligible participants of this study will be randomly selected to the intervention group or the delayed-intervention group (control group) after an initial health screening for eligibility. Participants selected to the intervention group will attend weekly healthy lifestyle education sessions with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and three physical activity sessions / week with other youth. After which, participants will attend monthly booster group meetings for three months. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, quality of life, fitness, and nutrition and physical activity behaviors.</detailed_description>
