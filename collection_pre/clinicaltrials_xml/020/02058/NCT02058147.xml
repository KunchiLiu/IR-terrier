	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination to lixisenatide alone and to insulin glargine alone (on top of metformin treatment) in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to Week 30. Secondary Objective: To compare the overall efficacy and safety of insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) to insulin glargine alone and to lixisenatide alone (on top of metformin treatment) over a 30 week treatment period in participants with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed for at least 1 year before the screening visit, treated for at least 3 months prior to visit 1 with metformin alone or metformin and a second oral antidiabetic treatment that could be a sulfonylurea, a glinide, a sodium glucose cotransporter2 inhibitor or a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, and who were not adequately controlled with this treatment. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: HbA1c at screening visit: less than 7.5% or more than 10% for participants previously treated with metformin alone, less than 7.0% or more than 9% for participants previously treated with metformin and a second oral antidiabetic treatment. Pregnancy or lactation, women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Use of oral glucoselowering agents other than those stated in the inclusion criteria or any injectable glucoselowering agents during the 3 months before screening. Previous Treatment with insulin (except for shortterm treatment due to intercurrent illness including gestational diabetes, at the discretion of the trial physician). History of discontinuation of a previous treatment with a glucagonlike peptide (GLP1) receptor agonist (GLP1 RA) due to safety/tolerability issue or lack of efficacy. Participant who previously participated in any clinical trial with lixisenatide or the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination or had previously received lixisenatide. Any contraindication to metformin use, according to local labeling. Use of weight loss drugs within 3 months prior to screening visit. Within the last 6 months prior to screening visit: history of stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or heart failure requiring hospitalization. Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation procedures to be performed during the study period. History of pancreatitis (unless pancreatitis was related to gallstones and cholecystectomy was already performed), chronic pancreatitis, pancreatitis during a previous treatment with incretin therapies, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery. Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic conditions that predispose to MTC (e.g, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes). Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure above 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure above 95 mmHg) at screening visit. At screening visit, Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 20 or above 40 kg/m^2. At screening visit amylase and/or lipase more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) laboratory range. At screening visit alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (AST) more than 3 ULN. At screening visit calcitonin above or equal to 20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L). Exclusion Criteria for randomization at the end of the screening period: HbA1c less than 7% or above 10%; Fasting Plasma glucose above 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); Metformin maximal tolerated dose less than 1500 mg/day; Amylase and/or lipase more than 3 ULN. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
