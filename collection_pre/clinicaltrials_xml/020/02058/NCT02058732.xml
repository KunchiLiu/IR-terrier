	<brief_title>Therapeutic Imaging Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will study cervical spinal cord chemical concentrations and cervical spinal cord and brain microstructure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have had a stem cell transplant compared to ALS patients who have not had a stem cell transplant. Investigators intend to determine cervical spinal cord chemical concentrations and cervical spinal cord and brain microstructure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have had a stem cell transplant and compare these to corresponding measures in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have not had a stem cell transplant.</detailed_description>
