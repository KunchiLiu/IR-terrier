	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Chloroquine comparing with placebo for treatment of non- response HCV patients.. In this triple blind pilot study, 20 patients with confirmed chronic hepatitis C will be randomize into treatment group (Chloroquine 150 mg daily, for 8 weeks) or control group (placebo once daily, for 8 weeks). Patients who have receiving anti neoplastic, anti viral or Immunomedullator drugs during 6 months prior to study, have co-infection Hepatitis A,C,D or HIV, severe liver or renal dysfunction, are pregnant or breast fed, or refuse to sign informed consent will be excluded.. At the end of therapy (12 weeks) and at baseline, first, second and third month after receiving drug and placebo HCV Virus load, CBC LFT and biochemical parameters will be evaluated and compared between groups.</brief_summary>
