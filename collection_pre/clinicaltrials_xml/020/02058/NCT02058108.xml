	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of telbivudine at a dose of 20 mg/kg up to a maximum of 600 mg q.d. in compensated pediatric HBeAg-positive and negative CHB patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years with the indication of antiviral CHB treatment. This study is part of the commitments of the pediatric development plan for telbivudine in Europe and US.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical history compatible with compensated chronic hepatitis B Documented compensated chronic hepatitis B defined by the following: oPositive serum HBsAg at screening and at least one other documentation of HBsAg positive at least 6 months prior to screening oFor HBeAg positive patients at screening, significant biologic and/or histologic signs of disease activity following EASL guidelines recommendations for CHB pediatric patients (serum HBV DNA level ≥ 5 log10 copies/mL (or 20 000 IU/mL) (COBAS Taqman®) at screening ; serum ALT ≥ 1.5×ULN and &lt; 10×ULN (pediatric ULN) for two times during the screening period or within 6 months prior to screening oFor HBeAg negative patients at screening, significant biologic and/or histologic signs of disease activity following EASL guidelines recommendations for CHB pediatric patients (serum HBV DNA level ≥ 4 log10 copies/mL (or 2 000 IU/mL) (COBAS Taqman®) at screening) ; serum ALT ≥ 1.0 ×ULN and &lt; 10×ULN (pediatric ULN) for two times during the screening period or within 12 months prior to screening) Patients with acute or chronic infection of HCV, HDV, HIV, or with acute infection of HAV, HEV, CMV, EBV, or HSV. Patient has received treatment of interferon or any other immunomodulatory agents within the last 12 months prior to screening or any nucleoside or nucleotide drugs or other antiCHB treatment (approved or investigational) at any time before screening Patient has a medical condition that requires frequent use of systemic acyclovir or famciclovir, systemic corticosteroids, potentially hepatotoxic drugs or nephrotoxic drugs or chemotherapy Patient has one or more additional known primary or secondary causes of liver disease, other than CHB; has a decompensated liver disease ; is a Liver transplant recipient or organ or bone marrow transplant recipient. History of any other acute or chronic medical condition (that in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for inclusion into the study. Patient has a history of myopathy, myositis, persistent muscle weakness or persistent high serum CK levels (≥7×ULN), any muscular disease Patient receiving any drugs potentially associated with myopathy within 3 months prior to screening Any other clinical significant disease, condition or abnormality, unrelated to their HBV infection at screening, as assessed by the investigator</criteria>
