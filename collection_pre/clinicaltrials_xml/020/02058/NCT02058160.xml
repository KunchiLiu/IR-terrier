	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) to insulin glargine in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to Week 30. Secondary Objective: To compare the overall efficacy and safety of insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC to insulin glargine (with or without metformin) over a 30 week treatment period in participants with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at least 1 year before the screening visit. Treatment with basal insulin for at least 6 months before the screening visit. Stable basal insulin regimen (i.e. type of insulin and time/frequency of the injection) for at least 3 months before the screening visit. Stable (plus/minus 20 percent) total daily basal insulin dose between 15 and 40 Units/day for at least 2 months prior to the screening visit. For participants receiving basal insulin and 1 or 2 oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs): the OAD dose(s) must be stable during the 3 months before the screening visit. The OADs could be 1 to 2 out of: metformin (more than or equal to 1500 mg/day or maximal tolerated dose), a sulfonylurea, a glinide, a dipeptidylpeptidase4 inhibitor, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) less than or equal to 180 mg/dL(10.0 mmol/L) at screening visit for participants receiving basal insulin in combination with 2 OADs or with 1 OAD other than metformin; FPG less than or equal to 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) at screening visit for participants on basal insulin only or basal insulin plus metformin at screening visit. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age under legal age of adulthood at screening visit. HbA1c at screening visit less than 7.5% or above 10%. Pregnancy or lactation, women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Use of other oral or injectable glucoselowering agents than stated in the inclusion criteria in a period of 3 months prior to screening. Previous use of insulin other than basal insulin eg, prandial or premixed insulin, in the year prior to screening. Note: Short term treatment (â‰¤10 days) due to intercurrent illness is allowed. History discontinuation of a previous treatment with Glucagon Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists for safety/tolerability or lack of efficacy. Participant who had previously participated in any clinical trial with lixisenatide or the insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC or had previously received lixisenatide. Use of weight loss drugs within 3 months prior to screening visit. Within the last 6 months prior to screening visit: history of stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or heart failure requiring hospitalization. Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation procedures to be performed during the study period. History of pancreatitis (unless pancreatitis was related to gallstones and cholecystectomy was already performed), chronic pancreatitis, pancreatitis during a previous treatment with incretin therapies, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery. Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic conditions that predispose to MTC (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes). Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure above 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure above 95 mmHg) at screening visit. At screening visit, Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 20 or above 40 kg/m^2. At screening visit amylase and/or lipase more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) laboratory range. At screening visit alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (AST) more than 3 ULN. At screening visit calcitonin above or equal to 20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L). Any contraindication to metformin use, according to local labeling, if the participant was taking metformin. Participant who had a renal function impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min (using the Cockcroft and Gault formula) or endstage renal disease for participants, not treated with metformin. Exclusion criteria for randomization: HbA1c less than 7% or above 10% . Mean fasting SMPG calculated from the selfmeasurements for 7 days the week before randomization visit was above 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). Average insulin glargine daily dose less than 20 Units or above 50 Units (in the week before randomization visit). Amylase and/or lipase more than 3 ULN . The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
