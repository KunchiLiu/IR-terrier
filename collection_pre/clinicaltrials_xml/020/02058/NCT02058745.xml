	<brief_title>SmartCare: Innovations in Caregiving Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have designed a needs-based intervention to improve neuro-oncology caregivers' health. Our novel approach treats depressive symptoms prior to implementing a needs-based intervention in a sample of PMBT family caregivers who score above threshold on depressive symptoms. Study outcomes are psychological responses (unmet needs, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burden) and physical responses (levels of stimulated and circulating IL-6 and IL-1β, C-reactive protein, peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells, physical symptoms, and new diagnoses or exacerbations of co-morbid conditions). The proposed study addresses research priorities set by both NCI and NINR to improve the quality of life of patients and their families and NINR's emphasis on integrating bio-behavioral science and adopting, adapting and generating new technologies. Primary aims: 1. Compare the efficacy of a) an intervention for depressive symptoms (Beating the Blues) delivered prior to a needs-based caregiver intervention (SmartCare©) versus b) SmartCare© alone versus c) enhanced care as usual (CAU+) in improving caregivers' psychological and physical responses. H1: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare© will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to caregivers who receive CAU+. H2: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive SmartCare© alone will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to caregivers who receive CAU+. H3: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare© will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to those who receive SmartCare© alone. 2. Compare the efficacy of Beating the Blues versus CAU+ in improving subjects' short-term psychological and physical responses. H1: At 2-months following baseline, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to CAU+. Exploratory aims: 1. Determine whether any changes in psychological and physical health resulting from receiving Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare© or SmartCare© alone are maintained at 10-months after baseline. 2. Evaluate whether the effect of Beating the Blues + SmartCare© (vs. SmartCare© alone) on 4- and 6-month psychological and physical responses is mediated by 0- to 2-month changes in depressive symptoms.</detailed_description>
