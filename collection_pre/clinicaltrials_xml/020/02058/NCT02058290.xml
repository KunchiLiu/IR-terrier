	<brief_title>A Health Economic Trial in Adult Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 4, prospective, sequential, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and health economic benefits of intraoperative local wound infiltration with EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) compared with postsurgical administration of standardized intravenous (IV) morphine sulfate or Sponsor-approved equivalent for postsurgical analgesia in adult patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy with general anesthesia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female, at least 18 years of age. Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic segmental colectomy with planned primary anastamosis, as defined by cecectomy, right hemicolectomy, resection of transverse colon, left hemicolectomy, or sigmoidectomy. (Note: patients who converted from a planned laparoscopic colectomy to an open colectomy were not eligible.) Ability to provide informed consent, adhere to study visit schedule, and complete all study assessments. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions or intolerance to any local anesthetic, opioid, or propofol. Patients who abuse alcohol or other drug substance. Patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients currently pregnant or who may become pregnant during the course of the study or who are unwilling to use acceptable means of contraception for at least 1 month before and 1 month after dosing. Acceptable means of contraception include hormonal contraceptives (e.g., oral, injectable, implantable), effective barrier methods (e.g., condoms with spermicide), intrauterine device, lifestyle with a personal choice of abstinence, nonheterosexual lifestyle, or in a strictly monogamous relationship with a partner who has had a vasectomy. Patients with any psychiatric, psychological, or other condition that the Investigator feels may make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this clinical study. Participation in an EXPAREL study within the last 30 days. Patients who have received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration, or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the patient's participation in this study. In addition, a patient was ineligible if he or she met the following criteria during surgery: Patients who had any concurrent surgical procedure. Patients with unplanned multiple segmental resections of large intestine. Patients who converted from laparoscopicassisted colectomy to traditional open colectomy. Patients who had unplanned, temporary or permanent colostomies, ileostomies, or the like placed. Patients who received intraoperative administration of opioids (other than fentanyl or analogs) or any other analgesic, local anesthetics, or antiinflammatory agents. Patients who received Entereg.</criteria>
