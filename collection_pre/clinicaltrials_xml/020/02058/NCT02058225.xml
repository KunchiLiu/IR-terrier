	<brief_summary>The purpose is to study the effect of infant nutrition on brain development, as measured using Magnetic Resonance (MR) techniques. The investigators will collect detailed information about the diet of each of the infants, and seek to correlate this information with multiple MR measurements, including structural imaging, diffusion imaging, and functional connectivity. The MR scans will be performed at birth and 3 months of age. Dietary information collected will include detailed food diaries describing the feeding habits of the infants, and food frequency questionnaires to characterize the diet of the mother.</brief_summary>
