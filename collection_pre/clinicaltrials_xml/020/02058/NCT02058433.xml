	<brief_summary>Platinum-based doublets including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or docetaxel are standard 1st regimens in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC). The traditional method of individualizing cytotoxic drug dose is by using body surface area(BSA), which is not correlated with the ability of an individual to metabolize or excrete cytotoxic drugs, because it is not related to liver function and is poorly correlated with glomerular filtration rate, and does not seem to be a determinant of toxicity. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve have been shown to correlate with toxicity. The advantages of using a fixed dose of antineoplastic agents for all of the patients are obvious. Pharmacokinetically guided treatment would avoid severe adverse effects, which has not been sufficiently investigated in advanced NSCLC.First, the investigators monitor the blood concentrations of paclitaxel and neutropenia blood toxicity after chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients of NSCLC and verify suitable paclitaxel therapeutic window for Chinese patients. Then the investigators compare safety and efficacy between individual paclitaxel dose adjustment based on the therapeutic window compared with conventional dosage.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For inclusion in the study treatment period patients must fulfil all of the following criteria: 1. Provision of informed consent. 2. Male or female aged 18 years and over. 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. 4. Locally advanced Stage not amenable to local therapy (e.g. pleural effusion) or metastatic disease. 5. No prior chemotherapy, biological (including targeted therapies such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR) and Vascular Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors) or immunological therapy. Patients who are willing to accept with paclitaxel and carboplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy will be eligible. 6. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2. 7. Females of childbearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test. Sexually active males and females (of childbearing potential) willing to practice contraception during the study. 8. Laboratory values within the range, as defined below, within two weeks of randomization: Absolute neutrophils count(ANC)≥2.0×109/L Platelets≥100×109/L Serum bilirubin≤2×ULN; Aspartate transaminase(AST) and alanine tansaminase (ALT) ≤2.5×ULN(≤5×ULN if liver metastases) Creatinine clearance≥60ml/min 9. Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST) criteria with at least one measurable lesion not previously irradiated. 10. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks. Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study: 1. As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal disease). 2. Newly diagnosed Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases that have not yet been definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation. 3. Known severe hypersensitivity to carboplatin, paclitaxel or any of the excipients of these products.Known severe hypersensitivity to premedications required for treatment with carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy. 4. Prior treatment with paclitaxel. 5. Current treatment with target drug and biological therapy. 6. Pregnant or lactating woman. 7. Prior chemotherapy, biological (including targeted therapies such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR) and Vascular Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors) or immunological therapy were received even if treatment was not paclitaxel and was completed in 4 weeks before day1 of study treatment. 8. Other coexisting malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ. 9. Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks. 10. Unable to tolerate carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy, as judged by the investigator.</criteria>
