	<brief_summary>This randomized, pilot phase I trial studies whether phone or email reminders increases vaginal dilator use in patients with endometrial, cervical, or vaginal cancers after they undergo brachytherapy. Brachytherapy is a type of internal radiation which uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. A reminder program may help increase use of vaginal dilators and decrease long-term side effects following brachytherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phone or Email Reminder in Increasing Vaginal Dilator Use in Patients With Gynecologic Cancers Undergoing Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether vaginal dilator adherence is improved with additional reminder phone calls and/or email reminder survey. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether there are differences in the length of vaginal canal between the non-intervention and intervention groups. Evaluate rates of gynecologic, urinary, and gastrointestinal toxicity. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I: Patients receive no additional reminders. ARM II: Patients receive a reminder email survey every 2 weeks for 1 year after completing radiation. ARM III: Patients receive a reminder email survey as in Arm I and 4 additional phone calls at 4-8 weeks, 3-5 months, 7-8 months, and 10-11 months during their first year of follow-up. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 10-14 weeks, 5-7 months, 8-10 months, 11-13 months, 15-17 months, 19-21 months, and 23-25 months post treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with gynecologic cancer who are undergoing vaginal brachytherapy as part of their treatment Patients cannot have previously received pelvic external beam radiation or brachytherapy. Patients may be enrolled while undergoing vaginal brachytherapy radiation treatment. Patients should have a life expectancy of at least 1 year No Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or Karnofsky performance status requirements No organ and marrow function requirements Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have received prior pelvic external beam radiation or brachytherapy will be excluded No restrictions regarding use of other investigational agents No exclusion requirements due to comorbid disease or intercurrent illness No investigational agent, so no exclusion requirements regarding history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to investigational agent or device No exclusion criteria relating to concomitant medications No exclusion criteria for pregnant or nursing patients from participating in this study (Of note, pregnant patients will not be treated with vaginal brachytherapy, a requirement for enrolling on this study)</criteria>
