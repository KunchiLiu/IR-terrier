	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting an open-label study of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for adult patients with mildly-moderately active ulcerative colitis. In this pilot study the investigators will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of a single application of FMT delivered colonoscopically. The investigators will also characterize the impact of FMT on the microbiota of the recipient and determine if it correlates with the microbiota from the FMT donor.</brief_summary>
