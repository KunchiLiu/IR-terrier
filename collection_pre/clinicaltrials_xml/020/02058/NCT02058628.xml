	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, comparator-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group study. The current study proposes to compare a fixed-dose combination product containing 3% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and 1% clindamycin against a cream containing 20% azelaic acid for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris. The results of the study will enable a better assessment of the safety and efficacy of the new dose regime (BPO 3% + clindamycin 1%) in comparison to a well established treatment. Based on the data more evidence based recommendations will be possible to improve the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris. A total of 220 subjects will be enrolled and will have 5 study visits (Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12). The duration of the study will be over 12 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who are males or females 12 to 45 years of age, inclusive. Subjects with acne vulgaris who have: a minimum of 17 to a maximum of 60 inflammatory facial lesions (papules and pustules), including the nose, and no more than 1 facial nodular cystic lesions and a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 125 noninflammatory facial lesions (open and closed comedones) and an ISGA score of 2 or 3. Subjects agreeing not to use sunbeds or undergo any ultraviolet (UV) light treatment for 4 weeks prior to entering the study and to minimize the amount of exposure to direct sunlight for the duration of the study. Subjects who are capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary informed consent before any protocolspecific procedures are performed. Subjects under the legal age of consent must provide assent and have the written, informed consent of both parents or legal guardians. Unable to comply with the requirement of the study. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or sexually active and not using reliable contraception and/or not prepared to do so for the duration of the trial (a negative pregnancy test must be confirmed at Visit 1, 3, 4 and 5, for all females if menarche has occurred). Subjects who have any clinically relevant finding at their baseline physical examination or medical history such as severe systemic diseases or diseases of the facial skin other than acne vulgaris. Subjects who have facial hair that may obscure the accurate assessment of acne grade. Subjects who have a history or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (eg, ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, or a history of antibioticassociated colitis) or similar symptoms. Prior Therapy: Have received treatment with the following therapies at the times specified prior to Baseline: systemic retinoids [6 months]; systemic antibiotics, investigational therapy, facial procedure (chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion, artificial UV therapy), topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids [4 weeks]; topical antibiotics on the face, topical antiacne medications (eg, BPO, retinoids, azelaic acid, resorcinol, salicylates, sulfacetamide sodium and derivatives, glycolic acid) [2 weeks]; medications that are reported to exacerbate acne (eg, megadoses of certain vitamins such as vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamins B2, B6, and B12; haloperidol; halogens such as iodide and bromide; lithium; hydantoin; and phenobarbital) as these may impact efficacy assessments, neuromuscular blocking agents (Clindamycin has neuromuscular blocking activities, which may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents), drugs known to be photosensitizers (eg, thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of increased phototoxicity [1 day]. Subjects who are unwilling to stop using the following types of facial products during the study: astringents, toners, abradants, facials, peels containing glycolic or other acids, masks, washes or soaps containing BPO, sulfacetamide sodium or salicylic acid, nonmild facial cleansers, or moisturizers that contain retinol, salicylic acid, or alpha or betahydroxy acids. Subjects who have a known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any of the active components (azaleic acid, lincomycin, clindamycin, BPO), or excipients of the study medication. Use of estrogens, including oral, implanted, and topical contraceptives, androgens, or antiandrogenic agents of less than 12 consecutive weeks prior to start of study dosing (change of the dose or drug is not permitted between 12 weeks prior study dosing until end of the study).</criteria>
