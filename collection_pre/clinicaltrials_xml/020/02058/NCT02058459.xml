	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of Targeted Lung Denervation (or TLD) in patients suffering from moderate to severe COPD. It is hypothesized that TLD will have a similar safety profile and improved physiological and functional outcomes to a sham-control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Lung Denervation for Patients With Moderate to Severe COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, sequential two phase multicenter, randomized double-blind, safety, &amp; feasibility study. The goal of AIRFLOW-1 will be to compare two energy doses and select the optimal energy dose to be utilized in AIRFLOW-2. The goal of AIRFLOW-2 is to compare the optimal energy dose to a sham control. All subjects will be followed for a minimum of 3 years.</detailed_description>
