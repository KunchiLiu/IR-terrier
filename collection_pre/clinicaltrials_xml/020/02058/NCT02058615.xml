	<brief_summary>Male partners of women with breast cancer experience distress, so we want to develop a way to support them so they, in turn, can care for their wives. The purpose is to pilot test an online male spouse transition toolkit (MaTT) that the research team has developed. The specific aims are to: a) evaluate the Toolkit for ease of use, acceptability, and feasibility, and; b) collect preliminary data to determine potential effectiveness of the Toolkit in increasing hope, general self-efficacy and quality of life, and its potential effectiveness in decreasing guilt scores for male partners of women with breast cancer (stages 1-3).</brief_summary>
