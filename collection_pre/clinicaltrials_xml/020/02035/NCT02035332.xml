	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the use of the Aurora Ablation System in reducing menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-treatment. The occurrence of adverse events will be assessed along with an assessment of the reduction of uterine bleeding as measured by a pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBLAC) or menstrual diary.</brief_summary>
