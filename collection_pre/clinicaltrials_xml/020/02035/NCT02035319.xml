	<brief_summary>In this research study investigators want to learn more about capillary malformations which are also known as port wine stains. Investigators are asking children with capillary malformations (port wine stains) to be in the research, because investigators do not have a good idea of what to expect from the current treatments of these malformations. These malformations are treated with laser as clinically indicated and there are no standardized methods to assess improvement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Laser Treatment on Capillary Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capillary malformations, specifically port wine stains, occur in one of every 12,000 live births (0.3% of newborns) with 90% on the face or neck. Pulsed dye laser therapy targeted at hemoglobin (i.e., 585 nm Â± 5 nm) is commonly used to lessen the visual coloration and increase skin lightness. Presently, the outcomes of laser treatment are difficult to predict, in part due to the difficulty in quantifying the tissue changes with visual inspection methods. Quantitative skin imaging methods are currently being applied to measure the features and response to treatment for infantile hemangiomas. The current study proposes to apply these methods in the treatment of capillary malformations, e.g., port wine stains. The purpose is to determine (1) the effects of laser treatment on capillary malformations (using quantitative skin imaging methods and standard clinical assessment and (2) the relationships between the imaging outcomes immediately after treatment and after healing. In the within-subject design we aim to measure color, temperature, blood concentration and tissue mechanical properties for the capillary malformation relative to an un-involved site at baseline (prior to treatment), immediately following laser surgery and over time. Imaging outputs will be compared to the standard clinical evaluation in up to 100 patients from the Hemangioma and Vascular Malformation Center (HVMC) at regular intervals to determine changes over time. Skin sites will be imaged for color (size, erythema, blue color, lightness, excess erythema, uniformity), thermography, blood concentration and tissue mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity). Skin characteristics will be examined at baseline, prior to surgery, immediately following laser treatment, just prior to discharge and at 2 and 4-6 weeks following treatment. For subjects receiving multiple laser treatments, the procedures will be repeated after each surgery. Enrollment will occur over 2 years. Patients will be evaluated for a period of up to 6 months following the last surgery. We expect the research to provide objective measures to clarify the effectiveness of laser treatment and permit effective measurement of tumor response for therapeutic protocols.</detailed_description>
