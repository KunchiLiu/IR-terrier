	<brief_summary>Regular breakfast consumption may help lower body weight reduce body fatness and improve cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the best kind of breakfast to consume to achieve these effects is unclear. We hypothesized that a high fiber breakfast would suppress appetite, lower body weight and improve cardiovascular disease risk factors compared with a no-fiber breakfast.</brief_summary>
