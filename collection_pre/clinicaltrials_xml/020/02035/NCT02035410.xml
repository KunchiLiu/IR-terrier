	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infections have been increasing out of proportion to the number of devices implanted We investigated recent trends and possible causes of the increasing numbers of Cardiovascular implantable electronic device infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decrease Implantation Site INFECTION (DISINFECTION I): a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are many studies on the preventive use of Antibiotics or povidone iodine to Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. But, studies of prophylactic use of hydrogen peroxide is still limited. We had planned research on effects of preventive using hydrogen peroxide before cardiac devices insertion.</detailed_description>
