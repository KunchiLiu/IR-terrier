	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-dependent impact of 6 month freeze-dried blueberry powder intake on insulin sensitivity and resistance, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and lung and cognitive function in overweight and obese participants with metabolic syndrome. We will also examine acute post-prandial effects of blueberry intake (at baseline and at 6-months).</brief_summary>
