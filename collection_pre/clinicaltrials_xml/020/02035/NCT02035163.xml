	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass graft is a common complication. The investigators have thought that the mechanism of temporarily postoperative atrial fibrillation is closely related to the autonomic nervous system imbalance. In a last several years, cryoablation was substituted for atrial incision in many reports to simplify the maze procedure. However, there has been no comparative study to delineate the feasibility of the use of cryoablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Prevention in Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery With Cryoablation for Ganglionic Plexi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modified maze procedures that use energy sources for the ablation of atrial fibrillation concomitant with cardiac surgery have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation. Cryoablation of atrial fibrillation recently has been shown to lead to outcomes that were at least equivalent to those reported for other energy modalities over both short- and medium-term follow-up times.</detailed_description>
