	<brief_summary>The study aims to assess： 1. whether low-dose colchicine could reduce microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria who have been receiving stable treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) for at least 3 months; 2. whether low-dose colchicine decreases carotid intima-media thickness(IMT) in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria; 3. whether low-dose colchicine slows the progression of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria; 4. whether low-dose colchicine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND—Previous study reported that colchicine 0.5 mg/day, in addition to statins and other standard secondary prevention therapies, was effective for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease. An experiment conducted by Li et al. showed that twenty-four-hour urinary albumin excretion was reduced after 6 months colchicine treatment in rats with diabetic nephropathy.As both micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes are closely associated with inflammation,with the anti-inflammation property,colchicine might reduce risk for micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes. STUDY DESIGN—Patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria(30mg/g Cr≤UACR≤300mg/g Cr) who have received stable dosage of ACEI/ARB for at least 3 months will be randomized to receive colchicine 0.5 mg/day or placebo. This trial includes four phases: - Phases 1: A prospective, randomized，double-blind，placebo control study,aims at evaluating changes of Urinary Albumin To Creatinine Ratio(UACR) from baseline to the 6th month. - Phases 2: A prospective, randomized，double-blind，placebo control study,aims at evaluating changes of CIMT from baseline to the 18th month. - Phases 3: A prospective, randomized，double-blind，control study,aims at evaluating microvascular events from date of randomization until the third year. - Phases 4: A prospective, randomized，double-blind，control study, aims at evaluating macrovascular and microvascular events from date of randomization until the 6th year. SAFETY AND DATA MANAGEMENT-Independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee has been set up to monitor the safety and tolerability of the subjects; this committee will analyze data independent of investigators at the end of any one phase.</detailed_description>
