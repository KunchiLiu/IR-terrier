	<brief_summary>Patients who receive the lateral and sagittal infraclavicular block (LSIB) tend to supinate their hand and forearm which may hamper optimal positioning for surgery of the dorsal side of the hand. The investigators think that this supination is caused by lateral rotation in the shoulder. The main lateral rotator of the shoulder is the infraspinatus muscle, which is innervated by the suprascapular nerve (SSN).The investigators hypothesized that optimal positioning of the hand for surgery on the dorsal side of the hand may be achieved by performing a SSN block (SSNB) in addition to the LSIB.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) I III age between 18 and 70 years body mass index between 20 and 36 kg/m2 scheduled for elective hand surgery. We will measure the angle between wrist and horizontal plane while the patient is supine and the extended arm 75° abducted. Patient who are not able to pronate the hand ≤15° before block performance, will be excluded from the study. Patients will also be excluded if they are pregnant, have contraindications to regional anesthesia, coagulation disorder, allergy to local anesthetics (LA), atrioventricular block, peripheral neuropathy or drugtreated diabetes. Patients using other anticoagulation drugs than acetylsalicylic acids or dipyridamol will be excluded.</criteria>
