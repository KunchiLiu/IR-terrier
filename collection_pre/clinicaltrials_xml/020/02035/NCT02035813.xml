	<brief_summary>Several studies have indicated that determining prevalence and number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at various time points during treatment may be an effective tool for assessing treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, even if the prognostic value of CTCs in MBC is well understood, the role of both CTC prevalence and CTC phenotype in predicting treatment response needs further investigation. DETECT IV is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase II study in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and persisting HER2-negative circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Additional research on CTC dynamics and characteristics will provide a better understanding of the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs and is one step into a more personalized therapy for MBC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>In General for both study cohorts 1. Metastatic breast cancer, which cannot be cured by surgery or radiotherapy. The primary tumor and/or biopsies must have be confirmed as cancer by histolopathology. 2. HER2 status (as investigated on all primary tumor tissue and/or biopsies from metastatic sites or loco regional recurrences) must be negative. HER2negativity is defined as (i.e.: immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 01+ or 2+ and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) negative or just FISH negative, whichever was performed) in all tissue samples. 3. Evidence of CTCs. At least one CTC has been detected in 7.5 ml patient blood by means of the CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit (Veridex LLC, Raritan, USA). 4. HER2 negativity of all detected CTCs. HER2negativity is defined as staining &lt; HER2 3+. 5. Adequate organ function within 7 days before date of recruitment, evidenced by the following laboratory results: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/µL platelet count ≥ 100000/µL hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3.0 × ULN AST (SGOT) ≤ 3.0 × ULN bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN creatinine ≤ 2.0 × ULN. 6. Written informed consent in study participation. 7. Undergoing a rebiopsy prior to inclusion if tissue is accessible, which can be safely biopsied, is otional but desirable. 8. Tumor evaluation has been performed within 6 weeks before date of recruitment and results are available. 9. Patients must have at least one not previously irradiated lesion that can be evaluated according to RECIST version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009). Patients with measurable and nonmeasurable disease are eligible. Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. 10. Age ≥ 18 years. 11. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2. For Everolimus only: Indication for an endocrine therapy (Histological confirmation of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor positive (PgR+) breast cancer). Up to two lines of previous cytostatic treatment for MBC. Any endocrine therapy in the history is allowed. Cholesterol ≤ 2.0 × ULN. Disease progression following prior treatment with endocrine therapy (endocrine therapy does not have to be the last therapy before inclusion in the trial). Postmenopausal women. The investigator must confirm postmenopausal status Postmenopausal status is defined either by Age ≥ 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea and postmenopausal levels of FSH and LH Prior hysterectomy and has postmenopausal levels of FSH and LH Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy For Eribulin only: Either hormonereceptor negative MBC or hormonereceptor positive MBC with indication for chemotherapy Up to three previous chemotherapy treatment lines for metastatic disease In case of patients of child bearing potential: Negative pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days prior to recruitment Contraception by means of a reliable method (i.e. nonhormonal contraception, IUD, a double barrier method, vasectomy of the sexual partner, complete sexual abstinence). Patient must consent in maintaining such contraception until 3 months after completion of study treatment In General for both study cohorts: 1. Treatment with other investigational agents of any type or anticancer therapy during the trial, within 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment. 2. Adverse events due to prior anticancer therapy which are &gt; Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) and therapeutically relevant at time of treatment start. 3. Known HIV infection. 4. Current active hepatitis B or C, cliniclally relevant known liver dysfunction, e.g. according to Child Pugh Classification class B and C, or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic nonviral liver disease per investigator assessment). 5. Concurrent disease or condition that might interfere with adequate assessment or evaluation of study data, or any medical disorder that would make the patient's participation unreasonably hazardous. 6. Other malignant diseases within the last 3 years (apart from carcinoma in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer) 7. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric or social condition which would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or which might interfere with the patient's adherence to the protocol. 8. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months. 9. Male gender. For Everolimus only: Known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other mTOR inhibitors, e.g. Sirolimus (rapamycin), or any of the other given drugs. Disease or condition, which might restrain the ability to take or resorb oral medication. This includes malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption (for example resection of small bowel or stomach), uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) and any other diseases significantly affecting gastrointestinal function as well as inability to swallow and retain oral medication for any other reason. For Eribulin only: History of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to eribulin. Preexisting neuropathy grade 3 or higher. Severe Congenital long QT syndrome. Pregnancy or nursing.</criteria>
