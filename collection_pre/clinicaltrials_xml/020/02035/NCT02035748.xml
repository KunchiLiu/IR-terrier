	<criteria>Diagnosis of vitreomacular traction/symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMT/sVMA), with evidence of focal VMA visible on Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT).

Broad VMT/VMA &gt;1500 microns at baseline. History of vitrectomy in the study eye. History of laser photocoagulation to the macula in the study eye. Any relevant concomitant ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could be expected to worsen or require surgical intervention during the study period. Macular hole of &gt;400µm diameter in the study eye. High myopia in the study eye. Pseudoexfoliation, Marfan's syndrome, phacodonesis or any other finding in the Investigator's opinion suggesting lens/zonular instability. Aphakia. History of retinal detachment. Diabetic retinopathy, ischaemic retinopathies, retinal vein occlusions. Recent ocular surgery or ocular injection. Vitreous hemorrhage. Exudative agerelated macular degeneration (AMD). Therapy with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to Visit 1. Active, simultaneous enrollment in another ophthalmology clinical study. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
