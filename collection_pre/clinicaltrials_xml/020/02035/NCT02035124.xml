	<brief_summary>Although there have been advances in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), all patients eventually develop resistance to available therapy. Docetaxel is the accepted first-line agent followed by cabazitaxel in the post-docetaxel phase. In this study the investigators propose to evaluate BKM120, a PI3K inhibitor, with cabazitaxel in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel and BKM120 in Patients With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Previously Treated With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two parts. In a lead-in cohort, the feasibility and safety of administering BKM120 with a standard dose of cabazitaxel will be assessed. If safety is confirmed, a subsequent Phase II portion will assess the activity of the combination in patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel. The treatment will consist of 3-week (21-day) cycles. The ultimate purpose of this study will be to determine progression-free survival, response rate, disease control rate and overall survival of patients treated with the combination regimen and compare outcomes to historical results with single-agent cabazitaxel.</detailed_description>

In addition, previous treatment with hormonal agents and/or immune therapy is allowed (e.g., abiraterone). (Previous treatment with MDV3100 will also be allowed.) 4. Patients must be castrateresistant (i.e. developed progression of metastases following surgical castration or during medical androgen ablation therapy) with documented castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl). 5.

Bone scan progression defined by 2 or more new lesions on bone scan. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression is determined by a minimum of three rising PSA levels with an interval of ≥1 week between each determination.

Ability to swallow and retain oral medication. 12. Life expectancy of ≥6 months. 13. Patients must be ≥18 years of age. 14. Patients entering this study must be willing to provide tissue from a previous tumor biopsy or 15 unstained slides (if available) for correlative testing. If tissue is not available, a patient will still be eligible for enrollment into the study. 15. Ability to understand the nature of this study and give written informed consent. 1. Previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors. 2. Known hypersensitivity to BKM120 or polysorbate80 or any of the excipients or taxanes. 3. Use of an investigational drug ≤21 days or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of BKM120. For investigational drugs for which 5 halflives is ≤21 days, a minimum of 10 days between termination of the investigational drug and administration of BKM120 is required. 4. Previous chemotherapy with any agent other than docetaxel. All patients must be ≥28 days after their most recent chemotherapy and have recovered from side effects. 5. Patient has received wide field radiotherapy (including therapeutic radioisotopes such as strontium 89) ≤28 days or limited field radiation for palliation ≤7 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy. 6. Major surgical procedures ≤28 days of beginning study drug, or minor surgical procedures ≤7 days. No waiting required following portacath placement. 7. Clinical significant peripheral neuropathy (defined as CTCAE v4.0 Grade ≥2) regardless of causality. 8. Mood disorders as judged by the Investigator or a Psychiatrist, or who meets the cutoff score of ≥12 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)9 or a cutoff score of ≥ 15 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)7 mood scale, respectively, or selects a positive response of '1, 2, or 3' to question 9 regarding potential for suicidal thoughts in the PHQ9 (independent of the total score or the PHQ9) anxiety or depression ≥ Grade 3 medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessivecompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempt or ideation, or homicidal ideation, or patients with active severe personality disorders (defined according to DSM IV) are not eligible. Note: for patients with psychotropic treatments ongoing at baseline, the dose and the schedule should not be modified 9. Previously untreated brain metastases. Patients who have received radiation or surgery for brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease progression, and at least 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed since treatment. Patients are not permitted to receive enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) during the study and should not be receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy for CNS metastases. 10.
