	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to identify the novel periodontal disease biomarkers using differentially expressed microRNA in the saliva. The severity of chronic periodontal diseases and the time of pre- and post-treatment are major classification criteria. The obtained data will secure the foundation for the development of a new non-invasive diagnostic methods for early diagnosis &amp; prognosis prediction of periodontal disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A. Severe Periodontal Disease Patients with chronic severe periodontitis Primary treatment of periodontal scaling, subgingival curettage is required, and the general progress of the protocol agreed with the basic periodontal therapy patients. subjects agreed collecting saliva and gingival crevicular fluid and physicochemical tests and genetic testing A. Moderate Periodontal Disease Patients with chronic moderate periodontitis Primary treatment of periodontal scaling, subgingival curettage is required, and the general progress of the protocol agreed with the basic periodontal therapy patients. subjects agreed collecting saliva and gingival crevicular fluid and physicochemical tests and genetic testing C. Healthy Control Healthy periodontal patients ( more than 20 permanent teeth are present , in all parts of deep periodontal pockets measuring 4mm or less, and height is 2mm or less clinical attachment person) subjects agreed collecting saliva and gingival crevicular fluid and physicochemical tests and genetic testing Received periodontal treatment within the last six months recently taken antibiotics within 3 months if you need a prescription antibiotic prophylaxis taking the drug can affect periodontal status for a long period of time pregnant or breastfeeding In case of oral inflammatory mucosal disease (Lichen planus, etc.) A history of alcoholism or drug abuse if other special systemic disease (high blood pressure) ages under 18</criteria>
