	<brief_summary>This study addresses postures and range of motion in cervical dystonia (Spasmodic Torticollis). It uses 3D miniature and wireless motion captures sensors, and aims to increase the understanding of the biomechanics of the movement disorders of the cervical column in this pathology. In addition, the clinical state of cervical dystonia of the patients will be assessed, using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS). The investigators will compare the results between control and study groups.</brief_summary>
