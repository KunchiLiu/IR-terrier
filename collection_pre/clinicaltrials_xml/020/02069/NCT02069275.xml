	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the frequency of bleeding and haematomas in patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention via femoral artery and mobilized immediately after the procedure, compared to those mobilized after two hours (following the standard regimen). At the same time the investigators will investigate whether it reduces the discomfort being mobilized immediately after the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Mobilization After Cardiac Catheterisation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The frequency of hematoma, bleeding or pseudoaneurysm at the access site in the groin is 7-15% with regimens that involve 0-2 hours of bed rest, somewhat more frequent after Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than coronary angiography (CAG). There seems to be no reduction in the complications of the CAG or PCI by maintaining the bed rest for more than 2 hours after the procedure. Angio-Seal seems most effective of current closure devices. There is less discomfort associated with early compared with late mobilization. Protamine reverse heparin's effect without the side effects of that regime. There lacks a larger randomized study of the safety of mobilizing patients immediately after CAG and after PCI.</detailed_description>
