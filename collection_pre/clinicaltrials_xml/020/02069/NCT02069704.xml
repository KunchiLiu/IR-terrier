	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open label, randomized bioequivalence study of BEVZ92 (bevacizumab biosimilar) and Avastin® with 2 parallel arms to compare the PK profile of BEVZ92 and Avastin® in combination with FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI chemotherapy. FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI will be chosen as per investigator criteria based on the hospital standard of care.</brief_summary>

Adequate liver function defined within specific parameters 8. Adequate renal function defined within specific parameters 9. Adequate coagulation parameters defined within specific parameters 10. Negative pregnancy test for females of a childbearing potential. 11. Use of an effective form of contraception during the study (for subjects of childbearing potential and their partners). 12. Life expectation ≥ 3 months 1. Prior treatment for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. 2. Prior treatment with an antiangiogenesis agent, in either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. 3. Concurrent use of investigational antineoplastic agents (including up to 4 weeks prior to enrolment). 4. History of any other malignancy unless the malignancy is in complete remission and the patient has been off all therapy for that malignancy for at least 5 years. 5. Chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents; topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed. 6. Scheduled immunization with attenuated live vaccines during study period or within 1 week prior to study entry. 7. Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases. 8. Patients with active bleeding or history of bleeding diathesis on oral antivitamin K medication (except low dose coumadin) within the past 6 month prior to randomization or coagulopathy. 9. Patients with history of cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or subarachnoid haemorrhage within the past 6 month prior to randomization. 10. Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study 11. Patients with serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, or with a major surgical procedure, or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to randomization 12. Patients with clinical symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal obstruction that require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition. 13. Patients with history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within the past 6 months prior to randomization. 14.
