	<brief_summary>To acquire low radiation dose and good quality cardiac CT images requires scanning at low heart rates which is usually done with beta-blockers. However, in some patients beta-blockers have little effect. This is thought to be due to a different mechanism of action which continues to maintain the heart rate despite administration of beta-blockers. This study aims to look at the effect of music or relaxation tracks to reduce patient heart rate as anxiety is thought to play a role in maintaining high heart rates. This study will randomise patients into a normal standard of care group compared to a normal standard of care group with music/ relaxation track and compare heart rate, radiation dose, image quality, amount of beta-blocker used and patient experience via a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire.</brief_summary>
