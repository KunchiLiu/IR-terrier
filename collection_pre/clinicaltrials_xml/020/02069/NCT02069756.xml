	<brief_summary>DuchenneConnect is an online, patient-report registry for individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and carrier females. The purpose of DuchenneConnect is to connect Duchenne and Becker patients with actively recruiting clinical trials and research studies, and to educate patients and families about Duchenne and Becker care and research. At the same time, DuchenneConnect is a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers in academia and industry, allowing access to a de-identified, aggregate dataset provided by patients and their familiesâ€”information that is vital to advances in the care and treatment of Duchenne. DuchenneConnect is a member of PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DuchenneConnect was created in 2007 by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), with assistance from the NIH, the CDC, and Emory Genetics. In early 2011, PPMD alone began financing the registry's operation and maintenance, and is the sole guardian of DuchenneConnect and its material. Questions may be addressed to the DuchenneConnect Coordinators at telephone 888-520-8675 or coordinator@duchenneconnect.org. The DuchenneConnect Coordinators are certified genetic counselors who are available to answer questions regarding the registration process, genetic testing and counseling, and clinical trials and research studies.</detailed_description>
