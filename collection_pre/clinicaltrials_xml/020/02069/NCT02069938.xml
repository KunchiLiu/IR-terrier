	<brief_summary>Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been used to control a number of virtual and physical objects through the voluntary modulation of brain rhythms. Current issues with noninvasive BCIs include exhausting motor imagery tasks and long training times required to achieve competent control. The investigators will address these issues within this protocol, examining new approaches to reduce the effort required by subjects to control a physical object in the task. The PI's hypothesis is: Control of a physical robotic device will increase the performance of subjects in BCI tasks that are analogous to virtual tasks due to greater engagement with a physical output.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be recruited to participate in controlling a physical robotic device such as a quadcopter or a robotic arm using imagination of movement or other activities as detected by brain waves that can be used to control a robotic device. The subjects will be able to observe the controlling of a robotics device using one's thought and participate in multiple sessions to learn the skills to better control such a device.</detailed_description>
