	<brief_summary>The CENTAurus trial is a prospective clinical study designed to address systematically some of the relevant endocrine complications in an iron overloaded thalassemic population, primary objective being the assessment of the effect of deferasirox therapy on glucose metabolism/homeostasis. Other endocrine parameters complementary or supportive to the primary objective will be assessed and analyzed during this study. A number of lab parameters related to other axes of the endocrine system will be collected and analyzed.</brief_summary>
