	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine the relative roles for various testing modalities in the diagnosis and prognosis of mild traumatic brain injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodal Approach to Testing the Acute Effects of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will undergo functional brain testing (magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography), anatomical brain imaging (diffusion tensor imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging), neuropsychological testing (memory, language, processing speed), sleep patterns using actigraphy, and blood testing of candidate biomarkers. Testing will be done at 3 time points post-injury: 1 day, 14 days, and 30 days post-injury. Analysis of these tests collectively will be used to develop diagnostic tools for acute mTBI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Civilian (nonmilitary) presenting to HMH ED. 1. Prior history of diagnosed TBI. 2. Other significant nonhead injury/trauma or open wound. 3. Other significant medical comorbidities, such as heart disease or cancer. 4. Selfreported current use or substances contributing to ED visit (e.g. illicit drugs, medications, alcohol abuse). 5. Currently diagnosed psychological condition (e.g. depression, PTSD). 6. Medications for psychological or neurological disorder. 7. Any implanted metal, such as medical device or braces on teeth. 8. Injury to the back or other injury that will make it difficult for the participant to tolerate tests. 9. Injury to dominant arm that would cause difficulty using computer or responding to stimuli during functional imaging. 10. Pregnancy.</criteria>
