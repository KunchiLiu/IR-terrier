	<brief_summary>This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of OMP-54F28 when combined with sorafenib. OMP-54F28 will be administered IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The planned dose levels of OMP-54F28 are 5 and 10 mg/kg. Depending on safety in this study, additional lower or intermediate dose levels may be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of OMP-54F28 in Combination With Sorafenib in Patients With Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in this study. Alternative dosing schedules of OMP-54F28 may be explored based on emerging nonclinical and clinical data for safety, PD, PK and efficacy. The starting dose for a new dosing schedule will be chosen to result in an AUC equivalent to the highest dose level that cleared on the previously studied dosing schedule. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be allowed within a dose cohort. Sorafenib 400 mg will be given orally twice daily (PO BID). Sorafenib dosing schedules with a total daily dose &lt;800 mg (e.g. Sorafenib 400 mg once daily) may be evaluated in this study depending on emerging safety data from this study.</detailed_description>
