	<brief_summary>Preterm premature rupture of membrane is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory process, enhancing the activity or the availability of antioxidants may modulate the inflammatory response associated with PPROM, thereby reducing oxidative stress and the risk to the fetus. In this study the investigators sought to determine the effects of Pomegranate 1. On the patients (maternal and fetal) oxidative stress and inflammation associated with PPROM. 2. On the time interval from PPROM to delivery and on the patients (fetal )Ph and apger scores</brief_summary>
