	<brief_summary>Relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients may experience long-term survival after allogeneic transplant (alloSCT), but disease recurrence represents the main cause of treatment failure. PET (positron-emission tomography) -positive patients after alloSCT have a dismal outcome. Serum TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) is produced by Reed-Sternberg cells and may be a marker of disease. Our study was aimed at assessing whether TARC levels after alloSCT were correlated to disease status and whether TARC monitoring could increase the ability to predict relapse.</brief_summary>
