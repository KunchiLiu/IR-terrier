	<brief_summary>Bleeding from the staple line is a complication of linear stapling. After clamping, a short period after firing of the laparoscopic linear stapler is recommended. That is, the clinician should continue to press the tissue between the prongs of the device to achieve adequate hemostasis at the staple line. The significance of the waiting period for hemostasis at the staple line has not been empirically clarified in humans. In this study, the investigators compared the number of bleeding points use of the laparoscopic linear stapler. Consequently, the investigators assessed the effects of time after the firing of linear stapling in patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass.</brief_summary>
