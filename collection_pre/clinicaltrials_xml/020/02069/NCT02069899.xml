	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up of HLH Patients Who Received Treatment With NI-0501, an Anti-interferon Gamma Monoclonal Antibody</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to monitor the long-term safety profile of patients who have previously received at least one dose of NI-0501, including survival at several time points after the administration of NI-0501. Moreover to study the elimination profile of NI-0501 and to assess the immunogenicity of NI-0501. Furthermore in the event that patients, upon request of the treating physician, will be maintained on NI-0501 treatment beyond the foreseen 8 weeks, NI-0501 safety, tolerability, efficacy and PK profile will be closely monitored in these patients until treatment discontinuation.</detailed_description>
