	<brief_summary>This research study was conducted to investigate the effects of a high protein diet on the efficiency of energy use at rest and at low-levels of physical activity. The hypothesis was that a high intake of dietary protein would result in a less efficient use of energy in skeletal muscle in older adults.</brief_summary>
