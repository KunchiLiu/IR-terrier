	<brief_summary>For endotracheal entubation in children mostly Miller and Macintosh blades have been used. On the other hand Truview EVO2 laringoscopes can maintain a better laryngeal view without having a direct sight of the airway and without having to align oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes. The aim of this study is to compare the Truview EVO2 laryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscope in terms of intubation difficulty score, time to intubation and intubation quality score.</brief_summary>
