	<brief_summary>Several studies have confirmed that patients with cirrhosis possess an imbalance in procoagulant versus anticoagulant activity due to increased factor VIII and decreased protein C. Moreover, in the last two decades there has been an increased recognition that not only bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. The prevalence and pathogenesis of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma are not clearly defined. The Aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma, and to prospectively assess the risk factors, outcome, and prognosis in these patients. The investigators plan to enroll two hundred patients with liver cirrhosis. The patients are going to follow up for one year and evaluate at baseline and every 6 months by liver function tests, coagulation test, upper abdomen ultrasound. All relevant clinical events will be evaluated at every follow up.</brief_summary>
