	<brief_summary>Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare serious medical condition that causes problems both with the immune system and with easy bruising and bleeding. The immune abnormalities cause patients with WAS to be very susceptible to infections. Depending on the specific type of primary immune deficiency diseases, there are effective treatments, including antibiotics, cellular therapy and gene therapy, but studies of large numbers of patients are needed to determine the full range of causes, natural history, or the best methods of treatment for long term success. This multicenter study combines retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional analyses of the transplant experiences for patients with WAS who have already received HCT since 1990, or who will undergo Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) during the study period. The retrospective and prospective portions of the study will address the impact of a number of pre and post-transplant factors on post-transplant disease correction and ultimate benefit from HCT and the cross-sectional portion of the study will assess the benefit of HCT 2 years post-HCT in consenting surviving patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>WAS participants will be defined as males who have: 1. thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100K) AND EITHER molecular diagnosis of WAS OR reduced WASP expression; OR 2. thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100K) AND positive family history consistent with WAS diagnosis; OR 3. chronic thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100K for minimum of 3 months) AND low mean platelet volume (MPV below normal range for age) AND EITHER recurrent and/or severe infections requiring treatment and/or eczema OR lack of antibody response to polysaccharide antigens or low IgM. Longitudinal Analysis (Retrospective and Prospective) 1. Stratum A. Participants with WAS who have or will Receive HCT Participants with WAS who have received an HCT since January 1, 1990 2. Stratum B. Participants with WAS who have or will Receive Gene Transfer Participants in which the intention is to treat with gene transfer with autologous modified cells CrossSectional Analysis (Strata A and B) 1. Participants with WAS who are surviving and at least 2 years after the most recent HCT or gene therapy. As this is a natural history study, for both the Longitudinal Analysis and the CrossSectional Analysis we will not exclude any patients due to race or age who fit the inclusion criteria.</criteria>
