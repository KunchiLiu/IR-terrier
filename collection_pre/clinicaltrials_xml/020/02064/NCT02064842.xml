	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TMC647055 in combination with ritonavir (Part 1); potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between TMC435 and the combination of TMC647055 with ritonavir; and to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability when TMC435, TMC647055 and Ritonavir are co-administered (Part 2) in healthy Japanese participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of TMC647055 in Combination With Ritonavir (Part 1) and the Co-administration of TMC435, TMC647055 and Ritonavir (Part 2) in Healthy Japanese Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center study which consists of 2 parts, sequentially conducted in 2 separate panels of 24 healthy adult Japanese participants each. Part 1 is a double-blinded (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) single ascending dose (SAD) part which will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up visit. Part 1 will have 3 cohorts (Cohort A, B, and C) with 8 participants each and they will be randomly assigned to receive either a single oral dose of TMC647055 (6 participants) or placebo (2 participants) in combination with RTV. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 5 weeks from screening to follow-up visit as maximum in Part 1. Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover part which will consist of a screening phase, 3 treatment phases, and a follow-up phase. Each of the 24 participants will receive Treatment A, B, and C in 6 sequences (Treatment ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, and CBA) with a washout period of at least 7 days between consecutive treatments. Safety evaluation will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examination. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 10 weeks from screening to follow-up visit as maximum.</detailed_description>
