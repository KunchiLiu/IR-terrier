	<brief_title>Enzalutamide and Hormone Therapy Before, During, and After Radiation for High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- this pilot study will assess the safety and tolerability of combining enzalutamide with an gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) and external beam radiation - Correlative imaging and tissue biopsy analysis will be performed to assess the radiographic response to enzalutamide plus gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) therapy as well as intratumoral androgen signaling</detailed_description>
