	<brief_summary>open label, single centre, randomised, Phase IV, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety study to evaluate single and multiple doses of 45, 60, and 90 mg of ticagrelor in Chinese patients with stable coronary heart disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor China Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 36 patients will be randomized in order to ensure 10 patients per treatment are evaluable.Ticagrelor will be supplied as 45 mg, 60mg, and 90mg tablets.
