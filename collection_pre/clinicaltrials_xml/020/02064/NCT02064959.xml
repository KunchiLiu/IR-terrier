	<brief_summary>This randomized, prospective trial will study the effect of very early cooling in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of acute subdural hematomas (35°C prior to opening the dura followed by maintenance at 33°C for a minimum of 48h). Intravascular cooling catheters (Thermogard XP Device, Zoll) will be utilized to induce hypothermia or to maintain normothermia. The primary objective is to determine if rapid induction of hypothermia prior to emergent craniotomy for traumatic subdural hematoma (SDH) will improve outcome as measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) at 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury 2. GCS motor score ≤5 (not following commands) 3. Estimated or known age 2265 years 4. Acute subdural hematoma requiring emergent craniotomy within 6 hours of initial injury 5. Estimated time of injury to time to reach temp of 35°C&lt;6 hrs 1. Total GCS = 3 and bilateral fixed and dilated pupils 2. Following commands after an initial period of coma (GSC motor score of 6) 3. Known preexisting neurological deficit (e.g., previous TBI, stroke) 4. Concomitant spinal cord injury 5. Arrival temperature is &lt;35°C 6. Hemodynamic instability (i.e., MAP&lt;60mmHg for 30 minutes) 7. Active cardiac dysrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic instability 8. Pregnancy 9. Duret hemorrhage 10. Prisoner or Ward of the State 11. Known history of clotting disorder (e.g., heparin induced thrombocytopenia, PE/DVT) 12. Injury to other body organ where hypothermia would be precluded because of bleeding risk (e.g., grade 3 liver laceration; bowel laceration; flail lung or INR&gt;1.4) 13. Inability to obtain informed consent or utilize exception to informed consent for emergency research.</criteria>
