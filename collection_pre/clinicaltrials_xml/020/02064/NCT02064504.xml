	<brief_summary>GSK961081 is a novel bifunctional molecule that combines muscarinic antagonism and beta2-agonism in a single molecule and is in development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is a randomised, open-label, six-way crossover, single dose study. This study evaluates the drug delivery and systemic pharmacokinetics of GSK961081 following concurrent administration of GSK961081 and fluticasone furoate via dry powder inhaler (DPI) in comparison to GSK961081 DISKUS. There will be six treatment periods and 7 days washout period in the study. Subjects will attend the unit in the morning for dosing and will be resident until 12 hours post administration. All subjects will receive six treatments.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male/females aged between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator determines that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 to 29.0 kilogram (kg)/meter (m)^2 (inclusive). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 MlU/mL and estradiol less than 40 picogram (pg)/mL (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or urine hCG test prior to dosing AND Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for 5 terminal halflives after the end of the study (i.e. until after the followup visit is complete). OR has only samesex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin greater than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%). Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) greater than or equal to 85% predicted and a FEV1/ Forced Vital capacity (FVC) ratio greater than or equal to 0.7 Based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate Electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period: QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) less than 450 millisecond. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An average weekly intake of greater than 21 units for males or greater than 14 units for females. In Australia one unit (= standard drink) is equivalent to 10 gram of alcohol: 270 mL of full strength beer (4.8%), 375 mL of mid strength beer (3.5%), 470 mL of light beer (2.7%), 250 mL premix full strength spirit (5%), 100 mL of wine (13.5%) and 30 mL of spirit (40%). History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. Urinary cotinine/ Breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening and a pack year history of &lt;/=10 pack years. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Lactating females. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day</criteria>
