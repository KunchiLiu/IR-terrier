	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was observed in over 30% of organ recipients with high morbidity. Moreover, no prophylaxis, 75% R + D-transplanted, 55%, R + D + and D-25% R + develop CMV. The number of available antiviral drugs is reduced and noticeable side effects (neutropenia, renal toxicity) lead to premature discontinuation of therapy or the use of reduced doses that promote non-response to treatment and the emergence of resistance. In case of neutropenia, there are more an increased risk of secondary rejection due to the reduction of immunosuppressive treatment rendered necessary by the haematological reached. Rational use of these molecules is necessary with essential today as the optimal duration of prophylaxis primary issues and the prophylaxis of recurrences in case of CMV infection reported in.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Risk of CMV Infection of the Renal Transplant About R + by Cellular Immunity Analyzed by the QuantiFERON ®-CMV Test.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>QuantiFERON-CMV ® is a fast and standardized test that evaluates the CMV specific cellular immunity measuring the amount of secreted Interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in plasma by ELISA. It uses more epitopes of proteins including CMV glycoprotein B (gB), protein IE-1 and protein pp65 and protein pp50, which are specific for (human leukocyte antigen) HLA class I. Pretreatment of the sample is simple and plasma can be stored, frozen, for a delayed dose of interferon.</detailed_description>
