	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and impairment of oxygen uptake. For example, pneumonia can cause the development of ARDS. Despite modern intensive care treatment, mortality in ARDS patients remains high (40%). Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is the mainstay of ARDS treatment. Controlled MV is the conventional ventilation strategy to ensure lung protective ventilation (low tidal volumes) and recovery of the lungs. However, among disadvantages of controlled MV are the development of respiratory muscle atrophy (due to disuse) and the need for high dose sedatives to prevent patient-ventilator asynchrony. The use of high doses of sedatives and respiratory muscle weakness are associated with increased morbidity, worse clinical outcomes and prolonged MV. Besides controlled MV, a patient can be ventilated with supported ventilation. Supported MV decreases the likelihood to develop muscle atrophy, improves oxygenation and hemodynamics, and lowers consumption of sedatives. However potential disadvantages of supported ventilation include generation of too high tidal volumes, especially in patients with high respiratory drive. A previous study in healthy subjects has shown that titration of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) can decrease activity of inspiratory muscles, while maintaining adequate ventilation. It is hypothesized that low dose NMBA may enable supported MV with adequate tidal volumes, in patients with high respiratory drive.</brief_summary>
