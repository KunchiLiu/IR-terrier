	<brief_title>Bioavailability, Safety, and Pharmacodynamics of Dexlansoprazole Delayed-Release Orally Disintegrating Tablets in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being tested to see if two different forms of the medication react the same way in the human body. This study will look at biological samples from people who take an orally disintegrating tablet of dexlansoprazole compared to a swallowed capsule of dexlansoprazole. The study will enroll approximately 52 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups. Both treatment groups will receive both forms of dexlansoprazole at different time periods: - Two dexlansoprazole 30 mg orally disintegrating tablets for 5 days - One dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsule for 5 days. All participants will be asked to take two tablets or one capsule at the same time each day throughout each treatment period of the study. This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic including two 6-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 5 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 57 days.</detailed_description>

The participant or, when applicable, the participant's legally acceptable representative signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 3. Is a healthy adult male or female participant by Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1). 4. Is aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, by Screening and the first dosing day (Day 1 of Period 1). 5. Weighs at least 50 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive at Screening. 6. If a male participant is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential, he agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent form throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 7. If a female participant of childbearing potential is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner, she agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1) and they must not be nursing. 8. Is in good health as determined by a physician based on medical history, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and physical examination findings at Screening and Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1), as applicable. 9. Has clinical chemistry, hematology, and complete urinalysis (fasted for at least 10 hours) at Screening and Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1) results within the reference range for the testing laboratory unless the out of range results are deemed not clinically significant by the investigator. 1. Has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1). 2. Has ever received dexlansoprazole in a previous clinical study or has received dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole as a therapeutic agent within 28 days prior to Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1). 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant hematologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, immunologic, endocrine, psychiatric disorder or other abnormality (other than the disease being studied), which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 5. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of dexlansoprazole delayedrelease orally disintegrating (OD) tablets or participant has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of dexlansoprazole delayedrelease capsules or other drug with the same mechanism of action (including esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole). 6. Consumed alcohol or drugs of abuse within 7 days prior to checkin (Day 1 of Period 1), has a positive test result for alcohol or drugs of abuse at Screening or Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1), or is unwilling to abstain from alcohol and drugs of abuse throughout the study. 7. Has received any known hepatic or renal clearance altering agents (eg, erythromycin, cimetidine, barbiturates, phenothiazines, fluvoxamine, etc.) within 28 days prior to Day 1 of Period 1. 8. Has had an acute, clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to Day 1 of Period 1. 9.
