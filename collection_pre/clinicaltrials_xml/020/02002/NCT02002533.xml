	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well brief behavioral therapy works in improving sleep disorders in patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Sleep disorder counseling may reduce fatigue and insomnia as well as improve the well-being and quality of life in patients with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brief Behavioral Therapy in Improving Sleep Disorders in Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine recruitment rates to the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT). II. Determine the rate of intervention adherence. III. Determine the feasibility of training National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) clinical research staff to successfully deliver the Brief Behavioral Therapy (BBT) intervention. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on insomnia as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). II. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). III. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on circadian rhythm as measured by the two-oscillator cosinor parameter estimates based on actigraphy data. IV. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on heart rate variability (HRV) as measured by the FirstbeatÂ® ambulatory heart-rate monitor (i.e., 1. respiratory sinus arrhythmia-RSA, 2. standard deviation of all normal R-wave to R-wave intervals--SDNN, 3. root mean square of successive differences between adjacent normal R-wave to R-wave intervals--RMSSD, 4. The ratio of low frequency total spectrum power of all NN intervals between .04 to .15 Hertz to high frequency total spectrum power of all NN intervals between .15 to .40 Hertz--LF/HF ratio, and 5. natural log of low frequency total spectrum power of all NN intervals between 0.04 to 0.15Hz.). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) total score and subscales. II. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on general mood as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) total score and subscales. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients undergo BBT intervention, comprising insomnia education, stimulus control, discouragement of napping and encouragement of exercise, and sleep compression over two 60 minute face-to-face sessions in weeks 1 and 3 or 4, and four 15 minute telephone sessions in weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 4, 5, and 6. ARM II: Patients undergo Healthy Eating Education (HEAL) comprising nutritional education and suggestions for symptom management over two 60 minute face-to-face sessions in weeks 1 and 2 or 3, and four 15 minute telephone sessions in weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 4, 5, and 6. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnosed breast cancer (stage I, II, III) Be receiving chemotherapy in either weekly, 2week or 3week cycles and have at least 6 weeks of chemotherapy treatment remaining; patients are eligible any time before chemotherapy cycle 3 if on a 2 or 3week cycle, or cycle 4 if on a 1week cycle; (Note: use of biologics [e.g., Herceptin (trastuzumab)] is permitted) For patients on a weekly regimen, there should be at least 3 dosages of chemotherapy remaining For patients on either a 2 week or 3 week cycle, there should be at least 2 dosages of chemotherapy remaining Patients will not be dropped from the study if their chemotherapy is discontinued after they are enrolled Report sleep disturbance of 8 (sum total of all 7 items) or greater on the Insomnia Severity Index (Note: this measure will be repeated again at baseline assessment) Report sleep problems that began or got worse with the diagnosis of cancer or with chemotherapy; (did your sleep problems begin or get worse with the diagnosis of cancer or with chemotherapy?) Be able to speak and read English Patients can take sleep aids (e.g., hypnotics and sedatives) for insomnia if they use sleep aids as needed; patients taking sleep aids every night are excluded; use of melatonin every night is permitted and these patients are not excluded Be able and willing to wear an Actiwatch for the entire 24 hours of each day they are scheduled to wear it Have diagnosis of breast cancer stage IV Have sleep problems that began before diagnosis and have not changed since diagnosis Selfreport or have a medical record of an unstable comorbid medical or psychiatric condition that would make it unsafe or impossible to adhere to the study protocol Have a clinical diagnosis of sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome Be unable or unwilling to discontinue anxiolytic medication within 4 hours of intervention sessions Take medication for sleep (e.g., hypnotics and sedatives) every night; melatonin is permitted Patients who are shift workers are excluded; shift worker is defined as someone who has irregular work and sleep hours (such as working a nontraditional schedule: e.g., 4pmmidnight or 10pm6am; a rotating schedule e.g., alternating between day and night shifts, or starting work between 4am and 7am) Have an implanted device for heart failure (e.g., pacemaker, defibrillator, left ventricular assist device, etc.)</criteria>
