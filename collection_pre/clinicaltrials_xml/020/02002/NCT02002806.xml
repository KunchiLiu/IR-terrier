	<brief_title>Surgery Plus Celiac Nerve Block for Long-term Pancreatic Cancer Pain Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thi is a study of pain control in subjects undergoing surgery for pancreatic or bile duct cancer. Subjects undergoing surgery will be randomized to surgery plus celiac plexus neurolysis with ethanol injection versus surgery plus placebo injection. Subjects will be followed every three months for survivorship or death to assess pain, quality of life measures, and narcotic pain control usage. The primary endpoint of pain control will be determined at one year post surgery. Subjects are not required to undergo any additional diagnostic testing procedures that are not part of their routine follow-up care.</detailed_description>
