	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of a 60 second rinse with chlorhexidine, essential oil-based mouthwash, cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash, or saline solution on bacterial contamination in the buccal vestibule when used preoperatively using the real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). We hypothesize that preoperative rinse with chlorhexidine mouthwash will result in greater reduction of bacterial counts than with essential oil-based, cetylpyridinium chloride, or saline mouthwashes. The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the tested mouthwashes in reducing the bacterial counts over time. We hypothesize that preoperative rinse with chlorhexidine mouthwash will result in a reduction of bacterial counts for longer duration than with essential oil-based, cetylpyridinium chloride, or saline mouthwashes.</brief_summary>
