	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis is the most common and feared complication of ERCP, occurring after 1% to 30% of procedures. Since 2012, a multicenter RCT was published in NEJM, indomethacin use in high risk patients was considered a "standard" method to prevent PEP. However, the risk factors of PEP is not fully clear. Rectal indomethacin before ERCP for all patients, not just for selected high-risk patients, may preventing PEP maximum. The purpose of this study is to determine whether routine using of rectal indomethacin is more effective than the conditional strategy.</brief_summary>
