	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized study is to determine if the home SDHD is a suitable alternative to conventional dialysis performed in a dialysis center for patients suffering from chronic kidney disease from Peritoneal Dialysis (HAPD/CAPD). The adequacy of this alternative dialysis technique confirms that the SDHD at home is a viable option for patients coming from HAPD/CAPD and indeed support the clinical benefits of home SDHD compared with those of conventional dialysis: lowering blood pressure and lower use of antihypertensive drugs , improving the quality of life, maintenance of residual renal function related to a reduced risk of death and reduction in operating costs of dialysis and patient transport.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Hemodialysis Vs Short Daily Hemodialysis for Patients Coming From Peritoneal Dialysis (HAPD/CAPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional Hemodialysis - 3 treatments per week for approximately 4 hours- will be performed in a dialysis clinic using any hemodialysis machine. Short Daily Hemodialysis - 5 or 6 treatments per week for approximately 2-4 hours per treatment- will be performed in the patient's home, using any hemodialysis machine. Partecipants randomized to SDHD will undergo an intensive home hemodialysis training program expected to take 2-6 weeks to complete. Qualified healthcare professionals will train each SDHD subject's partner to perform dialysis using any hemodialysis machine as chosen by clinicians. At baseline visit, before the first study treatment in either the SDHD or CHD arm, the following data will be collected: demographic information, ESRD history, EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, vital sign, blood laboratory test results, KT/V parameters, 24 hour timed urine collection test results, comorbid conditions, vascular access type, current medications. After hemodialysis start, patients will be followed up to 12 months with data collection at 1,3,6 and 12 months. At each visit, the following data will be collected: EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, vital sign, blood laboratory test results, KT/V parameters, 24 hour timed urine collection test results, adverse events, vascular access type, current medications. During this study, the following parameters will be strictly monitored: treatment costs, medications, number of hospitalization admissions, number of days in hospital and reasons for hospitalizations, additional costs informations. Home hemodialysis could be an integrated therapeutic option favoring the de-hospitalization of patients requiring hemodialysis. Aim of this study is to offer the patient a better quality of life, to create the conditions for an improvement in blood pressure, phosphate control, of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and to reduce costs for the National Health Service.</detailed_description>
