	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Lutetium-177 Labeled Girentuximab in Patients With Advanced Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II study using Lu-177-DOTA-girentuximab for treatment of patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The trial requires 14 patients. CT scans will be carried out at baseline and after 12 weeks, for response assessment using RECIST criteria. Patients will initially receive 5 mCi/10 mg Indium-111-DOTA-girentuximab antibody (an imaging dose preceeding Lu-177-girentuximab treatment). Whole body and blood measurements of radioactivity will be obtained on at least three occasions for one week to determine targeting and dosimetry. Only if at least one known and evaluable metastatic lesion is visualized with In-111-DOTA-girentuximab, therapeutic Lu-177-DOTA- girentuximab will be administered the following week. In the absence of disease progression and after recovery from toxicity, patients may be retreated no sooner than 12 weeks after the prior treatment with a dose of no more than 75% of the previous dose, for a total of not more than three treatments. Only patients who have normal pharmacokinetics on the preceding diagnostic In-111-girentuximab study (indicative of human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) negativity) are eligible for retreatment.</detailed_description>
