	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Lurasidone in Treatment of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening period (Days -14～-1) In-patients and out-patients are screened. Washout period (Days -7～ -1) Current medications (antipsychotics) must be discontinued within the washout period. The washout period for antipsychotics should be started from at least Day-1. All relevant examinations (except clinical laboratory examinations) and evaluation should be completed before randomization to determine whether the subjects meet all of the protocol-specified criteria. Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups after confirmation of eligibility by screening. Double-blind treatment period (Days 1~42) Subjects need to stay in hospital for at least 3 weeks during this treatment period. The starting dose of lurasidone is 40 mg/day. After administration for 6 consecutive days (Days 1~6 of medication), the dose can be either increased to 80 mg/day or maintained at 40 mg/day until the end of the double-blind treatment period. The starting dose of risperidone is 2 mg/day. After administration for 3 consecutive days (Days 1~3 of medication), the dose will be increased to 4 mg/day administered for additional 3 consecutive days (Days 4~6 of medication). From Day 7, the dose can be either increased to 6 mg/day or maintained at 4mg/day until the end of the double-blind treatment period. The doses can be adjusted weekly at investigator's discretion from Day 7. At week 2, 3, and 4, if the change of PANSS total score from baseline is less than -9, the dose must be increased to the higher dose. The dose can be reduced at any time when drug intolerance issue emerges. Usage of the study drugs is once a day after night meal. Follow-up observation period (Days 43~49) Observe subject's condition and collect safety data.</detailed_description>
