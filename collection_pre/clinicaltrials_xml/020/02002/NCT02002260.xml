	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized clinical trial comparing the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) to combined oral contraceptives (COCs) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. This study is designed to be conducted within the context of a patient's standard/usual/typical care from their primary gynecologic care provider. We hypothesize that, compared to COCs, the LNG-IUS will be more effective at improving bleeding-related quality of life and will be associated with fewer treatment failures and greater cost-effectiveness at one year. To test these hypotheses, we plan to enroll 59 women from several sites who present for gynecologic care and self-report heavy menstrual bleeding into a RCT comparing LNG-IUS to COCs. The eligible study population includes women with heavy menstrual bleeding secondary to ovulatory disorders (AUB-O) or endometrial hemostatic disorders (AUB-E). Women meeting study eligibility will be randomized to receive LNG-IUS or COCs. Main study outcomes will be obtained at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.</brief_summary>
