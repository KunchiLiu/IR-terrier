	<brief_summary>The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with LDE225 demonstrates sufficient efficacy in hedgehog pathway-mutated solid tumors and/or hematologic malignancies to warrant further study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LDE225 for Patients With PTCH1 or SMO Mutated Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patient has confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma) or hematological malignancy (except CML, ALL and AML). Patient has preidentified tumor with a PTCH1 or SMO mutation. Patient has received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and /or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated to result in a durable remission.
