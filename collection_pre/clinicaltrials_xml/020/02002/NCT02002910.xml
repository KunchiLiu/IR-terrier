	<brief_summary>To investigate whether instantaneous wave-Free Ratio(iFR)/Fractional Flow Reserve(FFR) guided treatment strategy makes the postulated treatment strategy by Coronary Angiogram(CAG) guide change and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of its dual diagnosis. To investigate difference between SYNTAX score evaluated CAG and functional SYNTAX score evaluated physiological assessment of coronary stenosis and its clinical effectiveness.</brief_summary>
