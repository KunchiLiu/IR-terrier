	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot study to evaluate impact of Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) on T cell immune activation and immune activation in HIV-infected immunological non-responders. The investigators aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy profiles of TwHF in HIV immunological non-responders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of TwHF in HIV Patients With Poor Immune Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators recruited 23 patients from Peking Union Medical College Hospital Outpatient clinic. They were all immunological non-responders. Nineteen patients will receive Triptolide wilfordii Hook F extract (10mg tid po) plus current cART, while 4 patients will continue their current cART. This study will last for 12 months. Patients will be followed up at month 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. During each follow-up time point, adverse effects, T cell subsets, T cell activation markers and other routine tests will be ordered. The investigators hypothesis that TwHF might boost CD4 cell recovery by reducing immune activation.</detailed_description>
