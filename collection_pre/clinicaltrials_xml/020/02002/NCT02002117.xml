	<brief_title>Genotyping of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSCLC is an area of oncology in which clinicians are beginning to use specific tumor-associated molecular aberrations to assign and/or prioritize targeted therapies for patients. At this early stage, multiple hurdles remain before molecular profiling becomes a routine part of thoracic oncology practice. In particular, to develop specific targeted therapies for patients whose tumors harbor rare mutations, it will be important to identify appropriate candidates, design the appropriate trials, and execute the trials with adequate numbers to achieve the necessary endpoints. Implementation will facilitate realization of the promise of molecularly tailored therapy, which could lead to more effective treatments with fewer side effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients who have participated or will be participating a lung cancer clinical trial that use EGFRTKI or chemotherapy as first line or second line treatment. 2. Pathologic or cytological confirmation of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with available tissue 3. Patients must understand and provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures 4. Have a life expectancy 3 months. 5. Have stage IV NSCLC (AJCC, 7th Edition) 6. No or one prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC 6.1.Adjuvant chemotherapy: The adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g. vinorelbine / cisplatin) should be counted as one prior systemic therapy if the interval between the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and the documentation of recurrence within 12 months. 6.2.Maintenance therapy: The maintenance therapy (e.g. pemetrexed) following the firstline systemic chemotherapy which achieved complete response, partial response, or stable disease should not be counted as one prior systemic therapy if the maintenance drug was used in firstline combination therapy 7. â‰¥20 years 8. ECOG performance status 0 2 9. If there is no available archived tissue, the subject must consent to undergo a biopsy or surgical procedure to obtain tissue within 1 month prior to study entry, which may or may not be part of the patient's routine care for their malignancy. 1. Prior history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cured insitu carcinoma of the cervix) within 5 years of study entry. 2. Known HIV infection. 3. If subject has no archival tissue and refuse to do any biopsy or surgery for molecular testing</criteria>
