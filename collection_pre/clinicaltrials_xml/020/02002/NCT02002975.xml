	<detailed_description>This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, designed to determine the onset of new cerebral and cardiovascular events and changes in metabolic syndrome parameters, and to analyze the association between patient baseline characteristics, including any metabolic syndrome-related risk factors, and the onset of new cerebral and cardiovascular events in an exploratory setting. Participants will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The planned sample size is 20,000. The usual adult dosage is 15 to 30 mg of pioglitazone administered orally once daily before or after breakfast.</detailed_description>
