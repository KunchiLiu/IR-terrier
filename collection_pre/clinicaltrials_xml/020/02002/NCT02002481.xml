	<brief_title>Comparison of the Quality of CPR by Professional Helpers (Emergency Physicians / Paramedics) During Flights</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even for paramedics and emergency physicians, the resuscitation of patients with cardiac arrest remains a challenge. Previous studies have shown that the cardiac output varies widely even under normal ambient conditions. Especially the mean frequenices of cardiac compression varies from 60 to 160/min, as well as the now-flow-time. Aim of this study is to investigate how narrowness and movement during a transport affect the CPR-performance. For this, we examine the impact of the common transport options (air and ground) on the outcome-varity on a manikin. The subjects for this study are professional rescuers (emergency physicians / paramedics) who perform a 10 minute ALS-CPR in either normal circumstances (resuscitation-room) or during transportation.</detailed_description>
