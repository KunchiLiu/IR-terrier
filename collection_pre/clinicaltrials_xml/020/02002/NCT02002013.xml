	<brief_title>The Fluid Translation of Research Into Practice Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Fluid-Translation of Research into Practice Study (TRIPS) is an international, single day, cross-sectional study planned for the second quarter of 2014, coordinated by the George Institute for Global Health, with the purpose of documenting prescribing practices for fluid resuscitation in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. This international cross-sectional study follows on from the publication of large-scale randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of fluid resuscitation, which provide evidence of how fluid resuscitation may affect patient-centered outcomes. Fluid-TRIPS is a repeat of the Saline versus Albumin for Fluid Evaluation (SAFE)-TRIPS which was an international cross-sectional survey conducted in 2007 that had 391 ICU's participate from 25 countries and provided insight into international fluid resuscitation practice at that time. Along with establishing if fluid resuscitation practices have changed since SAFE-TRIPS, Fluid-TRIPS also aims to determine the relationship between fluid choice and evidence, along with understand other factors that may influence the choice of bolus fluid in clinical practice.</detailed_description>
