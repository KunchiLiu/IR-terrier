	<brief_summary>In patient who are predicted to be difficult to intubate with a standard direct laryngoscope well use flexible optical intubation via a supraglottic airway devise (the Ambu Aura-i). Patients are randomly assigner to a single- or a multiple- use flexible optical scope. We hypothesize that intubation is obtained equally effective with both types of flexible scopes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>ASA physical status 13 and evaluated preoperatively and found suitable for tracheal intubation with a flexible optical scope via the SAD and scheduled for elective surgery/anesthesia and are conscious about their rights and consequences of participating in the study. The patient must have one or two of the following predictors of difficult tracheal intubation: 1. Modified Mallampati score &gt; 2 (= "no parts of the Uvula is visible") 2. a thyromental distance of less then or equal to 6.5 cms 3. Combined movement in head and neck &lt; 90 degrees 4. Mouthopening less the 4 cm (but must be larger then 2.5 cm) 5. Inability to protrude the teeth n the lower jaw beyond the upper incisors 6. BMI &gt; 40 combined with a neckcircumference &gt; 43 cms 7. Upperlipbitetest &gt; 2 8. Previous difficult intubation or laryngoscopy (If more then two criteria are fulfilled the patient should be considered intubated awake instead. . But the upperlipbitetest and the prognationbeyond the incisors test represents a similar thing, namely the inability to subluxate the lower jaw, the if both these findings are positive it is only considered as counting for one. ASA physical status 4 or 5 contraindications for use of the SAD Patients in whom intubation via a SAD has previously failed Patients at risk of aspiration from the gastrointestinal channel diseases in mouth, pharynx or larynx that precludes the use of a SAD Patients in whom the cricothyroid membrane cannot be localized preanaesthetically Patients in whom the doctor making the preanaesthetic evaluation finds in need of an awake intubation Patients with possible CreutzfeldtJacobs disease or contraindication against the use of nonautoclavable equipment r risk of cross contamination with prions</criteria>
