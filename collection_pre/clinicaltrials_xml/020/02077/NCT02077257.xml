	<brief_summary>This is a 12-week, randomized, open-label,,multicenter, Phase IV study exploring LDL-C lowering efficacy of Rosuvastatin 20 mg/d compared to 10 mg/day Chinese ACS patients.The Randomized Treatment Period is preceded by a 24hours Screening Period. The study flow chart (Figure 1) depicts the 2 periods which comprise the study. These periods are described as follows: 1. Screening Period (Day -1 through Day 1) This period consists of Visits 1 and 2. Subjects entering the Screening Period are required to meet the inclusion criteria. All subjects will be instructed to follow the current TLC(therapeutic lifestyle change)dietary guidelines for the duration of the trial. 2. 12-week Randomized Treatment Period (Day 1 through Week 12) This period consists of Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5. Eligible subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 to each treatment group: Rosuvastatin 20 mg orRosuvastatin10 mg. Treatment will be administered once daily for 12 weeks. A total of 450valid subjects in each of the Rosuvastatin arms are required, in order to test the hypothesis of superiority for comparison of LDL-C levels between Rosuvastatin20 mg and Rosuvastatin10 mg(see Section 6.1 for more details). The Study visit schedule(Table 2) indicates the number and timing of the planned visits. The visit schedule must be within time window. At the final visit, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the subject is offered an selected appropriate type of lipid-lowering therapy. Scheduled Visit3,4,5 will have a visit window of ±2 days. Subjects who attend a clinic visit without fasting (at least 12 hours) should be asked to return within 2 days for another clinic visit after fasting for at least 12 hours.</brief_summary>
