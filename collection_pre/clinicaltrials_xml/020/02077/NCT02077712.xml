	<brief_title>Intranasal Dexmedetomidine Sedation for Ophthalmic Examinations in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dexmedetomidine is an a2-adrenergic receptor agonist that provides sedation without respiratory depression.Clinical trials have demonstrated that intranasal dexmedetomidine in a dose of 1ug/kg produces satisfactory sedation in between 53% and 57% of children at anaesthetic induction. There are also reports using higher doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine. The investigators compared the sedative effect of 1ug/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine with those of 2 ug/kg for ophthalmic examinations in children aged 2 months-10 years and hypothesised that the higher dose would produce satisfactory sedation in more children at the time of anaesthetic induction.</detailed_description>
