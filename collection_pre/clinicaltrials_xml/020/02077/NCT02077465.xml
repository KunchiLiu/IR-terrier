	<criteria>Weight: ≥ 45 kg to &lt; 120 kg at screening Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of contraception. Male subjects must refrain from sperm donation for 90 days post last infusion of the study drug Diagnosis of COPD per Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for at least 6 months prior to screening and anticipated to remain on stable therapy for the duration of the study Postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 40% predicted No changes in COPD medications within 30 days prior to randomization Hepatic panel [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] ≤ 2 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL (both males and females) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (1,500 mm^3) Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Clinically significant active infection as judged by the investigator during screening Known history of HIV, hepatitis B or C during screening. Subjects who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive, but who received a successful series of hepatitis B vaccinations and never had the disease remain eligible A positive QuantiFERONTB GOLD test during screening History of malignancy within the last 5 years except for patients who have been treated locally for nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ Any serious cardiac event such as myocardial infarction, unstable or lifethreatening arrhythmia, hospitalization for cardiac failure within 6 months prior to randomization or any significant or new electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at Visit 1 as judged by the Investigator A hospitalization for a respiratory event such as, but not limited to, COPD, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, within the previous 6 months prior to randomization Chronic lung disease other than COPD such as: asthma, cystic fibrosis or fibrotic disease, α1antitrypsin deficiency, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary thromboembolic disease, or bronchiectasis Chronic use of systemic corticosteroids and/or treatment with systemic corticosteroids for an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) event, or other medical condition not requiring hospitalization, within 90 days of randomization. Treatment with antibiotics for an AECOPD event, or other medical condition not requiring hospitalization within 90 days of randomization, or any minor medical event not requiring hospitalization within 14 days of randomization. Treatment with any marketed or investigational biologic within 5 halflives of the molecule or if unknown within 90 days of screening Subjects currently on nonbiologic immune modulator medications such as: azathioprine, cyclosporine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, tofacitinib, within 90 days of randomization</criteria>
