	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study which aims to show the temperatures measured on body surface with an infrared thermometer on inpatients who need a central venous catheter (CVC) for medical care. Because the local temperature could be altered, at least during local infectious processes, seems to be reasonable to think that this approach could be helpful to its early diagnosis.</brief_summary>
