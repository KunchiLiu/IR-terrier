	<brief_summary>Recent Canadian studies, public opinion polls and the Canadian Heart Health Strategy and Action Plan state that women's heart health is a key national priority; it should be addressed through improving heart health awareness and prevention, and reducing care inequities for women in general and younger women in particular. The investigators have developed an innovative and interactive mobile website based postpartum lifestyle modification program (regular physical activity and nutritional guidance), based on established national guidelines, to improve heart disease risk factors in women. The investigators will conduct a trial to determine if the mobile website based lifestyle modification program can be maintained and reduces a collection of risk factors, which occurring together, greatly increases the risk of developing heart disease. The investigators hypothesize that the interactive mobile website directing regular physical activity and personalized nutritional guidance, compared to standard postpartum care, will be motivational and result in a reduced modified metabolic syndrome z score at 8 months postpartum among the intervention group.</brief_summary>
