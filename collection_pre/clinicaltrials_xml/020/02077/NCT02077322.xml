	<brief_summary>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the best method of surgically treating patients who suffer from sinus disease. Synechiae formation in the nose is the most common complication after sinus surgery. Synechiae describes the adhesion of two opposing mucosal surfaces in the nasal cavity that can cause scarring and obstruction of the nasal passage. Spacers are often inserted during surgery between nasal mucosal surfaces to prevent synechiae. The aim of this study is to see if a silastic spacer is more effective at reducing the formation of synechiae after sinus surgery than a merocel spacer.</brief_summary>
