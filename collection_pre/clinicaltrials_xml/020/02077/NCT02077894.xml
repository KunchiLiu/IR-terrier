	<brief_summary>Objective: The objective of this study is to identify genetic causes of inherited eye conditions through whole exome or whole genome sequencing. This includes identifying mutations in known genes or novel genes for recognized conditions, as well as identifying mutations in novel genes for previously uncharacterized genetic conditions involving the eye. Study Population: We plan to recruit 310 participants, to include both probands with an eye condition under study and unaffected family members. Ideally unaffected family members will be parents of a proband. Design: Participants will be recruited through other pre-existing NIH protocols, such as the NEI Evaluation and Treatment protocol (08-EI-0169), the NEI Screening protocol (08-EI-0102), and the Genetics of Uveal Coloboma protocol (13-EI-0049). Self-referred patients or patients referred by an outside clinician will be screened for eligibility under a pre-existing NIH protocol. Phenotyped patients eligible for participation and their unaffected family members will undergo genetic counseling and will provide a blood sample for exome or genome sequencing. Biological relationships will be confirmed prior to exome or genome sequencing. Sequence data will be analyzed for primary variants associated with the proband s eye condition and incidental findings, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be validated in a CLIA-certified laboratory and the results will be returned to the participant in-person. Outcome Measures: This is an etiologic study that will generate molecular information about previously-recognized conditions for which participants did not have a molecular diagnosis, as well as molecular information for previously uncharacterized conditions involving the eye.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Participant is affected with an eye condition under study, or is a family member of an affected individual who will be informative for WES/WGS analysis and interpretation. 2. Participant or legal guardian of participant understands and signs the informed consent document. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Participants who cannot comply with study procedures are ineligible. 2. Participants who are minors or participants who are adults and are decisionally impaired are ineligible if they do not have a legal guardian who can consent and make decisions on their behalf. Documentation of legal guardianship must be provided for decisionally impaired adults. 3. Participants who are minors and under joint custody are ineligible if parents are in disagreement about study participation. 4. Prospective participants or their legal guardians who, based on the judgment of the team, appear to have impaired ability to understand and appropriately use complex medical and genetic information, or to cope with potentially life altering medical information, will be ineligible.</criteria>
