	<criteria>Male or female subjects of minimum adult legal age (according to local laws for signing the informed consent document), able to provide written informed consent, and understand and comply with the requirements of the study Diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as evidenced by imaging or other diagnostic assessments Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≥1.5 x ULN on at least two occasions, seven or more days apart, during the Screening period alphafetoprotein (AFP) ≤ 100 ng/mL Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, a platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L, and a white blood cell count ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/L If on metformin, sulfonylureas, statins, or fibrates, subjects must be on a stable dose of these drugs for at least three months prior to Screening and during the study Known infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV Decompensated or severe liver disease as evidenced by one or more of the following: 1. Confirmed cirrhosis or suspicion of cirrhosis 2. Esophageal varices 3. Ascites 4. Suspicion of portal hypertension 5. Hospitalization for liver disease within 60 days of screening 6. Bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN, or ALT or AST &gt; 10 x ULN Inflammatory bowel disease Diagnosed or suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at entry into the study History of or active nonliver malignancies other than curatively treated skin cancer (basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas) Significant systemic or major illness other than liver disease, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, and/or serious psychiatric disease, that, in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude the subject from participating in and completing the study History or presence of alcohol abuse, defined as consumption of more than 210 mL of alcohol per week (the equivalent of 14 4ounce glasses of wine or 14 12ounce cans/bottles of beer or wine coolers), or other substance abuse within the prior two years</criteria>
