	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of HMS5552 in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study with multiple oral doses of HMS5552 given to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who never accepted anti-diabetic drug for treatment before. The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of HMS5552 following multiple ascending doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after BID dosing for 8 days. The secondary objectives include: 1. To determine the single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics of HMS5552 in patients with type 2 diabetes 2. To evaluate the single dose and steady state pharmacodynamics of HMS5552 in patients with type 2 diabetes 3. To further explore food-effect on HMS5552 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics A maximum total of 80 patients (10 in each dose group and assuming a maximum of 5~8 dose levels). There will be 8 active and 2 placebo patients in each dose group. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data after each dose cohort will be reviewed in blinded fashion before escalation to the next dose cohort.</detailed_description>
