	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and pidilizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pidilizumab, can block cancer growth by blocking the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide with pidilizumab may work better in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Pidilizumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of CT-011 (pidilizumab) in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) and assess efficacy in terms of overall response rate in patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and pidilizumab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 3. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>

30%, no uncontrolled arrhythmias or New York Heart Association class IIIIV heart failure Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70 A negative pregnancy test will be required for all women of child bearing potential; breast feeding is not permitted Fertility requirements: Female patients with child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at least 7 days before starting treatment drugs Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the duration of the study and for 90 days afterwards Female patients must be either posymenopausal, free from menses &gt;= 2 years (yrs), surgically sterilized, willing to use two adequate barrier methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy, or agree to abstain from sexual activity starting from screening and for 90 days afterwards Female patients of child bearing potential must agree to comply with the fertility and pregnancy test requirements dictated by the RevAssist program Patients with peripheral neuropathy &gt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 Prior exposure to anti programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or anti programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) Patients receiving concurrent corticosteroids at the time protocol therapy is initiated other than for physiologic maintenance treatment History of allergic reaction (including erythema nodosum) to lenalidomide Concurrent use of complementary or alternative medicines that would confound the interpretation of toxicities and antitumor activity of the study drugs Patients with contraindication to thromboprophylaxis Unacceptable cardiac risk factors defined by any of the following criteria: patients with congenital long QT syndrome, any history of ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes, bradycardia defined as heart rate (HR) &lt; 50 bpm, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% Patients who have received targeted or investigational agents within 2 weeks or within 5 halflives of the agent and active metabolites (whichever is longer) and who have not recovered from side effects of those therapies Patients who have undergone major surgery =&lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from the sideeffects of surgery Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis C; baseline testing for HIV and hepatitis C is not required Patients with a history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically significant or currently requires active intervention, other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix should not be enrolled; patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed therapy for a prior malignancy, are disease free from a prior malignancy for &gt;= 5 yrs and are considered by their physician to be less than 30% risk of relapse Patients with active (untreated or relapsed) central nervous system (CNS) metastasis of the patient's myeloma Patients with a history of gastrointestinal surgery or other procedure that might, in the opinion of the investigator(s), interfere with the absorption or swallowing of the study drugs Patients with any significant history of noncompliance to medical regimens or unwilling or unable to comply with the instructions given to them by the study staff Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the investigator(s) to likely interfere with the patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results</criteria>
