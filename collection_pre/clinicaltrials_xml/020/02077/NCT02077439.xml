	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine robotic hand system is more effective than conventional physical and occupational therapy at promoting functional recovery of the affected arm in subjects after stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interactive Intention-Driven Upper-Limb Training Robotic System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the recovery in hand and upper limb functions when the physical training is assisted by an exoskeleton robotic hand system. Subjects with a pure unilateral motor paresis after a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). All subjects should have sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions as well as understand the content and purpose of the experiment, and also should be able to sit up for 1 hour. During the training, you will be asked to do the hand open and hand grasp by Electromyography-driven robotic control strategy. There will be evaluations on the upper limb motor functions before and after the 20-session of training and follow up session by clinical assessments on functional recovery.</detailed_description>
