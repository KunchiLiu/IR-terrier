	<brief_summary>ERCP is associated with radiation exposure to the endoscopist and staff, which may be significant at high volume programs despite the use of lead aprons. We hypothesize that draping of the fluoroscopy image intensifier may significantly reduce staff radiation exposure and help achieve implementation of the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle.</brief_summary>
