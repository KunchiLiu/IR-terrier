	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the impact of a decision aid, Head CT Choice, to determine if its use improves parents' knowledge and engagement in decision making and safely decreases healthcare utilization in children presenting to the emergency department with blunt head trauma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shared Decision Making in Parents of Children With Head Trauma: Head CT Choice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' long term goal is to promote evidence-based, patient-centered evaluation in the acute setting, to more closely tailor testing to disease risk. The investigators will compare the use of risk stratification tools with usual clinical approaches to treatment selection or administration through the following aim: Test if the decision aid, Head CT Choice, improves validated patient-centered outcome measures and safely decreases healthcare utilization. The investigators will randomize at the clinician level. Through the use of the intervention, Head CT Choice, the investigators aim to significantly increase parents' knowledge, engagement, and satisfaction, decrease the rate of head CT use, and decrease 7-day total healthcare utilization, with no significant increase in adverse events.</detailed_description>
