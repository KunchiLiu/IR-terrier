	<brief_title>Reducing Lung Cancer Survivors' Anxiety and Dyspnea (RELAX)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES 1. To assess feasibility (accrual, participation, adherence, retention) of a randomized study of device-guided breathing and music in 75 post-treatment ESLC survivors with significant anxiety. 2. To obtain preliminary data on the variability and efficacy of two doses of a device-guided breathing intervention versus a music control group for reducing anxiety (primary outcome) and for improving self-reported dyspnea and respiratory functioning (secondary outcomes) in post-treatment lung cancer survivors. 3. To select the optimal dose of the device-guided breathing intervention (15 minutes once/day or twice/day) for subsequent randomized study.</detailed_description>
