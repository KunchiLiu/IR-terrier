	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Topical application of Tranexamic acid into the surgical wound during spine surgery will decrease the overall blood loss post-operatively. This reduction in blood loss will reduce the need for transfusion. In addition it will also significantly reduce the cost of the surgical procedure. Specific Aim 1: The goal of this study is to quantitatively assess whether topical application of tranexamic acid placed into the surgical wound during lumbar spine surgery will decrease post-operative blood loss, thus lowering the need for blood transfusions. By reducing the number of transfusions patients can avoid the well known complications associated with them. The investigators do not plan on measuring serum tranexamic acid levels. Several meta-analyses and level I studies have shown that IV administration of tranexamic acid is effective in reducing post operative blood loss and the need for transfusion</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of the Drug Tranexamic Acid to Reduce Post-surgery Blood Loss in Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, has been studied at great length across a myriad of medical specialties to reduce blood lost during these surgeries. More specifically, widespread use of this agent has proven safe and effective in cardiothoracic; ear, nose, and throat (ENT); oral and maxillofacial; and orthopaedic surgeries (total hip, total knee, and spine surgeries) (1, 2, 3, 4). Additionally, an oral version of tranexamic acid, which is FDA approved, has historically been used in the Gynecological literature for patients with menorrhagia. Even large doses of prophylactic antifibrinolytic agents, and more specifically, tranexamic acid have also proven safe and effective for major orthopaedic spine surgeries (5). Tranexamic acid has been FDA approved in oral and IV form for over 25 years with a wealth of safety and efficacy documented in the literature. In a recent prospective double blinded study involving total knee arthroplasty a 25-30% reduction in blood loss compared to negative control was shown when using tranexamic acid topically(6). While systemic (Intravenous) use of tranexamic acid has been studied in spine surgery, there has been little studied to show its effectiveness at reducing blood loss when used topically. This study proposes to determine if the topical application of tranexamic acid into the surgical wound of posterior multi-level lumbar spine surgery will decrease postoperative blood loss, thus decreasing the need for potential transfusions. Tranexamic acid has been well documented for its safety and efficacy, the investigators believe that this agent will become an important tool to reduce the blood loss in spinal surgeries. It offers a reduction in blood loss and, ultimately, a decrease in the transfusion rates which pose risks to the patient and significant cost.</detailed_description>
