	<brief_summary>The present phase II/III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparative study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-monthly oral administration of NE-58095 delayed release (DR) tablets for 12 months in participants with involutional osteoporosis. For this study, participants receiving oral NE-58095 immediate release (IR) 2.5 mg tablets once daily for 12 months are set as the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II/III, Double-blind, Parallel Group Comparative Study of Oral Administration of NE-58095 Tablets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the present study is to verify the non-inferiority of once-monthly oral administration of NE-58095 DR tablets for 12 months to once-daily oral administration of NE-58095 IR 2.5 mg tablets for 12 months, in terms of efficacy in participants with involutional osteoporosis. Secondary objectives of the present study are as follows: to compare the safety of once-monthly oral administration of NE-58095 DR tablets for 12 months with the safety of once-daily oral administration of NE-58095 IR tablets (at 2.5 mg) for 12 months in participants with involutional osteoporosis at time of wakening.</detailed_description>
