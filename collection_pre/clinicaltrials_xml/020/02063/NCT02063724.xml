	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of HER-2 pulsed DC1 vaccine in high risk HER-2 high and intermediate expression breast cancers. Participants will have HER-2 driven IBC at least Stage IIIA with N2 following chemotherapy with/without trastuzumab or recurrence exclusive of new primary tumor but rendered NED. Mammogram, laboratory studies, CT, and leukapheresis will be performed, in addition to vaccine administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dendritic cell cancer vaccines combined with chemotherapy may increase complete responses giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the immune repertoire is being shifted by chemotherapy to anti-breast cancer response and offer the chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. Participants with HER-2 driven IBC at least Stage IIIA with N2 (4 positive nodes) following chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab or those with recurrence exclusive of new primary tumor but rendered NED will be undergo mammograms, laboratory studies, and leukapheresis. Vaccines will be manufactured using participants' leukapheresis product, which will be administered in the Clinical Research Center 1 Dulles Building weekly for 6 weeks. Three booster vaccines will be administered at 3 month intervals following the initial induction vaccines. Immune analysis will be done after participant receives all induction vaccines and again after they receive all booster vaccines. This study began at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and will be continued at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute.</detailed_description>
