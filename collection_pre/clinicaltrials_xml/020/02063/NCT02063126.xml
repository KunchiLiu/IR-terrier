	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Measure the Maximun HR After ReConnect ® Supplementation vs. Placebo in CFS.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a serious, complex and extremely debilitating chronic illness, but often misunderstood characterized by prolonged fatigue, the hallmark of the condition and multiple nonspecific symptoms. The World Health Organization has recognized CFS as a disease that affecting the nervous system (ICD-10 G93.3) and multiple body systems. The etiology is unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated in CFS patients a significant reduction in plasma and intracellular Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells concentrations of Coenzyme Q10 and NADH, which correlate with clinical symptoms of the disease. Hypothesis: Supplementation with CoQ10 plus NADH could be beneficial in the improvement of clinical and molecular parameters in this disease. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of oral Reconnect ® suplementation on the maximum heart rate changes during an exercise test in CFS. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the effect of Reconnect ® suplementation on perception of fatigue (assessed by FIS), pain (McGill Pain Index Questionnaire), and sleep disruption (Pittsburgh Sleep Index Questionnaire). Patients and Methods: A total of 80 consecutive women patients with a diagnosis of CFS according to the 1994 CDC Fukuda's definition criteria were initially evaluated and enrolled in this study. The majority were excluded for no meet the inclusion criteria of the study. All subjects are treatment with ReConnect® containing CoQ10 plus NADH versus placebo. Fatigue levels, pain and sleep disturbances are scored using the Fatigue Impact Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Discussion: To our knowledge, no previous studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of oral ReConnect supplementation in CFS. ReConnect containing the combination of CoQ10 plus NADH and other nutrients (phosphoserine and Vitamin C) can help to improve clinical symptoms and restore mitochondrial function and oxidative stress reducing fatigue, pain and sleep impairments in CFS. The combination of these supplements can result in a safe and effective therapy to reduce fatigue, pain and improve sleep as well help restore quality of life of CFS patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients female between 18 and 65 years old. CFS patients diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS Clinical Unit, Vall d'Hebron Hospital, Barcelona, Spain) Heart rate in radial pulse and seated between 50 to100 bpm, systolic BP between 100 to 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP between 50 to 90 mm Hg. Patients who give a written informed consent before initiating the study. Patients for that is contraindicated or is not advisable to carryout an ergometer exercise test. Patients who are participating in another clinical trial of the same or differents nature in the last 30 days prior to inclusion. Any participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to follow instructions or make a good treatment compliance. Subjects that do not give written informed consent to participate in the study. Participants who are receiving any drug or banned substances and is expected that withdrawal of some medications/products not allowed in the study involves a significants problem.</criteria>
