	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, single dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of NCTX (PEGylated Liposomal Iodixanol Injection) administered intravenously to healthy volunteers. In addition, computed tomography (CT) scans will be acquired to measure radiographic density in regions of interest (ROI) at times from 3-5 hours and up to 72 hours following NCTX administration.</brief_summary>
