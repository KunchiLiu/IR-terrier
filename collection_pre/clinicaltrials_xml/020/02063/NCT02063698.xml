	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies whether auranofin will relieve pain following paclitaxel in patients who have previously experienced paclitaxel-induced pain. Auranofin is a drug given by mouth to treat other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is being studied to see if it will decrease pain following paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auranofin in Decreasing Pain in Patients With Paclitaxel-Induced Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether one dose of auranofin given the day following administration of paclitaxel decreases pain as assessed by daily completion of the Modified Brief Pain Inventory scale for seven days. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess whether auranofin is well tolerated in this setting. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) on day 2. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on day 2. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 21-28 days.</detailed_description>
