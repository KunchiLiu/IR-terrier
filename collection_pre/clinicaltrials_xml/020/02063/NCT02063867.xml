	<brief_summary>The ABATE Infection Project is a cluster randomized trial of hospitals to compare two quality improvement strategies to reduce multi-drug resistant organisms and healthcare-associated infections in non-critical care units. The two strategies to be evaluated are: - Arm 1: Routine Care Routine policy for showering/bathing - Arm 2: Decolonization Use of chlorhexidine as routine soap for showering or bed bathing for all patients Mupirocin x 5 days if MRSA+ by history, culture, or screen Note that enrolled "subjects" represents 53 individual HCA Hospitals (representing ~190 non-critical care units) that have been randomized.</brief_summary>
