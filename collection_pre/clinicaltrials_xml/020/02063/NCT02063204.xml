	<detailed_description>An open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 50 mg single oral dose of Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) in subjects with renal impairment and healthy subjects</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria all participants: 1. Male and female (non childbearing potential) subjects aged 18 years or more with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. 2. Have a weight of at least 50 kg (110 lbs) and body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40 kg/m2, inclusive. Inclusion healthy volunteers only: 3. Must be in good health as determined by a medical history, physical examination, 12 lead ECG, clinical laboratory evaluations, and an ophthalmic examination performed before the administration of the investigational product. Inclusion renal impaired patients only: 4. Stable renal function Exclusion Criteria all participants: 1. Subjects of Japanese or non Japanese Asian ethnicity. 2.

Subjects who smoke more than 10 cigarettes or the equivalent in tobacco per day 4. In the opinion of the investigator, any evidence of additional severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (eg, currently unstable or uncompensated hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory disease) or laboratory finding, physical examination, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, or 12lead ECG that makes it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study. Exclusion renal impaired patients only: 5. Subjects with an active renal transplant (subjects who have previously received a renal transplant and are currently undergoing dialysis due to transplant failure may be enrolled). 6.
