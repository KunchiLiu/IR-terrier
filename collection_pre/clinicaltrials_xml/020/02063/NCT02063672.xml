	<brief_title>Lutonix® Drug Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for Treatment of Femoropopliteal In-Stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key 1. Male or nonpregnant female ≥18 years of age 2. Rutherford Clinical Category 24 3. Significant (≥ 50%) restenosis of a previous bare (not covered and not drugeluting) nitinol stent(s) in the femoropopliteal artery 4. Lesion measures between 4 and 18 cm 5. Target vessel diameter between ≥4 and ≤6 mm and able to be treated with available device size matrix 6. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography 7. Successful crossing and predilatation of the target lesion with a guidewire 8. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%) stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been (nor planned to be) revascularized 9. No other prior vascular or surgical interventions within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30 days after the protocol treatment Key 1. Life expectancy of &lt;1 year 2. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study or previously enrolled in this study NOTE: Enrollment in another drug or device clinical trial during the follow up period is not allowed 3. History of stroke within 3 months 4. History of MI, thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of enrollment 5. Prior vascular surgery of the index limb, with the exception of remote common femoral patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the target lesion 6. Target lesion involves a previously placed covered stent or drugeluting stent 7. Grade 4 or 5 stent fracture (malaligned components or transaxial spiral configuration) in the restenotic stent 8. Inability to take required study medications or allergy to contrast that cannot be adequately managed with pre and postprocedure medication 9. Known inadequate distal outflow (&gt;50 % stenosis of distal popliteal and/or all three tibial vessels), or planned future treatment of vascular disease distal to the target lesion 10. Intended use of adjunctive treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, scoring/cutting balloon, stents, etc.)</criteria>
