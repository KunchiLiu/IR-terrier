	<brief_title>Acute Fetal Response to Prenatal Yoga</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2012, yoga was reported to be practiced by approximately 20 million Americans, out of which 82% are women practitioners. The effects of yoga on the fetus have not been demonstrated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute fetal response to yoga exercises by assessing fetal well-being via ultrasound and non-stress testing among healthy women. The investigators hypothesize that yoga during pregnancy does not have any acute negative effects on fetal behavior as assessed by umbilical artery Dopplers and fetal heart rate or maternal vital signs.</detailed_description>
