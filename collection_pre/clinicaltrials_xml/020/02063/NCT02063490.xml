	<brief_title>Nurse-led Intervention to Improve Phosphate Binder Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Phosphate binder nonadherence is ubiquitous. The results of adherence enhancing interventions are often disappointing. The aim is to test a nurse-led multifactorial intervention to enhance phosphate binder adherence. Methods In a quasi-experimental clinical trial, phosphate binder adherence was measured electronically in 135 hemodialysis patients for one year and phosphatemia measured monthly. For all patients, months 1-2 were baseline (no interventions were performed). The intervention arm was given 1 "preparatory" intervention and then monthly 8 "maintenance" individualized management sessions. The control arm received standard of care.</detailed_description>
