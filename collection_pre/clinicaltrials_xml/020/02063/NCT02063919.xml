	<brief_title>Association Between Confocal Laser Endomicroscopic (CLE) Features and Colorectal Mucosal Microbiome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the intestinal pathophysiology. The mucosal microbiome is in the front face of microbiome-host cross-talk. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) can provide realtime mucosal images during ongoing endoscopy. We hypothesized that the mucosal pattern, here evaluated by endomicroscopy, may constitute specific microbiome niches and participate the evolvement of the mucosal microbiome.</detailed_description>
