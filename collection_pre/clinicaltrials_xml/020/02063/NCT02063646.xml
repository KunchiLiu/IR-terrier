	<brief_summary>Several preliminary studies have shown that diet can have beneficial effects on cognitive decline. Among food shown to have such effects are some polyphenols from selected botanicals. Preclinical studies have concluded that polyphenols play a role in moderation of oxidative stress and inflammation, increased neuronal signaling, and improved metabolic function among other effects. Noteworthy, a positive and statistically significant association between the midlife level of polyphenol intake and cognitive function assessed 13 years later was found in a cohort of 2574 adults. Several mechanisms may be involved in these positive effects of food polyphenols on cognitive function in older adults: experimental studies suggest that polyphenols display neuroprotective effects, enhancement of the neuronal function, stimulation of brain flow and inducing neurogenesis, and might prevent age-related damage to the central nervous system through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Based on these promising results, a food supplement from botanicals offering complementary polyphenol profile was developed. This food supplement is aimed to aid at maintenance of cognitive function in older adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of a Polyphenol-rich Food Supplement on Cognitive Function in Healthy Aging Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aims to investigate the effects of 6 months supplementation with a polyphenol-rich supplement vs. placebo to consume daily on human cognitive function. Polyphenol-rich supplement and placebo will be provided as capsules matched for appearance. The study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-groups (2 arms) placebo-controlled, multicentre interventional design. Two groups, each of 102 volunteers, are studied. One group of volunteers will consume the polyphenol-rich product while the other one will consume the placebo product. Each volunteer will be seen for 3 visits at the investigational site, will have 2 follow-up calls and mid-term dietary survey. Baseline and follow-up visit will include cognitive assessment with the CANTAB battery. CANTAB tests will cover several aspects of memory: visio-spatial learning and episodic memory, verbal recognition memory and visio-spatial working memory. Moreover, psychological and mood components will be evaluated (mnesic complaint, depression, fatigue). Physical activity and food habits will also be recorded. Finally, biological parameters will be assessed (lipid profile, glycemia, insulinemia, CRPus, thyroid stimulating hormone, transthyretin, plasma level of phenolic compounds).</detailed_description>
