	<brief_summary>Treatment: five intro-articular Hyaluronic Acid injection Assessment has two parts, that are as follow: 1. Postural stability and risk of fall assessment using Biodex stability index and "Timed up and Go" test 2. Gait and stair climbing assessment using Vicon motion capture system synchronized with four force plates. For knee OA subjects, assessment was done in week one or before injection; and for healthy controls one assessment was performed.</brief_summary>
