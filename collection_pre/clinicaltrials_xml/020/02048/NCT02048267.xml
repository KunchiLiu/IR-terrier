	<brief_summary>Numerous treatment modalities have been proposed to treat pain in alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis such as analgesic medication, inhibition of gastric acid production, enzyme substitution, somatostatin analogues, nerve blockade,reduction of oxidative stress and endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting, but none of these concepts have shown long lasting benefits as surgery in clinical studies.Comparison of surgical outcome in non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and alcoholic chronic pancreatitis has limited data and differences on the basis of outcome in between alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis are not available in literature. Although it is well known that pain is the main symptom of chronic pancreatitis, it has until now been assessed in very common and varying categories. Pain, however, is only one aspect of the large variety of sensitive facets of daily life. In addition to an improvement in pain symptoms and the preservation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function and other parameters, occupational rehabilitation of these mostly young patients and quality of life also should be considered in the evaluation of surgical outcome in alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. In this prospective study, we intend to find out if there are any differences in the surgical outcome on the above mentioned parameters in alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis.We also plan to see if there are differences in the histopathology in these two disease settings.</brief_summary>
