	<brief_title>Intermittent Versus Continuous Infusion Meropenem in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To assess the number of episodes of emesis following both short and prolonged intermittent infusion of meropenem. 2. To assess the number of episodes of emesis corresponding to the peak serum concentration of meropenem. 3. To assess the number of episodes of emesis corresponding to the area under the meropenem serum concentration time curve. 4. To assess reported nausea, measured through administered dosages of anti-nausea medication, following both short and prolonged intermittent infusion of meropenem. 5. To assess reported nausea, measured through administered doses of anti-nausea medication, corresponding to peak concentrations of meropenem. 6. To assess reported nausea, measured through administered dosages of anti-nausea medication, corresponding to the area under the serum concentration time curve 7. To assess reported nausea, measured through patient-reported nausea measured using pictorial scales of severity of nausea in pediatric patients, following both short and prolonged intermittent infusion of meropenem. 8. To assess reported nausea, measured through patient-reported nausea measured using pictorial scales of severity corresponding to the peak serum concentrations of meropenem. 9. To assess reported nausea, measured through patient-reported nausea measured using pictorial scales of severity corresponding to the area under the meropenem serum concentration time curve.</detailed_description>
