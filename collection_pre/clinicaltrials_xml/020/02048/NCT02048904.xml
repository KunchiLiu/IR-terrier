	<brief_summary>The people being asked to participate in this study have type 2 diabetes and abnormal levels of protein in their urine. This indicates that they are starting to develop diabetic kidney disease. The standard treatment for this is the use of one of two blood pressure medicines, either an ACE inhibitor or ARB. However, these medicines are not always completely effective in stopping/reversing the kidney disease. Some studies have previously suggested that another type of medicine, called sitagliptin, normal used to treat diabetes may also help prevent diabetic kidney disease from getting worse. This study is being performed to test the effectiveness of sitagliptin as compared to a placebo, along with a stable dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, to determine whether or not it will reduce protein levels in their urine. Protein levels in the urine are a marker of the severity of kidney disease.</brief_summary>
