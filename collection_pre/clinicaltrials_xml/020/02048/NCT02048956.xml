	<brief_title>Hydrotherapy Intervention in Elderly With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main symptoms of knee osteoarthritis are pain and functional disability. These symptoms are caused by a progressive loss and deterioration of articular cartilage with reactive new bone formation at the joint's surface and margins involving articular cartilage, soft tissues and bone damage. Many treatment programs have been developed, including medication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical modalities, and therapeutic exercises. It is hypothesized that a hydrotherapy treatment during 8 weeks would benefit patients with knee osteoarthritis.</detailed_description>
