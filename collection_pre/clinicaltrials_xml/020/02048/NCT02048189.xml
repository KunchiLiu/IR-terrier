	<brief_summary>This is an open multicentre, randomized study to compare two treatment arms. One arm called "intensification of multiple injections" in which the patient will receive one supplementary injection of LEVEMIR®: that is to say 5 injections per day, and an arm called "continuous insulin infusion" via an external pump with APIDRA®. In the pump arm: a favorable effect in terms of improved insulin sensitivity, improved metabolic equilibrium, a decrease in the area under the baseline and prandial hyperglycemia curve noted during the continuous glycemia recording; an improvement in quality of life compared with treatment using multiple injections.</brief_summary>
