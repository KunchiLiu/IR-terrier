	<brief_summary>Obesity is often cited as being inversely related with socioeconomic status (SES), although the mechanisms linking social status with obesity are not well understood. Dietary restraint, physical activity, and social mobility have been proposed as possible mechanisms. Although there is some evidence of SES variation in the proposed mechanisms, evidence is mixed and mostly observational. The purpose of this research is to determine if one's social position influences eating behaviors. This study will attempt to determine this using a randomized, 2 parallel arm trial to determine the effects that social hierarchy positioning has on energy intake. To prevent compromise in the integrity of data, the investigators will detail the exact treatment condition (i.e., social positioning) after the data collection period. Based on findings from previous animal and large clinical observational studies, there are two complementary hypotheses tested in this study. First, it is hypothesized that being in a lower social position affects one's perception of food availability by making the future availability of food seem less certain. This uncertainty will lead to increased food consumption. Second, it is hypothesized that being in a position of power will lower one's food consumption, as previous research has found that individuals in power tend to east less in groups. Understanding how social position influences food intake could help improve weight loss/maintenance interventions by identifying unexpected factors that could limit the intervention's effectiveness.</brief_summary>
