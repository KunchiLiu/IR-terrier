	<brief_summary>Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a mode of mechanical ventilation that uses the diaphragm's normal electrical activity to deliver a mechanically supported breath. The amount of support provided is determined in part by the NAVA level, where a higher NAVA level will provide higher level of support and unload more of the work of the diaphragm. The purpose of this study is to compare the optimal NAVA level in neonates while on mechanical ventilation while intubated and after being extubated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing NAVA Levels in Intubated and Recently Extubated Neonates to Determine Optimal Non-invasive Ventilatory Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline measurements will be taken. The NAVA titration study will then be done. The NAVA level will be set at a starting value of 0.1 cm H2O/mcV and systematically increased by 0.5 cm H2O/mcV every three minutes to a maximum of 3 cmH2O/mcV. Once the NAVA titration study has been completed, the patient will be extubated. There will be a stabilization period following extubation (15-30 minutes), and then the NAVA titration study will be repeated.</detailed_description>
