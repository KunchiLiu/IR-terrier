	<brief_title>Locally Delivered 1% Metformin Gel in the Treatment of Intrabony Defects in Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Metformin (MF) belonging to the class biguanide, is a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is one of the most commonly prescribed oral hypoglycemic drug worldwide. MF has shown to posses bone forming and bone sparring actions. The present study was designed to investigate effectiveness of MF, 1 % in an indigenously prepared biodegradable controlled-release gel as, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in treatment of chronic periodontitis subjects with intrabony defects. Materials and Methods: Sixty five subjects were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus 1% MF and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months; they included plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). At baseline and after 6 months, radiologic assessment of intrabony defect (IBD) fill was done using computer-aided software.</detailed_description>
