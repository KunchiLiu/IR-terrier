	<brief_title>A Study of Metformin With or Without Rapamycin as Maintenance Therapy After Induction Chemotherapy in Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with metastatic PDA who have received FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen and have achieved stable disease or better will be enrolled onto this study. Subjects should have had at least 6 months of chemotherapy and decline continuation of chemotherapy and should have stable disease or better on 2 scans taken at least 6 weeks apart. If applicable, subjects should also have a stable or declining CA19-9. Twenty-two subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to metformin (Arm A) or metformin + rapamycin (Arm B). Subjects will be stratified according to their prior chemotherapy regimen: FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen. Treatments will be administered orally on a 28 day cycle. Metformin will be administered 850mg twice daily and rapamycin will be administered 4mg daily.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects with islet cell neoplasms are excluded. Subjects with mixed histology will be excluded. Have received 6 months of chemotherapy. Have stable disease for at least 6 months on the current regimen with the last 2 scans taken at least 6 months apart. Measurable disease not required. Subject with a lesion that is amenable to biopsy must agree to have a biopsy at baseline and 2 on treatment biopsies if amenable and considered reasonably safe to obtain. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. Adequate organ and marrow function. Oxygen saturation on room air &gt; 92 % by pulse oximetry. (Subjects on intermittent or continuous supplemental oxygen are excluded). Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Receiving or has received any other investigational agents within 28 days prior to Day 1 of treatment in this study. Has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (i.e. surgery done to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis or an aborted Whipple), within 28 days prior to Day 1 of treatment in this study. Known history of brain metastases unless previously treated and well controlled for at least 3 months (defined as stable clinically, no edema, no steroids). History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to metformin or rapamycin. Taking ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, rifampin, rifabutin, bromocriptine, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), and grapefruit juice. Subjects on metformin will not be excluded. Has received any nononcology live vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases for up to 28 days prior to or after the initiation of treatment in this study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic therapy), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such that the Investigator considers it unsafe for the subject to receive an experimental research drug. Unhealed surgical wound or other clinically significant wound. Known history of chronic HIV, Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections. Pregnant or breast feeding.
