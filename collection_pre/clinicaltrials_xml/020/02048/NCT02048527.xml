	<brief_summary>Sequential culture media were introduced in order to meet the changing requirements of the developing embryo in vitro. However, there has been renewed interest in the use of single-step media, which allow the embryo itself to choose the necessary nutrients while maintaining a more stable culture environment. Previous studies suggest that sequential media do not appear superior to single-step media.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sequential culture media were introduced in order to meet the changing requirements of the developing embryo in vitro. However, there has been renewed interest in the use of single-step media, which allow the embryo itself to choose the necessary nutrients while maintaining a more stable culture environment. Previous studies suggest that sequential media do not appear superior to single-step media. The current study will include 2 RCTs: RCT 1: Random allocation of sibling oocytes to compare embryo development and blastocyst formation rates in the two culture media compared. RCT2: Random allocation of patients in either Global or Origio media, to evaluate pregnancy rates.</detailed_description>
