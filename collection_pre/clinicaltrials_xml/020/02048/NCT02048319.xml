	<brief_summary>Liver cysts are fluid filled cavities located in the liver. They are present in 2-11% of the general population, typically not causing any symptoms or complications. However, in a small subset of patients complaints of pain, abdominal fullness and distension, dyspnea and nausea occur. Currently, aspiration and sclerotherapy is a treatment of choice in symptomatic patients with a large dominant liver cyst. However, studies reported early fluid reaccumulation and relative high recurrence rates of cyst growth after aspiration sclerotherapy ultimately leading to re-interventions. In this respect, somatostatin analogues are promising agents known for its volume reducing effect in patients with polycystic liver disease. In this study the investigators want to evaluate the effect of combining aspiration sclerotherapy with the multi-receptor binding, long-acting somatostatin analogue Pasireotide. The investigators hypothesize that administrating pasireotide before and after aspiration sclerotherapy could prevent early fluid reaccumulation and thereby result in a greater reduction of cyst diameter. Moreover, the investigators expect a lower rate of cyst recurrence and subsequently lower need for re-interventions.</brief_summary>
