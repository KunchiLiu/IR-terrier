	<brief_summary>Title: Inter-rater reliability of the reflux finding score based on endoscopic laryngeal findings in the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease Participants: Voluntary participants after invitation among members (a total of about 40 gastroenterologists) of Gangwon Branch of Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and an otorhinolaryngologist Primary endpoint: Interrater reliability (Kappa coefficient) on the sum of reflux finding score more than 7 points between an otorhinolaryngologist and gastroenterologists (7 points means the cut-off value for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease) Secondary endpoint: Agreement (%) on 8 items of reflux finding score for laryngopharygeal reflux among gastroenterologists</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design 1. Recruitment of doctor participants: introduction by e-mail 2. Education on reflux finding score - standardized materials (instructional video) 3. PRETEST (15 pictures) / feedback (at-a-glance assessment format) 4. TEST 1 (50 pictures) - Acess format including 8 items at each pictures 5. Feedback education (individualized intruction of an otorhinolaryngologist) 6. TEST 2 (50 pictures) - Acess format including 8 items at each pictures 7. Test-Retest reliability - repeat Test 2 with 1 week interval (Participants should take retest of TEST 2 with the concealment of the answer) 8. Analysis</detailed_description>
