	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the best dose of anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody MDX1201-A488 (MDX1201-A488) given before surgery to aid in visualization of the prostate. Attaching a fluorescence, a substance that emits radiation that is visible, to the anti-PMSA antibody and injecting it into the body may help identify the tumor when specialized microscopes are used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-operative Optical Imaging With MDX1201-A488 in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the preferred imaging dose (if any), based on image quality and correlation with pathological findings, of intravenously administered MDX1201-A488 in a dose-escalating study (doses of 5 and 15 mg) in patients with moderate to high-risk prostate cancer prior to undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), subject to predetermined safety stopping rules. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate intra-operative optical imaging (IOOI) findings with pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical staging. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody MDX1201-A488 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo IOOI during RALP on day 5. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.</detailed_description>
