	<brief_summary>The effect of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in patients with bronchiectasis (BC) is not sufficiently studied. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical and biological response of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program (PRP) for 12 weeks in BC vs PRP plus hyperproteic oral nutritional supplement enriched with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB). Methods: single center randomized controlled trial, parallel treatment design: Participants will be randomized assigned either will receive (n=14) PRP for 60 minutes, two supervised sessions per week in the hospital and one unsupervised session at home vs PRP (n=14) plus ONS (one can per day). Outcome assessments will be performed at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks: 1.- effort capacity &amp;#8211;cardiopulmonary exercise test-, 2.- body composition (anthropometry, lean body mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and bioimpedance, phase angle), 3.- peripheral muscle strength (dynamometry and respiratory -PEM (maximum expiratory pressure)and PIM (minimum expiratory pressure)-), 4.- spirometry, 5.- respiratory symptoms (bronchorrhea, dyspnoea, exacerbations),6.- level of physical activity (IPAQ questionnaire plus objective physical activity (WGT3X)), 7.- quality of life (QOL-B-Spain) , 8.-psychological symptoms (HASD) and 9.- biological markers of inflammation (leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, GPR55 (G protein-coupled receptor 55) RNAm (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression in white blood cells) and oxidation (total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase activity, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2a, Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances).</brief_summary>
