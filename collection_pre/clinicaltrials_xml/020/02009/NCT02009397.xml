	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the combination of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF. Both ipilimumab and GM-CSF are intended to work with the body's own immune system to attack melanoma cells in the body. This study will also demostrate how safe the combined drugs are when used to treat patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 melanoma (metastatic melanoma), which cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>

Fertile males should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after completion of treatment, as directed by their physician; 8. Premenopausal females and females &lt;2 years after the onset of menopause should have a negative pregnancy test at Screening.

Before study entry, written informed consent must be obtained from the patient prior to performing any studyrelated procedures. Patients will not be entered in the study for any of the following: 1. Treatment with Denileukin Diftitox within 42 days prior to the start of Ipilimumab; 2. Prior treatment with Ipilimumab; 3. Known hypersensitivity to Ipilimumab or any of its components 4. Received radiotherapy for non CNS disease within the 2 weeks prior to commencing study treatment or have not recovered from side effects of all radiationrelated toxicities to Grade ≤1, except for alopecia; 5. Steroids within one week prior to initiation of Ipilimumab. 6. Preexisting autoimmune colitis. 7. Patients with an allograft requiring immunosuppression; 8. Known positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 9. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or refusing double barrier contraception, oral contraceptives, or avoidance of pregnancy measures; 10.
