	<brief_summary>Potato is one of the world's most popular foods and is widely accepted as a staple food. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of consuming instant mashed potatoes with and without fat on glycemic response, subjective appetite and food intake. It is hypothesized that mashed potato with added fat (as it is usually consumed) will result in lower glycaemic response and subjective appetite, and reduced subsequent food intake.</brief_summary>
