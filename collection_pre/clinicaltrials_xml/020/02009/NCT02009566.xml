	<brief_summary>Surgical sponges can be accidentally left inside patient's bodies. We are working on special tags (called microfabricated tags) that surgeons can put on their sponges. Then, if the surgeons forget to remove a sponge from a patient, they'll be able to detect these special tags in an x-ray.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical sponges can be accidentally left inside patient's bodies. We are working on special tags (called microfabricated tags) that surgeons can put on their sponges. Then, if the surgeons forget to remove a sponge from a patient, they'll be able to detect these special tags in an x-ray. We wish to take x-rays of healthy people's abdomens with microfabricated tags lying on them. The x-rays will help us improve our system for detecting sponges left inside people's bodies.</detailed_description>
