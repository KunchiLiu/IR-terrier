Subject has severe ECG morphologic abnormalities that make QTc evaluation difficult. Subject has a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities. Subject has a significant history of cardiovascular disease. Subject has received any anticancer therapies 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug, or has recovered to no better than a grade 2 or higher clinically significant adverse effect(s)/toxicity(s) of the previous therapy. Use of drugs with a known risk for QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes within 7 days prior to the first study dose.
