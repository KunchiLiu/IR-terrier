	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Vitamin D and Statins to Treat Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D is primarily generated in the skin, in response to direct absorption of ultraviolet B radiation. Vitamin D can also be obtained through fortified foods and oral supplements. Lipid abnormalities are common in the general population, and are regarded as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recently low vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing hyperlipidemia. Statins are normally the first-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia. It is also reported that vitamin D can improve serum lipid levels. However, its effects on hypercholesterolemia patients remain unclear. The investigators planned to determine the efficacy of combination therapy with statins and vitamin D in a cohort of hypercholesterolemia patients. This study may shed light as to whether oral vitamin D supplementation can be an adjunct therapy in hypercholesterolemia patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The main inclusion criteria were for hypercholesterolemia patients with the treatment of statins. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, bone disorders, and/or thyroid disorders. Patients were also excluded if they were taking vitamin D3 tablets or other lipidregulating drugs.</criteria>
