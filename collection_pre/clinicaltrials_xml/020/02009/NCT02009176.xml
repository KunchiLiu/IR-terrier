	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare short-term and long-term efficacy of two surgical methods by laparoscopic hepatectomy, and provide the evidence for the choice of surgical method from the pathology and cytology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscope Anatomical and Aon-anatomical Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the world's most common and most malignant tumor, accounting for more than 90% of primary liver cancer, the incidence ranked fifth of malignant tumors in the world. surgery and comprehensive treatment is recognized by the medical profession Surgical approach, including the open HCC hepatectomy and laparoscopic hepatectomy, minimally invasive surgery is the main theme of the 21st century, and laparoscopy as the one of the elements in the field of minimally invasive surgery which carried out more and more in liver surgery, but which one of the two methods to choice to hepatectomy lack of sufficient scientific evidence.The RCT research of laparoscopic anatomical and non-anatomical hepatectomy for HCC has not been reported at home and abroad; Intervention:We let the 110 patients divide into A, B groups randomly who are meet the inclusion criteria .Group A is Laparoscopic Anatomical Hepatectomy: Anatomy the corresponding liver segment pedicle and hepatectomy along the Glisson fiber sheath.Group B is Laparoscopic Aon-anatomical Hepatectomy:1 to 2 cm along the edge of the tumor complete hepatectomy Results: 1. operation time, intraoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, resection margin, number of micrometastases ,long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed. 2. groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank survival curves were used.</detailed_description>
