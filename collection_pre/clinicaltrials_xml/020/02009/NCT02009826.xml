	<brief_summary>Previous research has suggested central nervous system inflammatory activity to be critically involved in disease development and progression in schizophrenia, with a complex interplay of inflammatory mechanisms leading to the development of brain abnormalities and medical symptoms related to schizophrenia. However, the mutual interactions of different inflammatory pathways and their relation to disease course have not been sufficiently studied. This study therefore aims to explore the interaction of neuroinflammatory mechanisms in patients with schizophrenia and to assess whether the inflammatory activity in schizophrenia is state-dependent and occurs mainly during psychotic episodes.</brief_summary>

Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, paracetamol, immunosuppressant or immunostimulating drugs within 21 days of screening. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 21 days of screening. Has a history of drug or alcohol dependence according to DSMV criteria, except nicotine or caffeine, within 6 months before screening. Has history of (comorbid) somatization or mood disorder according to DSMV criteria within 6 months before screening. Has a positive test result for drugs of abuse or for alcohol at screening or test day. Female subjects only: is pregnant or breastfeeding Has a history of chronic or acute physical illness associated with abnormal immune changes within the 2 weeks before the study. Leukocytosis (i.e., white blood cell count ≤ 11 x109 /L) on screening and test days. Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibodies, or HIV antibodies at screening. Has a medical history of any autoimmune disorder or chronic inflammatory disease. Has received electroconvulsive therapy in the last 6 months. Is currently enrolled in a study with an investigational study drug. Worsening or first time occurrence of significant suicidality Has donated blood within 3 months before screening. Has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the wellbeing of the subject or the study or prevent the subject from meeting or performing study requirements. Low affinity binder of the TSPO, as determined by rs6971 polymorphism genotyping at Screening Use of benzodiazepines for 3x the halflife prior to PETscan Presence of irremovable magnetic materials in or on the body Has a medical history of organic brain disease Has a medical history of traumatic brain injury Has a medical history of allergic reaction to any of the substances in the tracer fluid. Unwillingness or inability of subject to undergo PET and/or MRI scan (for example due to claustrophobia or lack of cooperation) Healthy volunteers: Personal history of psychotic disorder Family history of psychotic or bipolar disorder in firstdegree relatives Family history of autoimmune disorder in firstdegree relatives Schizophrenia patients: Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) score &gt;6 at screening</criteria>
