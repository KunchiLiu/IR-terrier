	<brief_summary>Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology using the Real Imager 4(RI4) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D metabolic maps and based on sophisticated machine learning technology, provides objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor. The procedure is non-invasive, comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. Moreover, Real Imaging's 3D Functional MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating patients with mammographically dense breasts. The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the ability of this novel technology to detect clinically occult breast cancer in a cohort of women that are at high risk for breast cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of screening mammography and metabolic screening (3D MIRA) will result in significantly higher breast cancer detection rates.</brief_summary>
