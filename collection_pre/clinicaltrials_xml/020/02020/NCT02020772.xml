	<brief_summary>Patients who suffer from musculoskeletal pain often have more than one diagnosis. These patients mostly have to wait a long time for the doctor's examination and treatment, and they also often have a sick leave for a long period of time. The investigators expect that treatment and follow-up by an coordinating interdisciplinary team can improve these patients opportunity to function, increase their quality of life, and decrease their pain. The purpose of this study is to investigate if use of a coordinating interdisciplinary team in primary health care will result in reduced sick leave compared with practice as usual, and give fewer referrals to specialized health services and private rehabilitation centers. Research data will be obtained from the patients journals, questionnaires, and clinical examinations..</brief_summary>
