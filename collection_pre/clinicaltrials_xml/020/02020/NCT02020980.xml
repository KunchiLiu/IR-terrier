	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of intramuscular BoNT-A injections in relieving pain, in a broad population of patients who suffer pain as the primary problem associated with spasticity. Thus, this study will help to expand the information that is available regarding the impact of BoNT-A treatment in routine clinical practice conditions. Treatment goals can vary greatly from one patient to another and there is no unique, single outcome that reflects the treatment benefits in all the cases. Therefore, this study with special focus on the achievement of therapeutic goals, will allow the identification of each patient's specific goals regarding the improvement of the functional outcomes, the quality of life and patient well-being.</brief_summary>
