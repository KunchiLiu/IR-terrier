	<brief_title>Clinical Decision Support System for Quality Assurance in Potassium-Increasing Drug-Drug-Interactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development of hyperkalemia during potassium-increasing drug-drug-interactions (DDIs) is associated with (i) unknown or elevated serum potassium level at onset of treatment and (ii) insufficient monitoring of serum potassium during therapy. However, potassium-increasing DDIs are frequently started despite an unknown or elevated serum potassium level, and monitoring intervals often exceed 48 hours. This study investigates the impact of reminders for serum potassium monitoring and hyperkalemia alerts. Both reminders and alerts are displayed in the electronic patient chart of in-patients treated with potassium-increasing DDIs.</detailed_description>
