	<brief_summary>- We have previously reported the results of the primary and secondary outcomes of a randomized study aiming to investigate the impact of a restrictive transfusion protocol on the magnitude of reduction in blood transfusion in a typically mixed general surgery population subjected to major abdominal surgery. - The main finding of that study was a reduction in red blood cell usage with the implementation of a restrictive transfusion regimen. This was achieved without adversely affecting clinical outcome in the population studied. - The aim of this secondary analysis performed on a subgroup of 20 patients from the original study was to determine whether there are any differences in the postoperative immunologic response, as expressed by the production of inflammatory mediators, between a restrictive approach to red cell transfusion and a more liberal strategy.</brief_summary>
