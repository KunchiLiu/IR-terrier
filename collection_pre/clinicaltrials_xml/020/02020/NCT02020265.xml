	<brief_summary>EEG protocols exist for reducing stress and improve PTSD symptoms (A/T EEG protocols, Peniston, 1993, Hammond, 2005) however; our innovative EEG-NF LMI approach intends to be more amygdala/stress specific and therefore more efficient. Three groups of soldiers, while in operational activity will go through 24 sessions of 3 different methods of EEG-NF; our newly developed NF via MLI, a standard procedure for NF via A/T and a placebo NF. Difference between the groups in regard to their emotion regulation capability will be tested by fMRI with regard to amygdala activation following EEG-NF LMI as well as two stress challenge tests.</brief_summary>
