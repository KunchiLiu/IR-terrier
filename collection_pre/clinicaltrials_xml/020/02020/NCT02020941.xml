	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib works in treating patients with multiple myeloma in first relapse or refractory to first-line therapy. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma in First Relapse or Refractory to First-Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the overall response rate of carfilzomib after 8 cycles of treatment in patients with first-relapsed myeloma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the overall response rate to single agent carfilzomib after 4 cycles of treatment. II. To assess progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP). IV. To assess duration of response (DOR). V. To assess toxicities. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the effect of carfilzomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone on the following biologic end points and their correlation with response: measurements of bone remodeling (sodium fluoride F 18 positron emission tomography [PET], serum markers of bone remodeling and the bone marrow osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation and function) with the measurement of disease response and proteasome activity in the bone marrow microenvironment. II. To describe recapture of response after progression in the maintenance phase. OUTLINE: TREATMENT PHASE (COURSES 1-8): Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than partial response (PR) also receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV weekly in courses 4-8. MAINTENANCE PHASE (COURSES 9-14): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Patients who received dexamethasone in the Treatment Phase continue to receive dexamethasone PO or IV weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Multiple myeloma (MM) in first relapse or refractory to first line therapy; the previous line of therapy should include either an immunomodulatory agent or a proteasome inhibitor Refractory disease is defined as =&lt; 25% response or progression during therapy or within 60 days after completion The number of prior lines of antimyeloma therapy will be determined as follows: Induction chemotherapy for peripheralblood stem cell harvest followed by planned mobilization and subsequent highdose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is considered one therapy regardless of the induction regimen Planned maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation or other induction therapy is not considered a separate line of therapy, as long as there is no evidence of progression in the time between the induction or transplantation and the initiation of maintenance therapy Two ASCTs within 6 months of each other is considered as one line unless different agents were used in the highdose therapyconditioning regimens If the same regimen is repeated after a 6month interval, they are considered to be two separate therapeutic lines If cyclophosphamide is used for reasons other than planned stem cell mobilization, its use is considered to be a separate line of therapy Dose modification of steroid and altering choices of steroid (i.e. from dexamethasone to prednisone) due to side effects, is not considered a line of therapy, as long as there is no evidence of progression If a regimen was stopped for more than 2 months, its reinitiation is counted as another line of therapy Presence of existing lytic bone lesions either by skeletal Xray, computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Measurable MM disease, defined as one of the following: A monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration on serum electrophoresis of &gt;= 0.5 g/dL for an IgG myeloma, &gt;= 0.1 g/dL for an IgD myeloma or &gt;= 0.5 g/dL for an IgA myeloma Measurable urinary light chain secretion by quantitative analysis of &gt;= 200 mg/24 hours Involved serum free light chain (FLC) level &gt;= 10 mg/dL, provided the serum FLC ratio is abnormal Patients with oligo or nonsecretory disease must have bone marrow involvement with at least 30% plasmacytosis on aspiration Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months as determined by the treating physician Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1 or 2 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 × 10^9/L (without transfusion support and without hematological growth factor support within 2 weeks of cycle 1 day 1) Platelets &gt;= 50 × 10^9/L;
