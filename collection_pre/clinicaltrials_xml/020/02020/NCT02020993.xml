	<brief_summary>There is a need for a biochemical marker in addition to clinical condition which will help the physician to understand the clinical progress of the disease. Urine Nt-proBNP, which does not need any blood sampling and can be collected easily, has not been evaluated for respiratory distress in newborn. The investigators aim to evaluate the prognostic value of urine NT-proBNP in respiratory diseases in newborns by a controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urine NT-ProBNP in Neonatal Respiratory Distress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal diseases such as respiratory distress and transient tachypnea of newborn may require high level of intensive care. On the other hand, some minor difficulties in respiration can resolve within hours. Therefore, there is a need for a biochemical marker in addition to clinical condition which will help the physician to understand the clinical progress of the disease. Serum NT-ProBNP level has been evaluated in transient tachypnea of newborn and found compatible with the clinical progress. Urine NT-proBNP has recently been evaluated in patent ductus arterioses and found compatible with the cardiac progress. However, urine Nt-proBNP, which does not need any blood sampling and can be collected easily, has not been evaluated for respiratory distress in newborn. The investigators aim to evaluate the prognostic value of urine NT-proBNP in respiratory diseases in newborns by a controlled trial.</detailed_description>
