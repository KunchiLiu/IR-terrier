	<brief_summary>Endoscopic high-frequency soft coagulation is available for the management of bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessels during endoscopic submucosal dissection. However, its efficacy on peptic ulcer bleeding has not been elucidated so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of hemostasis with soft coagulation using hemostatic forceps by comparing it with argon plasma coagulation (APC) in a prospective, randomized trial.</brief_summary>
