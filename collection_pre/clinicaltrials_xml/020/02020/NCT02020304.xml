	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that a combined spinal-epidural drug at refrigerated temperature will have a shorter period of pain relief than that maintained at room temperature. The temperature of the dose of medication will be measure with an infrared thermometer immediately prior (within 5 minutes) to administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Spinal-Epidural Temperature and Duration of Action</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive a combined spinal epidural medication as per standard of care to treat their labor pain; however, they will be randomized to receive either a dose maintained at room temperature (60-75 degrees F) or one maintained in a refrigerator (~&lt;43 degrees F). Duration of action will be done by assessments of pain, vital signs, nausea, itching, bromage and fetal heart rate every 15 minutes until the subject requests additional pain medication to treat their labor pain.</detailed_description>
