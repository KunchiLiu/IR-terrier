	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine menthol smokers' perception, product preference, and pattern of use across six products including, mint-flavored nicotine gum; non-flavored nicotine gum; mentholated nicotine inhaler; and non-menthol nicotine inhaler. Participants will undergo an orientation and baseline assessment followed by a 2-week product sampling phase. At the end of the 2 weeks of sampling, subjects will select a product to use during the following 2-week smoking cessation phase. This 2-week abstinence phase is followed by one week of abrupt withdrawal of the product. This study design was successfully used in a study we conducted that examined the smokers' preference for a variety or oral tobacco products.</brief_summary>
