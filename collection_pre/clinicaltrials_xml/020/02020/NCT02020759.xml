	<brief_summary>Neurological complications are frequent during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) representing a crucial factor for patient outcome. However, to date there is no consensus with regard to optimal neurological monitoring of patients undergoing ECMO. The aim of this study is to monitor patients using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during ECMO therapy. The study hypothesis is that TCD and NIRS technology are sufficient tools to detect cerebral embolism and hypoperfusion during ECMO therapy.</brief_summary>
