	<brief_summary>Virtual reality is currently used as a therapeutic strategy in common phobia as agoraphobia or acrophobia, since it permits to have a better control (on occurrence of events or on the environment) during the therapy than in "in vivo" therapy. Our hypothesis here is that we can improves the therapeutic effects of the virtual exposure by giving control to acrophobic patients during their exposure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Reality and Concept of Control in the Treatment of Acrophobia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is based on the exposure of acrophobic patients to virtual environments. During the study, several groups of patients will be distributed according to different conditions: exposure to anxiogenous virtual environments and exposure with the ability to control and secure the anxiogenous virtual environments. The interest of this project is to improve therapy by exposure to virtual reality. Our project offers a systematic therapeutic approach (using virtual reality and the concept of control) where current therapy are too often approximate. We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control of virtual environments on symptomatic and psychophysiological levels, to evaluate the adoption of these methods in the couple patients-caregivers and also to understand the brain mechanisms (including those prefrontal) involved in this therapy.</detailed_description>
