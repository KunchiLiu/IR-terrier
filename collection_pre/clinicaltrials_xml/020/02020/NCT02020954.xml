	<brief_title>Prospective Becker-Heart-Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cohort of 100 patients with mutations in the dystrophin gene associated with Becker muscular dystrophy and/or dilated cardiomyopathy will be included (patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are excluded). Patients with undergo at baseline the following workups: electrocardiogram, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, sera biomarkers measurement. At 3 years and 5 years, patients will be investigated according to the same protocol and occurrence of cardiac adverse events in the meanwhile will be recorded. Statistical analysis will assess correlations between cardiac phenotype and DMD mutations and prognostic value of cardiac investigations.</detailed_description>
