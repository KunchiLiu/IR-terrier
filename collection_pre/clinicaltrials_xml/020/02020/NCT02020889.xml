	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, double-blind study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab (300 milligram [mg] administered subcutaneously [SC] every 4 weeks) compared with placebo over a 52-week study treatment period in subjects with relapsing or refractory Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) receiving standard of care therapy including background corticosteroid therapy with or without immunosuppressive therapy. During the treatment period, in accordance with standard of care, corticosteroid dose will be tapered. The key outcomes in the study focus on evaluation of clinical remission, defined as Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS)=0 with a corticosteroid dose of &lt;=4 mg/day prednisolone/prednisone, reduction in disease relapse and reduction in corticosteroid requirement.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed Consent: Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in the study, which will include the ability to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Subjects must be able to read, comprehend, and write at a level sufficient to complete study related materials. Age and gender: Male or female subjects age 18 years or older. EGPA diagnosis: subjects who have been diagnosed with EGPA for at least 6 months based on the history or presence of: asthma plus eosinophilia (&gt;1.0x10^9/Liter and/or &gt;10% of leucocytes) plus at least two of the following additional features of EGPA; a biopsy showing histopathological evidence of eosinophilic vasculitis, or perivascular eosinophilic infiltration, or eosinophilrich granulomatous inflammation; neuropathy, mono or poly (motor deficit or nerve conduction abnormality); pulmonary infiltrates, nonfixed; sinonasal abnormality; cardiomyopathy (established by echocardiography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging); glomerulonephritis (haematuria, red cell casts, proteinuria); alveolar haemorrhage (by bronchoalveolar lavage); palpable purpura; anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive (Myeloperoxidase or proteinease 3). History of relapsing OR refractory disease defined as: Relapsing disease: Subject must have a past history of at least one confirmed EGPA relapse (i.e., requiring increase in oral corticosteroids (OCS) dose, initiation/increased dose of immunosuppressive therapy or hospitalisation) within the past 2 years which occurred at least 12 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1) whilst receiving a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of &gt;=7.5 milligram per day (mg/day). Refractory disease: Either: Failure to attain remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose &lt;=7.5 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent) within the last 6 months following induction treatment with a standard regimen, administered for at least 3 months. Note: a) Subjects who have received a cyclophosphamide (CYC) induction regimen may be included a minimum of 2 weeks after the last dose of daily oral CYC, or 3 weeks after the last dose of pulsed intravenous CYC prior to Baseline (Visit 2), if their total white blood cells (WBC) is &gt;=4x10^9/Liter (tested at the local laboratory, if necessary) prior to randomisation. b) Subjects who have received a methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil induction regimen may be included if on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 2). c) Subjects who have received an induction regimen comprising corticosteroids alone may be included only if they have failed to attain remission after 3 months of treatment AND the corticosteroid dose is &gt;=15 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent for the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 2). Or: Within 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1), recurrence of symptoms of EGPA (not necessarily meeting the protocol definition of relapse) whilst tapering OCS, occurring at any dose level &gt;=7.5 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent. Corticosteroid therapy: Subject must be on a stable dose of oral prednisolone or prednisone of &gt;=7.5 mg/day (but not &gt;50 mg/day) for at least 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 2). Immunosuppressive therapy: If receiving immunosuppressive therapy (excluding cyclophosphamide) the dosage must be stable for the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 2) and during the study (dose reductions for safety reasons will be permitted). ECG measurements: QTc(F)&lt;450 msec or QTc(F)&lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread. For subject eligibility and withdrawal decisions, QTcFwill be used. For purposes of data analysis, QTcF will be used as primary though data using both correction formulas will be collected and analysed. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period. Female subjects: To be eligible for entry into the study, females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control (as discussed in the protocol) beginning with consent, for the duration of the trial and for 4 months after the last study drug administration. French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.
