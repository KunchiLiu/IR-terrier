	<brief_summary>The trial is divided in two parts, Part A and Part B. Part A will involve dose-finding of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part B will involve expansion of the MTD to 3 cohorts including non-small cell lung cancer squamous histology, recurrent/ metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck and other advanced solid tumours (except sarcomas).</brief_summary>
