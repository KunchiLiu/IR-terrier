	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a technique designed to improve processing speed (i.e. the amount of time it takes to process information) in a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) population. The study is designed to study how well this technique can help people with TBI increase their processing speed and their ability to function better in everyday life.</brief_summary>
