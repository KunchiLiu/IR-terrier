	<brief_title>Effect of a Test Meal on Satiation Hormones in Obese and Normal Weight Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis is that obese adolescents have a disturbed balance of hormones associated with appetite regulation with less suppression of ghrelin and attenuated stimulation of GLP-1 secretion in response to meal intake compared to lean normal weight controls. A second aim of the study was to test which gastrointestinal peptides are most associated with insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
