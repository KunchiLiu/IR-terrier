	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, single administration design, conducted in patients with OA of the knee. Patients will be enrolled sequentially with 8 to 10 patients per Cohort as follows: Cohort A: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 20 Cohort B: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 16 Cohort C: FX006 10 mg, Final Visit at Week 12 Cohort D: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 12 Cohort E: Triamcinolone acetonide immediate-release (TCA IR) 40 mg, Final Visit Week 12 Each patient will be evaluated for up to 12, 16 or 20 weeks following a single intra-articular (IA) injection of FX006 at 10 mg or 40 mg or TCA IR 40 mg, depending on the assigned Cohort. Following the screening visit, safety will be evaluated at three (3) out-patient visits and synovial fluid will be collected at Day 1 for baseline measurements and the Final Visit for drug concentration measurements.</brief_summary>
