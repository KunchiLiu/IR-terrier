	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will examine the efficacy of extended-release baclofen (Baclofen ER) for the treatment of cocaine dependence. The primary study outcome will be urines positive for benzoylecgonine (BE), a metabolite of cocaine, submitted during outpatient treatment (12-week) and follow-up (12-week). To examine brain mechanisms of relapse/recovery, participants will complete fMRI sessions before, during, and after treatment. Brain responses to specific probes of reward and inhibition will be used as biomarkers predicting drug use during and after the treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Physically healthy cocainedependent (based on DSMIV TR criteria) male or female aged 1860 yrs, voluntarily seeking treatment for cocaine dependence. 2. Females must be nonpregnant, non lactating and either be of nonchildbearing potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 1 year postmenopausal) or of child bearing potential, but practicing a medically acceptable method of birth control. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this protocol include barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, an intrauterine device (IUD), oral contraceptives, a levonorgestrel implant, intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system, medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection, and abstinence. 3. Reading level at or above eighth grade. 4. Participants provide voluntary informed consent. 5. Smoking is primary route of cocaine administration. 6. Available for an inpatient stay. 1. Participation in clinical trial and receipt of investigational drug(s) during previous 60 days, except as explicitly approved by the Principal Investigator. 2. Clinically significant cardiovascular, hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurological or endocrinological abnormalities. 3. History of serious head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness that lasted more than 3 minutes or associated with skull fracture or intercranial bleeding or abnormal MRI. 4. Presence of magnetically active prosthetics, plates, pins, broken needles, permanent retainer, bullets, etc. in patient's body (unless a radiologist confirms that its presence is unproblematic). An xray may be obtained to determine eligibility. 5. Claustrophobia or other medical condition that disables the participant from lying in the MRI for approximately 60 minutes. 6. Current or prior gambling problems (assessed by participants selfreport) 7. Nonremovable skin patches 8. Have received medication that could interact adversely with baclofen, including muscle relaxants (including tricyclic antidepressants), antiseizure medication, CNS depressants (tranquilizers, sleeping pills), MAO inhibitors), within the time of administration of study agent based on the study physician's guidance (e.g. 5 half lives) 9. Have known or suspected hypersensitivity to baclofen. 10. Be taking baclofen for any reason currently or during the past year.</criteria>
