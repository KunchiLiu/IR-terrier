	<brief_summary>The DeFRA questionnaire is a new validated algorithm derived from FRAX. Here we use the DeFRA as a "primary anamnestic from" to identify subjects at risk of osteoporosis in a population never screened before and never treated for this disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DeFRA Questionnaire as an Anamnestic Form</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is an increasing recognition that the management of osteoporosis requires the characterization of fracture risk to be based on absolute risk rather than single measures such as bone mineral density (BMD). However, the threshold for pharmacological intervention for osteoporosis remains controversial. The aim of the present project is to perform a large scale study to identify subjects at risk of osteoporosis by administering the DeFRA questionnaire in a population never screened or treated before for osteoporosis. DeFRA questionnaire will be administered before and after DEXA scanning, to further validate the questionnaire and to highlight the predictive value of this protocol as a tool to screen the general population.</detailed_description>
