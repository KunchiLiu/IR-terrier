	<brief_summary>The purpose of the this international, multicenter, randomised, single-blind, parallel group, Phase III study is to demonstrate that a single transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided intraprostatic injection of NX-1207 provides a long lasting therapeutic improvement of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) in patients not adequately controlled by medical therapy with α-blockers, as assessed by a change from baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) total score.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent; Age 45 or older; Medical history of LUTS/BPH Use of a marketed αblocker for LUTS/BPH in the last 8 weeks; LUTS/BPH not adequately controlled by medical therapy with αblockers; Presence of moderatesevere LUTS (IPSS ≥ 15) at screening and at baseline (after a 4 week runin period with tamsulosin 0.4 mg QD); Prostate Volume ≥ 30 mL and ≤ 70 mL (as assessed by TRUS); Qmax &lt; 15 mL/sec based on a minimum void of 125 mL; Agree not to use any other approved or experimental BPH or overactive bladder (OAB) medication anytime during the core study; Agree to perform followup visits even in case of oral treatment discontinuation before study end; Satisfactory compliance to runin medication at Visit 2 (baseline).
