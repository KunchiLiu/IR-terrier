	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine desflurane's dose-dependent effect on left ventricular (LV) function in cardiac surgery. The change of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of lateral mitral valve annular velocity at three different desflurane concentrations would be analyzed by using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in cardiac surgery patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Desflurane on Cardiac Function During Cardiac Surgery: Tissue Doppler Imaging of Mitral Valve Annular Velocity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI ) of mitral annular velocity during the cardiac cycle has been introduced as a reliable method for analysis of systolic and diastolic LV ling-axix function , efficacy of diastolic TDI profile, including early early relaxation (E') and atrial contraction (A') and has been suggested to be useful in predicting the postoperative clinical outcomes and the impact of isoflurane on LV diastolic function. Desflurane is widely used in cardiac surgery patients due to its beneficial effects , but many studies have shown that desflurane reduces myocardial contractility in a dose-dependent manner, and compromises left ventricular( LV) function We hypothesized that desflurane , even at a clinical dosage, would affects intraoperative LV systolic function in a dose-dependent manner and thus produce significant changes int the TDI profiles of mitral annular velocity. So we planned to study the changes in TDI profiles of lateral mitral annular velocity at the clinical desflurane dosage during remifentanil based anesthesia for cardiac surgery</detailed_description>
