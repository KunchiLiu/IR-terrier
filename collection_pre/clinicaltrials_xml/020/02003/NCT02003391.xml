	<criteria>Have a clinical diagnosis of either open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Currently on betablocker monotherapy (for &gt;30 days) and would benefit, in the opinion of the investigator, from further intraocular pressure (lOP) reduction. Have a mean baseline lOP of &gt;18 mmHg and &lt;32 mmHg in at least one eye. Must be able to understand and sign an Informed Consent form. Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply. Use of medication excluded by the protocol. Diseases, illnesses, infections, or ocular abnormalities excluded by the protocol. Ocular surgeries or procedures excluded by the protocol. Bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (equivalent to 20/80 Snellen, 0.60 logMAR or 0.25 decimal). Hypersensitivity to prostaglandin analogues or any component of the study medications in the opinion of the investigator. Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, test positive for pregnancy at Screening visit, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study. Other protocolspecified exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
