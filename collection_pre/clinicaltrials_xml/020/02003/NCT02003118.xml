Patient has a concurrent medical/arthritic disease that could confound or interfere with evaluation of efficacy. Patients with impaired renal function, defined as an estimated creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 ml/min, or patients taking medications that might impair renal function. Patient has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIIV congestive heart failure.
