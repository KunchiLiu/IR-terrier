	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is considered immune reaction of gastrointestinal tract. Therefore there is growing evidence that IBS could occur after gastroenteritis. However, little is known about the incidence of IBS after acute diverticulitis. We thought that post diverticulitis status could induce IBS because diverticulitis was also bowel inflammatory disorder. This survey was designed to identify incidence of post-diverticulitis IBS and risk factor in Korea.</brief_summary>
