	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between the Independent Activities of Daily Living (I-ADL) component of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and poor tolerance to radiation treatment in older and younger patients with non-ovarian gynecological cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Adherence/Toxicity in Patients With Non-Ovarian Gynecological Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are little data regarding the impact of functional age on tolerance to radiotherapy for gynecologic cancers. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) tool which measures functional status (including the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (I-ADL)), among many other important geriatric related conditions, was developed by Hurria and colleagues. Geriatric assessment variables including functional status predicted for toxicity in older patients receiving chemotherapy and surgery for multiple cancer types., 2 We hypothesize that I-ADL can be used to predict treatment tolerance in patients of all ages receiving pelvic and/or paraaortic region radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies.</detailed_description>
