	<brief_summary>The pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery have the potential to cause an increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies have proposed that ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of increased ICP. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of pnemoperitoneum on intracranial pressure and cerebral oxygenation during laparoscopic surgery according to anesthesia agents, propofol based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA group) and desflurane anesthesia (Des group).</brief_summary>
