	<brief_summary>HIV patients may suffer sooner from aging than average population, including brain aging. Our hypothesis is that if brain dysfunctions are explained by a quicker loss of neurons in HIV patients, this loss could be detected earlier by a thinning down of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), compared to non HIV patients of the same age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Revealing Increased Axonal Loss in Treated HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to compare the thickness of the RNFL and the thickness of the RCGs measured by spectral domain OCT between patients infected by HIV and patients of same age non infected by HIV.</detailed_description>
