	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Study of the Effectiveness of IV Fluid Infusion in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke (IVIS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to find the effect of early IV fluid administration to patients with acute ischemic stroke on the neurological outcome and to determine the side effects of intravenous fluids. Due to its cost effectiveness and wide accessibility, the possible application or use of IV fluid infusion as first line treatment can aide in the treatment of more acute ischemic stroke patients worldwide. This novel information will aide physicians with more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of utilizing IV fluid in future treatment plans for patients with acute ischemic stroke.</detailed_description>
