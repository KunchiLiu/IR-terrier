	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with estrogen deprivation to see how they work compared to docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab without estrogen deprivation in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer that is operable or has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using goserelin acetate and aromatase inhibition therapy may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy with or without hormone therapy may be an effective treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, operable or locally advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel, Carboplatin, Trastuzumab, and Pertuzumab With or Without Estrogen Deprivation in Treating Patients With Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Positive Operable or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the addition of estrogen deprivation to neoadjuvant therapy consisting of therapy of docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (TCHP) yields a greater rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) (breast and nodes) than TCHP alone when administered to women with operable, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the addition of estrogen deprivation to neoadjuvant therapy consisting of TCHP will increase the pCR rate in the breast compared to TCHP alone when administered to women with operable, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer. II. To determine whether the addition of estrogen deprivation to neoadjuvant therapy consisting of TCHP improves recurrence-free interval (RFI) in women with operable, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer. III. To determine whether the addition of estrogen deprivation to neoadjuvant therapy consisting of TCHP improves overall survival (OS) in women with operable, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer. IV. To compare the rates of second primary invasive cancer by treatment arm. V. Assessment of patterns of pCR, RFI, and OS by menopausal status. VI. To evaluate the cardiac toxicity associated with each of the regimens. VII. To compare the effect of adding estrogen deprivation to neoadjuvant therapy on endocrine-related symptoms in all patients by treatment arm. VIII. To compare the effect of adding estrogen deprivation to neoadjuvant therapy on vasomotor symptoms, musculoskeletal, and vaginal complaints as well as quality of life. IX. To determine a relationship between pCR and a potential mechanism of resistance/sensitivity in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive tumors. X. To evaluate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and immune biomarkers as predictors of pCR. XI. To study early changes in TILs and other immune biomarkers in response to TCHP. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments arms. NEOADJUVANT: ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes, trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes, and pertuzumab IV over 30-60 on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients enrolled after Amendment #4 undergo 2 core biopsies prior to course 3 of treatment. ARM II: All patients receive docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab as in arm I. Premenopausal patients also receive goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) every 28 days until surgery and aromatase inhibition therapy at the investigator's discretion daily until 1 day before surgery. Postmenopausal patients receive aromatase inhibition therapy at the investigator's discretion daily until 1 day before surgery. Patients enrolled after Amendment #4 undergo 2 core biopsies prior to course 3 of treatment. SURGERY: Patients undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy. RADIATION: Patients undergo whole breast irradiation within 8 weeks following surgery. ADJUVANT: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes every 21 days for up to 1 year. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6, 9, 12, and 18 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>

if the regional lymph nodes are cN1 and cytologically or histologically positive or if cN2N3 with or without a biopsy, the primary breast tumor can be cT0T4 The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) within 6 weeks prior to randomization; if suspicious or abnormal, fine needle aspirate (FNA) or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to randomization; findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to randomization: Nodal status negative Imaging of the axilla is negative Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is negative Nodal status positive FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or core biopsy was not performed Patients may be premenopausal or postmenopausal at the time of randomization; for study purposes, postmenopausal is defined as: Age 56 or older with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months prior to study entry; or Age 55 or younger with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months prior to study entry (e.g., spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy) and with a documented estradiol level in the postmenopausal range according to local institutional/laboratory standard; or Documented bilateral oophorectomy The tumor must have been determined to be HER2postive as follows: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or In situ hybridization (ISH)positive (defined by ratio of HER2 to circulating endothelial progenitors [CEP]17 &gt;= 2.0 or HER2 gene copy number &gt;= 6 per nucleus) The tumor must have been determined to be estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone (PgR) positive assessed by current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologist (CAP) guideline recommendations for hormone receptor testing;

2.5 x ULN, the AST must be =&lt; the ULN; if the AST is &gt; the ULN but =&lt; 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be =&lt; ULN; Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be =&lt; 1.5 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be =&lt; 1.5 x ULN Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase &gt; ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, positron emission tomography [PET]CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements are met Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is &gt; ULN but =&lt; 2.5 x ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PETCT scan, or PET scan performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease Within 6 weeks prior to randomization, the most recent serum creatinine must be =&lt; ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance must be &gt; 60 mL/min Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment must be performed within 90 days prior to randomization; (LVEF assessment performed by 2dimensional [2D] echocardiogram is preferred; however, multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA] scan may be substituted based on institutional preferences); the LVEF must be &gt;= 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal; note: since the preentry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment; if the baseline LVEF is &gt; 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and repeat the test if the accuracy is uncertain FNA alone to diagnose the breast cancer Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to randomization Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to randomization;
