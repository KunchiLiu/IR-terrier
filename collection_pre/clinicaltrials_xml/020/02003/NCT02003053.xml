	<brief_summary>Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is an intervention used with success in the outpatient setting within the COPD population. Use of IMT is also theoretically possible during mechanical ventilation. This study will determine if the IMT excercise will increase Maximum Inspiratory Pressure and will also assess the feseability and safety of the study.</brief_summary>
