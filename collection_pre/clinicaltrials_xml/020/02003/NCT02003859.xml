	<brief_summary>Studies over the past two decades have convincingly demonstrated the role of barrier dysfunction in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. It previously shown that optical biopsy with probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) could be used to assess mucosal barrier function. Furthermore, mucosal barrier dysfunction on pCLE was shown to be predictive of disease relapse in adult IBD patients. The purpose of the current study is to determine the predictive value of pCLE findings in pediatric IBD patients.</brief_summary>
