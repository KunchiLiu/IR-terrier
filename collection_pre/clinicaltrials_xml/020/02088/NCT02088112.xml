	<brief_summary>This a Phase I, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of gefitinib in combination with MEDI4736 (anti PD-L1) in Subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study consists of two phases: Escalation phase and an expansion phase to be conducted in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEDI4736 (Anti PD-L1) Combined With Gefitinib in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Escalation phase: MEDI4736 and gefitinib in NSCLC subjects In Expansion phase: Subjects with EGFR mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled in expansion arms. Initiation of expansion arms with the recommended dose of MEDI4736 in combination with gefitinib will be based on an adequate safety and tolerability profile of the combination from the escalation phase.</detailed_description>
