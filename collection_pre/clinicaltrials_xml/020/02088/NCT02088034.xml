	<brief_title>Intervention to Promote Weight Loss in Latinas At-risk for Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed research is to compare two evidence-based strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes - promotora-led lifestyle intervention and metformin - vs. usual care (UC) among Latinas in a "real world" setting. The aims of this study are to 1) develop a protocol-based, promotora-led lifestyle intervention (PLI) to promote weight loss in at-risk Latinas, and assess its feasibility; 2) compare changes in weight and cardiometabolic markers—hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipids, blood pressure—from baseline to 1 year between at-risk Latinas randomly assigned to the PLI group versus metformin and usual care (UC) groups; and 3) understand the social and cultural context surrounding weight-related behaviors among Latinas at-risk for diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that Latinas assigned to PLI and metformin will have greater weight loss (primary outcome) and greater improvements in cardiometabolic markers from baseline to 1 year than those randomized to UC</detailed_description>
