	<brief_title>Thermocool SF Catheter Versus Thermocool Catheter in Isthmus-dependent Atrial Flutter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New porous tip catheters appear more effective in atrial fibrillation ablation than conventional irrigated catheter, with the same safety. We could hypothesize porous tip irrigated catheters are more effective than conventional irrigated catheter, reducing procedure time and RF ablation time.We realize a randomized comparison study. For that, 70 patients with an indication for isthmus-dependent atrial flutter ablation will be randomized to conventional irrigated catheter ablation or porous tip irrigated catheter ablation. A ECG-Holter examination will be done at 1 month follow up after catheter ablation, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
