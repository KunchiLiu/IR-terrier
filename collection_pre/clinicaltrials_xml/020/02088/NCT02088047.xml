	<brief_summary>This study is designed to pilot an intervention technique to reduce the self-stimulating behaviors seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorders using intervention with ProFoveate pellets. Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, eye blinking, and rocking, can interfere with the individual's ability to interact with their peers. Participants will wear the pellets for four week and measures with taken again. Another group of participants will not get the pellets. Both groups will be tested at the beginning and end of the study. Any variations in self-stimulating behaviors will be documented through parent report, Observational data. The investigators hypothesize that they will see changes in self- stimulating behaviors as a result of the strategic placement of the ProFoveateâ„¢ pellets on the ears of one group of the participants.</brief_summary>
