	<brief_title>Dynamic Ventilatory and Asymmetry of the Chest Wall During Breath Stacking and Volume-oriented Incentive Spirometer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All volunteers were undergone to two types of pulmonary expansion therapy (PET) techniques: volume incentive spirometry (VIS) and BS. Procedures involved two distinct phases: assessment and intervention. In the first day was performed assessment of the participants to obtain the following data: anamnesis, initial evaluation using the Ashwouth Scale, Barthel Index and Mini Mental State Examination, anthropometric data and pulmonary function using spirometry and respiratory muscle pressures. Intervention phase was performed in two different days, each day for only one PET techniques (VIS or BS), with a minimal wash-out period of one day according to the randomization sequence. Optoelectronic Pletysmography (OEP) was recorded during quite breathing at rest and during the execution of five maneuvers form each PET technique tested.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with right hemiparesis due to stroke for more than three months, of both genders, most than 20 years, with scores between 1 and 3 for Ashworth Scale for upper limb, up to 85 for Index score Barthel and minimum score of 18 on the Mini Mental State Examination. Facial paralysis, rheumatic or orthopedic diseases or deformities / abnormalities in the spine that could compromise the respiratory mechanics; reported respiratory conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis) or presenting spirometry with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) below 80% predicted and compared VEF1/Capacitate Forced vital â‰¤ .7; history of recent abdominal or thoracic surgery and hemodynamic instability or pregnancy.</criteria>
