	<brief_title>Evaluation of Soy-protein Russian Tarragon (Artemisia Dracunculus L.)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plants from the genus Artemisia, and specifically Artemisia dracunculus L. (Russian tarragon) have had a long history of medicinal (health) and culinary (food) use and have been reported as effective as a traditional treatments for diabetes in various parts of the world. The overall objective of this study is to conduct early human investigation and to evaluate the effect of nutritional supplementation with a well characterized extract of Artemisia dracunculus L. The primary objectives would be to evaluate safety, tolerability and effective dose in non-diabetic human subjects. Secondary objectives would assess metabolism of the extract and evaluate effects on proposed mechanisms such as insulin secretion, lipid levels and/or insulin resistance. After completing a screening visit and meeting qualifications for the single oral dose evaluation, subjects will receive three single doses (two different doses of the supplement and one dose of placebo) on three separate test periods which are separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. Each testing period requires an overnight stay on the inpatient unit. The inpatient stay will be approximately 26 hours. The doses that will be used in the study are 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20 and 30 grams plus the placebo. The supplement and the placebo will be mixed with sugar-free flavoring in water. There will be an opportunity to sample the liquid drink during the screening visit. Screening visit 1 (about 1 hour) - Fasting (Nothing to eat or drink other than water for at least 10 hours prior to appointment) - Sign informed consent if willing to participate - Body weight and height will be measured (body mass index will be calculated from these measures) - Blood pressure, pulse and temperature will be measured - Physical exam and ECG (electrocardiogram) - Report any medications taken over the past 3 months - Blood draw (about 2 teaspoons) to assess overall health - Taste test ALL PROCEDURES AND VISITS LISTED BELOW WILL BE REPEATED 3 TIMES. ALL TESTING WILL BE DONE FOR EACH SINGLE DOSE TESTING PERIOD (1,2,3) - Testing Period 1: Day -3, Day 1, Day 2 - 7 Day Washout - Testing Period 2: Day -3, Day 1, Day 2 - 7 Day Washout - Testing Period 3: Day -3, Day 1, Day 2 Day -3 (about 4 hours) Fasting (Nothing to eat or drink other than water for at least 10 hours prior to appointment) - Blood pressure, pulse and temperature will be measured - An IV line will be placed in an arm vein for blood draw purposes and will remain there throughout the testing. - A blood draw (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be done before and after dosing to assess any changes in glucose or insulin. - An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) will be done A blood sample will be drawn from the IV line, and then the subject will drink a sugar solution consisting of 75 grams of glucose. Blood will be drawn at specific times after the drink is consumed. Each blood sample will be about 1 tablespoon. (6 tablespoons total for the test). During the IV procedure, a small amount of the subject's own blood (less than 1 teaspoon) will immediately be returned into the vein through the IV after each specimen is collected. - Adverse events and changes in medication will be assessed by the staff - Meet with staff briefly about dietary intake and weight maintenance diets Day 1 (Inpatient Stay- 26 hours) Fasting (Nothing to eat or drink other than water for at least 10 hours prior to appointment) - Admission to the inpatient unit in the morning of the Day 1 visit. The subject will remain on the unit overnight and be discharged on Day 2. - Blood pressure, pulse and temperature will be measured. - Randomization to the study dosing scheme will occur. Randomization is like flipping a coin. You and the study staff will not know what dose you are receiving or if you are receiving placebo (inactive pill). - Single dose of extract given (either the supplement or placebo). The dose will be given 2 hours prior to the start of the OGTT. The extract will be in a powder form and will be mixed with up to 8 ounces of liquid for you to drink. - An IV line will be placed in the arm vein for blood draw purposes and will remain there throughout the testing. - OGTT as described above (at day -3). - A blood draw (approximately 2 teaspoons) before and after dosing will be done to assess any changes in glucose or insulin. Blood draws will occur at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 minutes and 12 hours after dosing. - An ECG performed will be performed. - Adverse events and changes in medication will be assessed by the staff. - The subject will be asked to fast overnight until your blood work on Day 2. Day 2 (Inpatient) Blood pressure, weight, pulse and temperature will be measured. - A physical exam will be done - A 24 hour post dose blood draw (approximately 1 teaspoon) will be done. - Study staff will schedule the next testing period if applicable and then the subject will be discharged from the inpatient unit.</detailed_description>
