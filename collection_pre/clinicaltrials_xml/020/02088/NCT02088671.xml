	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical study is to investigate whether the NeuroSENSE is an adequate monitor of hypnotic depth-of-anesthesia (DOA). Therefore, this study will investigate whether the information provided by the NeuroSENSE Monitor can help in assessing the hypnotic effect of anesthetics in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of the NeuroSENSE for Monitoring the Hypnotic Depth of Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In particular, the study will focus on the correlation between the WAVcns index, a proprietary quantifier of cortical activity displayed by the NeuroSENSE, with (1) commonly assessed clinical endpoints/variables relating to the DOA, (2) changes in anesthetic drug administration, and (3) the anesthesiologist's assessment of the DOA based on standard of care monitors and his/her own observations of the patient state. The hypothesis under evaluation is that the WAVcns index is an independent assessor of the progression of the anesthetic state and events of general anesthesia related to hypnotic endpoints.</detailed_description>
