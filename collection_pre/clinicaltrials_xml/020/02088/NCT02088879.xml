	<brief_summary>The chest compression depth decreases over time after starting continuous chest compression due to the rescuers' fatigue. The investigators hypothesized that the frequency parameters from surface electromyogram from each muscle during chest compression may reflect the muscle fatigue of the rescuers. Then investigators can identify which of the body are mainly used and get tired by continuous chest compression using surface electromyogram.</brief_summary>
