	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate whether long-term oral N-acetylcysteine as an expectorant drug can reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and improve their quality of life. Methods: Patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis will be randomly assigned to the observer group (participants receive 600 mg of oral N-acetylcysteine BID for 12 months) or the control group (participants receive oral tablet BID for 12 months). The primary endpoint was the frequency of acute exacerbations. Expected results: Compared with the control group, the frequency of acute exacerbations of the observer Group will decrease significantly. Hypothesis: Long-term oral N-acetylcysteine can reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and improve their quality of life.</brief_summary>
