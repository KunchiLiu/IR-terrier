	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, randomized, single dose, 3-period crossover PK study. This study will comprise 3 treatment periods with a 4-day washout between periods. On Day -1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. On Days 1, 5, and 9, subjects will be administered Treatment A, B, or C according to the randomization schedule. - Treatment A: a single dose of 160 mg ACY-1215 CLF (20 mg/mL) in the fed state - Treatment B: a single dose of 120 mg ACY-1215 ALF (10 mg/mL) in the fed state - Treatment C: a single dose of 120 mg ACY-1215 ALF (10 mg/mL) in the fasted state</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be confined to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from the time of Check-in (Day -1) to Day 10. Predose blood and urine samples will be obtained prior to each ACY-1215 administration. Following administration of ACY-1215 in each period, blood and urine samples will be collected at specified timepoints or intervals through 24 hours postdose for the determination of the PK of a single oral dose of ACY-1215. Subjects will be discharged from the CRU on Day 10, following the completion of the last PK collection and successful completion and evaluation of discharge safety tests. Subjects will return to the clinic for a Follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after the last dose of ACY-1215 (Days 14 to 16) for additional safety evaluations.</detailed_description>
