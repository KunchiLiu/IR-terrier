	<brief_summary>The Fit Study is a three-year, cluster-randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the impact of school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and reporting on child health. Seventy-five California schools will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) BMI screening and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or reporting (control). Investigators will assess the impact of BMI reporting on students' BMI trajectories over three years. Investigators will also assess the impact of BMI screening on weight-based teasing, feelings of stigmatization, and weight-control behaviors among students.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMI Screening and Reporting in Schools: The Fit Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Fit Study is a three-year, cluster-randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the impact of school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and reporting on childhood obesity and psychosocial outcomes. This study will take place during the 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 school years. Seventy-five schools across California will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) BMI screening and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or reporting (control). Schools randomized to Groups 1 and 2 will conduct height and weight measurements annually with their 3rd-8th grade students. Group 1 and 2 schools will also administer the five fitness assessments (mile run or PACER test, curl-ups, push-ups, trunk lift, and sit and reach) annually with their 5th-8th grade students. In the fall of Years 2 and 3, Group 1 schools will mail a report home to parents with students' results from the previous spring. All 3rd and 4th grade parents will receive a report with BMI results only. Investigators will randomize the parents of 5th-8th grade students to receive a report that provides BMI results only or one that provides BMI results with results from the five fitness assessments. Schools randomized to Group 3 will not conduct height and weight measurements with their students during Years 1 and 2. Each fall, investigators will administer a survey to 4th-8th grade students from all schools. This survey will assess weight-based teasing, feelings of stigmatization, and weight-control behaviors among students. The student survey will also ask questions about students' experiences having their heights and weights measured at school. In Years 1 and 2, investigators will mail a survey home a subsample of parents to assess parent behaviors related to their child's physical activity and nutrition, as well as parent reactions to the BMI report.</detailed_description>
