	<brief_summary>In this second phase of the multicenter study the investigators are going to evaluate the use of three different videolaryngoscopes in patients undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with intubation. The investigators are hypothesizing that these three videolaryngoscopes will succeed for intubation at first attempt in at least 90% of all cases using a difficult airway simulation with extrication collars. As the gold standard, a standard Macintosh blade is being used for comparison. The study consists of 4 arms. Each arm includes 120 patients, sums up to a total of 480 patients.</brief_summary>
