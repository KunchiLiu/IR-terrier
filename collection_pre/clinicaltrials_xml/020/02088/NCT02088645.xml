	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the use of 177Lu-PP-F11N for imaging and therapy of patients with advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). 177Lu-PP-F11N is a gastrin analogon, binding to cholecystokinin-2 receptors. This receptors show an overexpression on more than 90 % of medullary thyroid carcinomas. In the pilot (phase 0) study we will correlate the tumour detection rate with the surgery and histology (proof of concept study). Furthermore, kidney protection and dosimetry studies will be performed in order to determine the kidney protection protocol and starting activity for the dose escalation study in the following, dose escalation (phase I) study. In the phase I study we will determinate the maximum tolerated dose of 177Lu-PP-F11N in patients with MTC. Furthermore, correlation with tumour radiation dose and treatment response as well as organ radiation doses and maximal tolerated dose will be performed in order to allow prospective individual patient tailored therapy planning.</brief_summary>
