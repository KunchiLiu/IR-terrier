	<brief_title>Can Dispatcher-Activated Neighborhood Access Defibrillation and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Improve Survival of out-of Hospital Cardiac Arrest?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major health problem, occurring in about 1 in 1,500 adults in the developed countries each year. Although layperson CPR and defibrillation are crucial components of chain of survival, layperson CPR rate and it's quality is low and public-access defibrillation (PAD) program is not cost-effective.If trained bystanders can know the information of occurrence of OHCA and nearest place for automated external defibrillator (AED) at the same time by dispatch center, these neighborhoods could run and give high quality CPR and early defibrillation. If this protocol ,Dispatcher-Activated Neighborhood Access Defibrillation and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation(NAD-CPR), is introduced to community, it may improve survival of OHCA.</detailed_description>
