	<brief_summary>The hypothesis being tested is that inhibition of the enzyme known as elastase in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis will help decrease the number of bacteria. Alpha1 antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor, will be given to patients with cystic fibrosis by aerosol therapy twice in 1 day and sputum will be collected to measure the density of bacteria</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha1 Antitrypsin Aerosol Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis is usually characterized by chronic bacterial infections of the airways. Neutrophils release the enzyme elastase in the airways and this enzyme can prevent the ingestion and killing of bacteria by the airway phagocytic cells. The hypothesis being tested is that inhibition of elastase in the airways will help neutrophils decrease the number of bacteria. Each subject with cystic fibrosis will first undergo aerosol therapy with a sterile saline solution and sputum will be collected 2, 4 and 6 hours after the aerosol therapy to measure the density of bacteria. Subsequently, alpha1 antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor, will be given to the same patients by aerosol therapy twice in 1 day and sputum will be collected at 2, 4 and 6 hours after treatment to measure the density of bacteria. The results will be compared to those obtained after after aerosol therapy with saline solution. Study phase II Study type Interventional Study design Purpose - treatment Allocation - nonrandomized trial Masking - open Control - active Assignment - cross-over Endpoint - efficacy Primary Outcome Measure Bacterial density in sputum as determined by colony forming units at 2, 4 and 6 hours after Prolastin therapy.</detailed_description>
