	<brief_summary>Although thrombocytopenia has been reported as a risk factor for patent ductus arterioses, there is lack of data on the function of platelets in ductal closure. Information on functions of platelets in ductal closure may change the known model for ductus arterioses and may affect the treatment modalities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Platelet Functions on Spontaneous Ductal Closure in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patent ductus arterioses is a common problem which involves both pulmonary and cardiac outcomes in preterm infants. Although thrombocytopenia has been reported as a risk factor for patent ductus arterioses, there is lack of data on the function of platelets in ductal closure. The investigators aim to investigate the relation between thrombocytopenia and platelet functions in pathogenesis of spontaneous ductal closure. The investigators hypothesize that Information on functions of platelets in ductal closure may change the known model for ductus arterioses and may affect the treatment modalities.</detailed_description>
