	<brief_title>Survey of Women's Choice of Delivery Before Consulting With Her Obstetrician</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a survey for women who have had a previous cesarean section, also known as a c-section, with their last pregnancy. The study is looking at what factors and people may influence the decisions women make about their birthing plan after they have had a previous c-section. If they qualify, women will be asked to complete a brief survey at their initial Ob/Gyn appointment before they see their Ob doctor. In order to qualify, women must: - Be pregnant - Have not seen an obstetrician for this pregnancy - Be at least 18 years old - Be able to read English - Have had a prior pregnancy delivered by c-section - Only had one prior c-section - The c-section must have been the last pregnancy before this one Questions that will be asked include: - Demographic information (examples: age, race/ethnicity) - Pregnancy information - Delivery questions - Factors that may influence her birthing plan Participants will also be asked if the study staff can follow up after her delivery to see what kind of delivery she had (vaginal or c-section).</detailed_description>
