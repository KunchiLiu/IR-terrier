	<brief_summary>In women judged to require continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) during their labour, does the addition of decision support software to aid the interpretation of the intrapartum cardiotocogram (CTG) reduce the number of 'poor neonatal outcomes'? This study is not introducing a new form of labour monitoring; it is evaluating the addition of decision-support to CTGs displayed on the Guardian™ system. Specifically comparing: "No decision-support" - CTGs with no additional interpretation (UK standard care), compared with: "Decision-support" - CTGs with the decision support software running that will alert clinicians to the presence of abnormalities in the CTG in real time. How the labour is managed is entirely up to the recruiting unit and the woman; however the allocation of decision-support or no decision-support is determined randomly by the Guardian™ system.</brief_summary>
