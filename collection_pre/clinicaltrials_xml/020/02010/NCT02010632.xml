	<detailed_description>Platelet aggregation (ex vivo) were measured by using Whole blood impedence aggregometry (Chrono-log®) and VerifyNow® P2Y12 assay. Plasma concentration of clopidogrel carboxylic acid metabolite were measured by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</detailed_description>
