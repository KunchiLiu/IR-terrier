	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women. PCOS is characterized by increase levels of testosterone, unwanted hair growth, adiposity, irregular menstrual cycle, and infertility. PCOS is associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Women with PCOS are reported to have increased levels of stress hormones, which may be associated with decreased quality of life. Increased testosterone levels in women may decrease the risk of osteoporosis. The aim of the present study is to measure levels of stress hormones in urine and describe quality of life using questionnaires. In addition we aim to characterize body composition and bone architecture using DXA and ExtremeCT. As part of the project, a Biobank with fasting blood samples from participants is established.</brief_summary>
