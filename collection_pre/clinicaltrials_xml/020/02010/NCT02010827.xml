	<brief_title>Endogenous Glucoseproduction in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus During Oral Glucose and iv. Glucose Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not able to suppress their glucagon secretion after a meal or after ingestion of glucose. Previous studies have shown that gastrointestinal hormones might play a role in this phenomenon. However, it has not yet been possible to determine whether this lack of glucagon suppression postprandially results in an increased endogenous glucose secretion, and thus is a factor in the patients postprandial hyperglycemia. We aim to perform oral glucose tolerance tests and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusions with and without a continuous glucagon infusion in patients with T2DM and healthy control subjects. The glucagon infusion is aiming at copying the inappropriate "physiological" glucagon response observed in patients with T2DM.</detailed_description>
