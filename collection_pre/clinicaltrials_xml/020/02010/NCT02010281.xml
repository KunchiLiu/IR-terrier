	<brief_title>Analgesic Effects of rTMS in Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present multicenter parallel session randomized placebo controlled study (4 French centers) aims to evaluate the long term efficacy over 25 weeks of repeated sessions of magnetic transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex or prefrontal cortex on average pain intensity (primary outcome) and several secondary outcome measures (e.g. quality of life, sleep, neuropathic symptoms, return to work), in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. The patients will be randomized to receive one of 3 treatment arms : rTMS of the motor cortex, rTMS of the prefrontal cortex, or placebo (sham stimulation) of the motor or prefrontal cortex. The study will be double blind, eg the patient and the investigator will not know the nature of treatment. the stimulation protocol will consist of an induction phasse of 5 daily sessions then a maintenance phase of several sessions : 3 sessions a week apart, 3 sessions a fortnight apart, and 3 sessions 3 weeks apart.</detailed_description>
