	<brief_summary>This study is a single-center, open-label, 3-group, fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction study to assess the effect of coadministration of multiple-dose itraconazole or diltiazem on the single-dose PK of AZD3293 and the effects of coadministration of single- and multiple-dose AZD3293 on the single-dose PK of midazolam. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of AZD3293, alone and in combination with itraconazole, diltiazem, and midazolam in healthy young subjects.AZD3293 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease</brief_summary>
