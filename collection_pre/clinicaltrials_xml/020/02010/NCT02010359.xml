	<brief_summary>This study is a clinical trial designed to assess whether fish oil treatments are effective in the prevention of obesity-related fat tissue (adipose) inflammation. Specifically it addresses the hypothesis that fish oils treatments will reduce signaling by chemokine pathways (fractalkine and MCP-1) important in adipose tissue for the recruitment and activation of certain white blood cells (macrophages). The study is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the fish oil Lovaza from GlaxoSmithKline (omega-3-acid ethyl esters; a combination of ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) in obese non-diabetic adults, to determine if Lovaza decreases markers of inflammation and macrophage activation in adipose and blood and understand the mechanism by which fish oils affect inflammation.</brief_summary>
