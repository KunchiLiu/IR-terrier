	<brief_summary>The great saphenous vein is the most commonly used material in coronary vascular bridging operation. Coronary bypass operation to obtain the great saphenous vein is mainly through the incision open groin to ankle. This operation may damage the lymphatic, cause lymph circumfluence obstacle, cause fat liquefaction, scar formation, wound dehiscence, around hematoma and other a series of symptoms.Based on some studies and our experience that vacuum assisted closure （VAC）is effective in complex wound failures following Stripping saphenous vein, we use VAC to prevent seroma formation after Stripping saphenous vein in Coronary bypass. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and economics benefits of early VAC application on postoperative complications and wound healing after Stripping saphenous vein in Coronary bypass in comparison to conventional suction drain.</brief_summary>
