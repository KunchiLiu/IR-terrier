	<brief_summary>NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOX) have been implicated in the development of several diabetic complications including diabetic nephropathy. GKT137831 is the first in class NOX1/4 inhibitor. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral GKT137831 in patients with residual albuminuria despite maximal inhibition of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Male or female aged 18 to 80 years History of type 2 diabetes, defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) on at least 2 occasions prior to screening. Albuminuria defined as a UACR of 300 to 3500 mg/g. An eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2, as calculated by the CKDEPI formula. Must be taking an ACEI or an ARB for at least 6 weeks prior to the first screening visit (Visit 1) and during the screening period. The dose must have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the first screening visit (Visit 1). Combination therapy associating an ACEI and an ARB is not permitted. Key History of type 1 diabetes Any other nondiabetic kidney disease(s) except for hypertensive nephropathy which is acceptable. Diagnostic or interventional procedure requiring a contrast agent within 4 weeks of the first screening visit (Visit 1) or planned during the study. History of renal transplant or planned renal transplant during the study. A history of acute renal dialysis or acute kidney injury (defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] definition) within 12 weeks of the first screening visit (Visit 1) HbA1c level &gt;11% (97 mmol/mol). History of hypothyroidism requiring hormone replacement therapy. History of active cardiovascular disease A personal or family history of long QT syndrome. Administration of any investigational product within 30 days or within 5 halflives of the investigational agent</criteria>
