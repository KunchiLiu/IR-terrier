	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe the behavior of kinematic variables in children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy (SHCP), immediately after treadmill gait training with ankle loading. The children underwent a single treadmill training session with ankle loading. The kinematic parameters were assessed in three phases: before training (PRE); immediately after training (POST); and 5 minutes after the end of training (FOLLOW UP). The investigators hypothesized that the treadmill gait training with additional lower limb loading would be a disturbance capable of modifying the locomotor strategy of children with SHCP, by the increase in kinematic parameters in the swing phase of gait.</brief_summary>
