	<criteria>patients with Philadelphianegative BPrecursor Acute Lyphmoblastic Leukemia in complete hematological remission defined as less than 5% blasts in bone marrow after at least 3 intensive chemotherapy blocks (i.e. any standard or investigational regimen according to adult protocols as long as 3 age appropriate chemotherapy blocks were given, this also includes relapse treatment detection of minimal residual disease (molecular failure or molecular relapse) at a level of greater than or equal to 10*(4) by PCR or greater than or equal to 10*(3) by flow cytometry at a reference lab Age 15 or greater at time of initial diagnosis with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For patients aged 1517 treatment according to adult protocols is required Initial diagnosis in the year 2000 or later History of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment (including response to first therapy, number of prior relapses) is available Relapse status and disease follow up after timepoint of minimal residual disease detection is available Patients with extramedullary disease at timepoint of minimal residual disease detection Use of Blinatumomab within 18 months of minimal residual disease detection Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation prior to minimal residual disease detection at the required level</criteria>
