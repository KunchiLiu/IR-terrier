	<brief_summary>This study is a two part study: Phase I and Phase II. The Phase 1 portion is an open-label, safety study. Patients will have previously received 3-6 instillations of weekly intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) induction therapy (as standard of care) followed by low dose intradermal (1*10^6 cells) HS-410 monotherapy. In Phase 2, patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on whether they will receive induction BCG in the typical post-TURBT window. If the investigator plans to administer BCG, patients will be randomized to one of three blinded (physician-patient), placebo-controlled groups and receive either intradermal placebo or low dose (1*10^6 cells) or high dose (1*10^7 cells) vesigenurtacel-L in combination with induction and maintenance intravesical BCG. If patients will not receive BCG, they will be enrolled into an open-label, non-randomized group and receive high dose (1*10^7 cells) intradermal HS-410 monotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer [Ta, T1 or Tis (CIS)] that has been removed by transurethral resection Either: (i) highrisk disease, defined as T1 and/or highgrade and/or CIS or (ii) intermediaterisk disease, defined as Ta lowgrade with at least 3 of the following 4 risk factors: multiple tumors, tumor size &gt; 3cm, early recurrence (&lt;1 year from previous staging procedure), or recurrence with a frequency of more than once in any 12 month period Not have received bacillus CalmetteGuérin (BCG) or have completed previous BCG treatment &gt; 12 months prior to the baseline staging procedure. Phase 2 Arms 13: Suitable to receive a 6week course of BCG in the adjuvant setting within 6 weeks following TURBT. Phase 2 Arm 4: Suitable for monotherapy vaccine administration postTURBT. For Phase 1 only: Has previously received 36 weekly doses of BCG. Adequate laboratory parameters Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or immunodeficiency disorders, either primary or acquired Infections or intercurrent illness requiring active therapy Any condition requiring active steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy Active malignancies within the past 12 months except negligible risk of metastasis or death treated with expected curative outcome. Prostate pelvic radiation within the past 12 months Significant cardiac impairment Current alcohol or chemical abuse, or mental or psychiatric condition precluding protocol compliance Pregnant or nursing Allergy to soy, egg, or peanut products Receiving another investigational agent (30 day washout required prior to first dose) Neoadjuvant therapy prior to baseline staging procedures for the current occurrence of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer Prior treatment with a cancer vaccine for this indication Prior vaccination with BCG for tuberculosis disease Prior splenectomy</criteria>
