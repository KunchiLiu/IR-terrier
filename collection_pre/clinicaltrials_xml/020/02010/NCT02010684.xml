	<brief_summary>In this project, investigators examine the impact of a mood treatment enhanced diabetes self-care intervention for depressed, low-income Latino diabetics. The investigators hypothesize that the mood treatment enhancement will lead to significant improvement in both diabetes and depression outcomes as compared with the self-care intervention alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mood and Diabetes Empowerment &amp; Improvement Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase I pilot recruited older Latinos from Dr. Mangione's previous study (who agreed to participate in future research) and 10 participants from a community settings. Those with low mood and poor glycemic control were offered a 12-week intervention combining cognitive behavioral therapy mood management techniques and diabetes self-care into one seamless intervention. Drs. Mangione and Miranda supervised and reviewed (through audiotapes) well-trained health educators conducting the intervention sessions. The study manuals were modified following this Phase I pilot intervention. The final intervention manual was tested in a randomized trial in Phase II, compared the Mood and Diabetes Empowerment and Improvement Training intervention with enhanced care as usual (providing participants with a letter regarding their mood and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c with recommendations for improving care for their provider). The target population was low-income Latinos with depression and poor glycemic control. Both mood and diabetes outcomes are evaluated.</detailed_description>
