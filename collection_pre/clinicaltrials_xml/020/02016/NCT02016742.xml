	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study of the Pharmacokinetics of RDC5 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomised, single dose, 3-way crossover study to characterise and compare the PK, safety and tolerability of RDC5 in 15 healthy male volunteers. Eligible subjects will undergo 3 Treatment Periods, each separated by a washout period at least 14 days. Subjects will receive a single dose of RDC5 during each of the three Treatment Periods in line with their randomized treatment sequence. A total of 4 dose levels will be evaluated within the study, though each subject will only receive 3 doses. A Data Review Team (DRT) will review the pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Treatment Periods 1 and 2 and select the doses to be evaluated in Treatment Periods 2 and 3. Subjects will return for a follow visit 21 days after the last dose of RDC5.</detailed_description>
