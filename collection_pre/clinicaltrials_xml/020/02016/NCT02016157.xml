	<brief_title>Moxifloxacin in Situ Gel to Treat Periodontal Pocket.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against a wide range of putative periodontal pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces species, Peptostreptococcus species, Campylobacter rectus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Moxifloxacin penetrates well into soft tissues and is effective against intracellular periodontal pathogens when used in the treatment of periodontitis as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP). Systemic administration of moxifloxacin has provided superior outcomes compared with SRP in conjunction with systemic administration of doxycycline, or SRP alone. We hypothesized similar benefits with local drug delivery of Moxifloxacin in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published literature on in situ gel using moxifloxacin employing gellan gum as the vehicle, for direct placement in the periodontal pocket for the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Among various drug delivery systems for treating periodontitis, gel formulations have some advantages. Despite a relatively faster release of the drug, gels can be more easily prepared and administered. Moreover, they possess a higher bio compatibility and bio adhesivity, by allowing adhesion to the mucosa in the dental pocket and by decreasing the risk of dilution of the material by saliva. Keeping the above facts in mind, the goals of this study were to (1) evaluate in situ gel as a vehicle in a local drug delivery system, (2) evaluate the efficacy of moxifloxacin for local drug delivery, (3) evaluate the efficacy of gellan gum for in situ gelation of moxifloxacin, and (4) evaluate and compare the clinical and microbiological parameters of moxifloxacin with those of the gold standard, chlorhexidine di gluconate.</detailed_description>
