	<brief_summary>This study is a clinical study aiming at establishing immunological assays for the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of WT-1, Survivin and HPV16 E7-specific immune responses in cancer patients. Such a study will allow the development of suitable immunological tools to be used in assessing response in a subsequent phase I study aiming at evaluating therapeutic vaccine candidates targeting WT-1, Survivin and/or HPV16 E7-expressing tumors. In addition, this study will help defining the baseline cancer-associated immune responses in the selected patient population. Cervical and ovarian cancer patients, as well as leukemia patients, will be included in this study. WT-1, Survivin and HPV-specific immune responses will be monitored in these patients by ex vivo and cultured IFNg ELISpot as well as tetramer staining.</brief_summary>
