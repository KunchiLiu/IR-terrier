	<brief_summary>This post marketing observational study (PMOS) was conducted in Japan during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) seasons to assess the safety and effectiveness of palivizumab for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV in participants 24 months of age and under, who have an immunocompromised medical condition (e.g., combined immunodeficiency disease, antibody deficiency, or other types of immunodeficiency; HIV infection; recovering from organ or bone marrow transplantation; on chemotherapy; on high-dose corticosteroid therapy; on immunosuppressants) or who have Down syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Synagis® Liquid 50mg, 100mg for Intramuscular Injection Special Investigation in Immunocompromised Children With Synagis®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palivizumab was prescribed according to the local label and independently of the decision to enroll participants in the study. Palivizumab was administered monthly throughout the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection seasons via intramuscular injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight. Survey forms were collected after the observation period. The number of adverse events and the frequency of hospitalizations due to RSV infections in surveyed participants were assessed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of palivizumab.</detailed_description>
