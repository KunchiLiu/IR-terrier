	<brief_summary>To evaluate the rate of patients without cancer detected by biopsies performed six months after hemi-ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) (Ablatherm ®). Evaluate the impact of the HIFU treatment on continence, sexuality and quality of life at one year. Evaluate the cost of hemi-ablation HIFU treatment. A prospective single -centre phase II, single arm, cohort study (therapeutic confirmatory) offering focal therapy using HIFU (Ablatherm ®) to 25 men with histologically proven localised low to intermediate risk prostate cancer (PSA ≤10ng/ml, Gleason score ≤ 7 ,T1c or T2b ). Precise mapping and characterisation of the disease will be established using multi-parametric (mp)-MRI and prostate biopsies. Only the lobe with disease will be treated.</brief_summary>
