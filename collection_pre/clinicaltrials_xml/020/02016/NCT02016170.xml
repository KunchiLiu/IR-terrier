	<brief_summary>Recently, two new oral P2Y12 antagonists have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel, a third generation thienopyridine, and ticagrelor, a first in class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP). These agents have been shown to be associated with more potent platelet inhibitory effects compared with clopidogrel. In addition, both agents have shown to be superior to clopidogrel in preventing recurrent ischemic events in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Understanding how to switch patients from prasugrel to ticagrelor is an unmet need of clinical interest. The proposed PD investigation will have a prospective, randomized, parallel design aimed to show that switching patients from prasugrel to ticagrelor provides similar levels of platelet inhibition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist is the cornerstone of treatment for secondary prevention of thrombotic events in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, two new oral P2Y12 antagonists have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel, a third generation thienopyridine, and ticagrelor, a first in class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP). These agents have been shown to be associated with more potent platelet inhibitory effects compared with clopidogrel. In addition, both agents have shown to be superior to clopidogrel in preventing recurrent ischemic events in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Therefore, current guidelines recommend prasugrel or ticagrelor (as first line therapy according to European Society of Cardiology) in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Despite the broader indication for ticagrelor (also medically managed ACS) and its mortality benefit, prasugrel has a higher uptake than ticagrelor in the US market, likely due to its earlier approval. Further, implementation of prasugrel into institutional protocols, particularly for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary PCI, may also be a reason for the slow uptake of ticagrelor. However, many clinicians would indeed consider ticagrelor as the long-term treatment of choice for a variety of reasons. Therefore, understanding how to switch patients from prasugrel to ticagrelor is an unmet need of clinical interest. However, currently, there are no data on the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of switching from prasugrel to ticagrelor. The proposed PD investigation will have a prospective, randomized, parallel design aimed to show that switching patients from prasugrel to ticagrelor provides similar levels of platelet inhibition. This study will provide insights on the PD effects of switching and will help clinicians to choose the most appropriate schema to avoid complications related to inadequate antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease if switching from prasugrel to ticagrelor is desired.</detailed_description>
