	<brief_summary>In the primary progressive multiple sclerosis, the detection of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid is critical for the diagnosis. However, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid collection is considered relatively invasive. Our hypothesis is that oligoclonal bands detection in tears is possible and useful for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the present study is to assess concordance between oligoclonal bands detection in tears and in cerebrospinal fluid. We will include patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and we will compare results of oligoclonal bands detection by isoelectric focusing in cerebrospinal fluid and tears. Tears will be collected using a Schirmer strip. This would circumvent the practice of invasive lumbar punctures currently used in multiple sclerosis diagnosis.</detailed_description>
