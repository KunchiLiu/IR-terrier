	<brief_summary>There are approximately one million Americans who live with Parkinson's disease with 50,000 new cases per year and this rate is expected to rise with an aging population. The underlying pathophysiology and disease understanding of PD still remains elusive due to a combination of disease complexity and lack of predictive capability of existing models. The Berg Interrogative Biology™ discovery platform has demonstrated a unique capability in producing drug targets and biomarkers that truly represent a disease phenotype. It has been able to catalyze molecules now in late stage clinical trials in cancer and many pre-clinical candidate therapeutics and biomarkers in endocrinology and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The platform is able to decipher normal versus disease signatures by integration of data sets from the genome, metabolome, proteome, and lipidome in an agnostic manner that is subjected to Bayesian Artificial Intelligence informatics. The resulting nodes are then put back into wet-lab validation before proceeding to proof-of-principle pre-clinical testing. By utilizing clinical data and specimens obtained by the medical specialists at The Parkinson's Institute, along with Berg's Interrogative Biology™, this study aims to discover a disease biomarker enabling the creation of a diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
