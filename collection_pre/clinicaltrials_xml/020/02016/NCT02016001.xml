	<brief_title>Effective Fluoride Concentration In Toothpaste For Dental Caries Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In developed countries, well-controlled clinical trials have investigated the effective fluoride level in toothpaste and provided irresistible data in relation to the caries controlling efficacy of tooth pastes. But there has been no such data reported in our part of the world. This indicates the need to determine the effective concentration of fluoride in locally manufactured tooth pastes for accomplishment of the goal of prevention against dental caries. This will be a Parallel Group, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial, over a period of 18 months. The study will be conducted in a randomly selected school of Karachi city. Participants will be the cohort of regular school children aged 12-14 years. Sample size for the present study attained was 330 (165 in both groups), expected attrition rate will be kept as 15%, so the total sample size is 330 + 50 = 380 (190 in each group).</detailed_description>
