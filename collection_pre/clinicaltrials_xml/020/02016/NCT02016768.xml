	<brief_summary>There is a relationship between CSM and hypertension, probably a cause/effect relationship, and investigators term this type of hypertension "cervicogenic hypertension". Abnormally functioning serotonergic pacemaker cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus inappropriately activate and inhibit parts of the central and autonomic nervous systems as part of a chronic stress response, which causes hypertension and migraine. This theory is now being expanded to encompass both CSM and essential hypertension, the idea being that these two conditions are intimately related.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and hypertension are both very common diseases in the general population.Investigators have also observed previously hypertensive patients with CSM become normotensive following decompressive cervical surgery and no longer need antihypertensive medications. Both observations are difficult to explain according to current theories of the two diseases.</detailed_description>
