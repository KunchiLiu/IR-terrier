	<brief_summary>Glucocorticoids therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk for diabetes morbidity. However, there is no proven preventive therapy. GLP-1-RA has shown to improve glucose metabolism in healthy volunteers treated with glucocorticoids. We assume that GLP-1-RA will improve glucose metabolism in patients with high risk for diabetes morbidity, treated with glucocorticoids.</brief_summary>
