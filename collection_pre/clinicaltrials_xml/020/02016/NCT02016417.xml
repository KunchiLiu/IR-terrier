	<brief_summary>The present study is a randomized, control, phase II study of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with Gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen (GP) or Docetaxel，cisplatin regimen plus 5-Fluorouracil (TPF) induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy With GP Versus TPF in the Treatment of Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) prevalence is reported to be highest in southern China, where an average of 80 cases per 100,000 population are reported each year. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is both radiosensitive and chemosensitive. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 1, 2013), have recommended use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by CCRT plus AC as standard treatment for NPC. However, it was unclear whether patients with NPC could benefit from IC. Recently, many new drugs including docetaxel and gemcitabine have been incorporated in the induction chemotherapy phase of NPC. The investigators designed the present study with induction chemotherapy follow by CCRT for locoregionally advanced NPC, comparing induction chemotherapy regime of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) and docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with newly histologically confirmed nonkeratinizing (according to WHO histologically type). 2. 18 years to 70 years; 3. Tumor staged as T34N1/N23M0 (according to the 7th AJCC edition), 4. Performance status: Karnofsky scale (KPS) &gt; 70 (Appendix I ). 5. Adequate marrow: leucocyte count &gt; 4×109/L, neutrophil count &gt; 2×109/L, hemoglobin &gt; 90g/L and platelet count &gt; 100×109/L. 6. Normal liver function test: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) concomitant with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt; 2.5×ULN, and bilirubin &lt; ULN. 7. Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min. 8. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give written informed consent. 1. WHO Type keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma or basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. 2. Age &gt; 70 or &lt; 18. 3. Treatment with palliative intent. 4. Prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer. 5. Pregnancy or lactation (consider pregnancy test in women of childbearing age and emphasize effective contraception during the treatment period). 6. History of previous RT (except for nonmelanomatous skin cancers outside intended RT treatment volume). 7. Prior chemotherapy or surgery (except diagnostic) to primary tumor or nodes. 8. Any severe intercurrent disease, which may bring unacceptable risk or affect the compliance of the trial, for example, unstable cardiac disease requiring treatment, renal disease, chronic hepatitis, diabetes with poor control (fasting plasma glucose &gt; 1.5×ULN), and emotional disturbance.</criteria>
