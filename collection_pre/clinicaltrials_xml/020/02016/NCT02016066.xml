	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity of CR6261 in Japanese Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo comparator is compared with the study medication to evaluate safety profile of the study medication in clinical study), single-dose study in Japanese healthy adult male participants. The study will include screening phase (28 to 2 days prior to the study medication administration), treatment phase (Study medication will be administered on Day 1), and follow-up phase (up to 76 days). Twelve participants will be randomly assigned to CR6261 50 mg/kg or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio and receive an assigned treatment on Day 1. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead Electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. Total maximum duration of participation of an individual participant will be 104 days.</detailed_description>
