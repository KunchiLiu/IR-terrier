	<brief_title>Safety Study of Use of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cell in Treatment of Age Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label investigation of the safety and preliminary efficacy of unilateral intravitreal injection of autologous bone marrow stem cells in subjects with Geographic Atrophy secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Subjects will be enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated at regular post transplant intervals. Human central nervous system -stem cells will be transplanted by a vitreoretinal surgeon. The transplantation will be conducted in the eye with the inferior best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (i.e., the Study Eye). Only the Study Eye will undergo transplantation. The adult bone marrow stem cells will be administered into the vitreous cavity through a standard surgical approach. Moxifloxacin 300 mg(once per day ) will be administered orally to all subjects for a period of five days ( 2 days pre and post operatively) . Subjects will be monitored frequently for a total of one year after adult bone marrow stem cells cell injection .</detailed_description>
