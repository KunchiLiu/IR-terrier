	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre Phase 2 study. The study will evaluate the activity and safety of AMG 337 in patients who have MET amplified gastric, gastroesophageal junction or esophageal adenocarcinoma or other MET amplified solid tumors. The study is designed to estimate the objective response rate of AMG 337 by tumor type.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of AMG 337 in MET Amplified Gastric/Esophageal Adenocarcinoma or Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, multicenter, single arm, 2 cohort study to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 in MET amplified Gastric/esophageal adenocarcinoma or other solid tumors. Approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort 1 (subjects with MET amplified G/E adenocarcinoma with measurable tumor) or Cohort 2 (subjects with MET amplified solid tumors with measurable tumor/up to 10 subjects with MET amplified G/E adenocarcinoma with non-measurable tumor/up to 10 subjects who have received prior MET antibody therapy). All subjects will self-administer AMG 337 300 mg daily until disease progression or other protocol specified end of treatment criteria is met. Tumor tissue, biomarkers, Pharmacokinetics and Patient reported Outcomes will all be assessed. Tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1 will be followed during study treatment.</detailed_description>

Pathologically confirmed advanced G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma (Cohort 1) or other solid tumor (Cohort 2) for which subject has received prior therapy for advanced disease, for which no standard therapy exists, or subject refuses standard therapy Tumor MET amplified by protocolspecified centralized testing. Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Cohort 2 may include up to 10 subjects with advanced MET amplified, G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma with nonmeasurable tumor per RECIST v1.1 (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2 Known central nervous system metastases Candidate for curative surgery or definitive chemoradiation Peripheral edema &gt; grade 1 Persistent gastric outlet obstruction, complete dysphagia or are dependent upon jejunostomy for feeding. Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s) that in the opinion of the Investigator may influence drug absorption Acute Hepatitis B. Chronic Hepatitis B eligible if condition is stable and, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would not pose a risk to subject safety Detectable Hepatitis C virus (indicative of active Hepatitis C) Currently receiving any antitumor treatments, or less than 14 days prior to enrollment since ending antitumor treatment Prior treatment with small molecule inhibitors of the MET pathway.
