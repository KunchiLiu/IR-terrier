	<brief_summary>This research programme purports to test the effectiveness of two Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) protocols (Repetitive high frequency protocol and Theta Burst protocol) in reducing the symptoms of depression. The study also uses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to improve the localization of TMS targets.</brief_summary>
