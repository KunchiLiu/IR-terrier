	<brief_title>A Dose-Ranging Study of the Effect of DRM04B in Subjects With Axillary Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, vehicle controlled, dose-ranging study enrolling subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis and designed to assess the safety and efficacy of four doses of DRM04B compared to vehicle. There are 5 arms in this study. Efficacy will be assessed through the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a gravimetric assessment of sweat production. Safety will be assessed, at specified times during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, ECGs, physical examination and vital signs. PK samples will be taken from 20 to 30 subjects participating in the study.</detailed_description>
