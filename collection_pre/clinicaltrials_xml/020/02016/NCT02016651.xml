	<brief_summary>Gastro-esophageal reflux and aspiration is a common problem in premature infants receiving mechanical ventilation. Pepsin measured in tracheal aspirate (TA) emerged as a specific marker for aspiration. The objective of this study is to examine if TA pepsin will change when ventilated premature infants are positioned in two different positions; on their back vs. on their right side.</brief_summary>
