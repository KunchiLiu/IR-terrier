	<brief_summary>Statins are cholesterol lowering medications that reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However adherence to these medications has been found to be lower among minorities, a group particularly vulnerable for heart disease. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a phone based behavioral intervention to mailed educational materials regarding how to control cholesterol and other risk factors. We hypothesized that the behavioral intervention will improve adherence to statins by 15%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Adherence to Statins Among Minority Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affects members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups.Further in spite of a reduction in rates of cardiovascular events,the gap between certain minority groups and non-minority groups has not diminished. Cholesterol lowering medications are a medically proven intervention that dramatically reduces the risk of primary and secondary cardiovascular outcomes.However, the literature shows that at one year only half of the patients prescribed this medication continue to take a statin. One well known risk factor shown to be a predictor for non adherence is belonging to a racial/ ethnic minority group. The focus of the proposed study is to examine a non-traditional care-management approach delivered by a large commercial health benefit carrier in the prevention of cardiovascular disease among minority populations who have cardiovascular risk factors and who have been started in cholesterol lowering therapy. In particular, we seek to determine if a culturally tailored phone based intervention (Motivational Interviewing) delivered to Latino and African American enrollees living in predominantly minority neighborhoods in Florida, is effective at improving adherence to Statins. Specific Aims 1. To prospectively identify 1200 Latino or African American residing in Florida who have received a new prescription for statin therapy, evaluate their adherence to the statin and determine if the reasons for non-adherence are similar or different from other studies of adherence to cardiovascular medications. 2. Conduct a randomized control trial to compare the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing telephonic intervention to usual care on the primary outcome of statin adherence among minority subjects living in Florida. In addition, among the tobacco users at baseline we will evaluate the impact of our phone based MINT intervention on tobacco cessation in this minority populations. Update: The sponsor and the IRB approved a reduction in the target number of participants to 800. The reason was that we experienced a recruitment delay to ensure HIPAA compliant procedures between the University and the Health Benefits company when the Humana research group moved out of the University campus. Data that became available from another study showed 800 subjects will yield enough power for the analyses planned originally.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult patients over age 35 years 2. Recent new prescription for a Statin (GPI code 39.40.xx ) which will be the index prescription. We will define new as no GPI code present for any statin over a 6 month period before the index prescription. 3. Self report of being Latino or AA.
