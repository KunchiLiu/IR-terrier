	<brief_summary>Intervention for coronary bifurcation lesion is about 10~20% of entire percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Bifurcation lesion is difficult to be treated and prognosis of PCI at bifurcation lesion has been poorer compared to that at non-bifurcation lesion. Furthermore, occlusion of side branch frequently occurred during PCI. Several techniques to prevent occlusion of side branch have been developed, but outcomes are not to be satisfied. H-side branch stent is developed to treat coronary side branch lesion and composed of proximal, connecting and distal parts. In vivo study performed in pigs showed effective H-side branch stent. This study is to confirm safety and efficacy of H-side branch stent for treatment of coronary side branch lesion.</brief_summary>
