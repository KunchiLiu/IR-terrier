	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that an intervention of lifestyle modification will positively impact women with breast cancer who are overweight and/or obese. To that end, our primary endpoint is to examine the effects of a practical lifestyle intervention that can be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to 25) with early stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI over the course of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Lifestyle Intervention in Overweight or Obese Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Primary endpoint: To examine the effects of a practical lifestyle intervention that can be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to 25) with early stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI over the course of the study. - Secondary endpoint: To assess the impact of such intervention on lipid profiles and hemoglobin A1C. The study group will be compared with a historical control group of patients with early stage breast cancer who are obese or overweight who were not given the intervention - Secondary endpoint: To examine whether an active intervention program will lead into longstanding lifestyle modification in breast cancer patients with a BMI greater or equal to 25.</detailed_description>
