	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that ticagrelor may enhance endothelial healing after DES implantation by increasing adenosine concentrations by the inhibition of adenosine uptake into erythrocytes, compared to clopidogrel. Thus, the investigators will evaluate the extent of endothelialization (stent strut coverage) and neointimal hyperplasia (neointimal thickness) 3 months after DES implantation by optical coherence tomography (OCT)</brief_summary>
