	<brief_summary>pain control in pediatric renal transplant is a major concern. the main goal during anesthesia of renal transplant in pediatrics is to maintain hemodynamics in a range close to that of the adult donor. epidural analgesia is thought to be very effective in pain control. this study emphasises the ease of application of epidural catheter via the caudal route to the lower thoracic level; avoiding possible complications that may arise from lumbar or thoracic routes, and its effects on hemodynamics when using analgesic doses of local anesthetics and narcotics.</brief_summary>
