	<brief_summary>The objective of the GELATIN registry is to prospectively evaluate intracranial aneurysm occlusion and retreatment rates as well as adverse event rates in patients undergoing balloon-assisted coiling using the MicroVention Scepter Occlusion Balloon Catheter and second-generation MicroVention hydrogel coils for treatment of previously treated or untreated ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydrogel Balloon Assisted Intracranial Aneurysm Coiling Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single arm, single center study of patients with ruptured or unruptured saccular aneurysms that are embolized using MicroVention second-generation hydrogel coils and undergo balloon remodeling with the MicroVention Scepter Occlusion Balloon Catheter. Data for each patient will be collected 6 ± 3 months post-procedure for the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is 1880 years of age. Patient has a documented, previously treated or untreated saccular intracranial aneurysm, 4 20 mm unruptured or ruptured, suitable for treatment with balloon assisted coil embolization. Target aneurysm has a neck ≥4mm or the largest diameter to neck ratio of 2 or less. Patient has a Hunt and Hess Score of 3 or less. Patient has a premorbid mRS of 3 or less. Patient or patient's legally authorized representative has provided written informed consent. Patient is willing to and can comply with study followup requirements. Inability to obtain informed consent. Patient is &lt;18 or &gt;80 years of age. Target aneurysm is dissecting, fusiform, mycotic, or arteriovenous malformationrelated. Aneurysm that was treated previously with stentassisted coiling. Implantation of the stent after the balloonassisted coiling or combined stent and balloon assisted coiling. Target aneurysm is deemed unsuitable for balloonassisted coiling by the treating physician prior to the procedure. Target aneurysm will be treated with a total coil length comprised of less than 80% second generation MicroVention Hydrogel Coils. Balloonassisted coiling will be performed using a balloon catheter other than the MicroVention Scepter balloon (Scepter C, Scepter XC, any future Scepter configurations). Patients in which the target aneurysm is planned not to be coiled in one procedure (i.e. staged procedure). Patients with more than one aneurysm that requires treatment. (However, a second small low risk aneurysm that does not require therapy may be allowed.) Patients with a life expectancy of ≤ 9 months.</criteria>
