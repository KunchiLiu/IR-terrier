	<brief_summary>We hypothesise that the use of the LMA-Supreme provides greater ease of insertion and reduced haemodynamic variability during insertion compared to the tracheal tube, whilst still maintaining a patent airway to facilitate elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in selected patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme Versus the Tracheal Tube as an Airway Device in Elective Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme(LMA-S) has been used successfully to maintain a patent airway for laparoscopic surgery. Our study compares the use of LMA-S with that of the tracheal tube (ETT) with respect to the ease of insertion and potential haemodynamic disturbance during insertion.</detailed_description>
