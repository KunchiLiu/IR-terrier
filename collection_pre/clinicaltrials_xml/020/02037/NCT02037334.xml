	<brief_summary>Quantitative information on the biomechanical properties of the ecto-cervix in mid-pregnancy will be compared between women with term vs. preterm delivery. We aim to demonstrate that biomechanical data (ASP and CCI) might complement morphological data (CL) to improve prediction of preterm delivery. It is expected that women with preterm delivery will show stronger weakening of cervical tissue. Aspiration (ASP) and cervical CCI (cervical consistency index) measurements are performed at mid-pregnancy: detection at this time point is useful for therapy and biomechanical modifications are already significant so to enable differentiation by biomechanical measurements (ASP and CCI).</brief_summary>
