	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of human-derived antithrombin III (AT-III [Human]) supplementation prior to high-risk, non-emergency, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A total of 404 adult subjects undergoing CPB who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive either AT-III (Human) or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject needs nonemergency cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Types of cardiac operations permitted: 1. Complex/combined procedures (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] plus valve), double/triple valve repair/replacements, ascending aorta/aortic arch surgeries (without baseline AT level restriction or preoperative heparin requirement). OR 2. Isolated CABG or single valve repair/replacements are allowed only if either (a) AT level is less than 80% OR (b) preoperative heparin is received (unfractionated heparin [UFH] for at least 12 hours; low molecularweight heparin [LMWH] for more than 5 days). Subject needs emergency surgery. Subject needs heart transplantation. Use of minimally invasive surgery. Previous cardiac operation. Infective endocarditis. Thromboembolic events, stroke, or STelevated myocardial infarction within 7 days of surgery. Cardiogenic shock at the time of surgery. Renal dysfunction: Creatinine levels &gt;2 mg/dL or chronic dialysis. Liver dysfunction: aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase increase ≥2fold above the upperlimit of local lab normal ranges. Treatment with Clopidogrel and Ticagrelor within 5 days before surgery, Prasugrel within 7 days before surgery, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers within 24 hours of surgery. Treatment with new oral anticoagulants (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Dabigatran) within 48 hours before surgery. Vitamin K antagonist therapy and an international normalized ratio &gt;1.3 on the day of surgery. Platelet count &lt;120,000/μL. History or suspicion of a congenital or acquired coagulation disorder. History of anaphylactic reaction(s) to blood or blood components. Allergies to excipients in the study drug. Refusal to receive allogenic transfusion of bloodderived products. Received AT treatment within the last 3 months prior to Screening visit.</criteria>
