	<brief_summary>SDB has been identified as an important risk factor for insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. In a recent study in patients with SDB and T2DM it was shown that CPAP therapy can lead to improvements in postprandial glucose levels and in glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c). In children, there are only 3 studies that have examined the relations between SDB, obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In order to further understand the relative contribution of SDB to the development of impaired glucose homeostasis and metabolic abnormalities we aim to investigate the prevalence and severity of SDB in children with T2DM compared to obese children without T2DM. The investigators hypothesize that SDB will be more prevalent and more severe among obese children with T2DM compared with the general obese pediatric population.</brief_summary>
