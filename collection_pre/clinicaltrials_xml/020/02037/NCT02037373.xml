	<brief_summary>Post-Marketing Requirement study to evaluate the safety of octaplas™ versus plasma in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The primary objective is to assess the incidence of hyperfibrinolysis in patients undergoing (OLT) receiving octaplas™ versus regular plasma (e.g., fresh frozen plasma and other FDA and AABB approved plasma products).</brief_summary>
