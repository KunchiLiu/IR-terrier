	<brief_title>Dermabond Treatment for Gastric Variceal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical outcomes research is one of the strengths of the EUS group. As a group, the physicians need a tracking system for specific treatment modalities, and data to determine the impact of endoscopic ultrasound for patients with gastric variceal bleeding. Gastric variceal bleeding is a severe complication of portal hypertension with significant morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. Currently, there is no database in existence for endoscopic ultrasound clinical research for specific procedures. Also, there is limited data regarding the outcome of endoscopic sclerotherapy with cyanoacrylate in the United States.</detailed_description>
