	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate Xpert Mycobacterium Tuberculosis/Rifampicin (MTB/RIF) as the first-line Tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic test in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected adults and paediatric patients in peri-urban settings and determine its impact on accurate case detection and treatment initiation in these settings. In addition, the Determine TB-Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Ag速 will be used to model added diagnostic value when used alone or in combination with Xpert MTB/RIF, within the TB diagnostic algorithm for HIV infected patients in Zambia. A quasi-experimental "before-after" study design will be used at two similar peri-urban district hospitals. Each site will initially implement the Standard of Care (SOC) phase, in which a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adult and paediatric TB suspects will be screened for TB according to the current standard of care in Zambian HIV care clinics. This will be followed by a 4-week "intervention wash-out" period to allow completion of the diagnostic work-up of all patients recruited during the last month of the SOC phase. The second phase (Xpert MTB/RIF phase) will start immediately following the "intervention wash-out" period. In this phase, a second cohort of HIV-infected adult and paediatric TB suspects will be screened for TB using the Xpert MTB/RIF algorithm. Each phase will last approximately 6 months, or until the target sample size for adults is reached. Mycobacterial culture will be performed during the study to confirm TB diagnosis and determine whether appropriate treatment was given. "Appropriate treatment" means the patient was initiated on ATT within 4 weeks of screening initiation for culture-positive patients or a correct diagnosis of not having TB in culture-negative patients. Culture results will be released from the CIDRZ Lab for patient care as soon as results are available. During both study phases participants will be asked to submit a urine sample for testing with the Determine TB-LAM Ag速 assay. Urine specimens will be collected at the study site and all procedures will be carried out at the CIDRZ Central Laboratory in Lusaka using standard laboratory protocols and quality assurance procedures. Since Determine TB-LAM Ag速 has not yet been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) nor approved by the Zambian Ministry of Health for TB diagnosis, results from the Determine TB-LAM Ag速 assay will not be used for patient care.</detailed_description>
