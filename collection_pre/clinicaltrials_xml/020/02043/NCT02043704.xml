	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of perioperative intravenous (IV) acetaminophen on postoperative narcotic consumption and pain scores in subjects undergoing vaginal reconstructive surgery. One hundred subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either IV acetaminophen or IV placebo. Those in the IV acetaminophen group will receive 1000mg IV every 6 hours for 24 hours beginning prior to anesthesia induction. The control group will receive placebo saline infusions at the same time intervals. All subjects will receive as needed (prn) IV narcotic for additional pain relief. Visual analog scales (VAS) regarding pain will be evaluated at 18 and 24 hours postoperative and immediately prior to discharge. We will also collect total IV narcotic consumption. We hypothesize that subjects receiving IV acetaminophen will have lower VAS scores and decreased total narcotic consumption in comparison to the control group.</brief_summary>
