	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer is the fourth cause of cancer mortality: there are different treatment approaches to locally advanced pancreatic cancer management. Generally, gemcitabine alone is considered a reasonable approach for advanced pancreatic cancer patients but we need a chemotherapeutic regimen able to prevent as much as possible a progression of the disease. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) recently demonstrated an interesting activity profile in advanced pancreatic cancer. A combination of Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine has been demonstrated superior to gemcitabine alone in metastatic patients.</brief_summary>
