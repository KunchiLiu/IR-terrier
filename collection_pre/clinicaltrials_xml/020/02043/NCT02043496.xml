	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test a newly developed individual psychotherapy treatment for binge eating disorder in adults. This treatment is a type of individual psychotherapy called Integrative Cognitive-Affective Therapy (ICAT) that focuses on helping people change their behaviors, feelings, thoughts about themselves, and relationships. This new treatment is being compared to an existing treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy-Guided Self Help (CBTgsh), which focuses on changing behavior patterns through the use of reading and homework assignments along with sessions with a therapist. The primary hypothesis of this investigation is that ICAT will be associated with greater reductions in binge eating at end of treatment and follow-up compared to CBTgsh.</brief_summary>
