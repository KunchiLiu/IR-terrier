	<brief_summary>The objective of this protocol is to improve survival for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic lymphoma by reducing systemic and central nervous system (CNS) relapse with acceptable toxicity using intensive chemotherapy with liposomal cytarabine (Depocyt®) CNS prophylaxis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Liposomal Cytarabine CNS Prophylaxis for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia &amp; Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This treatment regimen builds on the "Linker" regimen/UCSF Protocol 8707 ALL regimen backbone with the goal of improved efficacy and acceptable toxicity by substituting pegylated asparaginase for native L-asparaginase, the addition of rituximab for pre-B-cell ALL, and the addition of dasatinib for Philadelphia chromosome/BCR-ABL positive ALL, and the addition of cyclophosphamide for younger adults. In addition, the study regimen aims to reduce CNS relapse through the use of intrathecal liposomal cytarabine in place of intrathecal methotrexate for CNS relapse prophylaxis and The regimen uses 3 modules of therapy with non-cross-resistant chemotherapy agents. Rituximab is added for a total of 8 doses for patients with pre-B-cell ALL. Dasatinib is added for patients with Ph+ ALL. Course 1A (Induction): Daunorubicin, vincristine, PEG-asparaginase, and prednisone for all patients with the addition of cyclophosphamide for patients 18-39 years of age. Treatment is intensified for patients with disease present on a day 14 bone marrow biopsies during Induction Course 1A. In addition to standard analyses, minimal residual disease will be assessed on day 14 and remission bone marrow aspirates and correlated with outcomes. Course 1B: High-dose methotrexate, oral 6-mercaptopurine, and PEG-asparaginase. Course 1C: High-dose cytarabine and etoposide. The 3 courses then repeat (2A (Intensification), 2B, 2C) followed by a final "B" cycle (3B) of high-dose methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, and PEG-asparaginase. After completion of Course 3B, patients proceed to maintenance chemotherapy with monthly methotrexate, vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, and prednisone cycles for 24 months with a single dose PEG-asparaginase given in month 1 of Maintenance. CNS prophylaxis: Intrathecal liposomal cytarabine replaces intrathecal methotrexate CNS prophylaxis and is given every 2 weeks during the "A" Induction and Intensification courses then every 3 months during Maintenance for a total of 8 doses. Given the presence of CNS penetrating chemotherapy in the "B" and "C" cycles, intrathecal liposomal cytarabine is not given due to risk of excessive CNS toxicity. There is a randomization to hydrocortisone or placebo premedication prior to PEG-asparaginase.</detailed_description>
