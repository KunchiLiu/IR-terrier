	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Quality of Self-collected Blood Spot Specimens for Laboratory HIV Testing - An InvolveMENt Sub Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be recruited to this one-time assessment during their follow-up visits. After completing a consent procedure specific to this study component, participants will be provided with instructions on how to fully self-administer the procedure of a finger stick and also blotting to collect a blood specimen using a 1, 3 or 5 blood spot specimen collection card. These specimens will be labeled with the participant's unique identification number, and no other identifying information. The dried blood spots will be evaluated by a laboratorian to assess quality, but will not be tested for HIV. This evaluation will help determine what number of self-collected dried blood spots yields the highest usable quantity of sample for HIV testing. There will be a separate monetary incentive of $30 for this procedure.</detailed_description>
