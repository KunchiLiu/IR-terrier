	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin D on Lung Function in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency is a known problem in CF patients. The CF Foundation Committee published in April 2012 new guidelines for administering vitamin D in CF patients. The investigators' study is designed to look for association between normal serum vitamin D levels and lung function. ~100 CF patients from The Center of Chronic Diseases in Hadassah Medical Organization will be treated according to the new guidelines, and their lung function will be tested once a month during the trial, which will be held for at least one year. In this study, the investigators' goal is to test the efficiency of the new guidelines in correcting serum vitamin D levels, and to follow other related factors such as growth indices (height, weight, BMI), bone mineral density, number of pulmonary exacerbations and number of hospital admissions.</detailed_description>
