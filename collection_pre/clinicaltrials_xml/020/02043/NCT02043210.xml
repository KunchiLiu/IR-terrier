	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of our new web-based version of the CBT4CBT (Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) in Spanish. This program specifically designed for Spanish-speaking substance users to evaluate its effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling at the Hispanic Clinic. The computer-based training program (CBT4CBT) focuses on teaching basic coping skills, presenting examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of realistic situations in video form, and providing opportunities for patients to practice and review new skills while receiving substance use treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>100 Spanish-speaking substance using individuals seeking treatment at the Hispanic Clinic of the Connecticut Mental Health Center will be randomized to (1) standard outpatient counseling at the Hispanic Clinic (typically consisting of weekly group counseling), OR (2) CBT4CBT plus standard outpatient counseling. Treatments will be delivered over an 8-week period with a six-month follow-up after termination of the study treatments. The primary outcome measures will be reduction in substance use (frequency of substance use by time, confirmed by urine toxicology screens and breathalyzers). Secondary outcomes will include treatment utilization and cost, several measures intended to detect whether web-based CBT4CBT retains key characteristics of traditional clinician-administered CBT (e.g., acquisition of coping skills, use of change strategies), participant characteristics which will be evaluated as potential moderators of outcome, as well as participant satisfaction and treatment credibility.</detailed_description>
