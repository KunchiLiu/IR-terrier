	<brief_summary>In the embry life there is a passage of IgG type, from the mother to tha embryoyo and only in the age of 3-5 month after birth the infant start to develop them by himself. In preterm infants the starting point of the level of the IgG's is lower from the level of term infants. Delayed cord clamping /milking it was prooved in many researches as benificial in terms of : levels of hemoglobin; hematocrit and feritin in the neonats. Also benefits were proved by means of less need for blood tranfusion, less intra ventricular hemorrhage; necrotzing entero colitis and iron deficiency anemia. The hypothesis is that delayed clamping /milking it will increse the level of IgG's in preterm infants. The end point hypothesis is that delayed cord clamping /milking cause to less fever disease or hospitalization it the neonats.</brief_summary>
