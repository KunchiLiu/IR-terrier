	<brief_summary>This is a multicentric and prospective study for the validation of a diagnostic method in multiple sclerosis. Our hypothesis is that there is a characteristic profile of tears that can be recognized in order to help in the diagnosis of this pathology and that could possibly replace the lumbar punction which is an invasive method. Semi-automatic and automatic techniques of isoelectric focusing will be developed for analyzing data from tears. These results will help in the identification of markers of this disease.</brief_summary>
