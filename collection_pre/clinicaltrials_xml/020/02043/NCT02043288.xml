	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With NC-6004 and Gemcitabine Versus Gemcitabine Alone in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers because of the predominately late diagnosis. Gemcitabine (GEM) is the standard treatment for advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer. According to preclinical data and few early phase studies, a combined use of gemcitabine and cisplatin (CDDP) showed synergistic efficacy against pancreatic cancer. NC-6004, a novel micellar cisplatin formulation, retains the activity but avoids the renal toxicity and neurotoxicity caused by the high peak Cmax concentrations of cisplatin. This trial is designed to evaluate the impact of the addition of NC-6004 to gemcitabine in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The main hypothesis of this study is that NC-6004 plus gemcitabine combination is superior to gemcitabine alone in terms of overall survival in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients</detailed_description>
