	<criteria>Obese men and women with prediabetes will be recruited for this study with ages ranging from 3060 years old. Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and a combination of the two (IFG/IGT) will recruited and verified using oral glucose tolerance testing at initial screening. All subjects will be obese (BMI 3040 kg/m2) and sedentary (&lt;2 hours/week of planned physical activity). Impaired fasting glucose is defined as fasting glucose between 100125mg/dl, with postprandial glucose (&lt;140 mg/dl 2 hrs after 75g OGTT). Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as normal fasting glucose &lt;100mg/dl, with postprandial glucose (&gt;140 mg/dl 2 hrs after 75g OGTT). Subjects with IFG/IGT will have both impaired fasting glucose (100125mg/dl), and impaired glucose tolerance (&gt;140 mg/dl 2 hrs after 75g OGTT) (49). To increase generalizability, and because each subject serves as their own control, women will be enrolled regardless of menopausal status, use of hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives. Regular exercise more than 2 hours/week, medications that could affect glucose, lipid metabolism, thyroid disease, a history of lung disease, pregnancy, active cigarette smoking or exposure to second hand smoke and severe plasma lipid disorders.</criteria>
