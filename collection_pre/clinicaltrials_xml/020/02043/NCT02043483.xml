	<brief_summary>Untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) has long-term complications, namely metabolic imbalances (obesity, dislipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus). Until now, no molecular markers for this physiopathological connection have been identified. This project aims to determine non-invasive biomarkers that may allow better comprehension of the metabolic consequences of OSAS, as well as assess the effect of Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on these metabolic parameters. This project will integrate the clinical, metabolic, genetic/proteomic and biologic systems to further explore the mechanisms behind OSAS, as well as the effect of the treatment with CPAP.</brief_summary>
