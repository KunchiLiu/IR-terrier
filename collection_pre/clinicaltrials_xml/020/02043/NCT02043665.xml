	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the ability of CVA21, either alone (Part A) or in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B), to reach and to replicate in existing tumors (while sparing normal cells) and to establish a safe multi-dose schedule of the virus for the treatment of solid tumors where enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and/ or DAF receptor occurs. This trial will consist of 2 sequential parts: VLA-009 (Part A) conducted only in the UK employs CVA21 as a monotherapy in NSCLC, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, melanoma and bladder cancer. VLA-009 (Part B) conducted in the US and UK employs CVA21 with pembrolizumab in NSCLC and bladder cancer. Both VLA-009A and VLA-009B are open-label, multi-center, ascending dose escalation (3+3 design) dose-finding and signal-seeking studies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed (1) NSCLC, (2) bladder cancer, (3) castrateresistant prostate cancer which are metastatic, or (4) stage 3C or stage 4 melanoma. VLA009A: Locally advanced and/or metastatic disease for which curative surgery and/or radiation therapy is not possible and judged not to be a candidate for the current standard of care treatment. VLA009B: locally advanced and/or metastatic disease and judged to be a candidate for pembrolizumab to be used in combination with CVA21. All subjects in Cohort 3 or Phase 2 dose (P2D) must have a lesion accessible for FNA or core or open biopsy on day 8 of the first treatment cycle. No CVA21 neutralising antibody (â‰¤ 1:16) Measurable or evaluable disease Second primary malignancy within the past 2 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, breast cancer) Concurrent immunosuppressive therapy and no known immunosuppressive disease other than primary tumour</criteria>
