	<brief_title>Maintenance Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma and Biological Marker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, with the morbidity of approximate 100 million cases per year. About 40% of patients present with metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and about 25% of patients with local lesion will ultimately develop metastatic disease.Therefore, our study is designed to investigate that colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under first-line chemotherapy are candidates for an convenient maintenance treatment.</detailed_description>
