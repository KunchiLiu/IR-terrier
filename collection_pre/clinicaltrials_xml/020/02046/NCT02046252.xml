	<brief_summary>Substance use, particularly the compulsive behaviors associated with addiction, lead to unhealthy behaviors including non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment failure. High on the list of disorders leading to non-adherence is heroin addiction as a wide range of impulsive, high-risk behaviors accompanies it. The science of adherence would be improved by developing new methods to prevent relapse to heroin addiction, especially methods that can be used in settings that are not limited by the aims to test such a method using an implantable naltrexone formulation (IN) that is approved in Russia and blocks opioid effects for 3 months. The efficacy of the IN should be better than oral naltrexone (ON) because it does not depend on daily behavior to take a tablet and maintains a constant plasma level for months, which should result in sustained blockade, less relapse, and better ART adherence and treatment response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adherence to HIV Therapy in Heroin Addicts: Oral vs. Extended Release Naltrexone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, randomized trial of a 48-week course of implant naltrexone vs. oral naltrexone, each arm with drug counseling every two weeks, for 200 HIV+ patients who are in early remission from opioid dependence, and who are interested in relapse prevention treatment medication, and starting their first episode of antiretroviral therapy at the Botkin Infectious Disease Hospital in St. Petersburg or the Leningrad Regional AIDS Center. Early remission was chosen because relapse risk is the highest at this point, thus maximizing the chances for detecting a naltrexone effect. The first antiretroviral therapy treatment episode was chosen because it is feasible (relatively few opioid addicted Russians have been treated with antiretroviral therapy), and because the virus is less likely to have developed secondary resistance. Participants will be recruited from the AIDS and addiction programs and who meet study admission criteria will be stratified within each site according to baseline viral load (&gt;100,000 copies/&lt;100,000 copies) and CD4 count (&gt;50/&lt;50 copies). Participants will be randomized to a treatment condition, receive a naloxone challenge, and if pass be prescribed oral naltrexone or oral placebo and implant/implant placebo), and given a schedule for addiction counseling and HIV treatment appointments. A 2-week supply of oral medication will be provided at each bi-weekly counseling session, and will be re-implanted at weeks 12, 24, and 36. Only the research pharmacist will know the group assignments, however the blind can be broken in case of emergency. The primary outcome measure will be to compare implanted naltrexone versus oral naltrexone on ability to achieve a viral load of &lt;400 copies at weeks 24 and 48. Secondary outcomes are to compare the efficacy of the two addiction treatments; to study the adherence to antiretroviral therapy; to evaluate time to relapse and the number of days to relapsed; to evaluate decline in CD4 counts; to evaluate HIV risk behavior; to evaluate opioid positive urine tests; and to evaluate the number of days that patients will keep their scheduled appointments. The Investigator will also monitor psychiatric symptoms, other drug use, and overall adjustment.</detailed_description>
