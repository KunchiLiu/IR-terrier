	<brief_summary>Current pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have limited efficacy. Thus, the development of effective treatments for AUDs represents an important public health objective. Repositioning, i.e. using existing approved drugs for other indications, represents a fast and economically feasible approach for drug development. Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA-approved antiparasitic medication that can significantly reduce alcohol intake in mice, suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of AUDs in humans. The goal of this project is to provide key clinical evidence that IVM can be repositioned as a novel therapeutic agent to treat AUDs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have limited efficacy. Thus, the development of effective treatments for AUDs represents an important public health objective. Repositioning, i.e. using existing approved drugs for other indications, represents a fast and economically feasible approach for drug development. Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA-approved antiparasitic medication that can significantly reduce alcohol intake in mice, suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of AUDs in humans. The goal of this project is to provide key clinical evidence that IVM can be repositioned as a novel therapeutic agent to treat AUDs. We will enroll 10 alcohol dependent individuals in a placebo-controlled randomized pilot safety trial of IVM (30 mg orally once) over a 2-day (1-night) inpatient stay at the UCLA CTRC and employ a well-characterized battery of behavioral paradigms (i.e., alcohol administration and cue exposure). The goals of the study are to test: (a) the safety of combining IVM, at a dose currently shown to be safe in humans (30 mg), with moderate doses of alcohol (0.08 g/dl); and (b) whether IVM reduces the reinforcing effects of alcohol during alcohol administration and whether it reduces alcohol craving during cue exposure, as compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
