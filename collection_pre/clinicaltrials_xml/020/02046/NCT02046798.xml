	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism and Excretion Routes of ASP3652 in Man, After Administration of 14C Radio Labeled ASP3652</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, one-period, single-dose study with 14C labeled ASP3652. Screening takes place between Day 22 to Day 2, and subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -1. On the morning of Day 1, each subject receives a single oral dose of 14C-labeled ASP3652. Blood, urine and feces samples for analysis of 14C radioactivity are collected until at least 120 h after dosing. Blood samples for the analysis of ASP3652 and metabolites are collected until 120 h after dosing. The subjects remain in the clinic until Day 6 (or up to Day 13 in case discharge criteria are not met on Day 6) and return for an End of Study Visit (ESV) 7 to 14 days after (early) discharge.</detailed_description>
