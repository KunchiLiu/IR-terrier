	<brief_summary>This study tests the use of handheld computer tablets to promote the integration of 5A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) for smoking cessation in academic and community primary care clinics. Although most patients receive the "ask" and "advise" steps, only slightly more than half are "assessed" for readiness to change, less than half receive "assistance" in changing, and only 9% have an "arranged" follow-up. While the large majority of primary care providers support the 5A's model, negative attitudes and the lack of time, knowledge, and cessation skills are common obstacles. Alternate service delivery systems that address these obstacles and evidence-based strategies to promote their implementation are needed to improve provider adherence and 5A's fidelity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-Facilitated 5A's for Smoking Cessation in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project develops and tests a computer-facilitated 5A's (CF-5A's) model that administers the 5A's intervention to patients then prompts providers for reinforcing next steps. CF-5A's could efficiently and effectively promote smoking cessation while educating providers about cessation resources and appropriate follow-up. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model, clinically tailored strategies to promote CF-5A's implementation will be developed and tested to ensure the appropriate use and uptake of this new service delivery model. Development of the model, materials, and strategies will occur in years 1 and 2. Baseline data collection occurs in year 2, followed by a randomized trial of CF- 5A's where the provider is the unit of randomization. Provider use of the 5A's will primarily be assessed with a brief phone call to the patient after the primary care visit has occurred. Although focused on 5A's for smoking cessation, this study examines the underlying implementation science of computer-aided service delivery models with important implications for the integration of other substance use or behavioral health interventions in primary care. Implementation factors will be assessed using qualitative interviews and brief pre-post surveys.</detailed_description>
