	<brief_title>An Open-label, Single-dose Study to Determine the Metabolism and Excretion of [14C]E2006 in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single-dose study in healthy male subjects. The study will have 2 phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment Phase will last up to 21 days and will consist of a Screening Period and a Baseline Period, during which each subject's eligibility will be determined and assessments will be conducted.</detailed_description>
