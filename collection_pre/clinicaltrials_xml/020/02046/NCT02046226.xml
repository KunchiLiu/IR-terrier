	<brief_title>Dissolved Oxygen Dressing to Improve Chronic Wound Healing After Revascularization for Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Prospective, Randomized, controlled pilot study enrolling up to 50 subjects at a singe investigational site in the US. Subjects with atherosclerotic peripheral arteria disease (PAD) presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and one or more non-healing lower extremity arterial insufficiency ulcers who are suitable candidates for revascularization procedures (endovascular or surgical) will be randomized 1:1 to: - Wound care with the use of OxyGenesys(TM) Dissolved Oxygen Dressing, or - Standard Wound Care procedures An initial study phase will enroll up to 20 subjects (10 in each arm). Pending results of the initial study phase, the study may continue to enroll until up to 50 subjects (25 in each arm) have been enrolled. All subjects will be followed clinically and receive wound evaluation at 1, 3, and 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or nonpregnant female &gt;=21 years of age A clinical diagnosis of critical limb ischemia (CLI) with Rutherford classification stage 5 One or more chronic ulcers with a presumed etiology of arterial insufficiency and duration &gt;2 weeks. The target ulcer is defined as the highestgrade ulcer (Wagner's classification) at initial evaluation. For wounds with identical grading, the largest wound is the index wound The patient or legally authorized representative is willing to provide informed consent and comply with specified followup evaluations Undergoing intervention for infrainguinal or infrapopliteal artery disease (below the femoral artery bifurcation and above the ankle joint) The index procedure resulted in successful revascularization. For endovascular procedures, successful revascularization is defined as complete revascularization of the target ulcer culprit vessels according to the angiosome treatment strategy, with a final percent diameter stenosis &gt;50% and improved distal flow by angiography following the procedure. For surgical procedures, successful revascularization is defined as a patent graft and improved distal flow following the procedure. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to index procedure. Rutherford classification stage 0,1,2,3,4, or 6 Target wound duration &lt;2 weeks Presence of frank gangrene (Wagner classification grade 4 or 5), major tissue loss (severe/extensive necrosis), or unsalvageable limb (extensive ischemic ulceration beyond the transmetatarsal level anticipated to require major amputation after the index procedure) Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 6 months before or 30 days after the index procedure, or any previous or planned target limb amputation. Active local or systemic infection Patients with ulcers judged by the examining physician to have a primary etiology other than ischemic arterial disease (e.g., venous related, decubitus, or other [goug, pyoderma gangrenosum, necrobiosis lipoidica, vitamin B12 deficiency]) Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.7sm sq. within 30 days of the index procedure or treated with dialysis) Severly decreased cardiac output Uncontrolled hyperglycemia Patients with a known other medical illness or known history of substance abuse that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy of less than 1 year Patient is currently participating (or has participated in the last 30 days) in a study of any other investigational treatment. Ulcer treatment with normothermic or hyperbaric oxygen therapy, recombinant or autologous growth factor products, or use of enzymatic debridement Concomitant medications such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, or chemotherapy Acute thrombus in the target limb</criteria>
