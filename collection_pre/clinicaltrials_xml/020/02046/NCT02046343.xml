	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study it to determine if a promotora-led intervention that takes a comprehensive, multi-level, community-based approach to promoting physical activity (PA) is effective among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. We hypothesize that Latinas in the promotora-led PA Intervention will significantly increase minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) compared to Latinas in the attention-control group.</brief_summary>
