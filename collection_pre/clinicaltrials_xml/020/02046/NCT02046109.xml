	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to compare the success (as assessed by a pre-defined set of outcome) of failing composite resin restorations that are repaired using diamond bur induced surface abrasion, to those that are completely replaced. It is hypothesized that both treatment will have comparable success rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Success and Survival of Dental Composite Restorations Being Repaired Instead of Being Replaced</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single-blind randomized non-inferiority trial using parallel groups. Patients recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Subjects allocated to Group 1 will have their defective restoration completely replaced while subjects allocated to Group 2 will have their defective restoration repaired. The success of the treatments will be assessed immediately following the intervention (baseline) and 12 months later.</detailed_description>
