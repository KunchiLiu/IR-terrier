	<brief_title>Preliminary Study of Pharmacokinetics of Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection was jointly developed by China Pharmaceutical University and Jiangsu Kanion Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Its pharmacal ingredients are ginkgo lactones A , ginkgo lactone B, ginkgo lactone K, etc; Excipients for meglumine, citric acid, sodium chloride. It is used to treat stroke (mild-to-moderate cerebral infarction) in recovery phlegm and Syndrome of Intermingled Phlegm and Blood Stasis. The aim of this study is to explore the rule of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination after intravenous administration of Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection healthy subjects. The plasma drug profiles will be important to assess the potential clinical drug-drug interactions. Biological sample including blood and urine for PK is collected during the study. In the first stage, the biological sample of two subjects will be collected at different time points. In the second stage, the biological sample of another two subjects will be collected at the time points which are adjusted according to the results of the first stage.</detailed_description>
