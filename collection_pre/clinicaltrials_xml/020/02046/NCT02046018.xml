	<brief_summary>In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many children die from diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness (ARI) and malaria, despite well- recognized, inexpensive and highly effective treatments, since health access and human resources are limited. Healthy Child Uganda (HCU) is a Ugandan-Canadian partnership that since 2003, has developed, implemented and evaluated a Village Health Volunteer (VHV) program in 175 rural villages. Volunteers, selected by peers, provide health education and refer sick children. Volunteer retention (94%) and significant decreases in child deaths are remarkable. Now, HCU wonders whether VHV scope can extend to provide treatment for sick children using Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)/Zinc, antibiotics, and antimalarials. Use of lay providers in this capacity, called integrated community case management (iCCM), has been proposed as a potential inexpensive solution to SSA's human health resource crisis. PRIMARY QUESTION: In rural southwest Uganda, can iCCM provided by lay volunteers, improve the proportion of children with diarrhoea receiving ORS/Zn, ARI receiving antibiotics, and fever/malaria receiving antimalarials? Secondary study questions consider VHV capacity to prescribe appropriate drug, dose, duration; iCCM acceptance by family, and VHV; VHV retention/motivation; program cost. Selected VHV will be iCCM trained then receive treatments for distribution. Qualitative and quantitative methods including household surveys, and focus groups will consider pre/post intervention differences and differences in control and intervention populations. A research short course and micro research grants (~ $3000 to multidisciplinary groups pursuing relevant questions) will promote health system evaluation capacity. Lessons learned are critical as SSA countries move forward in planning for increased iCCM programming.</brief_summary>
