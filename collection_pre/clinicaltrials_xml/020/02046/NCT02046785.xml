	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether hemodynamic measures vary in angles bedside before and after volume challenge.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Measurements at Different Inclinations of the Head</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Check if values of central venous pressure (CVP), pulse pressure variation (Δpp), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure ((PAM) vary in different angles headboards - Compare values of CVP, Δpp, HR and MAP as predictors of blood volume after supply of 500 ml of 0.9% saline solution.</detailed_description>
