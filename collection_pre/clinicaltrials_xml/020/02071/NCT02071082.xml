	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfected adults. Participants will be enrolled into two cohorts: - Cohort 1: HIV/HBV coinfected adults who are HIV treatment-naive and HBV treatment-naive - Cohort 2: HIV/HBV coinfected adults who are HIV-suppressed</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Both Cohorts 1 and 2: The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures HIV/HBV coinfected adult males and nonpregnant and nonlactating females No evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or clinical or imaging evidence of cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy). Subjects should have documentation of an abdominal ultrasound in the 12 months prior to screening, or an abdominal ultrasound at screening, demonstrating the absence of cirrhosis and HCC. Acute Hepatitis A virus (HAV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) negative Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab negative, or HCV Ab positive with negative HCV RNA Hepatitis D virus (HDV) Ab negative, or HDV Ab positive with negative HDV RNA Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula CD4+ count of &gt; 200 cells/μL Chronic HBV infection as defined by HBsAg positive for ≥ 6 months Or HBsAg positive at screening and either hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) or HBV DNA positive ≥ 6 months Or At screening: positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) and negative immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcIgM) antibody, and HBsAg positive, or HBeAg positive, or HBV DNA positive Cohort 1 (HIV and HBV treatment naive) only: No current or prior antiHIV treatment, including antiretroviral medications received for prevention (PrEP), or post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) No current or prior antiHBV treatment Plasma HIV1 RNA level ≥ 500 copies/mL at screening Screening HBV DNA ≥ 3 log10 IU/mL and &lt; 9 log10 IU/mL Cohort 2 (HIV suppressed) only: Receiving current antiretroviral regimen for at least 4 consecutive months No current or prior regimen containing 3 active antiHBV agents (i.e. cannot be on tenofovir alafenamide (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/Entecavir or TDF/lamivudine(3TC)/Entecavir) Maintained plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL for 6 consecutive months prior to and at the time of the screening visit. Unconfirmed virologic evaluation of ≥ 50 copies/mL after previously reaching viral suppression (transient detectable viremia, or "blip") and prior to screening is acceptable Documented positive HIV antibody test Screening HBV DNA &lt; 9 log10 IU/mL Key Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test (female of childbearing potential) Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive carcinoma. Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant Any history of, or current evidence of, clinical hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage). Significant bone disease (e.g., osteomalacia, chronic osteomyelitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteochondroses), or multiple bone fractures Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 Subjects on hemodialysis, other forms of renal replacement therapy, or on treatment for underlying kidney diseases (including prednisolone, and dexamethasone) Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements Investigational agents (unless approved by Gilead Sciences). Participation in any other clinical trial without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
