	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer with para-aortic lymph node (PAN) involvement is regarded as advanced disease, and only chemotherapy is recommended from the guidelines. In unresectable cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could prolong survival if conversion to resectability could be achieved.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma proven histologically . 2. Has paraaortic lymph node metastasis(PAN was defined as nodes in the region between the upper margin of the celiac artery and the upper border of the inferior mesenteric artery (stations no. 16a2/16b1)) 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. 4. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks. 5. Adequate hematological function: Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L and Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may be transfused to maintain or exceed this level). Adequate liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 × ULN , ALP ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); ALB ≥30g/L。 Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x ULN, and creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min. 6. Female subjects should not be pregnant or breastfeeding. 7. No serious concomitant disease that will threaten the survival of patients to less than 5 years. 1. Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the investigator. 2. History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the following: Any previous palliative, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Prior treatment for locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. 3. Any other metastatic disease will render patient ineligible according to AJCC staging manual(such as liver，lung，etc）. 4. Active infection that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy. 5. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus with fasting blood sugar &gt; 18 mm. Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study enrollment. 6. Unstable, persistent cardiac disease despite medicinal treatment, myocardial infarction within 6 months before the start of the trial 7. Previous surgery on primary tumour; Prior palliative surgery (open and closure, passage operation) 8. Any other type of tumour (e.g. leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma) or a secondary malignancy, excepting basal cell skin carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma in situ of the cervix which have already been successfully treated</criteria>
