	<brief_summary>Patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), a rapid beating of the upper heart chambers, can undergo catheter ablation to control or eliminate their rhythm disorder. The radiopharmceutical 123I-mIBG (Adreview™ GE Healthcare) has been introduced to visually identify cardiac innervation. This study will use non-invasive evaluation using MIBG imaging to study if we can predict baseline autonomic characteristics in patients with AF, as well as clinical outcome based on post ablation imaging</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autonomic Innervation and MIBG Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single centre, interventional, Phase III trial using the radiopharmaceutical 123I-mIBG for imaging. In this pilot study, up to 7 eligible participants will undergo pre-ablation and post ablation nuclear imaging. The major objective of our study is to evaluate the relationship between non-invasive imaging of cardiac innervation with invasive mapping of atrial innervation as determined by High Frequency Stimulation (standard of care to physiologically document autonomic function). This will be followed by the clinical ablation procedure, as discussed by the cardiac electrophysiologist, consisting of pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation, inclusive of regions of autonomic innervation, and sites showing complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) when clinically indicated. The secondary objective is to determine the relationship between catheter ablation of AF and non-invasive nuclear imaging of cardiac innervation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1880 years. Symptoms including one or more of the following: palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, presyncope or syncope, chest pain, tiredness or lack of energy. Failure of betablockers or at least one antiarrhythmic agent other than Amiodarone to prevent AF. In those patients who are not eligible to antiarrhythmic agents other than Amiodarone, patients may choose to undergo catheter ablation rather than starting Amiodarone. Paroxysmal (selfterminating AF within 7 days) or persistent AF (requiring an intervention to terminate or lasting more than 7 days). Intracardiac thrombus as determined by transesophageal echocardiography Class III or IV congestive heart failure Persistent AF duration of more than 3 years Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Left atrial size of greater than 55 mm determined by 2D echocardiogram Inability to undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram or cardiac CT Inability to undergo DSPECT™ imaging Inability to take Warfarin or the new oral anticoagulants Previously received 123ImIBG or 131ImIBG History or suspicion of significant allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to iodine or iodinated imaging agents Use of medications for noncardiac medical conditions that are known to interfere with 123ImIBG uptake and these medications cannot be safely withheld for at least 24 hours before study procedures Diagnosis of or signs or symptoms of a neurologic disease such as Parkinson's disease, multiple systems atrophy or Parkinsonian syndromes, or other diseases known to affect the sympathetic nervous system Pregnancy as determined by a preprocedure pregnancy tests</criteria>
