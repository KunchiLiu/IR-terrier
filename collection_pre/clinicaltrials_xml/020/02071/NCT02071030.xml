	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) compared to panoramic radiography prior to removal of third molars in reducing patient's morbidity. Adults having a close relationship between the mandibular canal and one or both lower third molars, as diagnosed from digital panoramic radiographs will be recruited for this randomised controlled trial. In one trial arm, patients will receive the standard digital panoramic radiograph prior to third molar surgery. In the second arm, subjects will undergo an additional Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) prior to third molar surgery. All patients require a postoperative visit one week after surgery to assess the outcome.</brief_summary>
