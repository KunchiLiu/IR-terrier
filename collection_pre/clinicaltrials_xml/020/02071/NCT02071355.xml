	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to a medication) of TMC435 after multiple oral doses of 100 and 150 mg TMC435 once daily for 7 days in healthy Chinese participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Examine the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Multiple Oral Doses of TMC435 in Healthy Chinese Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (both [participants and investigator] know what treatment participants will receive) and randomized (study medication is assigned by chance) study. The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 21 days prior to administration of study medication), a treatment phase (from day -1 [1 days before the administration of study medication] to Day 10 including pharmacokinetics sample collection), and follow-up phase (up to 16 days after the last dose of study medication or after dropout [other than withdrawal of consent]). Approximately 32 healthy participants will be equally divided into 2 groups (Group 1 and Group 2) to receive TMC435 for 7 days. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored at various timepoints throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for each participant will be approximately 47 days.</detailed_description>
