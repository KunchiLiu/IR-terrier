	<brief_title>A Retrospective Study of the Relationship Between White Matter Hyperintensities(WMHs) Within the Cholinergic Pathways and the Cognition of PD Patients After Bilateral STN DBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this observational study, we will retrospectively analyze 38 PD patients who received bilateral STN DBS in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University during the year of 2008-2012. All patients will be evaluated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III(UPDRSIII) before and after operation. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) in the on medication condition pre-operation and on stimulation on medication condition post-operation. The follow-up time points are one week pre-operation and 6, 12, 24 months post-operation. Before operation, white matter hyperintensities（WMHs）in the cholinergic pathways will be determined on a 3.0 Tesla MRI, using the visual rating scale of Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS). A correlation analysis will be conducted to investigate the relationship between CHIPS score and the change of cognitive status of PD patients after bilateral STN DBS retrospectively.</detailed_description>
