	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a protein in blood, called periostin, can determine if patients have chronic sinusitis. This protein is in everyone's body, but the level of the protein may indicate certain conditions such as chronic sinusitis. The investigators are interested in testing levels of periostin to see if they are higher or lower than patients without chronic sinusitis, just as periostin is higher in patients with asthma. All patients enrolled in this study will have chronic sinusitis without asthma.</brief_summary>
