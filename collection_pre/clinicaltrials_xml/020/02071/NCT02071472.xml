	<brief_title>Electronic Pharmaceutical Record Used for Medication Reconciliation by a Pharmacist Associated to the Anesthesiologist Consultation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesiology consultation is mandatory in France for planned surgery. It is part of the concept of anesthesia safety. The main goal is to assess the anesthetic and surgical risk including clinical and drug features likely to interfere with the anesthesia. The medication reconciliation is a central part of this consultation especially in order to assess the allergic risk and hemostasis disorders. However, access to comprehensive and reliable data concerning the consumption of health products by the patient represents a major challenge. The "Dossier Pharmaceutique" (DP) is an electronic pharmaceutical record including medications (prescribed medications, over the counter medications, complementary and alternative medicines) delivered by community pharmacists over a four month period. Hospital pharmacists have access to the DP of hospitalized patients in order to improve the quality of the medication reconciliation. These informations regarding medication of the patients will be shared with anesthesiologists.</detailed_description>
