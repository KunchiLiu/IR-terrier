	<brief_summary>This study will examine differences in the process of wound-healing in patients treated with platelet rich plasma (a concentration of proteins derived from a patients own blood) applied to the wound as a gel; injected into the wound or surrounding tissue; or both; compared to patients treated with usual medical treatment . This study seeks to enroll patients who are 18 or older with a non-healing skin wound that is at least 30 days old. Only patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Venous Ulcers, or Pressure Ulcers will be included in the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry Trial of the Effectiveness of Platelet Rich Plasma for Chronic Non-Healing Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed investigation is designed to solicit a large number of patients (N=1,500) with non-healing wounds (Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Venous Ulcers, or Pressure Ulcers) that have not responded to standard wound care in the previous 30 days or more. A prospective, interventional, single-blinded, controlled, registry trial will be used. Data will be analyzed to compare patients who received PRP therapy (PRP gel application, PRP injection, or both) and standard wound care (usual customary care) with patients who received standard wound care (usual customary care), only. Wound size, rate of healing, quality of life, and recurrence of wound will be measured during the 20-week period at usual office visits and at one-year post-enrollment, respectively. Hypotheses to be tested: 1. Treatment of a chronic wound with standard of care and autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) will increase the velocity of healing (rate of wound closure) over a twenty week period as compared to patients receiving standard wound care only (Control Group), which results in the patient's ability to return to previous function and resumption of normal activities. 2. Treatment of a chronic wound with standard of care and autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) will result in complete wound healing within twenty weeks, whereas complete wound healing will not be observed within twenty weeks in patients receiving standard wound care only (Control Group).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Medicare Eligible Written informed consent obtained from either the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative prior to screening activities Male or female ≥ 18 years of age Duration of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU),Venous Ulcers (VU), or Pressure Ulcers (PU) is greater than 30 days at first visit/subject screening DFU is classified as Wagner 1 2 on the Wagner classification system If more than one nonhealing wound is present, the largest of the wounds that is classified as a Wagner 1 2. If a subject has multiple eligible wounds, the largest wound will be selected. There must be at least 4 cm between the index wound and other wounds; if all wounds are closer than 4 cm, the subject should not be enrolled (screen failure). The ulcer must be clinically noninfected Able and willing to comply with the procedures required by the protocol. Subjects may be managed as either inpatient or outpatient. If a female of childbearing potential, the subject must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. Subjects with known sensitivity to components of the Arteriocyte BioBandage™ (calcium chloride, thrombin, acid citrate dextrose solution A (ACDA)). Current treatment of another chronic wound in the same limb. Wound is not of DFU, PU, or VU pathophysiology. Presence of osteomyelitis, or if osteomyelitis is suspected. Received systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), electrostimulation, growth factors, or any cell or tissuederived products for wounds during the 30 days preceding the screening visit. Received radiation therapy or chemotherapy within previous 6 months. Any malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patient has radiographic evidence consistent with diagnosis of neuropathic osteoarthropathy (Charcot foot) in the treatment limb. Ulcer area decreases by greater than or equal to 30% during screening period Subjects who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy. Subject has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for PRP preparation. Subject has sickle cell anemia. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the duration of the trial. Any chronic condition requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids 30 days prior to study entry and anytime during the course of the study. Concurrent participation in a clinical trial in which an investigational agent is used. (Subjects must not have been enrolled in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to study entry and anytime during the course of the study). Females who are nursing. Subjects with Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100,000 platelets/µL.</criteria>
