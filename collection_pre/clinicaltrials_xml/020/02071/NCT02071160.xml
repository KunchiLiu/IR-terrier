	<brief_title>Melatonin for Neuroprotection Following Perinatal Asphyxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study on 30 neonates with moderate to moderately to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) . HIE infants are randomized into two groups: Whole body cooling group (N = 15; receive 72 hours of whole body hypothermia) and melatonin/ hypothermia group (N = 15; receive hypothermia and 5 daily enteral doses of melatonin 10 mg/kg). Serum melatonin, plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD),and serum nitric oxide (NO) are measured at enrollment and after 2 weeks for the two HIE groups. The HIE groups underwent electroencephalography at enrollment and at 2 to 3 weeks. Brain MRI was performed after 2 weeks of life. Neurologic evaluations and Denver Developmental Screening Test II assessments were performed at 6 months. A group of healthy newborns will be used as a control for baseline labs.</detailed_description>
