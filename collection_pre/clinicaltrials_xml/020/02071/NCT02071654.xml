	<brief_summary>A prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical study of the Venus P-valve for the treatment of RVOT stenosis with pulmonary regurgitation after surgery of congenital heart defect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Venus P-valve to Treat RVOT Stenosis With Pulmonary Regurgitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this protocol is to assess the efficacy, safety and performance of Venus P-valve. Patients between 18-60 years with RVOT stenosis and moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation (≥3+) who have undergone trans-annular patch repair of their RVOT, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) screening right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) between 130-160mL/m2. Post-procedure follow-ups will be scheduled at 24 hours, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months.</detailed_description>
