	<brief_summary>To explore the cerebral protective effect of midazolam in patients with traumatic brain injury, we will collect blood samples from patients treated with or without midazolam when the patient is admitted to ICU, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after the admission before the use of midazolam for patients in group N1, and before the patient is treated with midazolam, 24 hï¼Œ 48 h, 72 h after the use of midazolam for patients in group N2. Parameters of cerebral metabolism and inflammatory response will be obtained from the blood samples or the cerebrospinal fluid. With the aforementioned parameters, the relationship between clinical outcome and cerebral metabolism and inflammatory response will be detected with statistical method.</brief_summary>
