	<brief_summary>The primary endpoint is to assess the safety and tolerability of Cenderitide (CD-NP) with the incidence of symptomatic hypotension being one of the key safety variables.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD-NP (Cenderitide) Therapy for the Preservation of Left Ventricular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a "proof of concept", randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. The study population will include 60 patients admitted with a first time ST elevation anterior STEMI as diagnosed by the following criteria: a) Significant chest discomfort and /or shortness of breath; b) ST segment elevation (1.5 mV total) in two or more adjacent anterior precordial leads; c) Successful reperfusion therapy (&gt;TIMI grade 2 flow) either with thrombolytics or PTCA within 24 hours of onset of symptoms as documented by coronary angiography; and d) No previous history of an anterior AMI or previous ECG suggesting an old anterior AMI. Patients will be randomized to one of two doses of CD-NP (5 ng/kg/min and 10 ng/kg/min) or placebo continuous infusion for up to 72 hours in a 1:1:1 manner. All patients will receive other standard medical therapies as determined appropriate by the physician and in accordance to the ACC/AHA guidelines</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Significant chest discomfort and /or shortness of breath ST segment elevation (1.5 mV total) in two or more adjacent anterior precordial leads Successful reperfusion therapy (&gt;TIMI grade 2 flow) either with thrombolytics or any mechanical forms of revascularization, including stent, PTCA, thrombectomy, etc. within 24 hours of onset of symptoms as documented by coronary angiography No previously known history of AMI (prior to current cardiac event) or no previous ECG (prior to current cardiac event) suggesting an old AMI (Q wave on presenting ECG is not an exclusion).. (Assessed at the time of enrollment unless otherwise stated) Cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure or hypotension (Systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg) Previous known decreased EF &lt; 40% Atrial Fibrillation Persistent signs and symptoms of Post MI ischemia Requirement of pressors for maintenance of blood pressure.
