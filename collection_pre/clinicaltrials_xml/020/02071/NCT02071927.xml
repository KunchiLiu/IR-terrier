	<brief_summary>Many tumor cells, in contrast to normal cells, have been shown to require the amino acid glutamine to produce energy for growth and survival. To exploit the dependence of tumors on glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with leukemia. This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in subjects with leukemia. Part 1 is a dose escalation study to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose as a single agent and in combination with azacitidine. Patients enrolled into Part 2 will be treated with the recommended Phase 2 dose. As an extension of Part 2, patients with relapsed/ refractory or newly diagnosed AML will be treated with CB-839 in combination with azacitidine. All patients will be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness in later studies), and tumor response.</brief_summary>
