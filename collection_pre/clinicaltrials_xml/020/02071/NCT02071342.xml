	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes at 30 days and 1 year (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), thrombosis of the device in patients who are undergoing angioplasty in myocardial infarction and in which bioabsorbable stent was implanted (BVS). Additionally, we will evaluate the acute recoil after implantation of bioabsorbable stents. A 24 months follow-up , by means of coronary angiography accompanied by QCA and assessment with intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) and VH (virtual histology) is scheduled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ABSORB Stent in Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug -eluting stents (drug eluting stents , DES) are currently used routinely in the course of coronary angioplasty ( percutaneous coronary intervention , PCI ) and have significantly reduced the incidence of adverse events during follow-up in the medium and long term . However, the persistence of the metal structure of these devices within the coronary artery over time adds no additional benefit but , on the contrary , it is potentially harmful because it may predispose to coronary thrombosis even after years of implantation, can alter the structure of the vessel for remodeling phenomena, can decrease a coronary vasomotion and reducing the possibilily of a future surgery. The recent development of new devices such as bioabsorbable vascular scaffold " BVS " release of antiproliferative drug ( everolimus ), could provide new clinical advantages especially in patients who are revascularized during acute myocardial infarction. These patients are at higher risk of MACE and stent thrombosis late . The aim of our study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes conventional to 30 days and 1 year, such as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization(TLR ), target vessel revascularization (TVR ), thrombosis of the device in patients who undergo angioplasty in the course of acute coronary syndrome and in which it was implanted bioabsorbable stent ( BVS ). The acute recoil after implantation of bioresorbable vascular scaffold will also be assessed Finally, a follow-up of 24 months we will conduct, by means of coronary angiography accompanied by QCA and IVUS with VH .</detailed_description>
