	<brief_summary>A small gastric remnant after whipple resection improves gastric emptying and therefore prevents the development of delayed gastric emptying.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Size of the Gastric Remnant as Determinant for Delayed Gastric Emptying After Whipple Resection.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every patient submitted to a whipple resection and at the same time present with characteristics suggestive of minimal risk for leakage from the pancreaticojejunostomy will be included in the study. At the time of reconstruction the patient will be randomized to either conventional size of the stomach or to a subtotal gastrectomy containing a small upper gastric pouch only.</detailed_description>
