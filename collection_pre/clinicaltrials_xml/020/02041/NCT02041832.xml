	<brief_summary>Using implantable loop recorder the investigators wish to detect atrial fibrillation in high risk patients and compare it to the results using conventional Holter monitoring. The hypothesis is that 10-15% of high risk patients have subclinical atrial fibrillation. The investigators want to detect those people so they can receive appropriate anticoagulation treatment. The patients will get a comprehensive workup including ecg, echocardiography and blood tests.</brief_summary>
