	<brief_summary>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is an important cause of severe respiratory failure in newborn infants. Treatment for MAS is mainly supportive but surfactant therapy might change the course of the disease. Aim of the study to evaluate whether lung lavage with dilute or bolus poractant alfa changes the duration of mechanical respiratory support or other outcomes in MAS.</brief_summary>
