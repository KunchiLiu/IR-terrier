	<brief_summary>Robot assisted prostatectomy reduces the patients' postoperative pain and leads to rapid rehabilitation. But pneumoperitoneum affects the kidney. The increase of stress hormone reduces the glomerular filtration and the vaso-contraction of renal vessels leads the renal ischemia. Remifentanil is analgesics coupled with μ opioid receptor. In high dose of remifentanil, it is associated with κ and δ receptors, which leads to renal protection effect in animal study. Also, remifentanil infusion during anesthesia showed a diuretic effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the remifentanil effect on renal function during robot assisted prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
