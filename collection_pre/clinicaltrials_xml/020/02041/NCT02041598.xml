	<detailed_description>The DREAM (Diabetes Research, Education, and Action for Minorities) Project is a Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve diabetic management and control among Bangladeshis with diabetes in New York City (NYC). For a two-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT), investigators will recruit a sample of 256 participants, all of whom are 1) of Bangladeshi descent, 2) residing in NYC, 3) diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a recent Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ≥ 6.5, and 4) between the ages of 21-85. The treatment group receives a six-month CHW-led intervention consisting of five monthly group educational sessions, two one-on-one visits, and follow-up phone calls as needed from a CHW. The control group receives an introductory educational session only. Primary and secondary outcomes include clinical and behavioral measures, such as HbA1c and weight change, access to and utilization of care (i.e. appointment keeping and use of specialty care), and knowledge and practice of physical activity and healthful eating. Additionally, information regarding CHW characteristics, the processes and mechanisms for influencing healthful behavior change, and fidelity of the intervention are collected. Outcomes are measured at Baseline, 3-Months, 6-Months for both groups, and at 12-Months for the treatment group.</detailed_description>
