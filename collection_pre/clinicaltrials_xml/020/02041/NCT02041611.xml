	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is evaluate T cell immune status and immune reconstitution and the association with specific cytokines in patients with newly diagnosed HGGs undergoing the standard RT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of T-cell Immune Status in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numbers of T-cell subtypes at six time points in patients with newly diagnosed HGGs undergoing standard RT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ: 1. Baseline within 2 weeks before initiation of RT/TMZ 2. At the end of RT/TMZ approximately week 6 3. Before adjuvant TMZ approximately week 10 4. After 2 cycle of TMZ approximately week 18 5. After 4 cycle of TMZ approximately week 26 6. Three month after last cycle of TMZ Secondary Endpoints 1. Changes in serial T cell subtypes and cytokines levels 2. Incidence of lymphopenia related infections 3. Changes in T-cell numbers and subtypes with TMZ administration 4. Overall survival</detailed_description>
