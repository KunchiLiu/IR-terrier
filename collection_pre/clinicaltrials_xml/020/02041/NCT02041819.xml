	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),has been shown to be effective and safe in some studies with head-neck cancers.Nab-paclitaxel regimen in advanced NSCLC has a better tumor response rate and safety than solvent-based paclitaxel.However,the safety and efficacy of Nimotuzumab plus nab-paclitaxel regimen is uncertain in neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer.The investigators then initiated a phase II clinical trial with Nimotuzumab plus Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to observe the efficacy and safety of the combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Nimotuzumab Plus Nab-Paclitaxel in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past decade, clinical trials have evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, or both, for patients with surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma, but have all failed to demonstrate a consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, preoperative chemotherapy followed by radical surgery became one of the treatment strategies for resectable, clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of Nimotuzumab plus Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin as perioperative therapy for patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
