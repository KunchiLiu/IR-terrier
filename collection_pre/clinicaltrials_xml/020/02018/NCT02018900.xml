	<brief_summary>In the present pilot study, the investigators will study the effects of a novel synbiotic, which is a mix of probiotics (Ecologic 825) in the presence of a prebiotic (short chain fructo-oligosaccharide (scFOS)), on mucosal integrity, overall microbiota changes along the gastrointestinal-tract and the mucosal immune response. The investigators hypothesize that the synbiotic Ecologic 825/scFOS will significantly affect the intestinal permeability and modulate the immune system in humans.</brief_summary>
