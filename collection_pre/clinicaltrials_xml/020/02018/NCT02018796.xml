	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted in 4 sites and will examine how a simplified outpatient medical abortion procedure using mifepristone and misoprostol, with the option to take mifepristone at a place of woman's choosing, works in Kazakhstan. The investigators intend to demonstrate the efficacy of oral administration of 200 mg mifepristone and sublingual administration of 600 µg misoprostol with gestations through 70 days, as well as the acceptability of this method. Research questions include: 1. What is the efficacy of regimen of 200 mg mifepristone, followed 24 to 48 hours later by 600 µg sublingual misoprostol and used in gestations of up to 70 days? 2. Is medical abortion procedure consisting of two visits acceptable to women in Kazakhstan? 3. Are the side effects associated with sublingual use of misoprostol acceptable to women? 4. When given a choice, do women prefer to take mifepristone in the clinic or at a place of their choosing?</brief_summary>
