	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a first-in-man phase I study that aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 3BNC117 in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects, and its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1, Open Label, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Antiretroviral Activity of 3BNC117</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In preclinical studies carried out in humanized mice and non-human primates, 3BNC117 alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV-1 or SHIV infection and also to sustained suppression of HIV-1 plasma viremia. The aims of this protocol are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of 3BNC117 in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects,and its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected subjects.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Group 1 (HIVuninfected): Adult males and females, age 18 to 65 Amenable to HIV risk reduction counseling and agrees to maintaining behavior consistent with low risk of HIV exposure; If a sexually active male or female, participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, agrees to use an effective method of contraception throughout the study.

Group 4 ART treated with HIV1 RNA plasma level of &gt; 20 copies/ml by standard assays on 2 occasions, at least 1 week apart, while on combination antiretroviral therapy; Groups 5A and 5B ART treated with HIV1 RNA plasma level of &lt; 20 copies/ml by standard assays on 2 occasions, at least 1 week apart, while on combination antiretroviral therapy; Current CD4 cell count &gt; 300 cells/µl If sexually active male and female, participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, agrees to use an effective method of contraception throughout the study. Exclusion criteria: Group 1 (HIVuninfected): Confirmed HIV1 or HIV2 infection; History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease; use of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the trial physician within the last 6 months; Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation; Within the 12 months prior to enrollment, the volunteer has a history of sexually transmitted disease; Hepatitis B (surface antigen, HbsAg) or hepatitis C (HCV antibodies); Laboratory abnormalities in the parameters listed below: Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 2,000 Hemoglobin ≤ 12 gm/dL if female; ≤ 13.5 gm/dL if male Platelet count ≤ 140,000 ALT ≥ 1.25 x ULN AST ≥ 1.25 x ULN Total bilirubin ≥ 1.1 ULN Creatinine ≥ 1.1 x ULN Coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, INR) ≥ 1.1 x ULN Pregnancy or breastfeeding; Any vaccination within 14 days prior to 3BNC117 administration; Receipt of any experimental HIV vaccine in the past or monoclonal antibody therapy of any kind in the past; Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or within past 12 weeks, or expected participation during this study. Groups 25 (HIVinfected): History of AIDSdefining illness History of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the trial physician within the last 6 months; Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition, other than HIV infection, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation; Hepatitis B (surface antigen, HbsAg) or hepatitis C (HCV antibodies); Laboratory abnormalities in the parameters listed below: Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,300 Hemoglobin ≤ 10 gm/dL Platelet count ≤ 125,000 ALT ≥ 2.0 x ULN AST ≥ 2.0 x ULN Total bilirubin ≥ 1.1 ULN Creatinine ≥ 1.1 x ULN Coagulation parameters ≥ 1.1 x ULN; Current antiretroviral regimen includes either maraviroc or enfuvirtide; Pregnancy or breastfeeding; Any vaccination within 14 days prior to 3BNC117 administration; Receipt of any experimental HIV vaccine or monoclonal antibody therapy of any kind in the past; Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or within past 12 weeks, or expected participation during this study.</criteria>
