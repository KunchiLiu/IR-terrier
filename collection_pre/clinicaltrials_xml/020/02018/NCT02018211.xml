	<brief_summary>Numerous techniques are reported to enhance recovery following intense exercise, however there is equivocal support for such claims. A novel technique of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) via the peroneal nerve has been shown to augment limb blood flow which could enhance recovery following exercise. The present study examined the effects of NMES, compared to graduated compression socks on muscle soreness, strength, and markers of muscle damage and inflammation following intense intermittent exercise.</brief_summary>
