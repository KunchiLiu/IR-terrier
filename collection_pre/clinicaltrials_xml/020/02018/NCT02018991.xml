	<brief_summary>The polymers releasing the drug of first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) may induce allergic reactions and inflammation, resulting in late-acquired stent malaposition (LASM) with uncoverage of struts, and risk of stent thrombosis. The incidence and predictors of LASM in DES with newer-generation polymers designed to improve biocompatibility are unknown.</brief_summary>
