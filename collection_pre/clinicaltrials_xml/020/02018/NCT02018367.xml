	<brief_summary>The overall goal of the study is to determine whether imaging with the low-cost High Resolution Microendoscope(HRME) will increase the efficiency and yield of the current standard of endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus. We believe the HRME will provide an in-vivo "optical biopsy" that will be comparable to gold standard histopathology and allow the endoscopist to make a more informed decision about whether to obtain a biopsy or even perform endoscopic therapy (i.e. endoscopic mucosal resection, EMR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy, Yield and Clinical Impact of a Low-Cost HRME in the Early Diagnosis of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary outcomes: - the diagnostic yield (defined as the proportion of mucosal biopsy samples with neoplasia) of HRME with directed biopsy - compared to standard white-light endoscopy with 4-quadrant random biopsy (WL) for the diagnosis of BE-associated neoplasia in flat mucosa as well as mucosal lesions - the clinical impact of HRME on the diagnosis and endoscopic surveillance of BE- associated neoplasia - does HRME alter the decision to obtain a mucosal biopsy or perform endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) - the total number of total mucosal biopsies taken per procedure; does HRME alter the number of biopsies necessary? Secondary outcomes: - sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of HRME for the in-vivo diagnosis of neoplasia in a routine surveillance population of patients with BE (using histopathologic diagnosis of mucosal biopsies as the reference standard) - the total procedure time for imaging and mucosal biopsy acquisition of HRME - compared with WL, stratified by length of BE (&lt; 3 cm and &gt; 3cm)</detailed_description>
