	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to investigate an attention training program for participants with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The attention training consists of a modified dot probe task with picture stimuli related to washing and checking paired with neutral pictures. Participants are randomly assigned to an experimental and a placebo-control group. After a minimum of 4 weeks of attention training we expect to find differences between participants of the experimental and the control group in terms of attention bias, OCD symptoms, anxiety and depression.</brief_summary>
