	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of three desensitizing toothpastes for immediate and intermediate-term relief of CDH, when compared with a control toothpaste. One hundred and thirty-eight hypersensitive teeth were diagnosed and randomized into four groups according to the therapeutic agent of each desensitizing cream tested: 1) strontium acetate and calcium carbonate, 2) calcium carbonate and arginine 8%, 3) calcium phosphate nanoparticles and 4) a control toothpaste. The desensitizing creams were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cervical dentin hypersensitivity was assessed at baseline, immediately, 24 hours and 30 days after the treatment. Cold and evaporative tests were used to assess the sensitivity level.</brief_summary>
