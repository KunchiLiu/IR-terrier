	<brief_summary>There are a number of powerful anti-HIV drugs, which keep the virus at undetectable levels and enable HIV-infected individuals to live longer. However, some participants taking anti-HIV drugs do not achieve an adequate CD4 recovery and remain at risk for developing AIDS and non-AIDS-related complications. ER niacin (PrNiaspanFCT®) is an extended-released form of niacin, also known as vitamin B3. Niacin is effective in reducing cholesterol levels in the blood. This drug has been known for a long-time to treat dyslipidemia and it is used to improve favourably all the lipoprotein risk factors for artherosclerotic disease, particularly in HIV-infected patients. Recent scientific research shows that regular consumption of niacin-rich foods may also provide protection against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline. The purpose of this study is to find out: 1. If ER niacin combined with anti-HIV drugs, compared with anti-HIV drugs alone, could reduce T cell immune activation and enhance CD4 recovery; 2. If ER niacin can improve your quality of life and your neurocognitive functions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Niacin on Immune Activation : a Proof-of-concept Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective • To assess the impact of extended-release niacin (ER niacin) supplementation + antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to ART alone on T-cell immune activation as defined by CD8CD38 percentage Secondary objectives - To assess the change in total CD4 T-cell count after ER niacin administration - To explore the effect of ER niacin on regulatory T-cells (Th-17/Treg) in blood and gut mucosa samples - To explore the effect of ER niacin on cytokines and inflammatory markers such as INF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, D-dimers, usCRP and LPS - To assess the influence of ER niacin on tryptophan (Trp) plasmatic levels - To assess changes in cholesterol and triglycerides - To explore ER niacin tolerance - To evaluate the impact of ER niacin on quality of life (QoL), fatigue, depression, and neurocognitive scores Population: All participants will have an undetectable HIV viral load (&lt; 50 copies/mL) for at least 3 months, current CD4 cell count of &lt; 350 cells/µL and be receiving ART for at least the previous 12 months. Sample size: N=20</detailed_description>
