	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes (failure, function, strength, range of motion and quality of life) between patients who receive the usual anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery and patients who receive anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery with a lateral extra-articular tenodesis (extra tendon repair on the outside of the knee). Some studies have shown high graft failure rates (ACL re-tear) in young individuals who return to pivoting contact sports following ACL reconstruction. This study is designed to look at whether or not adding this extra tendon repair reduces the risk of graft failure in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard ACL Reconstruction vs ACL + Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a pragmatic study for a parallel groups, randomized clinical trial in which 600 patients with anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency who are undergoing surgery, are randomly allocated to either ACL reconstruction alone (control) or ACL reconstruction with lateral extra-articular tenodesis (experimental). Surgeons, data collectors, and the data analyst will be blind to group allocation. The primary outcome is rate of failure. Secondary outcomes include disease specific quality of life, return to function and sport. Patients are followed for two years postoperative.</detailed_description>
