	<brief_summary>The present study aims to evaluate the effect of phototherapy with the combination of different sources of light on pain, activity of temporal and masseter muscles, bilateral and joint mobility in subjects with TMD. It will be made a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trial. Individuals participate with myogenic temporomandibular disorder, being allocated into 4 groups randomly and stratified by the method of sealed envelopes. The results will be evaluated using: RDC/TMD, digital caliper, electromyography, and visual analog scale and algometry. The protocols will be used in a single session and will be evaluated in four different moments. The variables that will be investigated are pain, muscle activity and joint mobility. The analyses of the data will be performed by adopting a significance level of 5%.</brief_summary>
