	<brief_title>The Effect of Oral Administration of 9-cis Rich Powder of the Alga Dunaliella Bardawil on Visual Functions in Adolescent Patients With Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetically disease consisting of progressive retinal degeneration starting in the rods. Its prevalence is 1:4000 people and is the fourth most common blinding disease in Israel in 2004 [7% of all blindness]. The investigators treated a non-progressive form of the disease [Fundus Albipunctatus] by oral therapy of the food supplement made from alga Dunaliella Bardawil composed of approximately 50% 9-cis β-carotene. The 9-cis β -carotene has been shown to be a precursor of 9-cis retinoic acid both in-vitro in human intestinal mucosa and in-vivo in a ferret, perfused with 9-cis b-carotene. The night vision, as measured objectively by electroretinography (ERG) more than doubled in six patients tested following treatment. The visual field was also improved significantly. In a more recent study the investigators treated 29 retinitis pigmentosa patients with the 9-cis b Carotene algae Dunaliella Bardawil in a double masked placebo control cross over trial. Significant improvement in retinal function was recorded in 34% of the patients. As a natural extension of this study we will perform a double-masked, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study for adolescent patients. Longer treatment duration will be tested: a 24 week treatment with either the 9-cis β-carotene-rich capsules or placebo followed by an additional a 24 week treatment with the other capsules and a wash-out period of 24 weeks between this two type of treatments. We predict that with this study design a maximal/increased therapeutic effect as well as efficient washout will be achieved.</detailed_description>
