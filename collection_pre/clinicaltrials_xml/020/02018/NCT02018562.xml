	<brief_summary>Verbal communication is vital to critically ill mechanically ventilated patient's quality of life (Hess, 2005). Patients who have a tracheostomy tube may be able to communicate using a speaking valve, however, some patients may not be able to tolerate cuff deflation for use of speaking valve. There are talking tracheostomy tubes that do not require cuff deflation to facilitate speech in this population. Unfortunately, not all candidates are offered these options due to lack of awareness. Recently, at our institution, there has been an increase in the use of these tubes to facilitate speech. One of the talking tracheotomy tubes that has proven to be effective is the Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid (BLUSA). In 2010, we conducted a retrospective review of 4 cases and found that BLUSA tracheostomy helped facilitate communication in this unique population (IRB #: NA_00041547). We would now like to formally conduct a prospective pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of measuring outcomes of patients with a BLUSA using a pretest-posttest research design. Communication empowers patients and allows healthcare staff to obtain a more accurate assessment of patients' condition and tailor care accordingly. Identifying the predictors of speech intelligibility and the impact of BLUSA on quality of life will promote communication between patients and healthcare providers. Study Hypothesis: Determine the impact of a talking tracheostomy tube on quality of life in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the hospital.</brief_summary>
