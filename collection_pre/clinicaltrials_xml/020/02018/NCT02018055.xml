	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in stabilized patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with ticagrelor. In this study, 3,288 patients with AMI who underwent PCI with DES and took dual antiplatelet therapy as aspirin and ticagrelor during 1 month from index PCI will be randomized to aspirin and ticagrelor versus aspirin and clopidogrel during 11 months.</brief_summary>
