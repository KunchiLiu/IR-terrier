	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine if an alternative energy source will impact brain metabolism in a disorder characterized by glucose metabolism failure in the brain. The central hypothesis tested in this investigation is whether circumventing impaired glucose metabolism is feasible, safe and potentially promising by supplying anaplerotic precursors through metabolism of odd-carbon fatty acids that can enter the citric acid cycle (CAC) through alternative metabolic pathways.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Triheptanoin, a nutritional supplement long used in other metabolic disorders and also added to foods and cosmetics, will be used to complement any diet that G1D patients may be receiving at enrollment with the exception of the ketogenic diet.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or Female Ages 1 month to &lt;21 years of age Diagnosed with glucose transporter type I deficiency. Age matched (within 1 year) controls not diagnosed with G1D. All subjects carrying body metal implants incompatible with the exposure to a magnetic field Subjects unable to tolerate the MRI and MRS procedures due to anxiety Subjects receiving oxygen supplementation or those confined to a bed or stretcher Subjects currently receiving a ketogenic diet, due to a high risk of seizure recurrence while transitioning off ketosis. Patients behaviorally unable to hold still for imaging procedures (rather than limited by seizure activity) will be excluded.</criteria>
