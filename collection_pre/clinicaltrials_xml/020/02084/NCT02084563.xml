	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence and prognostic impact of the most common genetic abnormalities in patients with Myeloid Neoplasms, including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN), Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Myeloproliferative/Myelodysplastic Neoplasms. Patients will have samples of blood and/or bone marrow collected and sent to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for analysis and storage. Patients with a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia will be treated according to an uniform protocol.</brief_summary>
