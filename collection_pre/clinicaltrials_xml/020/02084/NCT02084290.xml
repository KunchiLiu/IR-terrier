	<brief_summary>Specific Aim: Study the impact of the Crohn's Disease Shared Decision Making Program on patients' treatment choice, persistence with chosen therapy, decision quality, cost of care, and outcomes Hypothesis: The Crohn's Disease Shared Decision Making Program will help patients understand which treatments are right for them and will lead to a higher acceptance of appropriate therapy, improved persistence with chosen therapy, lower costs and improved clinical outcomes. To accomplish this aim, Investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial to: 1. Determine how the shared decision making program influences patients' choice of therapy 2. Evaluate how the shared decision making program affects persistence with chosen therapy 3. Determine how the shared decision making program affects decision quality 4. Determine how the shared decision making program influences cost of care and clinical outcomes Expected Outcome and Impact: Investigators expect that this program will influence patients' choice of therapy, persistence with their preferred therapy, and lead to improved clinical outcomes. Investigators believe that this product can be successfully operationalized in the clinic to establish a new paradigm of how providers can communicate personalized treatment options to patients across a broad range of diseases.</brief_summary>
