	<brief_summary>After a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) people often report balance problems. At Parkwood hospital we have noticed that balance is improved when patients with mTBI wear a weighted compression vest. This follow up pilot study looks at the immediate effects of weighted compression vests on participants with altered balance after mTBI. Participants will be recruited from the Ministry of Health Outpatient Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Program wait list. Then each participant will perform a series of balance and walking tests under 2 conditions : 1) wearing a weighted compression vest , 2) not wearing a weighted compression vest. It will be randomized whether participants wear the vest on the first or second testing day. Participants will also be asked how confident they are about their balance and how anxious they felt performing the assessments after each testing session. We hypothesize that the weighted compression vest will improve fatigue and anxiety immediately and 24 hours after performing a complex task, and will improve static and dynamic balance, gait variability, and walking speed in patients with mTBI, during the tasks.</brief_summary>
