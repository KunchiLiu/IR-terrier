	<brief_title>Effects of Berberine Hydrochloride and Bifidobacterium in Diabetes Mellitus Prevention and Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gut microbiota maybe play an important role in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Berberine, which is usually used as an antibiotic drug, has been reported a potential glucose-lowering effect in vitro and in vivo studies. Bifidobacterium, as a familiar probiotics, can modulate gut microbiota and improve glucose and lipid metabolism in animal experiments. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium Hydrochloride and Berberine on lowering glucose in patients with T2DM and to detect the potential mechanism.</detailed_description>
