	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works compared to standard-of-care PET-computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing patients with cancer, cardiac diseases, or neurologic diseases. PET-MRI combines two imaging methods that can be used to evaluate disease. PET-MRI is similar to standard-of-care PET-CT, but exposes the patient to less radiation. It is not yet known whether PET-MRI produces better image quality than PET-CT in diagnosing patients with cancer, cardiac disease, or neurologic disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess and optimize image quality of PET and MRI focusing on technical artifacts and their correction. II. To assess the accuracy of PET quantification based on MR attenuation correction (MRAC) derived from various MRI sequences and reconstruction algorithms including the effect of routinely used Gadolinium-based contrast agents on MRAC. III. To determine the clinical and diagnostic accuracy of PET-MRI in comparison to standard-of-care diagnostic imaging. IV. To assess the efficacy and workflow in combining PET and MRI in one single examination as compared to separate imaging studies. V. To assess the potential for radiation dose reduction if PET-CT is substituted by PET-MRI, thus avoiding the radiation exposure from the CT-component.</detailed_description>
