	<brief_summary>Aqueous (EUA) cream, cetomacrogol (CMG) and emulsifying ointment (HEB) are in South Africa's essential drug list (EDL) but are not available to most rural patients. To assess whether accessible moisturizers can be used as alternatives in atopic eczema (AD), a randomized controlled trial of patients with mild-to-moderate AD, aged 1-12 years was conducted. Two separate sub-studies were conducted using a randomized controlled single (assessor) blind trial design. Study 1 compared UEA vs. liquid paraffin (unscented baby oil) for baths, all patients used HEB as moisturiser. In Study 2, 4 moisturisers were compared -HEB, CMG, petroleum jelly and petroleum jelly/Glycerine (2:1). Assessments (SCORAD, POEM, NESS and IQDOL) carried out at baseline, week 4, 8 and 12. Routine topical steroids and antihistamines were continued as prescribed.</brief_summary>
