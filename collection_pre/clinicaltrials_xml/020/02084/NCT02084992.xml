	<brief_summary>This study will randomize participants with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure and at least one risk factor for hospitalization to either a tablet computer and web based disease management program or a telephone based disease management program. Both interventions are home based with heart failure education and symptom monitoring provided by nurse managers. The nurse managers are in close communication with both the participants and the participants' physicians . The components of the disease management program have been developed at Tufts Medical Center and the New England Quality Care Alliance with studies showing improved clinical outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations. The goal of this study is to transition this successful home monitoring and disease management program to a table computer and web-based implementation to both improve clinical outcomes (reducing hospitalizations and improving self-perceived health status) and improve provider-patient satisfaction. We hypothesize that the tablet computer based disease management will decrease heart failure hospitalizations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients age ≥ 18 with a primary care provider or specialist that is participating within the Collaborative Health ACO. 2. Patient able to consent 3. A diagnosis of heart failure with at least one of the following risk factors: Hospitalization for heart failure within the prior year NYHA class IIIIV symptoms Most recent BNP ≥ 300 pg/mL (or NtproBNP ≥ 600 pg/mL) as long as within 90 days prior to enrollment 1. Acute myocardial infarction, PCI or CABG within 30 days before enrollment 2. Planned revascularization procedures, cardiac mechanical support implantation, cardiac transplantation, or other cardiac surgery within 30 days following study randomization. 3. Illness other than heart failure deemed the principal limitation to life expectancy or principal cause of disability 4. Severe angina as the principal cause of limitation 5. Uncorrected valvular disease, except where valvular regurgitation was considered to be secondary to severe left ventricular dilation, or where surgical correction is deemed excessively risky or declined by the patient. 6.
