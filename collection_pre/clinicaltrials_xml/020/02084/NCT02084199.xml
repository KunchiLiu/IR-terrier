	<brief_summary>This will be an open label study to assess the influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GLPG0634 and its metabolite after once daily oral administrations of 100 mg GLPG0634 for 10 days in subjects with renal impairment and matched healthy controls. Also, safety and tolerability of once daily oral doses of GLPG0634 for 10 days in subjects with renal impairment and matched healthy controls will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate GLPG0634 in Subjects With Renal Impairment Compared to Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be divided in two parts. In Part 1, 3 subjects with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not yet requiring dialysis (Group 1) will be recruited first. Thereafter, 3 subjects with normal renal function (Group 2) will be recruited. If a substantial effect on the PK in renal impaired subjects is observed on Day 10, the sponsor may elect to stop Part 1 of the study without enrolling the complete set of subjects and Part 2 will be initiated. In case no substantial effect on the PK is observed, 3 further subjects in both Group 1 and 2 will be recruited and analysed. If a substantial effect on the PK is observed, the study will proceed to Part 2. Part 2 of the study will not be conducted, if in Part 1 no substantial difference in PK is seen. In Part 2, Group 3 (mild renal impairment) and Group 4 (moderate renal impairment) will be recruited first. After completion of the mild and moderate impairment groups, Group 5 (normal renal function) will be recruited.</detailed_description>
