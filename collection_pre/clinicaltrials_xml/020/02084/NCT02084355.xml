	<brief_summary>Although opioid rotation is well known treatment modality in reducing pain and opioid-induced neurotoxicity, it is not established whether opioid rotation is more appropriate or opioid escalation is more effective in controlling significant pain in cancer patients under opioid medication. - The purpose of this study is to determine effective therapy out of opioid rotation and opioid dose escalation in patients with moderate to severe cancer pain who have been already treated with strong opioid.</brief_summary>
