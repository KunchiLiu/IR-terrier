	<brief_summary>PCOS is a common endocrinopathy affecting 5-10% of women in their reproductive age characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries. This syndrome is a serious problem in IVF since there is a high risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. The introduction of GnRH antagonist in IVF has reduced the incidence of severe OHSS, still maintaining a good ovarian response and pregnancy rate. Recently, a long acting GnRH antagonist, Degarelix, was introduced for prostatic cancer treatment. Furthermore a recent paper reported its use also for the induction of multiple follicular growth in a program of oocyte donation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of GnRH antagonist depot use in a protocol of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in PCOS women at risk of developing OHSS in IVF cycles.</brief_summary>
