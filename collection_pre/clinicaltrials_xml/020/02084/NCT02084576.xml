	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Efficacy for Prophylaxis of Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) After Phacoemulsification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized clinical trial study included patients older than 40 years with age-related cataract, and a normal ophthalmologic examination besides senile cataract. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery, central endothelial cell count less than 2000 cells/mm2, glaucoma or intraocular pressure greater than 21 mmHg, amblyopia, retinal abnormalities, steroid or immunosuppressive treatment, connective tissue diseases, or an allergy or hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. Enrolled patients who had complicated cataract surgery (eg, posterior capsule rupture, vitreous loss, or an intraocular lens not placed in the capsular bag) were subsequently excluded. Study Protocol Preoperatively, patients had an extensive ophthalmologic examination, including measurement of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refraction, slitlamp examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy, corneal endothelial cell count by noncontact specular microscopy (Noncon Robo, Konan), central corneal thickness (CCT) measurement (Pentacam, Oculus, Inc.), and biometry with the IOLMaster partial coherence interferometry device (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). The targeted postoperative refractive error was 0.0 D. The visual acuity measurements were recorded with logMAR UDVA and CDVA. In addition, a baseline spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) scan was performed before surgery and postoperatively after 1, 4 and 12 weeks. All SD-OCT imaging was performed with a spectral-domain Heidelberg Spectralis OCT devise (Heidelberg Engineering, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany). Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ration to 1 of 2 treatments groups using a computer-generated randomization list. The study medications were ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% (Acular LS, Allergan) in group 1, and nepafenac 0.1% (Nevanac, Alcon) in group 2. Patients were instructed to instill ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% 1 drop in the operative eye 4 times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bedtime), and nepafenac 0.1% 1 drop 3 times a day.</detailed_description>
