	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize, that non-optimally treated carbohydrate counting-na√Øve patients with type 1 diabetes can achieve better metabolic control by counting carbohydrates, and that the metabolic control can be further improved with concurrent use of Accu-Chek Aviva Expert. Additionally, the investigators propose that carbohydrate counting will lead to better quality of life as a result of fewer restrictions when eating and less variation in blood glucose. Finally the investigators hypothesize that the use of Accu-Chek Aviva Expert will lead to fewer hypoglycemic episodes.</brief_summary>
