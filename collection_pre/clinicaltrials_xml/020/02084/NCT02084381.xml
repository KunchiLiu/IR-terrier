	<brief_summary>The medium cut-off dialysis membrane has been developed to provide a significantly extended molecular cut-off compared to conventional high-flux membranes. The medium cut-off membrane allows for a high permeability of molecules up to a molecular weight of 45 kDa and has a still limited permeability for albumin (68 kDa). The main goal of this project is the evaluation of the new, highly porous and selective dialysis membrane (MCO-Ci 400) for the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease in hemodialysis mode and to study its potential to improve chronic inflammation.</brief_summary>
