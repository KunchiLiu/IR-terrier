	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center study involving babies 0-2 months of age who have liver problems (pathology) and need to have their liver and possibly, the bile ducts imaged using magnetic resonance imaging and injection of a contrast agent (dye). This agent is called Eovist. It has been marketed since 2004 and used in many countries all over the world. The baby will have blood tests before and after the imaging is done to make sure that there are no unexpected findings before and after the imaging. Also 3 blood samples up to 8 hours after the injection will be obtained in order to measure how much of the dye is in the blood. The baby will have an intravenous line which can be used for the blood samples and will not need to be stick for the blood samples. Several radiologists will evaluate the images. The family doctor will be contacted to find out what was the diagnosis and treatment after the results of the MRI were known. Six months after the study, the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be contacted to make sure the that baby did not have any problems, especially with the skin, joints and eyes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order to minimize bias in assessment of the images, blinded reading of the MR images will be performed by 2 blinded readers. The blinded readers will be independent board-certified pediatric radiologists who have no knowledge about the subjects and are not affiliated with any of the clinical sites.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 02 months (must be gestational age 37 to 41 weeks) Scheduled to undergo routine contrastenhanced liver MRI Able to comly with the study procedures Scheduled for any intervention (except lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration) during the study period If receiving chemotherapy, may have a change in treatment during the study period Contraindication for MRI Renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 80% of ageadjusted normal mean value using the Schwartz formula) Acute renal failure Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory parameter, ie, greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, in particular, liver enzymes and renal function. (Note: if elevations in liver enzyme levels are consistent with the underlying hepatobiliary disease, then the subject may be enrolled.)</criteria>
