	<brief_summary>Intraoperative administration of tranexamic acid (TXA,T) reduces significantly blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during spinal posterior fusion in adolescents with scoliosis. TXA acts mainly by inhibit the plasminogen activator. Desmopressin (DDAVP ,D) can inhibit the fibrinolytic activity by inducing the release of von Willebrand factor from the endothelial cells. But at the same time, it releases tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which may cripple its hemostatic effect. The investigators supposed that if the investigators combine TXA with DDAVP in scoliosis correction surgery, the blood loss and the transfusion need would be reduced significantly.</brief_summary>

TXA acts mainly by inhibit the plasminogen activator. Desmopressin (DDAVP ,D) can inhibit the fibrinolytic activity by inducing the release of von Willebrand factor from the endothelial cells. But at the same time, it releases tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which may cripple its hemostatic effect. The investigators designed a a randomized double-blind clinical combining TXA with DDAVP in scoliosis correction surgery to observe if the blood loss and the transfusion need would be reduced or not.</detailed_description>
