	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing EUS-Guided cystgastrostomy or cystduodenostomy and endoscopic necrosectomy to minimally invasive surgical necrosectomy, in patients with symptomatic or infected WOPN.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Surgery vs. Endoscopy Randomized (MISER) Trial for Symptomatic Walled-Off Pancreatic Necrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly allocated to either treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio. Following intervention, patients will be assessed at regular intervals intil study completion at 6 months post-discharge. Primary outcome is a composite of major complications or mortality, measured to 3 months post-discharge.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Necrosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Walled off pancreatic necrosis Symptomatic: Pain, gastric outlet, intestinal or biliary obstruction, newonset or persisting organ failure, or 'persisting unwellness'. Infected (suspected and confirmed): clinical signs of infection (septic, positive blood cultures, febrile), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gas within the collection on imaging (not iatrogenic), or positive culture of collection contents Necrotic collection has developed a wall, typically around 4 weeks post presentation, and is within 15mm of the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Informed consent obtained from the patient or their medical representative. &gt; 18 years old Medically fit for general anesthetic Collection amenable to either endoscopic or minimally invasive surgical necrosectomy and drainage. &lt;18 years old Unable to obtain informed consent from the patient or their medical representative. Medically unfit for general anesthesia Pregnant WOPN collection not accessible by either or both necrosectomy techniques. The collection has not matured and developed a wall, or is &gt;15mm from the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Irreversible coagulopathy: INR &gt;1.5 Irreversible thrombocytopenia: platelet count &lt;50 x109/L, thrombocytopenia confirmed by manual count. Dual antiplatelet therapy or therapeutic anticoagulation that cannot be withheld for the procedure Surgical or endoscopic necrosectomy or pseudocyst drainage has been performed within the preceding 12 months WOPN secondary to trauma or other surgical event that requires additional interventions such as management of liver lacerations or vascular injury.</criteria>
