	<brief_summary>The aim of this research is to assess current care by studying macular function using microperimetry and by then comparing visual acuity results with OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) data. The examinations performed are those usually done in the follow-up of epiretinal membrane surgery, apart from microperimetry which is an examination of the central visual field. Patients who undergo ERM surgery usually have a follow-up examination at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the surgery. The consultation includes an assessment of visual acuity, a fundus examination an SD-OCT of the retina. The present protocol will require no additional visits. The microperimetry will be done in addition to the usual follow-up examinations after ERM surgery.</brief_summary>
