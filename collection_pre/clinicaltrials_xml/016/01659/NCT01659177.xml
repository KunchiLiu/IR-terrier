	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the effect of food on absorption of LY2140023 in blood. This study involves a single dose of 80 mg LY2140023 taken as a tablet by mouth on 2 occasions, once on an empty stomach and once after eating breakfast. There is a minimum 3 day washout between doses. This study will last approximately 16 days not including screening. Screening is required within 30 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of LY2140023 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Are healthy males or females, as determined by medical history and physical examination Male participants agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of LY2140023, and agree not to donate sperm for 3 months following the last dose of LY2140023 Female participants: of childbearing potential, who test negative for pregnancy at screening and who agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of LY2140023 of nonchildbearing potential i.e. postmenopausal or permanently sterile following hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or confirmed tubal occlusion (not tubal ligation). Postmenopausal is defined as spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 12 months, and a plasma folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 milliinternational units per milliliter (mIU/mL), unless the participant is taking hormone replacement therapy have given written informed consent approved by Lilly and the chosen ethical review board (ERB) Are currently enrolled in, have completed or discontinued within the last 90 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product other than the investigational product used in this study; or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have known allergies to LY2140023 or LY404039, related compounds, activated charcoal, or any components of the formulation Are persons who have previously withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating LY2140023 after receiving at least 1 dose of LY2140023 Show evidence or any history of significant active neuropsychiatric disease (for example, manic depressive illness, schizophrenia, depression) Have increased risk of seizures based on a history of: one or more seizures (except for a single simple febrile seizure [lacking focality and lasting less than 15 minutes, not associated with a central nervous system (CNS) infection or severe metabolic disturbance] as a child between ages 6 months to 5 years) head trauma with loss of consciousness or a postconcussive syndrome within 1 year or lifetime history of head trauma with persistent neurological deficit (focal or diffuse) CNS infection, uncontrolled migraine or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 year; stroke with persistent neurological deficit (focal or diffuse), uncontrolled migraine is defined as migraine attacks that produce headache lasting up to 72 hours and are often accompanied by associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia) that impair wellbeing and disrupt social functioning. TIA is defined as "ministroke" caused by temporary disturbance of blood supply to an area of the brain, which results in a sudden, brief decrease in brain function CNS infection with persistent neurological deficit (focal or diffuse) brain surgery electroencephalogram (EEG) with paroxysmal (epileptiform) activity (isolated spikes waves, repetitive bursts of sharp waves, paroxysmal activity, frank seizures, spikewave complexes, or sharpslow wave complexes, or as locally defined) brain structural lesion, including developmental abnormalities, as determined by examination or imaging studies (except hydrocephalus treated by shunt and without neurological deficit) Show evidence of active renal disease (for example, diabetic renal disease, polycystic kidney disease) or creatinine clearance less than 90 milliliters per minute (mL/min) as determined by the Cockroft Gault formula Show evidence or any history of known substance dependence or abuse at any time (according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSMIV] diagnosis), or regularly use known drugs of abuse and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening Have a clinically significant abnormality in the neurological examination Participants judged prior to randomization to be at suicidal risk by the investigator</criteria>
