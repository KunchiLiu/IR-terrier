	<brief_title>Low Energy Dense, Weight Maintenance, Risk of Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies introduced different dietary interventions for weight loss maintenance. Besides the debate on low fat or low carbohydrate diets, focusing on some food groups including fruits, vegetables and low fat dairies in the diet may be helpful for weight maintenance. However, energy intake is the key factor of weight maintenance. Energy intake will decrease by reducing energy density (ED) of a diet without producing short-term calorie restriction or feeling hunger. There are several studies which showed the beneficial effects of low energy density diets on weight reduction. However, few studies discuses regarding the effects of such diets on weight maintenance.</detailed_description>
