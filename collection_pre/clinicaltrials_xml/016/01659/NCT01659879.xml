	<detailed_description>The intervention website www.syktbarn.no is an open Norwegian online resource for parents of small children, and the site contains videos, audio clips, animations, illustrations, pictures and text materials regarding children's illnesses and normal development. In addition, the parents can use an interactive symptom checker that will help them to decide what to do and when to seek medical advice when their child is sick. The uniqueness of the website is the authentic video clips of sick children with common childhood symptoms like breathing difficulties, signs of dehydration, rash, cough and fever.</detailed_description>
