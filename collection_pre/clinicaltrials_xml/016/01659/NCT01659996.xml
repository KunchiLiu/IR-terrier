	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to further characterize the safety and immunogenicity of Menactra® in the population &lt;2 years of age when administered alone and when the second dose is administered concomitantly with the 4th dose of Pentacel®, a licensed pediatric vaccine. Primary Objectives: - To evaluate and compare the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 induced by 2 injections of Menactra® in subjects aged 9 months at the first vaccination visit and 15 to 18 months at the second vaccination visit. - To evaluate and compare the antibody responses to Pertussis (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN]) antigens induced by a dose of Pentacel® when administered concomitantly with Menactra® to those elicited by a dose of Pentacel® administered alone. - To evaluate and compare the antibody responses to polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), tetanus and diphtheria antigens induced by a dose of Pentacel® when administered concomitantly with Menactra® to those elicited by a dose of Pentacel® alone. Observational Objectives: - To describe the safety profile (immediate unsolicited AEs within 30 minutes of each trial vaccination, solicited reactions within 7 days of each vaccination, unsolicited AEs within 30 days of each vaccination, and serious adverse events [SAEs] throughout the course of the trial from Day 0 up to Day 30 after the last trial vaccination[s]) in all trial groups - To describe the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135, measured by SBA HC, 30 days after the second Menactra® administration - To describe the antibody responses to Pentacel® (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, PRP) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), or functional assays.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 9 months (249 to 305 days) for Groups 1 and 2, or 15 to 18 months (420 to 570 days) for Group 3 on the day of the first trial visit Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative Received 3 doses of any DTaPcontaining vaccines Received 3 doses of a Hibcontaining vaccine, or 2 doses if the subject received PRPOMP (PedvaxHIB® or Comvax®[HepBHib]) Received at least 3 doses of a CRM197based pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV] or 13Valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]) Subject and parent/ legally acceptable representative are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding each trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following each trial vaccination, except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before or after the trial vaccination(s) Vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine, or receipt of the 4th dose of any DTaPcontaining vaccines, receipt of the 4th dose of a Hibcontaining vaccine, or receipt of the 3rd dose of PRPOMP (PedvaxHIB® or Comvax® [Hep BHib]) prior to enrollment or during the conduction of the trial, except for Group 1 subjects, who may receive Hib vaccine at 12 months Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months). Topical steroids are not included in this exclusion criterion History of invasive meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically Personal history of GuillainBarré Syndrome History of encephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days of a previous dose of a pertussis containing vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable cause Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to one of the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Known thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/ legally acceptable representative, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination In an emergency setting or hospitalized involuntarily Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/ infection (according to investigator judgment) or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [≥ 38.0°C]) on the day of vaccination. A prospective subject should not be included in the trial until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to any trial blood draw (topical antibiotics, drops, or ointments are not included in this criterion) Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed trial.</criteria>
