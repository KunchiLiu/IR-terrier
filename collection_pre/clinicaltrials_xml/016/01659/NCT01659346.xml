	<brief_summary>Every patient with HCC (Hepato-Cellular Carcinoma) with main portal vein thrombosis will be screened for presence of large esophageal varices and will be randomized between non-selective beta blocker versus primary endoscopic variceal ligation. They will be followed to assess the rate of reduction of index bleed rate as well as survival difference between the groups.</brief_summary>
