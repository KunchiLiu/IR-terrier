	<brief_title>A Phase 2, Single-Arm, Open-Label Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Single Agent GS 1101 (CAL 101) as Therapy for Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, controlled, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3K-delta) inhibitor GS-1101 (CAL-101) as therapy for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This clinical trial (Study GS-US-312-0120) is a single-arm in which compliant subjects from GS US-312-0119 -Arm B who experience progression of CLL while receiving single-agent ofatumumab therapy are potentially eligible to receive single-agent, open-label GS 1101 therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participation in Study GSUS3120119 Occurrence of confirmed progression of CLL while receiving singleagent ofatumumab in Study GS US 312 0119. Permanent cessation of Study GSUS3120119 (singleagent ofatumumab) and no intervening or continuing therapy (including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational therapy) for the treatment of CLL. The time from permanent cessation of singleagent ofatumumab on Study GSUS3120119 and the initiation of GS 1101 on Study GSUS3120120 is no more than 12 weeks.</criteria>
