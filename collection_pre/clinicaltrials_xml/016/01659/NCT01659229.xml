	<brief_summary>The investigators are comparing the range of movements the knees of patients who had total knee replacement surgery for knee osteoarthritis. In the study arm, the implant used was a Sigma Cruciate Retaining (CR) Press Fit Condylar (PFC) 150, which is a high flexion knee system designed to combine function with wear resistance. It can accommodate up to 150 degrees of knee flexion. In the cohort arm, the implant used was the standard Sigma CR which can accommodate up to 120 degrees of flexion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluoroscopic Analysis of PFC CR 150 Versus Standard PFC CR Total Knee Arthroplasty Implants in Deep Flexion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both sets of patients will undergo routine post-operative follow up in clinic. The study involves patients who had their surgery more than 2 years ago. We assess their range of movement using fluoroscopy. They are asked to perform lunges, squats and climbing up and down 3 steps. The fluoroscopic images are then analysed to assess their individual range of movements.</detailed_description>
