	<brief_summary>The insertion of an urinary catheter in a patient undergoing a surgical procedure, especially in urinary interventions, may lead to catheter-related bladder discomfort with varying degrees of severity during the postoperative period. Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) symptoms associated with indwelling urinary catheter are similar to overactive bladder symptoms such as discomfort in the suprapubic region, urinary urgency, frequency, burning sensation with or without urge incontinence. Paracetamol is a drug with proven efficiency for the management of mild and moderate postoperative pain. In this study, the investigators hypothesized to address the effect of single-dose intravenous paracetamol on postoperative CRBD following percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery (PNL).</brief_summary>
