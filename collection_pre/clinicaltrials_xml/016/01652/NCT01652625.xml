	<brief_summary>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common recurrent oral disorder with no curative treatment available to date. The challenge remains in patients that do develop drug resistance and/or secondary infection, although topical corticosteroids and antimicrobials are the first therapeutic choice. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an herbal extract of Yunnan Baiyao formulated in toothpaste as an alternative therapy for minor RAS. Yunnan Baiyao is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, formulated in a powder or capsule form. It was initially and widely used in wounds for its anti-hemorrhagic hemostatic function, and further in gastrointestinal bleeding. Yunnan Baiyao powder has been generally applied on RAS among Chinese population. In this study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (from March 2010 to March 2011) was conducted on a cohort of 227 minor RAS patients. The toothpaste containing Yunnan Baiyao was used twice daily as part of the patient's routine oral hygiene for 5 days. An assessment of ulcerative size and pain was recorded on Day 0 (baseline), Day 3 and Day 5. Any noted adverse reactions were recorded.</brief_summary>
