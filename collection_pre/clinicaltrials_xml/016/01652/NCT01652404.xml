	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to give conclusive evidence on whether serial PCT (Procalcitonin) measurements can facilitate individual decision-making and shorten antibiotic treatment duration in patients with sepsis in the pediatric ICU (Intensive Care Unit).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PROcalcitonin to SHORTen Antibiotics Duration in PEDiatricICU Patients (ProShort-Ped) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators aimed to design a multi-center trial addressing aforementioned flaws. The investigators will set stricter inclusion criteria, collect complete data on relapse or secondary infection, and include sufficient number of patients to show non-inferiority to conventional therapy by a delta margin of 10% [11]. The investigators aimed to give conclusive evidence on whether serial PCT measurements can facilitate individual decision-making and shorten antibiotic treatment duration in patients with sepsis in the pediatric ICU.</detailed_description>
