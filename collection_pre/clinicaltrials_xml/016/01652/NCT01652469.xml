	<brief_summary>Using a laboratory test (VeriStrat), patients with relapsed squamous cell lung cancer are assigned to two strata, VSG (VeriStrat Good) and VSP (VeriStrat Poor). They are then randomized between an EGFR-TK inhibitor (erlotinib) and chemotherapy (Docetaxel). It is hypothesized that the VeriStrat test results are able to predict the benefit of treatment with erlotinib vs docetaxel. This would suggest a significant improvement in progression-free survival for VSG patients when treated with Erlotinib, and no significant improvement in VSP patients who receive the same treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing of Drugs Erlotinib and Docetaxel in Lung Cancer Patients Classified Regarding Their Outlook Using VeriStrat®.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goals of the study: 1. Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature, by testing for interaction between treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B: docetaxel) and VeriStrat status (VSG vs VSP) using as outcome progression free survival. 2. Explore whether treatment with erlotinib provides progression free survival benefit as compared to docetaxel in the VSG group. 3. Compare progression free survival in the two treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B: docetaxel) in the VSP group. 4. Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall difference in progression free survival between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no significant interaction). 5. Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature using the secondary measures of clinical efficacy including overall survival, objective response rate, and disease control rate. 6. Compare overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between treatment groups separately in the VSG and VSP groups. 7. Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall difference in overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no significant interaction). 8. Assess the safety and the tolerability of the two treatments separately in each VeriStrat group and overall. Recruitment period: 18 months Sample Size: 500</detailed_description>

Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study registration. Estimated life expectancy &gt;12 weeks. Patient compliance and geographical proximity that allow adequate followup. Evidence of other medical condition which would impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial or might preclude therapy with trial drugs (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal disease, active infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus). Previous treatment with any EGFRTKI or docetaxel. Documented brain metastases unless the patient has completed local therapy for central nervous system metastases and has been off corticosteroids for at least 14 days prior to study registration. Documented presence of activating EGFR mutations, if the patient was tested for EGFR mutations. Previous malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, breast cancer in situ or localized nonmelanoma skin cancer. Psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information on trial related topics, giving informed consent, or interfering with compliance for oral drug intake. Concurrent treatment with experimental drugs or other anticancer therapy treatment in a clinical trial within 21 days prior to study registration. Known hypersensitivity to trial drugs or hypersensitivity to any other component of the trial drugs or any concomitant drugs contraindicated.</criteria>
