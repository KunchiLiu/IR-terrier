	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to show that doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD)-based response-adapted therapy for advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, with treatment intensification (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPPesc) in case of a positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) after one cycle of ABVD, has non-inferior efficacy compared with the intensive BEACOPPesc regimen. A second objective is to assess the prognostic value of FDG-PET/CT after one cycle of BEACOPPesc.</brief_summary>
