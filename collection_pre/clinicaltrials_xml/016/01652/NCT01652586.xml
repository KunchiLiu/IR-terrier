	<brief_summary>Cardiac ablation is an invasive procedure requiring anesthetic support for immobility and analgesia. Benzodiazepines and opioids are the most commonly used agents, while they are associated with respiratory depression and hypotension. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine, which exerts sedative and analgesic effect without serious respiratory depression, with conventional midazolam/remifentanil combination on sedative and analgesic levels in patients undergoing endocardial ablation.</brief_summary>
