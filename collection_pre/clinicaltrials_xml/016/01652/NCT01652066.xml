	<brief_summary>the aim of the study is to get evidence for an enhancement of immune status in subjects after probiotics mixture consumption ( lactobacillus gasseri PA 16/8, Bifidobacterrium longum SP 07/3, Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5) based on influenza vaccination model - compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of a Mixture of Probiotics on the Antigen Specific Antibody Response in a Influenza Vaccination Model of Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>probiotics are "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host" . many health effects are associated with probiotics , but various degrees of evidence support the benefits associated to probiotics consumption . Impact on defences and the immune system has been shown with several strains and this may result in improved protection against some infections or improvment of vaccine efficacy . In its scientific requirments for health claims related to immune function, EFSA indicates that it is generally accepted that higher vaccination responses are beneficial.</detailed_description>
