	<brief_summary>This open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of MEHD7945A when combined with FOLFIRI (folinic acid [leucovorin], 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], and irinotecan) chemotherapy as compared to cetuximab plus FOLFIRI in participants with Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) wild-type mCRC who have progressed after first-line oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Participants will be randomized to receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy plus either MEHD7945A or cetuximab. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
