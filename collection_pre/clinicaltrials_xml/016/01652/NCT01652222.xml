	<brief_title>Experimental Study to Validate the "Therapeutic Game" CONEM-BETA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically diagnosed based on memory and cognitive deterioration, and the loss of other functional abilities. Nevertheless, for the caregivers and the patients themselves, the psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia (PBSD) are specially relevant aspects. These PBSD are a source of stress for the caregiver. PBSD treatment starts with non-pharmacological treatment, but if the symptomatology is moderate to severe, then pharmacological treatments are indicated on top of the non-pharmacological ones. The symptoms that better respond to non-pharmacological interventions are depression and mild apathy, wanderings and repetitive behaviors. Once dementia progresses, the ability to interact at cognitive and emotional levels are reduced, and then, alternative approaches are needed. In this circumstance, it has been postulated that the caregivers should not try to bring -patients with AD back to the objective reality, but that they should rather empathize with them and establish an emotional connection. This is a complex process, and requires intervention tools that favor this connection and improve the subjective welfare of the caregivers of persons with dementia. The current study is based on a previous experience in implementing the Montessori method at SARquavitae nursing homes and daycare centers. The "therapeutic game" called CONEM-BETA contains a subset of these activities that have been adapted from the original texts from the Myers Research Institute. We aim to prove that CONEM-BETA may have also socio-emotional benefits for the caregivers when they systematically use them at home with their AD relatives. These potential benefits will be assessed by using validated questionnaires that measure changes in subjective welfare, anxiety and depression, coping strategy, overload level and perceived social support.</detailed_description>
