	<criteria>Diagnosis of pediatric glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Qualifying mean IOP at the Eligibility Visit in at least one eye. Written informed consent, including assent when applicable, MUST be obtained from the parent or legally authorized representative prior to any procedure specified in the protocol, including screening procedures. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant during the study period, breast feeding, or not using any form of birth control measures. History of chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease. Ocular trauma requiring medical attention within the past 3 months prior to the Screening Visit. Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease. Severe ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the administration of a topical prostaglandin analog or a topical betablocker. Intraocular surgery in the study eye within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
