	<brief_summary>Researchers from the University of South Florida's Rehabilitation Engineering program are looking for volunteers to participate in a research study for experimental evaluation of wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs). Participants will operate commercially available and developmental WMRAs in a physical test environment. The study will serve to identify desirable design features of WMRAs and input devices so that future production systems may further increase the quality of life of potential users. The study will also promote both the justification of prescribing WMRAs to enhance quality of life through the proposed standard testing method, and awareness for the emerging assistive robotics industry.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experimental Evaluation of Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with injuries or conditions resulting in both upper and lower body disabilities who are power wheelchair-bound are of key interest. The purpose of this study is to experimentally evaluate up to six wheelchair mounted robotic arms (WMRAs). The goal is to quantitatively compare each device. In order to compare each device, patients will be asked to operate one of up to six wheelchair mounted robotic arms at a time. With each WMRA, patients will be asked to perform a series of up to four activities of daily living. patients will be presented with a survey at the conclusion of each task test. The survey is designed to quantitatively rank each WMRA's performance. The time to complete each task with each arm will also be recorded. Patients will be asked some questions such as age, occupation, disability and/or physical limitations, and wheelchair use. Patients will be asked to disclose pertinent medical information to determine their level of mobility. Then the patients and the research team will know whether or not they should be in the study. If they take part in this study, patients will be asked to use a series of devices to control each of the six WMRAs to complete the following tasks: - Open cabinets of varying heights - Open drawers of varying heights - Operate mock sink fixtures - Operate mock light switches - Plug into and out of mock electrical outlets - Open personnel door - Move objects on a table top - Move objects on a book shelf - Move a cup from a table top to the participant's mouth - Perform any of the previous tasks under additional cognitive load * Additional cognitive load may include but is not limited to carrying on a conversation while attempting to perform a given task Patients will be asked to spend about four hours in this study, which will be completed in one session at the Rehabilitation Robotics and Prosthetics Testbed at the University of South Florida. Break and refreshment time will be available during setup and installation time for each of up to six WMRAs. It is anticipated that twenty people will take part in this study at USF. Participants who take part in this study may find quality of life benefits as a result of becoming familiar with WMRA assistive devices. Participants may find using a WMRA helpful in performing activities of daily living, though participants will not be given any of the WMRAs for personal use. The research study is directed at comparing and contrasting commercially available and developmental WMRAs. The study will also help to increase awareness of WMRAs and possibly help develop an assistive manipulator industry in the United States.</detailed_description>
