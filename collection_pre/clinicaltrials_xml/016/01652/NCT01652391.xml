	<brief_summary>Insufficient cognitive control over emotional distracters is characteristic for major depressive disorder (MDD). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is associated with this deficit. In this study the investigators assess the effect of an enhancement of dlPFC activity in MDD patients by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive control. In a double-blinded, balanced randomized, sham-controlled crossover trial the investigators determine the effect of a single-session tDCS to the left dlPFC on cognitive control in MDD patients and healthy controls. To assess the cognitive control the investigators use a delayed response working memory (DWM) task with pictures of varying valence presented during the delay period.</brief_summary>
