	<brief_title>Plasma Cystatin C and Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective AKI observational study in patients undergone cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. pCysC and plasma creatine will be measured at entry to ICU.AKI was defined as 50% increase in plasma creatine above baseline.The predictive and diagnostic performance of pCysC will be assessed from area under receiver operator characteristic curve(AUC) and odds ratio(OR).</detailed_description>
