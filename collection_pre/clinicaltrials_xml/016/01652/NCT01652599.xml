	<brief_title>Eltrombopag and High-dose Dexamethasone as First Line Treatment for IT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune Thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by formation of autoantibodies against platelet antigens leading platelet destruction. Corticosteroids increase the platelet count in about 80 percent of patients.However, many patients have a relapse when the dose of corticosteroid is reduced. Debilitating side effects are common in patients who require long-term corticosteroid therapy to maintain the platelet count. Eltrombopag, it is a small molecule agonist of the c-mpl (TpoR) receptor, which is the physiological target of the hormone thrombopoietin, has been shown to be effectively raise the platelet count in adult patients (aged 18 years and over) who have had their spleen removed or where splenectomy is not an option and have received prior treatment with corticosteroids or immunoglobulins, and these medicines did not work (refractary ITP). There are a few case reports where eltrombopag was an option as first line treatment for IT. The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and response duration with the combination of eltrombopag (50mg PO once a day for 4 weeks) and high-dose dexamethasone (40mg PO days 1,2,3,4) in untreated adult patients immune thrombocytopenic or in patients with less than 7 days of treatment with corticosteroids. A complete platelet response is defined as an increase in platelet counts to &gt;150×109/L on two consecutive occasions. A partial response is defined as an increase in the platelet count to between 50 and 150×109/L on two consecutive occasions, 1 week apart. Duration of response is considered from the day of the initial administration to the first time of relapse (platelet count &lt;30×109/L)or to time of analysis. At the end of the first 5 weeks, the patients will followed by 6 months every month.</detailed_description>
