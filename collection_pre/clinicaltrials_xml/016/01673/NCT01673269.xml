	<brief_summary>When a doctor performs Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography "ERCP" (Endoscopy to examine the bile duct) a flexible tube is inserted into the mouth and into the stomach. The tube passes beyond the stomach and into an opening in the liver called the bile duct. Another small flexible endoscope is inserted inside the ERCP scope to directly visualize the bile duct to ensure that there are no cancers or stones in the bile duct and occasionally to take a sample from the bile duct. The purpose of our study is to examine wither performing this procedure can transmit bacteria from the bile duct to the main blood stream.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study of the Risk of Bacteremia in Directed Cholangioscopic Examination of the CBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study to measure the frequency of bacteremia in patients undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic examination of the Common Bile Duct "CBD". A blood culture will be drawn from patients prior to the procedure, 5 minutes after the procedure and 30 minutes after the procedure. The patient will be followed up for 7 days after procedure for fever and sepsis. The estimated sample size is 60 patients.</detailed_description>
