	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pasireotide LAR in Japanese patients with active acromegaly or pituitary gigantism. Primary objective is to assess the total-group efficacy of pasireotide LAR on the reduction of mean GH levels to &lt; 2.5 µg/L and the normalization of IGF-1 at 3 months of study treatment.</brief_summary>
