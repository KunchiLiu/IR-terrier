	<brief_title>The Effect of the Oligofructose Supplementation on Body Weight in Overweight and Obese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity is reaching epidemic proportions. There have been no effective methods for preventing or treating obesity in childhood so far prompting interest in new interventions. One potential option for obesity prevention is the use of the prebiotic oligofructose. Data from research on rodents shows that a high-fat diet enriched with oligofructose causes a decrease in energy intake, less weight gain and a lower level of triglycerides . A similar effect has been observed in healthy adults. Available evidence suggests that the addition of oligofructose to the diets of overweight or obese adults may increase satiety and thus reduce energy intake. Currently, there are no data on the effect of oligofructose in overweight and obese children.</detailed_description>
