	<brief_title>Renal Stent Placement for the Treatment of Renal Artery Stenosis in Patients With Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial that will take place at up to 25 US/ Outside US (OUS) sites. Primary endpoints have been determined to show the safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcomes of the iCAST™ RX Stent System. Safety and effectiveness will be evaluated based on the primary patency rate at 9-months on a per lesion basis evaluated against a performance goal of published studies with bare-metal stents. The primary clinical endpoint will assess the improvement in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) at 9-months as compared to baseline Systolic Blood Pressure. Eligible subjects will undergo a two-week Medical Documentation Screening period to confirm resistant hypertension (SBP ≥ 155mmHg) while on maximum tolerable doses of ≥ three anti-hypertensive medications from at least three distinct classes of drugs, one of which must be a diuretic. There must be documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic findings &gt; 80% whether it is Duplex Ultrasound (DUS), Computed Tomography angiogram (CTa), Magnetic Resonance angiogram (MRa) or other medical evidence. After meeting screening and clinical eligibility criteria, subjects will undergo a baseline assessment for angiographic eligibility. After angiographic documentation of a ≥ 80% renal artery stenosis or Fraction Flow Reserve (FFR) &lt; 0.8 is confirmed, the subject may be enrolled in the trial by placement of the investigational device. The 9-month visit will include a follow-up DUS of the target renal artery. If the DUS is non-diagnostic due to an imaging problem, such as overlying bowel gas or body habitus, a second DUS may be attempted. If the DUS is indicative of ≥ 60% stenosis as determined by the core laboratory, or the second DUS remains non-diagnostic, a contrast angiogram will be used to assess the degree of restenosis of the covered stent(s). Clinical follow-up visits will be required for all enrolled subjects at 30-days, 9-months, 12-months, 24-months, and 36-months. A 6-month and 18-month visit will occur via telephone to collect medication usage and Adverse Events (AEs) only. The 36-month clinic office visit will be required as the final safety visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1. Age ≥ 18 at the time of informed consent. 2. Subject or subject's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the trial, agrees to participate, and has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF). 3. Subjects that have bilateral kidneys or a solitary functioning kidney with Renal Artery Stenosis in at least one kidney and an average Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥ 155mmHg. 4. Subject has a history of maximum tolerable dose of ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes, one of which must be a diuretic (for at least two weeks prior to Medical Documentation Screening period). a. A documented history for a minimum of 3 months showing reasonable and aggressive efforts to manage hypertension prior to consent. This must include the use of a broad variety of medications that have been used and failed or not tolerated. 5. Subject must have documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic findings &gt; 80% whether it is DUS, CTa, MRa or other medical evidence. 6. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, II, or III the time of trial enrollment. NOTE: When a subject has bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis both of which require stenting, it is recommended to treat both kidneys with an iCAST™ RX Stent System during the index procedure. In the event that a subject needs a renal stenting procedure staged for renal protection, it is important that the Investigator treats the second renal artery with an iCAST™ RX Stent System after 30 days of the index procedure. If subjects with bilateral stenosis have only one lesion that meets protocol inclusion criteria that lesion should be treated per protocol. The recommendation is to NOT treat the second nonqualifying lesion, however if the operator feels strongly it is indicated, then they should treat per standard of care after 30days post index procedure in order to comply with exclusion criteria #10. Subjects with flash pulmonary edema are allowed into the trial should they meet all other Inclusion and Exclusion criteria. Angiographic Anatomic 1. Angiographic diameter renal artery stenosis ≥ 80% involving unilateral or bilateral renal arteries. a. The degree of percent diameter stenosis for all lesions intended to be treated, must be confirmed via one of the following methods: i. Manual or automated measurement with calipers ii. Measured Flow Fraction Reserve (FFR) &lt; 0.8 using a pressure wire iii. Measured translesional peak pressure gradient of &gt; 21mmHg after induced hyperemia via dopamine or papaverine using a 4Fr or less catheter or pressure wire. b. Subjects with 6079% angiographic stenosis who have confirmed FFR &lt; 0.8 may be enrolled. 2. Renal poletopole length &gt; 8cm (per visual estimate). 3. Target lesion length ≤ 16mm per vessel (per visual estimate). 4. Renal artery vessel diameter ≥ 5.0mm and ≤ 7.0mm (per visual estimate). 5. Lesion originating ≤ 15mm of the renal ostium. General 1.
