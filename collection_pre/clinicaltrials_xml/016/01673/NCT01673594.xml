	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to a) assess the efficacy of naltrexone in preventing stimulant-induced euphoria in adults with ADHD, b) assess whether naltrexone will interfere with the clinical efficacy of stimulants in treating adults with ADHD, c) assess whether naltrexone will interfere with the effects of stimulants on neurotransmitter activity. We predict that naltrexone will successfully prevent stimulant-induced euphoria without interfering with the ability of stimulants to effectively treat ADHD in adults. This study will be an 8 -week trial with young adults (18-24) with ADHD.</brief_summary>
