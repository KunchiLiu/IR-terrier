	<brief_title>Physical Activity Telehealth Intervention After Percutaneous Coronary Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular physical activity is important in the maintenance of cardiovascular health, and is especially critical for previously sedentary individuals who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Changing behavior to adopt and maintain recommended physical activity levels in this population is difficult. Interventions to accomplish behavior change will not work unless they can be adopted into a person's busy lifestyle. This proposed study fills a gap by testing the feasibility of an innovative, targeted intervention (Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention), delivered by a practical and feasible platform (cell phone). The asynchronous targeted daily interaction will consist of 5-6 text, picture, and/or video messages delivered to the subject's cell phone each day. Upon successful completion of this study, it is believed that these feasibility findings will provide a foundation for the testing of a larger clinical trial to promote physical activity in this population.</detailed_description>
