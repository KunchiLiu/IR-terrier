	<brief_title>Safety and Feasibility Study of Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells Transplant to Treat Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, delayed-treatment trial. A total of 12 subjects fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited and randomly assigned into two treatment group. Group A (early-treatment group) will receive transplant of UCBMC isolated from HLA-matched umbilical cord blood at Day 0. Group B (delayed-treatment group) will participate in 6 months observation before the UCBMC transplantation at Month 6. All subjects will be followed up for 18 months from enrollment at Day 0. Long-term follow-up will be carried up to 36 months if applicable. The adverse events and safety parameters will be collected and recorded. In addition, the stroke scores , gait and brain MRI will be obtained before and after the treatment to assess the safety and potential treatment effect of UCBMC in chronic ischemic stroke.</detailed_description>
