	<criteria>For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com Men &amp; women ≥18 years of age Subjects with histologically or cytologicallydocumented nonsquamous cell NSCLC who present with Stage IIIB/IV disease or recurrent or progressive disease following multimodal therapy (radiation therapy, surgical resection, or definitive chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced disease) and who will receive study therapy as second or third line of treatment for advanced disease Disease recurrence or progression during/after one prior platinum doubletbased chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease Measurable disease by Computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per RECIST 1.1 criteria Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 A formalin fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or unstained slides of tumor sample (archival or recent) must be available for biomarker evaluation. Specimens must be received by the central lab prior to randomization. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient Subjects with untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are asymptomatic or treated and subjects are neurologically returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis Subjects with active or recent history of known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders (vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization Prior therapy with antiprogrammed death1 (antiPD1), antiprogrammed cell death ligand 1 (antiPDL1), antiprogrammed cell death ligand 2 (antiPDL2), anticluster of differentiation 137 (antiCD137), or antiCytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (antiCTLA4) antibody (including Ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways) Prior treatment with Docetaxel Treatment with any investigational agent within 14 days of first administration of study treatment</criteria>
