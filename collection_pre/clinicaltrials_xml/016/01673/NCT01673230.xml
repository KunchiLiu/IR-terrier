	<brief_summary>Low Cardiac Output Syndrome occurs frequently after cardiac surgery, especially when pre-operative LVEF is altered (LVEF≤45%). The correction of hemodynamic failure requires adapted treatments: fluid expansion and/or inotropic or vasoactive drugs. Predictive indices of a response to fluid challenge may allow an earlier hemodynamic optimization, which has not been showed until now when LVEF is altered.</brief_summary>
