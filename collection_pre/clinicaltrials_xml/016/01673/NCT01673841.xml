	<brief_summary>In this clinical study the investigators compared mixed venous oxygen saturation (SmvO2) with relative and absolute cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) measurements. They hypothesized that previously reported contradictory results regarding the equivalence of SmvO2 and rScO2 might be related to time delay issues and to the measurement technology. 42 consenting patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were included. 4 disposable oxygenation sensors were applied bilaterally on the patient's forehead for continuous, non-invasive registration of rScO2. The sensors of one monitor were placed just above the eyebrows, and the sensors of the other monitor were placed just above the former sensors. The sensors placement was determined at random by a computerized randomization list. SmvO2 was measured continuously via a pulmonary artery catheter. All variables were recorded continuously. The study ended at the end of the operation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients undergoing elective offpump coronary artery bypass grafting for at least 3vessel coronary artery disease were eligible. Patients with arteriovenous shunts, intracardiac shunts, a previous history of cerebrovascular accident, or stenosis of the internal carotid artery of &gt; 60% were excluded.</criteria>
