	<brief_summary>This is an observational study that seeks to gather information about perceptions of body image through the use of a one-time questionnaire completed by participants at the time of study enrollment. Effective management of Human Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has become possible through the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART). As a result of more successful treatment options, HIV/AIDS has transitioned from a terminal illness to one which is treated as a chronic condition. One particular group that has been impacted tremendously by HIV in the United States is the adolescent population. As youth are living longer with HIV/AIDS, clinicians and researchers are beginning to examine ways in which the disease can affect one's physical health, mental health, and other psychosocial factors. Research emerging involving adults with HIV/AIDS has suggested that increased attention to and negative views of one's body image may be found at a higher rate in this group. To our knowledge, very few studies have examined this relationship in adolescents with HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Image in Youth With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this exploratory study is to characterize body image perceptions among youth with perinatally and behaviorally acquired HIV. In a cross-sectional design, adolescents will be asked to complete an ACASI questionnaire that will assess body image, medication adherence, depressive symptoms, medical, and other sociodemographic variables which may relate to adolescents with HIV. Information regarding the adolescents' medical history, medications, and physical functioning also will be abstracted from his or her medical record. Guided by the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, findings from this study will inform future intervention studies designed to enhance HIV disease management among adolescents. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To characterize body image perceptions among youth with HIV.</detailed_description>
