	<brief_summary>Elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) is the standard treatment for displaced diaphyseal femoral fractures in children. However, some literature report high complication rates (10-50%) in complex fractures. Data of our own patients with special emphasis on complications showed also mediocre results. Thus, a biomechanical study was conducted to search for modifications. In this study the stiffness with a 3rd nail implanted was compared to the classical 2 C-shaped configuration. For each of the 3 configurations of retrograde ESIN (titanium nails) eight composite femoral grafts (Sawbones®) with an identical spiral fracture were used: 2C configuration (2 C-shaped nails, 2x3.5 mm), 3CM configuration (3rd from antero-medial, + 1x2.5 mm) and 3CL configuration (3rd from antero-lateral, + 1x2.5 mm). Each group underwent biomechanical testing in 4-point bending, IRO/ERO and axial compression (0°/9°). Due to a significantly higher stiffness of 3CL in the anterior-posterior, internal rotation and 9° compression directions implantation of 3 nails became standard treatment for all dislocated femoral fractures at our department. All patients were followed prospectively. The following data was collected: Type of osteosynthesis, any kind of complication (additional procedures like cast or external fixateur, Re-Do operations, misalignment, pseudarthrosis, skin irritation, infection), time until full weight bearing and time until implant removal. At follow-up the legs were controlled for a possible length discrepancy and a possible deviation of axis. Patients` satisfaction was controlled by CSQ (clients satisfaction score, Larsen et al 2002). Further on the Harris Hip Score was used. X-ray controls were done as standard care protocol after 1 and 3-4 months (dependend on age).
