	<brief_summary>Background Severe health anxiety, hypochondriasis according to DSM-IV, is common and associated with functional disability. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and behavioral stress management (BSM) have been showed to be effective in the treatment of severe health anxiety. The mechanisms of the treatments are however poorly understood. In addition, effective psychological treatments are accessible to only a few. One prior RCT has shown that internet-based CBT could be effective in comparison to waiting list controls. More studies on internet-based CBT is essential to establish evidence. In addition, few studies with sufficient power have investigated the effect of CBT in comparison to other active treatments. Aim of the study The aim of the present RCT is to compare internet-based CBT (n=110) to behavioral stress management (n=110) for adult participants with severe health anxiety. BSM is considered a comparison treatment for two reasons: it has been shown to be effective and it lacks exposure and response prevention, which is suggested to be an important mechanism in CBT. Participants in both treatments are expected to be significantly improved on measures of health anxiety. Participants receiving CBT are expected to be significantly more improved compared to participants receiving BSM.</brief_summary>

The investigators expect participants in both treatments to be significantly improved on measures of health anxiety. Participants receiving CBT are expected to be significantly more improved compared to participants receiving BSM. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Assessments: The primary outcome measure is the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). Assessments with HAI are conducted at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 12 month follow-up.</detailed_description>
