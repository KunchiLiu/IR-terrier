	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm crossover study comparing tivozanib hydrochloride and sunitinib in subjects with metastatic RCC who have received no prior systemic therapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). Approximately 160 subjects will be stratified for ECOG score (0 vs 1) and histology (clear cell vs non-clear cell) and then will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment arms. The study consists of two 12-week treatment periods with a 1-week washout in between. Subjects will receive double-blind (over-encapsulated) tivozanib hydrochloride and sunitinib sequentially. The study is designed to compare subject treatment preference, as well as overall safety and tolerability, frequency of dose modifications and kidney-specific health outcomes/QoL.</brief_summary>
