	<brief_summary>Fundoscopy is an important aspect of the neurological examination, but can be challenging in uncooperative children. This study explored whether viewing a video (selected by patient or caregiver) during eye examination improves the success, duration and ease of pediatric fundoscopy. Hypothesis: Showing a short video clip during a fundoscopic exam will increase the probability of successfully visualizing the optic disk and reduce the amount of time needed to perform a fundoscopic exam in children between 1-8 years old.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine whether showing a video clip with sound of the patient's choice can improve the ease of fundoscopic exam as defined by improved success of visualizing the optic disk and the reduction in time needed to perform the exam. The investigators will also examine the physician's and caregiver's perception on whether the video was effective in improving the ease of the exam. The purpose of the video is to capture the visual attention of the patient thereby allowing the physician to swiftly perform the fundoscopic exam. The literature has suggested that young patients are most uncooperative, therefore the investigators will focus our study on younger patients 1-8 years old.</detailed_description>
