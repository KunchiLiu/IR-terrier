	<brief_summary>Serial quantitative measurements of plasma pro-endothelin-1 concentrations in very preterm infants. Comparing pro-endothelin-1 with established clinical indices of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hypothesis: Pulmonary-vascular remodeling in infants developing BPD is directly related to circulating pro-endothelin-1, which therefore serves as surrogate marker of BPD.</brief_summary>
