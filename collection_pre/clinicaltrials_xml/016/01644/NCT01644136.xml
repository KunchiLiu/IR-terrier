	<brief_summary>This study is being performed to investigate if the application of Arista absorbable hemostat (AH)Â®, a product approved to stop surgical bleeding, can prevent lymphoceles. Lymphoceles are collections of lymphatic fluid which can occur after a lymph node dissection for cancer. These fluid collections can become symptomatic in some patients. Arista would be applied to one side of the pelvis after a pelvic lymph node dissection, to see if this decreases the number of postoperative lymph fluid collections seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan after surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether, if applied to the lymph node basins after pelvic lymph node dissection, Arista could potentially reduce the formation of lymphoceles and consequently the need for secondary interventions. OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. After lymph node dissection, patients undergo microsphere-mediated lymphocele prevention to the lymph node basin on one side of the pelvis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.</detailed_description>
