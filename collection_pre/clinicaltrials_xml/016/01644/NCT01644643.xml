	<criteria>Patient must be ≥18 and ≤90 years of age Female patients can participate if they are surgically sterile or completed menopause or females capable of having children and agree not to attempt pregnancy while receiving IV study therapy and for a period of 7 days after Patient has a ceftazidimeresistant Gram negative pathogen that was isolated from an appropriate culture within 5 days prior to study entry (ie, within 5 days prior to Screening; the studyqualifying culture), which was determined to be the causative agent of the entry infection Patient has an APACHE II score &gt;30 (cIAI patients only) Patient has an infection due to Gram negative pathogen that is unlikely to respond to CAZAVI treatment (eg, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp.) Patient is receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or had a renal transplant Patient is immunocompromised Patient has a rapidly progressive or terminal illness with a high risk of mortality due to any cause, including acute hepatic failure, respiratory failure or severe septic shock such that they are unlikely to survive the 4 to 5week study period.</criteria>
