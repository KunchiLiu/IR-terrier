	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to compare directly conventional balloon angioplasty alone versus. balloon angioplasty with routine stenting - that is, to determine whether angioplasty with self-expanding stent is superior to conventional balloon angioplasty - in the infrapopliteal arterial occlusive lesions of critical limb ischemia patients by collecting and analyzing the cases of each patient group in a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial, and to clarify main factors affecting mid- and long-term clinical effects of angioplasty with self-expanding stent in the infrapopliteal arteries. Hypothesis: Balloon PTA followed by routine stenting with self-expanding nitinol stent in critical limb ischemia patients with infrapopliteal arterial occlusive lesions is superior to conventional PTA in the aspect of vascular restenosis rate.</brief_summary>
