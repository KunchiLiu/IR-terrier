	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test whether or not the use of screw-retained implant crowns on customized zirconia abutments results in biological, technical and esthetic outcomes similar to those obtained with cemented all-ceramic crowns on customized zirconia abutments, both made with a computer-aided design and manufacturing procedure (CAD/CAM). The null-hypotheses is that marginal bone level change is equal at screw-retained and cemented crowns</brief_summary>
