	<brief_summary>The aim is to introduce a new therapeutic method of intracavitary chemotherapy (cisplatin) combined with a fibrin carrier (Vivostat®) after pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural pneumonectomy in a phase I and II study for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma patients by evaluation of the safety in a dose-escalating model (phase I), and confirmation of safety and efficacy in phase II with the maximum tolerated dose in phase I.</brief_summary>

Heart and lung function allowing P/D under general anesthesia Exclusion criteria: Known or suspected unwillingness of the patient to follow the rules of the protocol Patient who has not recovered from side effects from prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Any known hypersensitivity against cisplatin or other platinum containing substances or any other components used for the preparation of the drugs. Patient must not receive any other investigational agents 4 weeks before treatment and until the end of the observation period (2 months after treatment). Patient with prior ipsilateral pleurectomy Only Phase II: Multimodality Prognostic Score (MMPS) &gt; 2: 4 items with a maximum possible score of 4 if the patient presented all four conditions and 0 if none were present: Tumor volume before induction chemotherapy &gt; 500 ml, nonepithelioid histotype in the diagnostic biopsy before induction chemotherapy, CRP value &gt; 30 mg/l before induction chemotherapy, and progressive disease after induction chemotherapy according to RECIST criteria Patient with uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses that would limit the operative procedure of P/D / EPP or compliance with study requirements Tinnitus impairment of more than severity grade I (slight) evaluated by the tinnitus questionnaire MiniTF12_CH, and/or restricted power of hearing until 4 kHz confirmed by audiometry, unless agerelated presbyacusis in a normal range confirmed by an audiologist.
