	<brief_title>Prehospital Telemedical Support in Acute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six ambulances from five different Emergency Medical Service (EMS) districts are equipped with a portable telemedicine system. In cases of suspected acute stroke (including intracranial hemorrhage), the paramedics can use this system to contact a so called "tele-EMS physician" after consent of the patient is obtained. The tele-EMS physician has an audio-connection to the EMS team and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure) in real-time. The transmission of still pictures (taken with a smartphone), 12-lead-ECGs and video streaming from the inside of the ambulance can also be carried out, if indicated. The tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team in obtaining all relevant medical history, neurological diagnosis, general diagnosis and can delegate the application of medications. This can be carried out to bridge the time to the arrival of an EMS physician or in less severe cases without an EMS physician on-scene. The quality of prehospital care and the possible influences on the initial inhospital phase should be investigated and compared with regular EMS.</detailed_description>
