	<brief_summary>The ability to selectively control blood flow through an arteriovenous (AV) graft only when it is needed for dialysis may reduce the current repetitive complications such as thrombosis, venous hypertension and blood steal from the extremities. The Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) allows an AV graft to be turned on to blood flow when it is needed for dialysis then when dialysis is concluded, the device's valves are activated, shutting off the flow of blood through the graft. The graft is then flushed with sterile saline using the dialysis blood lines. By having only saline in the graft and restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein, it is believed that this will dramatically reduce the current complications with having blood diverted through the graft 24/7.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study To Evaluate The CreatiVasc Hemoaccess Valve System In Patients Requiring Arteriovenous Graft Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) is a subcutaneous valve device that is implanted when a new AV graft is placed. It consists of a silicone port into which 3cc of sterile saline is injected. The fluid travels through connective tubing to two balloon valves which expand inside small rigid cuffs which surround the end ends of the graft at the venous and arterial anastomoses. The expansion of the balloons inside the cuffs close off the graft to blood flow. Once the graft is closed off, blood inside the graft is flushed out with sterile saline and using the dialysis needles which are still in place in the graft at the end of dialysis. Once the graft is cleared of blood, the sterile saline along with heparin remain in the graft between dialysis sessions. At the next dialysis session, the 3cc of saline in the balloon valves is aspirated out, deflating the valves and allowing blood to flow to the graft for dialysis. (The saline inside the graft simply enters the blood stream.) By only having saline inside the AV graft between dialysis sessions, there is no post-dialysis bleeding where the dialysis needles were cannulated, and because blood flow is restored to its normal course in the vein and artery, the traditional turbulent blood flow through the graft is eliminated, reducing the traditional complications caused when arterial blood is diverted through the graft then into the vein.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be a candidate for a new arteriovenous graft Be either currently on dialysis or ready to begin dialysis as soon as the access device (AV graft with Hemoaccess Valve System) is ready for use. Be prepared to receive dialysis at dialysis centers in Greenville, SC or Bethesda, MD Have an outflow vein of greater than or equal to 3mm in diameter to which the graft can be successfully anastomosed. Be able to communicate with study personnel. Be considered by the physician to be readily available for subsequent visits. Be willing to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation as directed over the duration of the study. Allow representatives of the Sponsor, the designated Clinical Research Organization, the Institutional Review Board and the FDA to review his/her relevant medical records that pertain to this study. An identification of a central venous stenosis on the ipsilateral side is documented or otherwise identified An identification of an arterial venous stenosis on the ipsilateral side is documented or otherwise identified A hypercoagulable state is documented or otherwise identified and/or previous AV access failures have occurred without an identifiable cause. Has a life expectancy of less than one year. An immunodeficiency syndrome An organ transplant is expected within 6 months of enrollment They are a candidate for a natural fistula 3 or more previous new AV graft or fistula placements have occurred. Body habitus (e.g., extremely small or obese arms( precludes HVS device implantation or access.</criteria>
