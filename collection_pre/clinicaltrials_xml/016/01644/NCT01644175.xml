	<brief_summary>Alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Primary Objective of the study: - To demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by alirocumab as add-on therapy to stable maximally tolerated daily statin therapy with or without other lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) in comparison with placebo after 24 weeks of treatment in high cardiovascular (CV) risk participants with hypercholesterolemia Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab in comparison with placebo on LDL-C at other time points - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on other lipid parameters - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participants with hypercholesterolemia and established coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents who were not adequately controlled with a maximally tolerated daily dose of statin with or without other LMT, both at stable dose for at least 4 weeks to 6 weeks prior to screening (Week 2) Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 or legal age of adulthood, whichever was greater Participants without established CHD or CHD risk equivalent LDLC &lt;70 mg/dL (&lt;1.81 mmol/L) and participants with a history of documented cardiovascular disease LDLC &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.59 mmol/L) and participants without a history of documented cardiovascular disease Not on a stable dose of LMT (including statin) for at least 4 weeks and/or fenofibrate for at least 6 weeks, as applicable, prior to the screening visit (Week 2) and from screening to randomization Fasting serum triglycerides &gt; 400 mg/dL (&gt;4.52 mmol/L) The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
