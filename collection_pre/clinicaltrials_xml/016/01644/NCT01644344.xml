	<brief_summary>The standard post-operative radiographic protocol for the monitoring of fractures at HSC includes post-operative in hospital radiographs as well as radiographs at the two week follow up appointment. This is in addition to good quality intra-operative radiographs. With current operative techniques and implants, orthopaedic surgeons can achieve reliably stable internal fixation. In fact, patients are often allowed to take weight through the fractured limb immediately post-operatively. In these cases, redundant post-operative radiographs likely represent an avoidable cost to the system financially, and an avoidable cost to the patient in additional time spent in hospital and unnecessary radiation exposure.</brief_summary>
