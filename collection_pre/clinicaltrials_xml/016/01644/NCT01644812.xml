	<brief_summary>This two-site (Southern Methodist University (SMU) and Boston University (BU)) study aims to examine the effectiveness of exercise interventions for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). If effective, the use of exercise as a component of treatment for GAD would have a significant public health impact. In addition to improving GAD treatment outcome, exercise is expected to offer health benefits and promote further lifestyle changes. The present study involves the randomization of 52 adults with GAD to either a 12-week combined supervised- home-based moderate-intensity aerobic exercise protocol (EX) or a 12-week combined supervised- home-based stretching protocol (CTRL). The investigators hypothesize that participants in the EX intervention will evidence greater improvements in anxiety symptoms and quality of life relative to individuals receiving the control intervention.</brief_summary>
