	<brief_summary>Objectives: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition for which pessaries are commonly used in conservative treatment. Despite their prevalence, there is no literature to guide the management of pessaries. Our objective is to determine whether patients managed with a pessary for POP are more satisfied with follow-up at 3 or 6 month intervals and if there is any difference in complications rates between the two groups. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be higher patient satisfaction in the group randomized to 6 month follow-up intervals and that there will be no difference in complication rates between the two follow-up groups. Method: The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized control trial comparing patient satisfaction and complication rates between patients with pessaries randomized to either 3 or 6 month follow-up intervals over 1 year.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Females with POP who have opted for conservative management with a pessary Able to read and write English First time pessary users Successful fitting with a covered ring or Gellhorn pessary, as determined at the usual early followup visit 24 weeks after initial fitting (successful defined as: no expulsion on movement, squatting or valsalva, no urinary retention, no discomfort, and still retained pessary after 2 weeks) Patients agree to use vaginal estrogen (either tablet or cream twice weekly) during the study period; patients may not use a vaginal estrogen ring since this requires changing every 3 months, and will interfere with the study followup schedule Exclusion criteria: Current presence of vaginal bleeding, vaginal abrasions or ulcers, or vaginal infection Significant cognitive impairment Pessary used for indication other than POP (ie. urinary incontinence) Use of a pessary that is not a covered ring or Gellhorn (i.e exclude cube, donut, etc.) Contraindications to vaginal estrogen Unsuccessful pessary fitting (successful defined as: no expulsion on movement, squatting or valsalva, no urinary retention, no discomfort, and still retained pessary after 2 weeks)</criteria>
