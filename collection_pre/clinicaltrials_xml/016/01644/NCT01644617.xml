	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-related effectiveness, the safety and the tolerability of MK-8237, compared to placebo, in the treatment of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis in adults. The primary hypothesis is that administration of MK-8237, compared to placebo, results in dose-related improvement in the average total nasal symptom score (TNSS) determined during environmental exposure chamber (EEC) challenge.</brief_summary>
