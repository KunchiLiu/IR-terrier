	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to determine a threshold value of diaphragmatic excursion (ultrasound measures: expiration versus inspiration)that best predicts a 50% collapsibility of the inferior vena cava.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives of this study are: - to determine a threshold value of diaphragmatic excursion (ultrasound measures: expiration versus inspiration)that best predicts a 40% collapsibility of the inferior vena cava (IVC). - to determine a threshold value of diaphragmatic excursion (ultrasound measures: expiration versus inspiration)that best predicts a 100% collapsibility of the IVC. - to determine the location of the cutting plane for the TM analysis of collapsibility of the IVC. - to evaluate the hemodynamic conditions of normal healthy volunteers. - to detect any abnormality of cardiac function.</detailed_description>
