	<brief_title>Cognitive Training for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: Effects on Cognitive, Emotional, and Brain Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients either choose not to complete or do not achieve optimal response to current first-line behavioral and pharmacologic treatments. Neurocognitive research points to the potential of novel treatments targeting dorsal prefrontal function and inhibition, attention, and working memory processes. This study investigates effects of computer-based training in executive functions compared to word games on cognitive and emotional aspects of combat-related PTSD. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires, interviews, computer-administered testing, and magnetic resonance imaging will be complete before and after the intervention. Results from this pilot study will provide information concerning feasibility and treatment potential of cognitive training for PTSD.</detailed_description>
