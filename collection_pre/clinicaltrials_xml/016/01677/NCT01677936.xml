	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the effects of Raisins three times per day versus alternative snacks three times per day on blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors (weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol levels) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. These effects will be studied over a 12 week period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Raisins Versus Alternative Snacks in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raisins are often considered a good food choice because they provide dietary fiber and many health-promoting nutrients, antioxidants and phytochemicals. Like most other fruits, raisins are devoid of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, and low in sodium; these features, combined with their high potassium content, high fiber, and low glycemic index make them potentially preferable to other foods in their effects upon glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors.</detailed_description>
