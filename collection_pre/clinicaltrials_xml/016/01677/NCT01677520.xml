	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to enhance identification and isolation of ADSCs and adipocytes, to find the optimum culturing conditions to increase growth and volume of grafts, and to study the effects of cryopreservation on ADSCs and adipocytes. Fat injections are used in aesthetic surgery but tend to disassemble over time. If the investigators can enhance growth and volume of fat in culture, the investigators could use fat grafts in reconstruction of cancer and traumatic injury defects with the patients own cultured fat cells and grafts.</brief_summary>
