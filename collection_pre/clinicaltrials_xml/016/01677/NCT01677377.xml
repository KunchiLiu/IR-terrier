	<brief_title>Multiple Ascending Dose Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic/Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, Phase 2A, multiple ascending dose study in 1 to 3 sites, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of multiple subcutaneous injections of 60mg, 90mg, and 120mg doses of risperidone in the RBP-7000 formulation, in subjects with clinically-stable schizophrenia who are on a once daily stable dose of 2mg, 3mg, or 4mg of oral risperidone</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female &gt; 18 to &lt; 65 years Diagnosis of paranoid, residual, or undifferentiated schizophrenia as defined by DSMIVTR criteria Status: clinically stable subjects defined as subjects with no hospitalizations for acute exacerbations within 3 months of screening and screening total PANSS score &lt; 60 Subjects who have given written informed consent Subjects taking any risperidone sustained release formulation within the 60 days prior to study screening Subjects taking the following concurrent medication/overthecounter products: Inducers or inhibitors of CYP2DD6 within 14 days or 7 half lives (whichever occurs last) prior to study screening Bupropion, chlorpheniramine, cimetidine, clomipramine, doxepin, or quinidine within 30 days prior to study screening Clozapine, phenothiazines, aripiprazole, haloperidol, or any other antipsychotic other than oral risperidone within 14 days prior to study screening Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) or serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine) within 30 days prior to study screening Opioids or opioidcontaining analgesics within 14 days prior to study screening Medications, in addition to those listed above, which may be expected to significantly interfere with the metabolism or excretion of risperidone and/or 9hydroxyrisperidone, that may be associated with a significant drug interaction with risperidone, or that may pose a significant risk to subjects' participation in the study Subjects with a history of cancer (with the exception of resected basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) unless they have been disease free for &gt;5 years Subjects with another active medical condition or organ disease that may either compromise subject safety and/or outcome evaluation of the study drug Subjects with evidence or history of a significant hepatic disorder that may either compromise subject safety or interfere with the safety and/or outcome evaluation of the study drug. Individuals with acute hepatitis (including but not limited to B or C); or individuals with 1) total bilirubin &gt;1.5x the upper limit oof normal and/or 2) alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;2x upper limit of normal will be excluded Subjects with hepatitis C antibody and AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase &gt;2x and total bilirubin &gt;1.3 mg/dL will be excluded Subjects with a history of renal disease, or a creatinine clearance of less than 80 mL/min (as determined by the Cockcroft Gault formula) Subjects with an international normalized ratio &gt;2.0 at screening Subjects with corrected QT interval (Bazett's QTcB) &gt;450 msec (male) or &gt;470 msec (female) at screening. Subjects with a QTc above these levels due to a benign right bundle branch block can be included in the study at the discretion of the PI Subjects who are known to have AIDS or to be HIV positive Subjects with suicidal ideation with intent and plan (CSSRS affirmative answers to questions 4 and 5 of the ideation section) or suicide attempts within the last six months as noted on the CSSRS, or subjects with uncontrolled depression in the opinion of the investigator Subjects with known diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes or subjects with Hemoglobin A1c &gt;7.0 at screening Subjects who have participated in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to study screening Subjects who meet the DSMIVTR criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence within the last six months of screening</criteria>
