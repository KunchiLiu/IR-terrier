	<brief_summary>Fifty pregnant patients with acquired and congenital heart disease between 38-41 weeks were randomised into elective induction and spontaneous labour groups only after bishop score was equal to or more than 6.It was concluded that induction of labour with oxytocin is a relatively safe procedure in women with low risk heart disease with NYHA class I and II. It resulted in a similar caesarean delivery rate and was not associated with more maternal and neonatal complications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Induction of labour was done with oxytocin. An infusion of 30U oxytocin diluted in 500ml normal saline was prepared and given through infusion pump at initial rate of 3mU/min. Subsequently dose was increased 3mU/min every 45 min till adequate uterine contractions were established. Epidural analgesia was provided wherever feasible or Injection Morphine 2-5mg was given intravenously for pain relief.</detailed_description>
