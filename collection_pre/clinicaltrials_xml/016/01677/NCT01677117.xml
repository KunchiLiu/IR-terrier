	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) fatality rate can be as high as 20% -41%, once progress is severe of ARDS, mortality rose to 90%, the main cause of death was refractory hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilation as the main measure to improve hypoxemia cannot correct all hypoxemia and relating complications of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation in the treatment of severe ARDS has gradually been challenged. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation（ECMO) technology matures, so that clinicians have more choices in the face of hypoxemia, and with the deepening understanding of ECMO, ECMO may become severe ARDS first-line treatment. Currently, ECMO therapy has been recognized by the majority of medical workers. Therefore, we assume that accurately grasping the ECMO indications and standardizing the implementation of treatment can significantly improve the prognosis, shorter hospital stays, lower hospitalization costs.</brief_summary>
