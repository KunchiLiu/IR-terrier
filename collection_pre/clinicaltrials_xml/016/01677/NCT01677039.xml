	<brief_summary>The study is designed to test whether or not the rate and extent of absorption of oxycodone from a proprietary controlled-release formulation is significantly affected by co-administration of alcohol compared with controlled conditions (when the formulation is administered with water). The primary pharmacokinetic parameters are the peak concentration of oxycodone (Cmax) and the overall exposure level of oxycodone as represented by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC).</brief_summary>
