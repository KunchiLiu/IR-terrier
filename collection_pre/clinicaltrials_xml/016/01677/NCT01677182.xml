	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Ramelteon (TAK-375) Tablets for Sublingual Administration (SL) in Adults With Bipolar 1 Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Ramelteon. Ramelteon is being tested to treat people who have Bipolar 1 Disorder. This study will look at the symptoms of depression in people who take Ramelteon as a sub-lingual formulation. This study plans to enroll a minimum of 276 participants and a maximum of up to approximately 870 participants Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Ramelteon (Dose 1) - Ramelteon (Dose 2) - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one tablet every night at bedtime throughout the study. This study plans to conduct one unblinded interim analysis after the first 276 subjects have been enrolled and treated for the 6-week double-blind treatment period. Based on the interim analysis, the study plans to adapt limited aspects of the design including: 1) to make no changes to the study; 2) to reassess sample size based on the interim analysis results. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 14 weeks. Participants will make 8 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recently performed a planned interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from this study. Upon completion of their review, the DMC advised that the unblinded interim data met the predefined efficacy criteria for study termination. No safety concerns were identified.</detailed_description>

The subject is on lithium and/or one other mood stabilizer (lamotrigine or valproic acid) and/or one atypical antipsychotic (risperidone or olanzapine or aripiprazole or ziprasidone). Patients may be on one, two, or three medications but no more than one from each group. 11. The subject is on the same dose of the protocol allowed medications (identified in inclusion # 10) for bipolar 1 disorder for at least two weeks prior to screening (and at least 6 weeks prior to screening for lamotrigine only). Further dose adjustments will not be allowed from screening until end of study, except for downward dose adjustments for adverse events. 12. If the subject is on lithium and/or valproic acid, the trough serum levels must be less than 1.2 mEq/L for lithium and the trough serum must be less than 125 mcg/ml for valproic acid. Downward dose adjustment is allowed to lower trough serum levels for lithium and/or valproic acid below the maximum allowed. This must be confirmed at least two weeks prior to baseline. 13. The subject screened must have &lt;25% improvement in MADRS total score from screening to baseline visit with a minimum of two weeks between screening and baseline visits. 14. A female subject of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. 15. A male subject who is nonsterilized and sexually active with female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 1. The subject has received any investigational compound &lt;30 days before Screening or 5 halflives whichever is longer prior to Screening. 2. The subject has received TAK375 or TAK375SL in a previous clinical study or has ever used ramelteon. 3. The subject is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependant relationship with a study site employee who is involved in conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. The subject has one or more of the following: 1. Any current psychiatric disorder which is the primary focus of treatment other than Bipolar 1 Disorder, Most Recent Episode Depressed as defined in the DSMIVTR, as assessed by the SCID. 2. Current or history of: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, unipolar depression with psychotic features, bipolar depression with psychotic features, any other psychotic disorder (with the exception of psychosis associated with a manic or mixed episode), mental retardation, organic mental disorders, OCD, or mental disorders due to a general medical condition as defined in the DSMIVTR. 3. Current diagnosis or history of alcohol or other substance abuse (excluding nicotine or caffeine) as defined in the DSMIVTR that has not been in full and sustained remission for at least three months from the day of screening. (Subject must also have negative urine drug screen at Screening and Baseline). Note that a positive drug screen for opiates and benzodiazepines is allowed provided the subject has a valid prescription. 4. Current diagnosis or history of alcohol or other substance dependence (excluding nicotine or caffeine) as defined in the DSMIVTR that has not been in full and sustained remission for at least three months from the day of screening.
