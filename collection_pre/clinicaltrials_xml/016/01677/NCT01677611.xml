	<brief_summary>Animal studies indicate that resveratrol, a phytoalexin enriched in the skin of red grapes and a constituent of red wine, is associated with longevity likely through the increased production of a protein, SIRT1. The trial is a proof-of-concept study primarily designed to examine for the first time in humans, the effect of 12 weeks of oral resveratrol on skeletal muscle SIRT1 expression in 10 patients with T2DM in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. Secondary outcomes include measures of AMPK, p-AMPK and GLUT4 expression levels, energy expenditure, physical activity levels, distribution of abdominal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle fiber type composition, body weight, HbA1c, plasma lipid subfraction, adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
