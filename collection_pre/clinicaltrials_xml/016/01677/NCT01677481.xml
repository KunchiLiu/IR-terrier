	<brief_title>Randomized Evaluation of Vascular Entry Site and Radiation Exposure: REVERE Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred for coronary angiography will be randomized to either left radial, right radial or femoral arterial access sites, and the coronary angiogram will be performed in a standard fashion, including left ventriculography. Radiation exposure parameters including Air Kerma, Dose-area product, Fluoroscopy time and Operator radiation exposure will be recorded. Operator experience as well as demographic data will be recorded.</detailed_description>
