	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation in treating selective patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We hypothesized that autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation would promote β-cells regeneration by directly differentiated from the transplanted BMMCs or stimulate local stem cells regeneration and thus decrease or eliminate the need of exogenous insulin and improve β-cells function.</brief_summary>
