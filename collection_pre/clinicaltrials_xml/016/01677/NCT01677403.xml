	<brief_title>A Study to Access Safety and Efficacy of Nebulized Tobramycin in Patients With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis is a chronic disorder of the major bronchi and bronchioles characterized by permanent dilation, microbial infection, a persistent inflammatory response with the release of immune mediators and microbial toxins leading to destruction. The origin of bronchiectasis varies, but the presence of microbial infection and a persistent inflammatory response is typical of the disease. The chronic nature of the infection and the associated considerable morbidity provides the rationale for using aerosolized antibiotics for the treatment of bronchiectasis patients. This is a study of safety and efficacy of combined administration of nebulized tobramycin compared with systemic administration alone in patients with Bronchiectasis in acute exacerbation of Bronchiectasis. Study subjects will be randomized to receive either study drug or placebo by inhalation via a nebulizer. Each subject will complete 14 days of daily dosing. Clinical laboratory parameters,clinical adverse events and pulmonary function will be evaluated for all study subjects in order to determine the qualitative and quantitative safety and efficacy of nebulized tobramycin.</detailed_description>
