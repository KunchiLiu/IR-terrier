	<brief_summary>This open-label, extension study is designed to provide continuing treatment with RO5045337 to participants who have completed parent studies NO21279 (NCT00623870), NO21280 (NCT00559533), NP25299 (NCT01164033), NP28021 (NCT01605526) or NP28023 (NCT01635296). Participants are eligible to participate in this study if they have completed required Phase 1 study assessments for primary objectives of respective parent protocol and are having evidence of clinical benefit (as defined by the parent protocol). Participants will continue the most similar dose and formulation available (which does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose [MTD] or the maximum safely administered dose for that formulation during Phase 1) and the same schedule of RO5045337 treatment that they were receiving at the time of transitioning from the parent clinical study protocol.</brief_summary>
