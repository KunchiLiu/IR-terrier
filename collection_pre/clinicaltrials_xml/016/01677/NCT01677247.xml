	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of 4 mg Glimepiride Tablet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast; and in the next morning they were given orally either one tablet of 4 mg glimepiride as the test drug (produced by PT Dexa Medica) or one tablet of 4 mg glimepiride (AmarylÂ®, Sanofi Aventis) as the reference drug with 200 mL water. Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4.5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours after drug administration. Immediately after drug administration, subjects were administered 100 ml of 10% glucose at approximately 0.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 hours. In addition, 20% glucose solution was given to any subject who exhibited symptoms of hypoglycaemia. One week after the first drug administration (wash-out period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug. The plasma concentrations of glimepiride were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed are AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2.</detailed_description>
