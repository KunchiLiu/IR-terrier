	<brief_summary>Objectives: The aims of the present study were to compare ultrasound on asymptomatic feet of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and normal controls, determine the association between ultrasound and global disease activity, function and goniometric measures in patients with RA and determine the correlation between ultrasound and radiography in the detection of bone erosion. Methods: The foot joints (talocrural, talocalcaneal, talonavicular, naviculocuneiform, calcaneocuboid, 5th tarsometatarsal and 1st to 5th metatarsophalangeal [MTP] joints) of 50 healthy subjects and 50 patients with RA (all with asymptomatic feet) were evaluated bilaterally regarding quantitative/semi-quantitative synovitis, semi-quantitative Power Doppler (PD) signals and erosion using ultrasound. Statistical significance was set to 5%.</brief_summary>
