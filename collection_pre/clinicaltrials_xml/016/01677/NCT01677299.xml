	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate how EFB0027 and EFB0026 behave in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, this study will compare the effects of EFB0027 and EFB0026 on circulating concentrations of glucose and gastrointestinal hormones in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>

A stable regimen (minimum of 2 months at Visit 1) of DPP4 inhibitor alone, OR HbA1c between 6.0 to 8.5% (inclusive) for subjects managing their diabetes with a stable (minimum of 2 months at Visit 1) combination regimen of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors. 3. Has serum creatinine below the upper limit of normal at Visit 1 and an estimated creatinine clearance above 80 using the Crockroft and Gault equation (CrCl = [(140 age) x body weight in kg] / (serum creatinine x 72) x (0.85 for females) [ref. 3]. 4. Has a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 40.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive) at Screening. 5. Is male, or is female and meets all of the following criteria: Not breastfeeding Negative pregnancy test result (human chorionic gonadotropin, beta subunit) at Visit 1 (Screening) (not applicable to hysterectomized females) Surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or if of childbearing potential, must practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control during the entire duration of the study 6. Has a physical examination with no clinically significant abnormalities as judged by the investigator. 7. Ability to understand and willingness to adhere to protocol requirements. 8.

Has any chronic disease requiring medication that has been adjusted in the past 90 days (subjects may take acute intermittent overthecounter medications such as Tylenol, if needed). 3. Has any drug treatment that affects gastric pH (prescription or overthecounter), including any antacids or medications such as Rolaids or Pepcid within 2 days of Visit 1 (Screening). 4. Has had major surgery of any kind within 6 months of Visit 1 (Screening). 5. Has received a blood transfusion within 6 months of Visit 1 (Screening). 6. Has a history of &gt;5 kg weight change within 3 months of Visit 1 (Screening). 7. Has clinical laboratory test (clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) abnormalities other than those expected in subjects with diabetes and judged by the investigator to be clinically significant at Visit 1 (Screening). 8. Has physical, psychological, or historical finding that, in the investigator's opinion, would make the subject unsuitable for the study. 9. Currently abuses drugs or alcohol or has a history of abuse that in the investigator's opinion would cause the individual to be noncompliant with study procedures. 10.
