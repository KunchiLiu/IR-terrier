	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects who are subject to any of the following vascular embolization therapies 1. Subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have deep stained early stage tumor confirmed by dynamic computerized tomography (CT) after bolus intravenous infusion of contrast media and have a typical finding of hypervascular tumor, and are not amenable to resection and local therapy, and meet any of the following (a) to (c). 1. 1 lesion of &gt;50 mm in diameter 2. 2 or 3 lesions of &gt;30 mm in at least one diameter 3. 4 or more lesions 2. Metastatic hepatic cancer Subjects with metastatic hepatic cancer who have deep stained early stage tumor confirmed by dynamic CT after bolus intravenous infusion of contrast media and have a typical finding of hypervascular tumor but not amenable to resection, and whose primary lesion and extrahepatic lesion are controlled. 3. Hypervascular tumor other than metastatic hepatic cancer Subjects with deep stained early stage tumor confirmed by dynamic CT after bolus injection of contrast media and who have a typical finding of hypervascular tumor other than the liver (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, bone soft tissue sarcoma) and meets any of the following (a) to (b). 1. Subjects applicable to preoperative arterial embolization therapy to reduce tumor size or volume of bleeding for safer conduct of surgical resection or local therapy (e.g., radiofrequency ablation (RFA)) 2. Subjects in stable general condition and are applicable to pain control treatment 4. Arteriovenous malformation: Subjects with arteriovenous malformation (except for central nervous system, heart, and lung) confirmed by dynamic CT but at a low risk of undesirable reflux into systemic circulation and with vessel malformation suitable for particle embolization in size 2. Subjects with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 02 (PS 01 for metastatic hepatic cancer) 3. No carryover effect of prior therapy or adverse drug reactions which may influence the embolic effect of E7040, if having a history of prior therapy time elapsed from the end of prior therapy to the start of E7040 embolization therapy should be: Surgery: greater than or equal to 6 weeks Local therapy: greater than or equal to 4 weeks Embolization for nontarget vessel: greater than or equal to 4 weeks 4. With a survival of greater than or equal to 12 months after the prior arterial embolization therapy using E7040 Exclusion criteria: 1. Subjects with clinical symptom or brain metastasis or cerebral encephalopathy requiring medical treatment 2. Suspected to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) judging from clinical findings in patients with any disease other than HCC 3. Previously treated with arterial embolization therapy in target vessel 4. Previously treated with arterial embolization therapy in nontarget vessel, resection in target organ, or local therapy (e.g., RFA) (except for HCC patient) 5. Subjects expected to have arterypulmonary vein shunt or righttoleft shunt, or those with a possible risk of influx of embolized particles into the central nervous system.</criteria>
