	<brief_title>Survival According to the Feeding Artery Obliteration by Chemoembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjective angiographic chemoembolization endpoints (SACE) levels were developed to standardize the embolic endpoints of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It determined the antegrade arterial flow and residual tumor blush as follows: I, normal-normal; II, reduced-reduced; III, reduced-none; IV, none-none. SACE level II and III indicates intermediate-levels of embolization, whereas IV indicates overembolization. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether survival of patients who underwent TACE with unresectable HCC can benefit from intermediate-levels of embolization.</detailed_description>
