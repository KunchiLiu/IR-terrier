	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy and the toxicity of the treatment program. Eligible patients with stage T1-2c prostate cancer who sign consent will be enrolled to this phase I dose escalation trial and be treated with hypo-fractionated radiation therapy (HRT). Dose escalation will be as follows: There will be 3 cohorts consisting of 3 patients each.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dose escalation will be as follows: There will be 3 cohorts consisting of 3 patients each. All patients will receive 18 fractions of HRT over the course of 6 weeks (3 fractions per week). Dose level I will be 54Gy (3 Gy per fraction), dose level II will be 55.8 Gy (3.1Gy per fraction), dose level III will be 57.6 Gy (3.2 Gy per fraction). After accrual of dose level I, all patients will be observed for a minimum of two weeks after completion of radiation treatments, for assessment of toxicity, before the dose can be escalated for the next cohort. After dose level II, patients will be observed for 6 months before enrolling patients on dose level III. All patients will be seen weekly by their radiation oncologist during radiation therapy. Any observations regarding radiation reactions will be recorded.</detailed_description>
