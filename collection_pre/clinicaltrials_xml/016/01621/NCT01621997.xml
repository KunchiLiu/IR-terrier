	<brief_title>Different Retraining Methods vs Usual Care on the Prevention of Peritonitis in Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design is prospective, randomized, controlled study. At baseline (during the first month), they will receive a standard training program on performing bag exchange and education on the prevention of peritonitis. Then the participants will be randomized into three groups: retraining via operation inspection (G1), retraining via verbal education (G2) and usual care (G3). Retraining will be performed every 2 months in G1 and G2 group. During the following 2 years or a longer period, all the participants will be followed up frequently with outcome events recorded.</detailed_description>
