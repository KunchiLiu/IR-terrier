	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the influence of total atherosclerotic burden assessed by 3-vessel fractional flow reserve (FFR) on the clinical outcomes of the patients with multi-vessel disease. For this purpose, the clinical data of the patients with 3-vessel intermediate coronary artery disease, whose FFR was measured at all 3-vessels due to their own clinical needs, will be analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Analysis The Primary Analysis will be performed after 2-year follow-up data will be completed. Pre-specified Subgroup Analysis The pre-specified subgroup analysis will perform after 1-year follow-up data will be completed according to the following subjects: - Concordant and discordant results between FFR and angiographic stenosis severity (patients and lesions with pre-PCI FFR will be analyzed.). - Association between total atherosclerotic burden and total ischemic burden, coronary CT angiography substudy (after 2-year follow-up will be completed). - Validation of total ischemic burden (sum of 3 vessel FFR) with Duke score, measured by treadmill test. - Comparison of clinical outcomes of deferred lesions according to pre-PCI FFR levels (Pre-PCI FFR &lt;0.75, 0.75-0.80, and &gt;0.80).</detailed_description>
