	<brief_summary>Title: Evaluating New Radiation Techniques for Cardiovascular Imaging Background: - Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans involve the use of radiation to create the pictures. Heart and blood vessel CT scans can cause high radiation exposure. Different methods of creating CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose. Researchers want to see how effective these new methods are in producing accurate CT scans. Objectives: - To study new ways of taking pictures of the heart or blood vessels using computed tomography. Eligibility: - Adults at least 18 years of age who will be having imaging studies to help detect heart or blood vessel problems. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be taken to check kidney function. - Participants will have a CT scan of the heart and blood vessels. A contrast agent may be used to improve the quality of the images. The scanning session may last up to 2 hours. - Participants will have follow-up contact 90 days after the scan, and then yearly contact for the next 5 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac CT angiography is associated with radiation exposure. Different methods of creating CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose to the subject. The purpose of this research study is to learn whether these new imaging methods are accurate or predict subject outcomes.</detailed_description>
