	<detailed_description>One hundred and forty adult men concerned about their substance use and behaviors toward intimate partners, recruited in Washington State, will be enrolled in the trial. Participants are recruited through print and radio ads. Following a baseline assessment, participants are then randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions: - The experimental intervention is a two-session motivational enhancement treatment. A personalized feedback report, containing information from the participant's assessment as well as normative comparison data, is reviewed, with the counselor employing motivational interviewing strategies intended to impact study outcomes. - The comparison condition involves an educational brochure focusing on the legal, health and behavioral effects of intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and HIV risky behaviors. Following the two interventions, participants are reassessed at 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months following either intervention.</detailed_description>
