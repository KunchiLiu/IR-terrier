	<brief_summary>As the use of video games (VG) is rapidly increasing, many studies have tries to understand the effects of VG on the children and adolescents playing them. Most of the research was directed towards negative effects (especially violence, attention and school performance), producing mixed results.

The current study will try to characterize the variance of VG playing pattern among adolescents diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, in order to better under the rich interaction between a player and his VG, and to understand whether VG playing patterns holds diagnostical clues for the child's diagnosis and his inner world.</brief_summary>
