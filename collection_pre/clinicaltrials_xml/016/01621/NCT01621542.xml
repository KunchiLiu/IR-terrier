	<brief_title>Clinical Study of WT2725 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with other WT1 vaccines in clinical trials has shown evidence of immunogenicity and clinical response in various malignancies. This study will assist with determining which dose level(s) to use in future clinical studies and will evaluate both clinical and immunological response.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Part 1 Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0, 1, or 2 Patient must have one of the following histologically or cytologically documented measurable (may be measureable by tumor markers only, such as quantitative RTPCR for WT1 transcript for AML, or CA125 for ovarian carcinoma) advanced stage malignancies: nonsmall cell lung, ovarian, glioblastoma, and AML (not including acute promyelocytic leukemia), known to overexpress the WT1 protein. Patient must qualify with a study specific HLA typing assay. Haematological parameters: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/μl Platelet count ≥ 10.0x10(to the 4th power)/μl (≥ 5.0 x 10(to 4th power)/μl after stem cell transplant) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 1,000/μl (≥ 500/μl after stem cell transplant) Note: After completion of dose escalation, patients with AML are not required to meet these hematologic criteria. Biochemical Parameters: serum creatinine of ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference lab. total bilirubin of ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (≤ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with known Gilbert's syndrome) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 times the ULN for the reference lab Patient must have access to archival tumor tissue sample or agree to undergo biopsy after study eligibility has been confirmed to obtain fresh sample for evaluation of WT1 expression. In place of archival tumor tissue samples, subjects with AML should have available a bone marrow aspirate and/or, bone marrow biopsy, with PCR for WT1 transcript performed before the first dose of study drug. Note: The archived tumor tissue sample does not need to be delivered to the clinical site prior to enrollment of the patient, however its availability should be confirmed through provision of the accession number or other identification number.

Patient must have adequate renal function documented by a serum creatinine of ≤ 1.5 times the ULN for the reference lab. Patient must have adequate hepatic function documented by a total bilirubin of ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (≤ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with known Gilbert's syndrome) and ALT and AST ≤ 3 times the ULN for the reference lab. Patient must have access to archival tumor tissue sample or agree to undergo biopsy after study eligibility has been confirmed to obtain fresh sample for evaluation of WT1 expression. In place of archival tumor tissue samples, patients with AML should have available a bone marrow aspirate and/or bone marrow biopsy with PCR for WT1 transcript performed before the first dose of study drug. Note: The archived tumor tissue sample does not need to be delivered to the clinical site prior to enrollment of the patient, however its availability should be confirmed through provision of the accession number or other identification number. • Patients with AML must be willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration/biopsy during treatment if there are no other indicators of measureable disease.
