	<brief_summary>Randomized prospective study comparing the anterior capsule repair vs capsulectomy with regards to post-operative pain and range of motion outcomes in elective primary unilateral direct anterior approach THA for osteoarthritis. Visual Analog Scores (VAS) will be recorded for preoperative and postoperative months 1 and 4. Hip range of motion will be assessed by goniometer measurements and lateral hip radiographs in maximum flexion. The purpose of the study is to compare post-operative pain control and hip range of motion between two surgical techniques (anterior capsular repair vs. anterior capsulectomy) during direct anterior total hip arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
