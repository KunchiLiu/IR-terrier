	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to explore the optimal propofol dose in neonates receiving a single intravenous propofol bolus for endotracheal intubation during (semi-)elective INSURE (intubation-surfactant-extubation) procedure (preterm neonates) and (semi-)elective non-INSURE procedures (term-preterm neonates).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Propofol Dose Finding Study In Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol (short acting anesthetic) in 50 neonates to whom the drug is administered as a intravenous bolus. This is part of routine clinical care in patients receiving (semi-) elective intubation. It's the aim to explore the most effective IV propofol dose for a successful INSURE (intubation, surfactant, extubation) procedure and for successful (semi-) elective intubation in non-INSURE procedures. We hereby aim to define the most optimal dose regimen for propofol in neonates. we will hereby use - predefined scoring systems to evaluate sedation, relaxation and intubation conditions - vital parameter monitoring - pharmacokinetic analysis with blood samples - brain monitoring with NIRS (Near infrared spectroscopy) derived cerebral oxygenation and aEEG (amplitude integrated EEG).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit who need short procedural sedation for (semi) elective intubation will be considered for inclusion, after informed written consent of the parents. Patients can be included if they are hemodynamically stable and did not receive sedative or analgesic agents during the previous 24 hours. Known propofol intolerance</criteria>
