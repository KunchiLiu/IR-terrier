	<brief_summary>Physiological stimulation therapy effectiveness will be proved with contractility sensor or CLS sensor (Closed Loop Stimulation), in BIOTRONIK CLS pacemakers to prevent from neuromediated syncope. Furthermore, not only will be investigated if this system eradicates syncopes, but also if the number of presyncopal episodes is reduced.</brief_summary>
