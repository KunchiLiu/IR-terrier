	<brief_summary>Background: - Sunitinib is drug that is approved for treating various types of cancers, including kidney cancers. However, it has not been approved to treat cancers of the thymus. Sunitinib works by blocking proteins that are responsible for cell division and growth. Some of these proteins can be found on thymus cancer cells. Researchers want to see if sunitinib can be used to treat advanced thymus cancer. It will be given to people who have had at least one earlier chemotherapy treatment containing platinum. Objectives: - To see if sunitinib is a safe and effective treatment for advanced thymus cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced thymus cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments. - At least one previous cancer treatment must have been chemotherapy treatment containing platinum. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor biopsies will be used to check the severity of the cancer. - Participants will take sunitinib tablets once a day, in the morning. They will take the tablets daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest with no sunitinib. This 6-week period is called a cycle. - Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. - Treatment cycles may be repeated as long as the tumor does not continue to grow and there are no severe side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib for Advanced Thymus Cancer Following Earlier Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymoma and thymic carcinoma. However over 50% of these patients may fail initial therapy and therefore require second-line therapy. New therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. Results obtained from protocol 12-C-0118 so far have shown impressive clinical activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma with an objective response rate of 23% and disease control rate of 91% which is unprecedented for this histology. Treatment at a dose of 50 mg once daily for four weeks followed by 2 weeks off was poorly tolerated. Twenty five out of 41 patients needed dose reductions due to development of intolerable adverse events. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: - To evaluate the objective response rate (PR+CR) for sunitinib in patients with relapsed or refractory thymoma or thymic carcinoma MAIN ELIGIBILITY: - Patients with histologically confirmed thymoma (Group 1 only) or thymic carcinoma who have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen with progressive disease prior to study entry - Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria - Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function - No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of sunitinib DESIGN: - In the first group (Group 1), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous schedule at 50 mg per day for 4 weeks with 2 weeks off to constitute a 6-week cycle (Schedule 4/2) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects. - In the second group (Group 2), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous schedule at 50 mg per day for 2 weeks with 1 week off to constitute a 3-week cycle (Schedule 2/1) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects. - Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE Version 4.0 - Tumor response assessments by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be performed every cycle for Group 1 and every other cycle for Group 2 (every 6 weeks) for patients receiving treatment for less than one year, and every two cycles for Group 1 and every four cycles for Group 2 (every 12 weeks) for patients who have been receiving treatment one year or longer. -Exploratory studies include evaluation of serum VEGFR2, PLGF, IL-4, IL-12, HGF, and b-FGF (Group 1 only); and circulating tumor cells, endothelial progenitors, and mature apoptotic endothelial cells (both groups). In Group 2, regulatory T cells (Tregs), exhausted CD8 T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and Th1/Th2 T cell populations will also be evaluated. Where tumor samples are available, intra-tumoral immune infiltrate will be assessed (both groups).</detailed_description>

Progressive disease must be documented prior to study entry. 3.1.3 Patients must not have received chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 3.1.4 Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. 3.1.5 Age greater than or equal to 18 years. 3.1.6 ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky &gt; 50 percent) 3.1.7 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months. 3.1.8 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limits serum calcium less than or equal to 12.0 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. If subjects have liver metastases, both ALT and AST must be less than or equal to 5 times ULN. Patients must have QTc &lt; 500 msec 3.1.9 PT or INR, and APTT less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), unless the abnormality can be explained by the presence of lupus anticoagulant or if these values are in the therapeutic range for a patient on low molecular weight heparin. 3.1.10 The following groups of patients are eligible provided they have New York Heart Association Class II (NYHA) cardiac function on baseline ECHO/MUGA: those with a history of Class II heart failure who are asymptomatic on treatment those with prior anthracycline exposure those who have received central thoracic radiation that included the heart in the radiotherapy port. 3.1.11 Patients must have blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) and 90 mmHg (diastolic) for eligibility.
