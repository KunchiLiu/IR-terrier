	<brief_title>Prospective Comparative Clinical Study to Investigate the Use of the NON CONTACT TONO/PACHYMETER NT-530P</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following data analysis will be conducted for tonometer and pachymeter readings. One of eyes of one patient becomes an object of the analysis. Regarding the intraocular pressure, higher IOP readings of either right or left eye are used for analysis. Regarding CCT, the readings of either right or left eye are randomly assigned to analysis in the order of registration.</detailed_description>
