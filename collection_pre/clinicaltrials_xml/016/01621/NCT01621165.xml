	<brief_summary>Mania has been considered to be, in part, a hyperadrenergic state. One focus of treatment of mania involves directly targeting this hyperexcitable state by reducing arousal with antiadrenergic agents. This can be achieved by decreasing norepinephrine release by stimulating presynaptic inhibitory receptors. Prazosin, FDA approved for the treatment of high blood pressure works in part by blocking postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors. Prazosin has been found to be clinically useful for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is reasonable, therefore, to anticipate that prazosin might be helpful in the treatment of mania.</brief_summary>
