	<brief_summary>People with primary metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in combination with an investigational agent called necuparanib (M402). It is made from heparin, which is a well known blood thinner. Blood thinners have been shown in prior animal and human studies to have anti-cancer effects. Necuparanib has been re-engineered from heparin to have much lower blood thinning activity while keeping the anti-tumor activity. The investigators are testing whether necuparanib administered in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine may be more effective than nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>M402 in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A was an open-label, multiple ascending dose patient study of necuparanib given first as a single dose and then daily in combination with the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine regimen. It was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of necuparanib alone and in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine and to recommend a necuparanib dose regimen for subsequent evaluation in Part B. Part B is a randomized, double-blind study investigating the antitumor activity of necuparanib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine compared with nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and placebo. In both Parts A and B, a treatment period consists of one 28-day cycle. The Study Patient and Investigator can decide to continue with additional 28-day cycles according to the patient's status at the end of each 28-day cycle. Part A has completed enrollment and Part B is currently open. Part A - Primary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of necuparanib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. - To determine the dose of necuparanib to be carried forward into Part B. Part B - Primary Objective: To evaluate overall survival in patients treated with necuparanib + nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine compared with placebo + nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.</detailed_description>
