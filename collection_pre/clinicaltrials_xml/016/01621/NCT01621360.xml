	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) who undergo arthroscopic hip surgery experience similar outcomes at 2 years post-operative with respect to physical function, pain, and health related quality of life, compared to similar patients who receive conservative management, including medication and physiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hip Arthroscopy Versus Conservative Management of Femoroacetabular Impingement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthroscopic surgery is now commonly used to treat patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) however there is a lack of scientific evidence to support its efficacy. Two distinct types of FAI have been defined: cam impingement and pincer impingement. Cam impingement is described as an abnormally prominent anterolateral femoral head-neck junction that rubs against the acetabular rim during flexion resulting in impingement of the acetabular labrum. Pincer impingement is described as an anatomical overcoverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum that impinges the labrum leading to proliferation, or an increase in the prominence of the acetabular rim, further exacerbating the impingement. Previous studies investigating the efficacy of arthroscopic surgery of the knee and shoulder have shown no benefit compared to sham surgery and non-surgical management, therefore strong scientific evidence is needed to support its use in the treatment of hip pathology.</detailed_description>
