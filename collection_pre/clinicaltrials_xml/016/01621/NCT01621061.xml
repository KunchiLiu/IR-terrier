	<brief_summary>High altitude pulmonary hypertension, a form of altitude illness that occurs in long-term residents at altitudes &gt;2500 m, is characterized by dyspnea, hypoxemia, impaired exercise performance and hypertension in the pulmonary circulation. Whether sleep related breathing disturbances, common causes of nocturnal hypoxemia in lowlanders, are also prevalent in highlanders and promote pulmonary hypertension in highlanders is unknown. Therefore, the current study will investigate whether highlanders with high altitude pulmonary hypertension have a greater prevalence of sleep apnea than healthy highlanders and lowlanders.</brief_summary>
