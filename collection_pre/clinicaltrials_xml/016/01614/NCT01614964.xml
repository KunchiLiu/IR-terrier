	<brief_summary>This is an initial efficacy study of a candidate antimalarial in human subjects with uncomplicated malaria caused by the most common and most important parasite in Africa (Plasmodium falciparum). This study will enroll 66 adult Malian males with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and randomize them to treatment with 1750 mg of the investigational drug (AQ-13) by mouth over 3 days or the current standard treatment, which is 2 doses of Coartem twice daily for 3 days. The hypothesis underlying this study is that AQ-13 will be similarly effective to Coartem for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to both chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant parasites.

	<detailed_description>This is an initial efficacy study (Phase 2 Proof of Concept Study) of a candidate antimalarial in human subjects with uncomplicated malaria caused by the most common and most important parasite in Africa (Plasmodium falciparum). This study will enroll 66 adult Malian males with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and randomize them to treatment with 1750 mg of the investigational drug (AQ-13) by mouth over 3 days or the current standard treatment, which is 80 mg of artemether and 480 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. The hypothesis underlying this study is that AQ-13 will be similarly effective to Coartem for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to both chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant parasites.</detailed_description>
