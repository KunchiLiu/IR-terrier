	<brief_title>Delayed Start to Ovarian Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past two decades, the success rate of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has dramatically increased. This increase is attributed to improvements in embryo culture, laboratory conditions, and optimization of ovarian stimulation protocols. Over the past years, there has been more interest in altering the ovarian stimulation protocol to improve outcomes. For example, recently our group found that a modification of ovulation trigger toward a more physiologic process improves oocyte quality and pregnancy outcomes. Others have suggested minimal stimulation improves in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. The investigators propose to further investigate modifying the ovarian stimulation for women who have "decreased" ovarian reserve. The investigators propose that a delayed start to ovarian stimulation will improve oocyte maturation and quality and pregnancy outcomes. No published studies to date have evaluated if a delayed start to ovarian stimulation improves pregnancy outcomes. However, the investigators hypothesize that the use an antagonist for a delayed start of stimulation will work by one of two mechanisms: I. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further recruitment of early antral follicles. II. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further FSH responsiveness in existing follicles to synchronize the primary cohort, thereby increasing the total number of follicles.</detailed_description>
