	<brief_summary>Plantar fasciitis presents clinically as pain in the inner heal, which is the result of degeneration of the plantar fascia, an arch supporting ligament of the foot. It manifests predominantly in those subjected to sustained weight bearing or repetitive pounding activities. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of inferior foot pain. Although most cases resolving within 6 months, traditional treatment regiments such as orthotics and physiotherapy are occasionally unsuccessful in treating this limitation leading to chronic symptoms (Neufeld &amp; Cerrato, 2008; Rompe, 2009; Roxas, 2005). Platelets are central players in clotting, inflammation and the wound healing response. Research has shown the potential of platelet rich plasma to accelerate wound healing in a variety of conditions including maxillo-fascial and plastic surgery, chronic wound healing and orthopaedics. Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP) is a novel treatment that may accelerate the healing of injured tissue. Treatment with ACP involves taking a blood sample from the patient, isolating the platelets and injecting them back into that patient at the injury site</brief_summary>
