	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to test a single dose of intranasal oxytocin, compared to placebo, in a within subjects, crossover design, to see if oxytocin will improve satiety signaling (behaviorally and/or by self report) compared to placebo. If this single dose pilot paradigm shows an increase in satiety, it may be tested in follow-up studies as a prevention or treatment for weight gain and overeating in people with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
