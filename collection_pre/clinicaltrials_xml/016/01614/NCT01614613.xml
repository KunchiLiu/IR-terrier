	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to test the performance of an investigational Bayer Blood Glucose (BG) meter and five additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMSs). The goal was to obtain glucose samples from subjects with diabetes across the meter operating ranges. A capillary sample was collected from each subject at 3 different times during the visit to obtain natural capillary blood samples with a range of glucose concentrations. Some blood samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels and glucose solution was added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). All lancings and testing were performed by study staff.</brief_summary>
