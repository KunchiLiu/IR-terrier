	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have a non-G551D cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gating mutation (any one of the following CFTR mutations: G178R, G551S, S549N, S549R, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Who Have a Non-G551D CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Gating Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivacaftor is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in subjects with CF. Results from Phase 3 studies (VX08-770-102 [Study 102] [NCT00909532] and VX08-770-103 [Study 103] [NCT00909727]) showed that ivacaftor is effective in the treatment of subjects with CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation, as evidenced by sustained improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride concentration) and corresponding substantial, durable improvements in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and weight gain. Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and reasons for premature discontinuation and results of safety assessments. Ivacaftor (Trade Name Kalydeco; 150 mg tablets) was initially approved in the United States for the treatment of CF in subjects 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene.</detailed_description>
