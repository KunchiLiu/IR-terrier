	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this real-world comparative effectiveness research (CER) study is to reduce disability among older home health patients by treating their pain more effectively. To achieve this goal the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of a physical therapist (PT) delivered intervention provided to VNSNY home health care patients with activity-limiting pain. The intervention is an evidence-based non-pharmacological program to reduce pain and pain-related disability that utilizes cognitive-behavioral pain self-management (CBPSM) techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Pain to Reduce Disability Among Older Home Health Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will compare the effectiveness of usual care provided to older home health patients admitted with activity-limiting pain to usual care plus instruction by PTs in CBPSM techniques. The project also will examine differences in the effectiveness of the intervention among different race/ethnicity groups and individuals with different pain types, as well as the fidelity of intervention-group PTs to the CBPSM program. The specific aims of this CER study that will include sizeable numbers of Hispanics, non-Hispanic African Americans and non-Hispanic white patients ages 55 and older are: (1) to compare the effectiveness of usual care provided to older home health patients admitted with activity-limiting pain to usual care plus instruction by PTs in CBPSM techniques; and (2) to examine the heterogeneity of CBPSM treatment effects among patients with different pain conditions and minority group status.</detailed_description>
