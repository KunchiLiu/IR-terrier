	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study of temsirolimus (Torisel) combined with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Temsirolimus With Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in Children With Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) inhibit growth of pre-B and T-cell ALL cell lines in vitro and in ALL xenograft models. The MTI temsirolimus was chosen for use in this study due to its weekly intravenous dosing, its more predictable blood levels, and availability of a single-agent pediatric MTD and its sustained biologic effect due to conversion to sirolimus. This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus that can given in combination with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in relapsed ALL, LL or PTL. A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design will be used. Response to treatment will be evaluated. Biology tests will be done to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD), temsirolimus' effect on glucocorticoid resistance, and mTOR inhibition.</detailed_description>

Patients with leukemia or lymphoma who relapse while receiving maintenance chemotherapy will not be required to have a waiting period before enrollment onto this study. At least 14 days must have elapsed after the completion of cytotoxic therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 14 days after the last dose of a longacting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for shortacting growth factor. Biologic (antineoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair Immunotherapy: At least 42 days after the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines. or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapy. Monoclonal antibodies: At least 3 halflives of the antibody must have elapsed after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody. (ie: Rituximab = 66 days, Epratuzumab = 69 days). Patients must have been off blinatumomab infusion for at least 7 days and all drugrelated toxicity must have resolved to grade 2 or lower as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria XRT: At least 14 days after local palliative XRT (small port); At least 84 days must have elapsed if prior TBI, craniospinal XRT or if greater than or equal to 50% radiation of pelvis; At least 42 days must have elapsed if other substantial marrow radiation. Stem Cell Infusion: No evidence of active graft vs. host disease and at least 84 days must have elapsed after transplant or stem cell infusion. Study specific limitations on prior therapy: Patient may not have received therapy with an mTOR inhibitor. Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined as: Blood counts are not required to be normal prior to enrollment on trial. However, platelet count must be greater than or equal to 20,000/mm3 to initiate therapy (may receive platelet transfusions). Patients should not be known to be refractory to red blood cell or platelet transfusions. Adequate Renal Function Defined as: Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR greater than or equal to 70ml/min/1.73 m2 or Normal serum creatinine based on age and gender.
