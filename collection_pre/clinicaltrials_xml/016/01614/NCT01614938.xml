	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Radiation With Cetuximab or Cisplatin in Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. A phase Ⅱ study conducted by Hui et al. showed that neoadjuvant docetaxel-cisplatin (TP) chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy was superior to the standard concomitant chemoradiation in terms of the 3-year OS without significantly exacerbating the acute toxicities. Moreover, Bonner et al. demonstrated that RT with concurrent Cetuximab significantly improved the 5-year OS and did not increase the treatment induced toxicities when compared with RT alone. Therefore, we initiated this study to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the two regimens, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with cetuximab or weekly cisplatin for locally advanced NPC.</detailed_description>
