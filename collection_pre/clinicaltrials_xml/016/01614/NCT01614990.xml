	<mesh_term>Cachexia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Subjects â‰¥18 years of age with histological diagnosis of incurable cancer (solid tumor), 2. ECOG performance status of 02, 3. Presence of cancerrelated cachexia defined as an involuntary weight loss of at least 5% of the preillness body weight over the previous 6 months, and 4. Provide written informed consent prior to screening. 1. Obesity (body weight &gt;140 Kg); 2. Recent active excessive alcohol or illicit drug use; 3. Severe depression as determined by the investigator; 4. Other causes of cachexia such as: Liver disease (AST or ALT &gt; 3x normal levels); renal failure (creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL), untreated thyroid disease, class IIIIV CHF, AIDS, other cancer diagnosed within the past 5 years other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, severe COPD requiring use of home O2; 5. Inability to increase food intake (e.g., esophageal obstruction, intractable nausea and vomiting); 6. Any condition that would prevent the subject from performing the research procedures (e.g. unstable coronary artery disease); 7. Use of growth hormone, megestrol, Marinol, or any other anabolic agents, appetite stimulants (including corticosteroids other than dexamethasone at the time of IV chemotherapy administrations), tube feeding, or parenteral nutrition during the 1 month prior to entering the study; 8. Recent administration (less than 1 week) of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (Hesketh scale class 45); subjects may otherwise be undergoing chemotherapy. 9. Being female and pregnant, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential. (Note: Lack of childbearing potential for female patients is satisfied by: a) being post menopausal; b) being surgically sterile; c) practicing contraception with an oral contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm, or condom with spermicide for the duration of the study; or d) being sexually inactive. Confirmation that the patient is not pregnant will be established by a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at the time of enrollment. 10. Coadministration of drugs that prolong QT interval (see appendix XI), CYP3A4 inducers (see appendix XII), or other investigational agents (a washout period of five times the half life of drugs that prolong QT will be allowed with approval of prescriber). 11. Conditions that would preclude from successfully scanning subjects in MRI: Claustrophobia (this would make lying in the scanner very uncomfortable); b. having a pacemaker, aneurysm clips, neurostimulators, cochlear implants, metal in eyes, steel worker, or other implants; c. History of Seizures d. History of head injuries resulting in loss of consciousness &gt; 10 minutes.</criteria>
