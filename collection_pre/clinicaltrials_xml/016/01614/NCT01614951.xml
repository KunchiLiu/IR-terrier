	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with a preoperative reduced pulmonary function have a better preserved oxygenation capacity after open heart surgery, using either pulmonary perfusion or pulmoplegia compared with TAVI and the control-group with standard ECC (Extra Corporal Circulation).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Planned and urgent surgery on legally competent patients over 18 years: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Aortic Valve Replacement Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery + Aortic Valve Replacement Transcatheter AorticValve Implantation 2. Spirometry FEV1 measurement show less than or equal to 80% of the anticipated. We expect that these patients provide the largest signal with lung protective interventions in relation to lung healthy patients. Previous surgery on the heart or lungs Previous thoracic irradiation Preoperative heart failure (ejection fraction below 20%). Surgical demanding mitral regurgitation Unstable patients (heart rate above 100 and systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg) Intubated patients Patients with an ongoing preoperative treatment with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Patients with renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis Pregnant and lactating</criteria>
