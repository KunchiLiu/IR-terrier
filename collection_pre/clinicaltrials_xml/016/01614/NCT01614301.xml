	<brief_summary>A prospective phase I and consecutive phase II, twoarm, randomized multi-center trial of temsirolimus in combination with pioglitazone, etoricoxib and metronomic low-dose trofosfamide versus dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with advanced melanoma Phase I: To determine the dose of temsirolimus to be used in phase II part of the study Phase II: To determine overall survival Secondary objectives - To evalulate response rate - To evaluate time to progression (TTP) - To evalulate time to partial response (time to PR or better)(TPR) - To evaluate quality of life - To evaluate tolerability and safety</brief_summary>
