	<brief_title>Multicenter Pilot-study for the Therapy of Medulloblastoma of Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As medulloblastoma in adult patients are very rare (1.1% of all brain tumors), adults are often treated in the scope of expanded access treatments or within pediatric studies; although, it is not known whether medulloblastomas act in the same way in adulthood and in childhood. This is the first study to investigate the significance of a combination of a radiochemotherapy (vincristin) and a following maintenance chemotherapy (vincristin, cisplatin and CCNU) in adult patients with medulloblastoma with the purpose to have a starting point for the development of chemotherapeutical protocols in adults.</detailed_description>
