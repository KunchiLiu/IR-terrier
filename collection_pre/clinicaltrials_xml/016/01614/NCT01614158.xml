	<brief_summary>This present research project intends to collect five quantitative test series: - perimetric examination using static stimuli, assessing the entire (80 degree) visual field with a fast thresholding algorithm (GATE) [Schiefer 2008] to know the extent/ magnitude of the visual field defect and its variability within the cohort and over time - D-BCVA, using FrACT [Bach 2007] and EDTRS chart [Ferris 1982] - RAPD (using swinging flashlight test). - IOP (using applanation tonometer) - RNFT and RNFV using Spectralis OCT (star scan, ring scan 2,8 mm, and volume scan) Optic disk morphology will be documented by fundus photography. This assessment of the above-mentioned data is needed in order to allow for estimation of the spontaneous course / fluctuation of the (quantified) functional and morphometric parameters of the N-AION patients during the follow-up period. This is essential for the estimation of the sample size of the subsequently intended SINN study, that is intended to compare different therapeutic strategies in N-AION patients.</brief_summary>
