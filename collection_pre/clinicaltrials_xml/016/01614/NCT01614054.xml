	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that a patient-centered survey asking about smoking habits, with the option for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) will increase the prescription rates among health care providers (HCP). The investigators also believe that this intervention can also lead to increased referrals to smoking cessation clinics and ultimately increase rates of smoking cessation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Replacement Provided at a Tertiary Care Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since the past decade, there has been an increased awareness of the effects of smoking of general health. In 2000, 18.1% of all US deaths were related to tobacco use. Multiple trials have proven that providing nicotine-replacement therapies to help smoking cessation were efficacious with various types of populations. However, smoking has not been eradicated in North America and was associated with a 3.1 million YPLL (years of potential life lost), along with 96.8 billion in productivity losses in the US4. We are carrying out a study of 200 inpatients on a general medicine ward to attempt to improve prescription rates of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and smoking cessation. Our goal is to use a patient centred approach to determine which patients would benefit from NRT and which patients would be in the contemplative stage of smoking cessation. We will want to look at whether a simple, short survey taken by patients can encourage the health care provider (HCP) to provide more NRT and more referrals to a smoking cessation clinic. We hope that this tool will improve the ability of HCP to provide optimal, comprehensive care. The study's findings should help to guide future practices for hospitalized smokers. Currently, standard treatment involves NRT being prescribed completely at the discretion of the physician. This occasionally involves a discussion with the patient regarding their preferences, but more often is a unilateral decision made by the health care provider. Additionally, we believe that this method misses a lot of potential patients who may benefit from this therapy but are otherwise not identified. We will not be using a placebo.</detailed_description>
