	<brief_summary>Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia, also referred to as intra-epithelial neoplasia, are well recognized precursors of gastric cancer. Apart from endoscopic surveillance, there is no other intervention which predictably eradicates pre-cancerous gastric lesions. Endoscopic radiofrequency ablative (RFA) therapy has been recently shown to be highly effective in eradicating both IM and dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus. However, the potential role of RFA to remove gastric IM and dysplasia remains unknown. In this study, we determine the feasibility of using endoscopic RFA in treating early gastric neoplasia (metaplasia and dysplasia). Patients with gastric metaplasia and/or dysplasia will be treated with endoscopic RFA. The safety and effects of RFA will be determined.</brief_summary>
