	<brief_title>Do Patients With Early Post Operative Recurrence of Pelvic Organ Prolapse Have a Genetic Predisposition?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse develops as a result of a loss of support provided by the muscles and fascia that constitute the pelvic floor. Several recent population studies have estimated the prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse at between 10% and 30%. One in nine women will undergo surgery for these disorders in her lifetime and of these, one third will undergo repeated surgeries. The correction of pelvic organ protrusion is aimed at restoring the pelvic floor functional status and ultimately improving the patients quality of life. There are a few studies that have explored the genetic predisposition to developing pelvic organ prolapse but none so far looks at genetic factors involved in prolapse recurrence after adequate prolapse repair. There are two groups of women: women who underwent adequate repair of their prolapse and had an unexplained early recurrence. And a second control group of women who underwent the same prolapse repair procedure and had no further prolapse recurrence.</detailed_description>
