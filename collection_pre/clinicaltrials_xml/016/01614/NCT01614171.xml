	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis pseudoglioma (OPPG) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition of childhood osteoporosis and congenital blindness for which new treatments are needed. We have found that body fat is increased in OPPG and muscle mass is reduced. We hypothesize that growth hormone therapy will improve muscle mass and bone strength in OPPG.</brief_summary>
