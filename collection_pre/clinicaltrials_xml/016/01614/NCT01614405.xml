	<brief_summary>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) develop progressive liver disease and often require liver transplantation. The cause of disease is unknown. It is thought to occur as a result of an infection in subjects that are more susceptible to disease than others. The investigators found evidence of retrovirus infection in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The investigators found that most patients with PBC have evidence of viral infection. Since then the investigators have conducted clinical studies using anti-viral therapy. The investigators found that PBC patients treated with combination anti-retrovirus therapy experienced significant reversal of the disease process. However, the changes were not substantial and the investigators are now looking for better antiviral regimens. Now the investigators have found a mouse model with a similar virus infection that develops a similar biliary disease. Importantly, the investigators found that antiviral therapy blocks the development of the disease in this mouse. The investigators have used this model to find safer and more effective antiviral treatments for patients with PBC. The investigators have now found out that a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy with Truvada and Kaletra stops disease in the mouse and plan to use this combination to see if it works in patients with PBC.</brief_summary>
