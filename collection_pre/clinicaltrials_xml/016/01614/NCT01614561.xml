	<brief_summary>This was a multicenter survey of patients who were on lipid -lowering pharmacological treatment in 2 Levant countries namely Jordan and Lebanon. The purpose is to study the effects of cholesterol lowering drugs on the blood cholesterol levels of patients in Jordan and Lebanon. Data collected from each patient took place at a single visit. Each participating doctor filled the investigator questionnaire on his/her experience and perception of the management of the hypercholesterolemia of his/her patients. Each doctor was asked to indicate his/her general attitude on the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia, the existing guidelines and goals and the various treatment options for high cholesterol in blood. Before being assessed by the investigator, patients recorded, on the patient questionnaire, their awareness of high blood cholesterol , their current lipid-lowering treatment schedule, their understanding of their condition and compliance in taking the medications on time. The investigators completed a Patient Record Form (PRF) with the patient's basic information, cardiovascular risk factors and the cardiovascular medical history, current lipid lowering drug treatment and the reason for the current therapy. A blood sample under fasting condition was drawn from each subject. A central laboratory in Jordan received all samples. Every sample was analyzed for its cholesterol blood level, fasting sugar level and hemoglobin A1C levels.</brief_summary>
