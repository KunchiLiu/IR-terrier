	<brief_title>Comparison of Breathing Pattern During Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist Ventilation and Pressure Support Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligibility : healthy subject without respiratory complications in the past Subjects will breath spontaneously without mechanical ventilation, with Pressure Support Ventilation and with Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist during. Three levels of pressurisation will be tested : 5 cmH2O, 8 cmH2O and 12 cmH2O Duration of each condition will be about 15 minutes. Measurements will include:Flow, airway pressure, SaO2, PtCO2, diaphragmatic electromyography, chest wall motion by optoelectronic plethysmography</detailed_description>
