	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to implement and assess a behavioral and structural intervention in Russia designed to support and motivate HIV-infected narcology heroin dependent patients (i.e., IDUs) to engage (i.e., initiate and retain) in HIV medical care and ultimately improve their HIV outcomes. The central hypothesis is that an intervention that involves coordination between the narcology and HIV systems via HIV case management delivered by a peer to help motivate and reduce barriers to HIV care will lead to engagement in HIV care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study "Linking Infectious and Narcology Care (LINC)" is to improve upon the treat and retain dimensions of the "seek, test, treat, and retain" paradigm in Eastern Europe. We will implement and assess a behavioral and structural intervention in Russia designed to support and motivate HIV-infected narcology heroin dependent patients (i.e., IDUs) to engage (i.e., initiate and retain) in HIV medical care and ultimately improve their HIV outcomes. LINC is a clinical model designed to coordinate narcology and HIV systems of care using elements shown to facilitate engagement in medical care: HIV case management and point-of-care CD4 testing. The central hypothesis is that an intervention that involves coordination between the narcology and HIV systems via HIV case management delivered by a peer to help motivate and reduce barriers to HIV care will lead to engagement in HIV care. Implementation research recognizes that effective interventions may not translate successfully across different contexts and systems. Hence, we will assess the organizational and operational issues that drive engagement in HIV care in Russia. The project will be undertaken by an international research team experienced in addressing HIV, substance use, and clinical interventions in Russia. This proposal's Specific Aims are to assess the effectiveness of the LINC intervention compared to standard of care on 4 distinct outcomes: 1) initiation of HIV care (&gt; 1 visit to HIV medical care) within 6 months of enrollment; 2) retention in HIV care (&gt; 1 visit to medical care in 2 consecutive 6 month periods) within 12 months; 3) appropriate HIV care (prescribed ART if CD4 cell count is &lt;350 or having a second CD4 count if CD4 â‰¥350 within 12 months; and 4) improved HIV health outcomes (CD4 cell count at 12 months). The final Specific Aim is to establish the contextual factors that influence adoption and sustainability of the LINC intervention in Russia. If LINC can embed effectively within Eastern European medical systems, then it has the potential to be widely implemented in this region of the world and have a major impact on the HIV epidemic among IDUs.</detailed_description>
