	<brief_summary>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a common cause of acquired in-hospital renal insufficiency and is associated with prolonged hospitalization and unfavorable early and late outcomes. The investigators sought to compare 4 different strategies (intravenous high-dose of N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, the combination of both, and saline alone) in the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary angiography using high-osmolar contrast media defined by creatinine and cystatin C serum levels.</brief_summary>
