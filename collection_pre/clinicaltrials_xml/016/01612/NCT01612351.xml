	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a three method risk adapted design using induction chemotherapy, transoral surgery and radiation chemotherapy will lessen toxic effects and make treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) better.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodality Risk Adapted Tx Including Induction Chemo for SCCHN Amenable to Transoral Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm non-randomized two-stage phase II trial in previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) arising in the oral cavity, oropharynx, or supraglottic larynx amenable to a transoral surgical approach. Treatment will consist of 3 parts: neoadjuvant induction with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination with daily lapatinib for 6 weeks (PART 1) prior to transoral surgery (PART 2). Post-operative treatment (PART 3) will vary depending on the risk category assigned to the patient following surgery as follows: no further treatment or treatment limited to involved field radiation (low risk), ipsilateral radiation concurrent with weekly chemotherapy ( medium risk); or cisplatin every 3 weeks and daily lapatinib concurrent with bilateral radiation (high risk).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Previously untreated, histologically proven primary squamous cell carcinoma arising in the oral cavity, oropharynx, or supraglottic larynx, and amenable to transoral approach Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 (see Appendix C) Measurable disease as per RECIST1.1 Age ≥18 years Adequate bone marrow function as demonstrated by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3; Hgb &gt; 10 g/dL (use of transfusion to reach this threshold prior to study initiation is acceptable); Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Adequate hepatic and renal function as demonstrated by: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL; Creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥ 40mL/min as measured via CockcroftGault Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be &gt; the lower limit of normal (LLN) per institutional standards by either echocardiography or radionuclidebased multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) Negative serum βhCG pregnancy test within 72 hours of day 1 of induction chemotherapy in women of childbearing potential All males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception during the study. Adequate contraception is defined as any medically recommended method (or combination of methods) as per standard of care. Females of nonchildbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy Signed an institutional review board (IRB)approved informed consent document for this protocol. T1N0 disease or T2N0 disease Any metastatic disease Not considered eligible for any of the chemotherapy agents included in the induction regimen. Current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment) Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to day 1 of study treatment from which the patient has not completely recovered Current use of a prohibited medication or requires any of these medications during treatment with lapatinib prior to study entry Receiving any investigational agent currently, or within 2 weeks of Day 1 of treatment on this study Active, serious infection, medical, or psychiatric condition that would represent an inappropriate risk to the patient or would likely compromise achievement of the primary study objective, including unstable angina, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled infection, or myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to study entry Adequate swallowing function or gastrictube for drug administration. Of note, lapatinib can be administered via Gtube in a slurry for patients who cannot swallow Other prior or concomitant malignancies with the exception of: Nonmelanoma skin cancer; Insitu malignancy; Lowrisk prostate cancer after curative therapy; Other cancer for which the patient has been disease free for ≥ 3 years Pregnant or lactating women, or adults of reproductive potential who do not agree to use adequate contraception during study treatment (see definition of adequate contraception</criteria>
