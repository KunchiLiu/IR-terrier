	<brief_summary>Personalized treatment approaches and antiplatelet drug choice have been proposed to optimize safety of coronary stenting by reducing heart attacks and repeat interventions while simultaneously minimizing adverse bleeding events. This study compares the efficacy of two laboratory guided treatment algorithms to personalize antiplatelet medication choice after coronary stenting</brief_summary>
