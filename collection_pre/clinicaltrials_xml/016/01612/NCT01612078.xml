	<brief_summary>Orthostatic hypotension is a major complication of hemodialysis and interferes with everyday activities in hemodialysis patients. Since information regarding the use of droxidopa in clinical trials relating to orthostatic hypotension of chronic hemodialysis patients is limited in Taiwan, this study is designed for evaluation the efficacy and safety profile of droxidopa on orthostatic hypotension treatment / prevention in hemodialysis patients.</brief_summary>
