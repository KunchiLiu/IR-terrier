	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, unblinded sub-study to the E-30 to gather physiological data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-Dimensional Accelerometer Sub-Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This sub-study to the E-30 is designed to collect vital signs, accelerometer and ECG data on subjects, and will consist of two phases. Phase 1 is designed to collect data in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) and Phase 2 is designed to collect data in an everyday (ambulatory) setting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(Phase 1) Subject be scheduled to participated in the E30 parent study for a minimum of 48 hours Subject has a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy based on a prior EMU visit (Phase 1&amp;2) Subject is currently enrolled or previously participated in the E30 study Subject must be 6 years of age or older (Sleep State: Optional) Subject must be 12 years of age Subject is currently enrolled in the E30S substudy and is willing to stay in a light controlled environment in the EMU for up to 120 hours (Phase 1&amp;2) Subjects with a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would affect his/her ability to participate in the substudy. Subject who has implanted defibrillator, pacemaker or Vagus Nerve Stimulation TherapyÂ® (VNS) System Subjects who are pregnant or lactating Subjects with severe psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject's successful completion of the substudy. Subjects 6 to 16 years of age with moderate/severe learning difficulties or those who may be at risk of selfharm. Subjects prescribed drugs specifically for a cardiac or autonomic disorder that in the investigator's opinion would affect heart rate response unless the patient has ictal tachycardia while taking said drugs. These include, but are not limited to, beta adrenergic antagonists ("beta blockers"). Subjects with cardiovascular arrhythmias or cardiac disease that would preclude the ability to detect intrinsic changes in heart rate due to activity, stress, or seizure. This would include but not be limited to chronic atrial fibrillation or chronotropic incompetence. Subjects with a history of dependence on alcohol or narcotic drugs within the past 2 years as defined by DSM IVR. (Sleep State: Optional) Subjects with a history if gastrointestinal disease (GI)or GI surgery Subjects with a history of difficulty swallowing Subjects with diabetes mellitus Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension Subjects with planned MRI during EMU stay</criteria>
