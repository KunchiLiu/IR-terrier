	<brief_summary>The current recommended antibiotic, Cefazolin, treatment for vascular surgery, provides coverage only for Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureaus (MSSA), other gram-positive bacteria, and some gram-negative bacteria which may not be adequate antibiotic treatment at the time of vascular surgery and result in an increased hospital length of stay, increased cost of care, and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality as a consequence of surgical site infections. Thus, the investigators want to compare whether Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureaus (MRSA) antibiotic prophylaxis with Cefazolin plus Daptomycin is superior to Cefazolin plus Vancomycin in the reduction of surgical site infection (SSI) following open arterial revascularization procedures requiring a groin plus lower extremity incision. The investigators hypothesis is that Cefazolin plus Daptomycin is superior to Cefazolin plus Vancomycin in the prevention of SSI for high risk patients undergoing open groin plus lower extremity procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vascular Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis Study (VSAPS 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is an increase in surgical site infection (SSI) due to MRSA. The current recommended antibiotic, Cefazolin, treatment for vascular surgery, provides coverage only for Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureaus (MSSA), other gram-positive bacteria, and some gram-negative bacteria. To demonstrate that MRSA coverage is needed in vascular surgery with prosthetic graft placement in areas of the body that is at high risk for infection, the investigators are initiating a second study of patients undergoing groin plus lower extremity procedures by using combination antibiotics such as Cefazolin plus Daptomycin, Cefazolin plus Vancomycin. By decreasing post surgical site and prosthetic infections, the investigators could significantly reduce vascular surgery mortality and morbidity. Cost and amputation rates the investigators feel could also be reduced. Patients will be randomized in two groups -- Cefazolin plus Daptomycin, Cefazolin plus Vancomycin and will be evaluated during post procedure before discharge or within 30 days and between 30 and 360 days, for postoperative complications including cellulitis, graft infection, sepsis, limb loss, graft failure, and length of stay. If a patient is re-hospitalized, reason for the return and whether it is related to the procedure will be evaluated. Additionally, is there a graft failure, amputation, infection, hematoma, pseudoanurysm will be assessed. In case of a wound infection, the type of organism and finally, length of this hospitalization will be recorded.</detailed_description>
