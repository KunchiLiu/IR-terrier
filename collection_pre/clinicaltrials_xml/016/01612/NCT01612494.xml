	<brief_summary>This single center, blinded, randomized controlled trial evaluated the use of hypertonic saline versus normal saline as therapy for the symptoms of pediatric concussion post head injury. The study hypothesis was that hypertonic saline would improve symptoms of pediatric concussion following head injury as measured on the self-reported Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale as compared to normal saline. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in change of reported pain in either group.</brief_summary>
