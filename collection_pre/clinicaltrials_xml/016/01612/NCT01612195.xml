	<brief_summary>Anal abscess-fistula disease is of common occurrence and has a significant impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. The course of abscess-fistula disease as well as its treatment modalities may affect anal continence. The present cohort study investigates the results of anal fistula plug surgery. In particular, this study focus on the impact of anal fistula plug surgery on fistula healing, quality of life, and anal continence. Fifty patients will be included and followed up at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery in the clinic of participating surgeons.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Success Rate, Continence, and Quality of Life With a Bioprosthetic Plug for Treating Complex Anal Fistula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anal abscess-fistula disease is of common occurrence and has a significant impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. The clinical course of abscess-fistula disease as well as its treatment modalities may affect anal continence. Anal fistula plug surgery is an Health Canada and FDA approved surgical treatment that has demonstrated promising results in terms of fistula healing and minimal patients' burden. The present cohort study prospectively investigates the results of anal fistula plug surgery performed in teaching hospitals affiliated to the University of Toronto. In particular, this study focus on the impact of anal fistula plug surgery on health-related quality of life, and its 2 major determinants anal continence and fistula healing. Fifty patients will be included and followed up at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery in the clinic of participating surgeons. Quality of life and anal continence will be measured with the validated Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2) and Fecal Incontinence Score Index (FISI) questionnaires, respectively. It is expected that the present study will provide objective information on the results and generalizability of anal fistula surgery, as well as on its impact on health-related quality of life and anal continence.</detailed_description>
