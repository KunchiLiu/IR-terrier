	<brief_title>Shensong Yangxin Capsule in the Treatment of Heart Failure Complicated With Ventricular Premature Beat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ventricular contractions is one of the most common arrhythmia in the patients with structural heart disease and heart failure, which is not only has the high incidence but also has a high predictive value of sudden death. The purpose of the study is to assess the effects of Chinese medicine Shensong Yangxin capsule for the chronic cardiac dysfunction complicated with ventricular premature beats, which based on the numbers of premature ventricular contractions in 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) as the main endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints are evaluation of the Shensong Yangxin capsule on cardiac function and quality of life. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial. Chronic heart failure patients(cardiac function is Class II-III) associated with premature ventricular contractions (premature number 720-10000 / 24h), who received standardized treatment for heart failure at least three months, were involved in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into Shensong Yangxin capsule group or placebo group, with the capsule administration of 4 granules t.i.d.for 12 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and evaluation of heart function were observed at baseline and 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcomes are the numbers of premature ventricular contractions in 24-hour ambulatory ECG, and the secondary outcomes are New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, NT-proBNP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD, 6 minute walking test and Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ).</detailed_description>
