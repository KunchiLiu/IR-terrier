	<brief_summary>This is a phase II intervention to propose a new melanoma chemoprevention agent. The investigators believe oxidative stress/damage in nevi is a probable indication for melanoma risk, and propose that reduced melanoma risk in humans can be inferred by protection of nevi from ultraviolet light (UV)-induced oxidative changes. The investigators will 1) evaluate whether administration of NAC around the time of UV exposure will reduce melanoma risk in high-risk patient populations with genetic susceptibility to UV-induced oxidative stress, and 2) examine key genetic variants that will identify which individuals are most likely to benefit from chemoprotection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must have at least 2 nevi (each &gt;6 mm diameter) not clinically suspicious for melanoma that can be biopsied. Must be able to receive informed consent and sign an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines. The patient is a minor (&lt; 18 years old). The patient cannot speak/understand English or Spanish. (NOTE: A Spanish consent form and certified interpreter can be made available if needed) The patient is pregnant. (NOTE: All female patients who have not had a hysterectomy and are not postmenopausal (i.e. postmenopausal for 1 year and not of childbearing potential) will have a urine pregnancy test.) The patient is a prisoner, critically or mentally ill, or otherwise incapacitated or considered vulnerable. The patient has history of allergic reaction to NAC. The patient has history of severe asthma. The patient has been taking NAC or any other oral antioxidant. The patient has recent history (i.e., 3 months) of sunless tanning (tanning bed) or extensive sunburn.</criteria>
