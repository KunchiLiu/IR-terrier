	<brief_summary>The physical examination before an abortion is usually performed by a physician. However, in many countries access to physicians is limited. To increase access to safe abortion this study wishes to examine if midlevel providers such as specially trained midwives can provide safe abortion services. Midwives in study were specially trained to perform early pregnancy ultrasound and if needed to consult a physician. The midwife then provided the abortion service as well as the contraceptive advice. Women were randomized to receive the service from a midwife or a physician.</brief_summary>
