	<brief_summary>This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of an additional preemptive, single, low-dose dexamethasone in terms of incidence and severity of postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV), pain level, and the safety in terms of wound complications in patients managed with our antiemetic protocol based on Ramosetron following TKA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Single, Low-dose Dexamethasone in Patients After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain and emesis can cause postoperative systemic complications and delay recovery and rehabilitation in patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore, patients who suffered from severe postoperative pain and emesis tend to be dissatisfied with their surgical treatments. Although contemporary protocols to control perioperative pain and emesis after TKA have been reported to substantially reduce postoperative pain and emesis compared with traditional measures, pain and emesis after TKA remain to be a challenging issue for patients and health care providers. In our previous study, the use of Ramosetron was found to reduce postoperative emetic events, but the antiemetic effects by Ramosetron were incomplete. In search of a further antiemetic measure, we identified the use of dexamethasone as the additional measure fortifying our antiemetic protocol using Ramosetron.</detailed_description>
