	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the influence of local application of Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) on the functional outcome and integrity of the arthroscopically repaired tendons in patients with massive tears of the rotator cuff.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Platelet-rich Fibrin on Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, randomized clinical trial was performed on 28 patients (22 females, 6 males) with an average age of 65 years (range, 53 to 77) undergoing complete arthroscopic repair of a massive rotator cuff tear. In 14 patients, after the repair was completed, 6 cc. of PRF (vivostat Â®) were locally applied to the repair site. In 14 patients no addition of PRF was performed. All patients underwent an arthro-MRI to evaluate the integrity of the repair and a clinical exam one year after the operation. All patients were then followed clinically at a minimum of 2 years. Functional outcome was evaluated with the Constant and DASH scores.</detailed_description>
