	<brief_title>Effect of Distal Needling on Knee Pain Using Acupuncture Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main novel features of this study: 1. First aim to assess the effect of distal needling on knee pain 2. Second aim to directly compare two acupuncture techniques, placebo, needling at "wrong" places and "correct" needling for knee pain Advantages of the study compared to published data: 1. Distal needling - enables assessment of range of motion (ROM) and pain level during needling. 2. Both acupuncture systems rely on minimal questioning, which simplifies the patient-practitioner interactions. 3. Exploratory studies in the clinic of DP show that it is possible to distinguish between "correct" and "incorrect" needling, at least in the short term. Long term effects have not been assessed yet.</detailed_description>
