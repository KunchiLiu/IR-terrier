	<brief_summary>Primary objectives: A. To evaluate the effect of Zortress® versus standard immunosuppression therapy on progression of CAC as evidenced by changes in Agatston scores from baseline and at 6, and 12 months in renal transplantation patients. B. To investigate progression of CAC in patients undergoing renal transplantation within the study period. Secondary objectives: 1. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard immunosuppression therapy on bone mass as evidenced by changes in quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). 2. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard immunosuppression therapy on activity of bone forming and resorbing cells as evidenced by changes in bone histology. 3. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard immunosuppression therapy on biochemical parameters of bone turnover as evidenced by changes in serum Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Bone-Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP), Sclerostin, Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), , serum CTX (C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen), and urinary NTX (N-terminal cross link telopeptide). 4. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard immunosuppression therapy on cardiovascular events, graft rejection and patient survival.</brief_summary>
