	<brief_summary>Diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) relies on a late marker, namely serum creatinine (SCr). New biomarkers are considered for early and sensitive detection of CIN. In particular, uNGAL has been used for early detection of AKI in the emergency department, after cardiopulmonary bypass or following CM administration. This study will be conducted to assess the possible value of urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (uNGAL) as an early detector of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in a large sized cohort of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary procedures (PCP) and whether or not uNGAL correlates with the volume of contrast medium (CM) used.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods. We will enroll all consecutive patients undergoing PCP with iomeprolum during a 3-month period at our institution. CIN will be defined as a â‰¥25% increase in SCr from baseline when measured 2-4 days after PCP. uNGAL will be measured at its peak with the Abbott ARCHITECT assay.</detailed_description>
