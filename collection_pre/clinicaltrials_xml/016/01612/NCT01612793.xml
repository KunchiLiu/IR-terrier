	<brief_title>Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Management of Bronchoconstriction in Patients Hospitalized With COPD Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary safety measurement for this study is the type, occurrence and severity of adverse events (anticipated and unanticipated), including serious and non-serious device-related events. The primary outcome measure is hospital length of stay (LOS) defined as the number of days from hospital admission to the date the subject meets the medical elements of the GOLD Discharge Criteria.</detailed_description>
