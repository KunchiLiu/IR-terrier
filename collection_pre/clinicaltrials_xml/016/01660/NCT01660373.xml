	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, open-label prospective randomized pharmacodynamic investigation of two anti platelet regimens in patients who are planned to undergo PCI for non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome(NSTE-ACS) for 24 hours 1. Ticagrelor : loading dose(180mg) followed by maintenance dose(90mg bid) 2. Tirofiban : 0.4ug/kg/min for 30min followed by 0.1ug/kg/min - both agents will be given on top of aspirin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Antiplatelet Effect of Ticagrelor vs Tirofiban in Patients With Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In combination with aspirin, P2Y12 receptor antagonist or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor(GPI) is now a recommended drug as the standard dual antiplatelet regimen in patients with acute coronary syndrome(1). Ticagrelor is a newly developed oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. It shows faster, greater and more consistent platelet inhibition as compared with previous P2Y12 receptor antagonist clopidogrel(2) and it also shows better clinical outcome and similar risk for bleeding as compared with clopidogrel(3).Interestingly, pharmacodynamic data of some studies showed excellent effect of ticagrelor in terms of inhibiting platelet activation apparently as high as that of GPI(2,4). Primary hypothesis: Ticagrelor have a comparable efficacy in platelet inhibition to GPI in patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. Statistical design : non-inferiority test</detailed_description>
