	<brief_summary>Pain during nuclear medicine breast lymphnode detection procedures has been reported as high as 8.8/10. Using Sodium Bicarbonate to alkalinize the radio-pharmaceutical injection, pain can safely be reduced from 6.6/10 to 4.7/10, during breast lymph node detection procedures. In sites other then the breast, using Bicarbonate to make the injection's pH closer to natural, attempts to lower the pain levels will be performed. Hypothesis: The perceived pain level during non breast sentinel lymph node techniques can be reduced by raising the pH of the injectate (Tc-99m SC) to near the physiologic level of pH 7.40.</brief_summary>
