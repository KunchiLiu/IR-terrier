	<brief_summary>In a previous study (NL33904.091.10) the investigators challenged 24 volunteers after Chloroquine Prophylaxis Sporozoites (CPS) immunization with 45, 30 or 15 infected mosquito-bites respectively. The availability of this immunized cohort opens the unique opportunity to determine protection to a heterologous challenge for both of the protected and unprotected volunteers as the previous challenge infection might have served as immunological boost to the unprotected volunteers. In the current observational, proof of principle study, the investigators aim to investigate the protection on an individual basis of these previously immunized and challenged volunteers against a heterologous P. falciparum challenge.</brief_summary>
