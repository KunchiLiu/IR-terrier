	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine which technique in using a vacuum erection device (VED) is best. Erectile dysfunction (ED) after robotic prostate cancer surgery is a concern for both the surgeon and the patient. Recent studies have shown that beginning to use the vacuum pump on a daily basis starting with in 2-8 weeks may help prevent the start of penile shrinkage. This is a potential issue that can occur because of decreased blood flow after prostate cancer surgery. This study will allow researchers to determine and compare vacuum therapy techniques and erectile function outcomes of patients who have prostate cancer surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine sexual function and penile morphometric outcomes for the post-robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) patients undergoing daily vacuum therapy using one of two randomized methods and whether these outcomes differ. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare compliance rates between the two randomized groups using the compliance questionnaire and a diary collected from patients at each follow up visit. II. Compare overall patient satisfaction with the recovery procedure between the two randomized groups utilizing the SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) questionnaire. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. GROUP A: Patients receive vacuum therapy daily over 10 minutes while holding erection for 2 minutes after undergoing RALP. Patients complete erection process 5 times. GROUP B: Patients receive vacuum therapy daily over 10 minutes while holding erection for 5 minutes after undergoing RALP. Patients complete erection process 2 times. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
