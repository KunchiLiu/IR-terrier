	<brief_summary>Eligible patients will receive subcutaneous vaccinations of the hTERT/survivin/CMV multipeptide vaccine and GM-CSF over a 24 month period. All patients will receive basiliximab 20 mg 1 day prior to the start of vaccinations. Prevnar vaccine will be administered at the time of Vaccines 1,3, and 5. Patients who remain clinically stable after the fourth vaccine, may continue to receive vaccinations every 4 weeks for up to 2 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-peptide Vaccine With Basilixumab for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>hTERT is widely found in breast cancer cells and has a role in tumor growth and development, making it attractive for immunotherapy. Also, recent data suggest that breast cancer is potentially responsive to immunological therapies. In one trial, patients with advanced cancer received a series of hTERT vaccinations and 4 of 7 patients with advanced breast or prostate carcinoma developed hTERT-specific T lymphocytes. Partial tumor regression was observed in 1 patient. In a second trial, 19 HLA A2+ patients with metastatic breast cancer were vaccinated with hTERT 1540 peptide in adjuvant with GM-CSF. 68% of patients exhibited immunological responses with development of CD8+ hTERT-specific T-cells. Overall survival of vaccine responders was signifiantly better than the overall survival on non-responders. In order to expand the number of possible immune responses and to potentially bypass immune tolerance, multiple peptides have been added to the vaccine. In addition, the monoclonal antibody basiliximab is included to decrease the regulatory T cells which prevent the immune system to work against the tumor, and GM-CSF and Prevnar are used to boost the immune system. Subjects will receive a maximum of 28 vaccinations over a 24 months period.</detailed_description>
