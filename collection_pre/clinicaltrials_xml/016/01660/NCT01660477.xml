	<brief_summary>The purpose of this two part study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of lopinavir/ritonavir and the effect of multiple doses of lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole. Part 1 of the study includes 12 subjects randomized to receive either isavuconazole alone or isavuconazole in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir. The purpose of Part 1 is to evaluate safety and tolerability and to establish the effect of multiple doses of lopinavir/ritonavir on isavuconazole. Part 2, if initiated, includes 54 subjects randomized to receive isavuconazole alone, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or isavuconazole in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.</brief_summary>
