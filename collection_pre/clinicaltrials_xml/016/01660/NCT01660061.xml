	<brief_title>Monitoring Anticoagulant Therapy in Antiphospholipid Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with an antiphospholipid syndrome receiving Vitamin-K antagonists for secondary prevention after a first thrombotic complication are known to be at higher risk of recurrent thrombotic events despite INR values in the therapeutic range. It ist also known that antiphospholipid antibodies can interfere with phospholipid-dependent tests (e.g. prothrombin time and INR). The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of interfering antiphospholipid antibodies. The intensity of anticoagulant therapy was assessed by measuring the INR using different thromboplastins and the CoaguChek system for INR self-assessment. Test results were compared to measurements of the phospholipid-independent chromogenic factor X. The second objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of recurrent thrombotic events during 1-year follow-up.</detailed_description>
