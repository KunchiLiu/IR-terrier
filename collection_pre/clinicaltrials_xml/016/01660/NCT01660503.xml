	<brief_title>Dose Effects of SCF on Calcium Metabolism and GI Microflora in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The growing knowledge of non-digestible oligosaccharide (NDO)-related health benefits has led to the identification of other fermentable carbohydrates which may improve bone balance and bone health parameters. One such carbohydrate is the corn derivative, soluble corn fiber (SCF). Already known for its association with improved intestinal health and influence on colonic microflora content, we have been studying the effects of SCF on calcium absorption and bone health. First we found that soluble corn fiber (SCF) greatly enhanced calcium utilization and bone properties in a growing rat model. Results from this study demonstrated that SCF was capable of increasing bone mineral content, density and bone strength parameters in 4-week old, male rats. Our study in adolescent boys and girls showed a 12% increase in calcium absorption after consuming 12 g SCF for 21 days compared to a control period in a crossover design using a controlled feeding metabolic balance approach. Given these profound changes on calcium absorption and in bone, a logical next step is to study a dose-response effect of SCF on calcium absorption, bone turnover, and gut microflora in free-living adolescents.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adolescent Caucasian girls between the ages of 1214. This population has been chosen because they exhibit higher risk for osteoporosis later in life.

History of smoking, alcohol use, illegal or nonprescription drug use History of disordered calcium or bone metabolism e.g. Paget's disease, hyper or hypocalcemia History of gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn's, celiac, inflammatory bowel disease) History of diseases that affect kidney or liver function. Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 5th percentile for age or greater than the 90th percentile for age Having a broken bone within the last 6 months.
