	<brief_title>A Safety Study of Carfilzomib, Cyclophosphamide &amp; Dexamethasone Prior to ASCT in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose finding pilot study to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of carfilzomib and cyclophosphamide with dexamethasone (Car-Cy-Dex) prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients with newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma. The study will also explore the efficacy of Car-Cy-Dex including overall response after induction therapy, overall response at 3 and 6 months post ASCT, and time to progression, progression free survival, and time to next therapy if it occurs within 6 months post ASCT.</detailed_description>

Patients with nonsecretory or hyposecretory MM Prior treatment for MM (prior radiation therapy or dexamethasone up to 160 mg for spinal cord compression is allowed. Other limited field radiation involving ≤ 1/3 of the pelvic area is also allowed) Plasma cell leukemia Pregnant or lactating females Major surgery within 21 days prior to first dose Congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class III to IV), symptomatic ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional intervention or myocardial infarction in the previous six months Acute active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 14 days prior to first dose Patients receiving active treatment or intervention for any other malignancy or patients who, at the Investigator's discretion, may require active treatment or intervention for any other malignancy within 8 months of starting study treatment. Serious psychiatric or medical conditions that could interfere with treatment Significant neuropathy (Grade 3, Grade 4, or Grade 2 with pain) at the time of the first dose and/or within 14 days before study treatment Contraindication to any of the required concomitant drugs, including antiviral (e.g. Valacyclovir) and protonpump inhibitor (e.g. lansoprazole). Corticosteroid therapy in a dose equivalent to dexamethasone ≥ 1.5 mg/day or prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day. (Steroid use is allowed if necessary to treat spinal cord compression and/or hypocalcaemia.) Patients in whom the required program of oral and IV fluid hydration is contraindicated, e.g. due to preexisting pulmonary, cardiac, or renal impairment Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.</criteria>
