	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to investigate the efficacy of MT-9938 compared with placebo after 2 weeks, to continue to evaluate efficacy for an additional 6 weeks, and to explore the effect of a reduction in itching intensity on health-related Quality of Life(QoL) domains, especially those which recent research suggests have a positive correlation with overall survival for this patient group. The study will consist of the following phases: Screening (1 to 2 weeks), Run in (1 week), double-blind Treatment (8 weeks), Washout (1 week) culminating in a Follow-up Visit (1 week after the last dose).</brief_summary>
