	<brief_title>Enhancement of Methylphenidate Treatment by Psychosocial Intervention and Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a parenting enhancement training (PET) for parents with children diagnosed with Attention Deficit-/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) already medicated with methylphenidate (MPH). This particular PET was developed at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Cologne and has already been evaluated in several studies. MPH treatment has been proven to be efficacious in the reduction of ADHD symptoms. However, despite optimal titration a substantial percentage of children still suffer from residual symptoms and impairment in psychosocial functioning. Therefore, there is still room for improvement in satisfaction with medication. Moreover, a substantial rate of patients with good treatment effects fails to comply with medication during the course of treatment. This parenting enhancement training (PET) mainly conducted via written materials and telephone support will be introduced in patients already treated with MPH. Effects are expected on symptoms of ADHD as well as on comorbid oppositional symptoms. Further outcome parameters are satisfaction with medication and medication compliance of MPH treatment, psychosocial functioning as well as parenting skills. Parenting skills are a main focus of the PET and ADHD symptoms shall be improved through improving parenting skills. Besides focusing on symptoms, recent research often focuses on improvement of quality of life and impairment in psychosocial functioning (e. g. family, school, leisure time) as well. Not only suffer patients from the main symptoms. Many patients suffer as well from the symptoms' consequences, which is often an overall impairment. Satisfaction with medication and medication compliance are fundamental conditions for the success of a long term medical therapy. However, many studies show a lack of compliance.</detailed_description>
