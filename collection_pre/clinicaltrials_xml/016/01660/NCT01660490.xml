	<brief_summary>An expert panel of surgeons agreed that there is not any established, standardized approach to the teaching of intraoperative imaging and that there may be practice gaps in decision making and the use of imaging among trauma surgeons. The panel is set to initiate a consensus-based evaluation process to develop a list of criteria for assessing images and would like to validate these criteria for differentiating good quality versus poor quality images in term of reliability and accuracy.</brief_summary>
