	<brief_summary>Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) represent 25 to 30% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas in western countries. DLBCLs are aggressive cancer but potentially curable with multi-agent chemotherapy. Whereas R-CHOP regimen has led to a marked improvement in survival, this disease remains a biologically heterogeneous entity. New therapeutic strategies are required including identification of patients' subgroups with different prognostic. This project is based on BMS_LyTrans and Goelams 075 clinical trial. A study of whole blood transcriptome in 75 DLBCL patients and in 87 controls showed that PD-L1 (CD274) gene was overexpressed in DLBCL patients. Preliminary results demonstrated that PD-L1 is detected in plasma of DLBCL patients with a significantly higher concentration than in controls. This protein was selected as a potential biomarker because of its established role in anti-tumoral immunity. Interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 is known to inhibit activation of immune responses by inducing T-lymphocytes anergy and/or apoptosis. Moreover, a direct involvement of PD-L1 in the protection of cancer cells from lysis by activated T lymphocytes has been demonstrated. PD-L1 expression has been described in several solid tumours, including ovary cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma and in hematological malignancies such as T-NHL, MM and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Furthermore the expression of PD-L1 by tumour cells is associated with poor prognosis. The blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach in aggressive cancers. These first results incite to identify the cells releasing soluble PD-L1 and to investigate its role in the anti-tumoral immunity in DLBCL patients. The aim of this study is to identify cells producing soluble PD-L1 in DLBCL patients at diagnosis in comparison to others tumours known to express PD-L1 (metastatic breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary purposes are : - To confirm the presence of plasma soluble form of PD-L1 in others malignancies - To study surface expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumour cells with multiparameter fow cytometry and Veridex® technology in DLBCL and metastatic breast cancer patients - To study surface expression of PD-L1 on circulating endothelial cells in DLBCL, Hodgkin lymphoma and metastatic breast cancer patients (subpart ended in late 2012) - To study surface expression of PD-L1 on different types of leukocytes (monocytes, B and T lymphocytes) - To separate circulating tumour cells expressing PD-L1 by immunomagnetic or Cell-sorting method - To develop ELISPOT technique to study the release of soluble PD-L1 in culture supernatants of selected cells (subpart ended mid 2013) - to evaluate the correlation between the expression of PD-L1 in the plasma and *) the expression of PD-L1 in the tumor, **) the expression of PD-L1 and other molecules in the bronchoalveolar liquid (whenever available from routine) in non-small cell lung cancer - to evaluate the response to treatment according to plasma PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer - to evaluate the susceptibility to develop a disease according to the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the PD-L1 gene in DLBCL and non-small cell lung cancer - Constitution of the different cohorts and collection of samples Main cohort : de novo DLBCL at diagnosis Secondary cohorts: Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer Control cohorts : healthy volunteers (blood donors), patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) - Quantification of plasma soluble PD-L1 in the different cohorts</detailed_description>
