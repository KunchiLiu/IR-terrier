	<brief_title>Comparison of Intranasal Kovacaine Mist, Tetracaine Alone, and Placebo for Anesthetizing Maxillary Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will employ a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design to assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) sufficient to allow completion of the Study Dental Procedure. A total of 140 subjects, randomized 2:2:1 (Kovacaine Mist:Tetracaine alone:Placebo) will be enrolled to achieve 125 completed subjects; a total of 50 Kovacaine Mist subjects, 50 tetracaine alone subjects and 25 placebo subjects. Recruitment will be from diverse dental patient populations. At the two study sites, a balanced enrollment of 70 subjects each is planned to allow for a potential 10% drop-out rate.</detailed_description>
