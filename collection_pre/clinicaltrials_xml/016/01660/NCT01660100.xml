	<brief_summary>Objective: This prospective study aims to examine the outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation after permanent pulmonary vein antrum isolation or pulmonary vein antrum isolation plus left atrial posterior wall isolation is proven by a repeat procedure. The study will be conducted in patients with different types of AF: paroxysmal AF (PAF) and non-PAF (Persistent AF and Long Standing Persistent AF). Hypothesis: In addition to permanent pulmonary vein antrum isolation, proven isolation of left atrial posterior wall is associated with more freedom from atrial arrhythmia at long-term follow-up after atrial fibrillation ablation, especially in non-PAF patients.</brief_summary>
