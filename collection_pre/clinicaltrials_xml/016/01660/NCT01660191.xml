	<brief_title>A Study Comparing CoQ10 Levels While Taking 3 Different Statins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins are known effectively treat high cholesterol and heart disease. However, statins may lower endogenous levels of Coenzyme10 (CoQ10). This decrease in CoQ10 levels may be responsible for side effects such as myalgia. Previous studies have shown that Pitavastatin may not affect CoQ10 levels as other statins do, while still lowering cholesterol. In this study, investigators intend to compare the plasma levels of CoQ10 in patients taking 3 different FDA-approved statins, in equipotent doses.</detailed_description>
