	<brief_summary>This phase I dose escalation study will evaluate alisertib, an Aurora A kinase inhibitor, when given in combination with the selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor pazopanib in patients with advanced, previously treated non-hematologic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN8237 and Pazopanib in Combination for Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alisertib is taken orally twice a day for the 1st 7 days of a 21 day cycle. Pazopanib is taken orally once a day continuously beginning on day 10 of cycle 1 to allow for alisertib pharmacokinetics (PKs). Treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. PKs will be done on all patients in association with the last dose of alisertib cycles 1 and 2.</detailed_description>
