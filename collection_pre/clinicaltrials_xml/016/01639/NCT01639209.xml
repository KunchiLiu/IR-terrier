	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare the outcomes of pneumatic retinopexy with the outcomes of vitrectomy (with or without scleral buckle) for the management of retinal detachment, in terms of anatomical success, functional success and impact on patient quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pneumatic Retinopexy Versus Vitrectomy for Retinal Detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)is an acute, sight threatening condition, with an incidence of approximately 10 per 100,000 population. Both of the treatments under investigation are widely used and accepted by vitreoretinal surgeons, but randomised, prospective comparison of the two techniques has not been reported in the scientific literature to date. Currently, the management decisions surrounding primary retinal detachment are grounded on a weak evidence base. The findings of this study will allow vitreoretinal surgeons and their patients to select the most appropriate intervention for that individual, in an informed and holistic manner.</detailed_description>
