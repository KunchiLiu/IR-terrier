	<brief_summary>Regional metabolic changes associated with response to 6 weeks of citalopram treatment, using 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography imaging, will be characterized (FDG PET). The following hypothesis will be tested: Antidepressant response or remission in depressed BPD patients will be associated with changes in cortical (prefrontal, parietal, premotor) and paralimbic (hippocampus, anterior cingulate, subgenual cingulate, posterior cingulate, and anterior insula) regions, consistent with SRI antidepressant response in unipolar depressed patients.</brief_summary>
