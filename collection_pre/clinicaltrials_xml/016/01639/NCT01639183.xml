	<brief_title>Power Toothbrush Use in Nursing Homes to Eliminate Mouth and Body Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well recognized worldwide that residents of nursing homes have poor oral health primarily due to caregiver resistance in the provision of daily oral hygiene care. Fear of being bitten or assaulted by the resident as well as lack of time and discomfort with working in the mouth, are reasons cited for this resistance. It is also now recognized that inflammation in the mouth can raise overall inflammation within the body potentially leading to serious health consequences. Numerous studies involving periodic professional interventions as well as education and training of caregivers in oral care provision have not met with a great deal of success. Caregivers in some studies have indicated preference to power toothbrushes as they are bulkier and longer eliminating the need for insertion of fingers into the mouth and subsequently alleviating fears of being bitten. This study hypothesizes that caregiver utilization of a power toothbrush may increase their compliance with daily oral care provision and could potentially result in elimination of oral and systemic inflammation.</detailed_description>
