	<brief_summary>A growing interest in monitoring cardiac output (CO) non-invasively has emerged, however its determination has been difficult using the standard approaches. The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy and precision of pulse contour analysis (PCA) as compared to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).</brief_summary>
