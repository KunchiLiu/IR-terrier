	<brief_summary>Patients with early cervical cancer are usually treated with radical hysterectomy + pelvic lymph-node dissection. The study randomizes patients in 2 arms. The control arm is the classical surgical treatment including identification of the sentinel nodes, full pelvic lymph-node dissection and radical hysterectomy. The experimental arm is only sentinel node identification + radical hysterectomy.</brief_summary>
