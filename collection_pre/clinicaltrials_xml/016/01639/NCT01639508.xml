	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase II study is to find out what effects cabozantinib (XL184) has, good and/or bad, in patients whose tumors one of the following gene changes RET, ROS1, or NTRK fusion, or increased MET or AXL activity. A phase II study looks at how effective a medication is at treating a specific type of cancer and collects information on the side effects of the study treatment. RET, ROS1, or NTRK fusion or increased MET or AXL activity gene leads to lung cancer cell growth. Cabozantinib is an oral medicine that inhibits of RET, ROS1, NTRK, MET, and AXL. In addition, this drug interferes with other cell pathways that also cause cancer cells to grow, form new blood vessels, and spread to other organs of the body. The goal of using cabozantinib is to shrink the cancer and to prevent it from growing Cabozantinib has been studied and shown to cause cancer shrinkage in other cancers such as medullary thyroid cancer and prostate cancer. We thus have a good idea of what side-effects it causes and can anticipate them.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject must fully meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study: 1. The subject has a pathologic diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma that is metastatic or unresectable. 2. Documented presence: Group A: KIF5B/RET or related variant RET fusions. Group B: any of the following aberrations ii. NTRK fusion iii. MET overexpression, amplification, or mutation iv. AXL overexpression, amplification, or mutation Group C: ROS1 infustion 3. The subject is ≥ 18 years old on the day of consent. 4. The subject has a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 70%. 5. The subject has organ and marrow function and laboratory values as follows: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3 without colony stimulating factor support 2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 3. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). For subjects with known Gilbert's . disease, bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL 4. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min. For creatinine clearance estimation, the Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used: Male: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 age) × wt (kg) / (serum creatinine × 72) Female: Multiply above result by 0.85 5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 × ULN if no liver involvement, or ≤ 5 × ULN with liver involvement 6. Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 1 mg/mg (113.2 mg/mmol) creatinine or 24hr urine protein of &lt; 1 g 7. Serum phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium ≥ LLN after adequate supplementation if necessary 8. The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and has signed the informed consent document. Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. 9. Women of childbearing potential include women who have experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal. 10. Postmenopause is defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months. Note: women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible reason. 1. Any type of systemic anticancer agent (including investigational) within 3 weeks of first dose of study treatment, or within 5 halflives of the agent whichever is shorter. Subjects on LHRH or GnRH agonists may be maintained on these agents. 2. Prior treatment with cabozantinib 3. Radiation therapy for bone or brain metastasis within 2 weeks, any other external radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 4weeks. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible. 4. The subject has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except alopecia and other nonclinically significant AEs. 5. Known uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastases or cranial epidural disease; subjects previously treated and on stable dose of corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants for &gt;10 days, or not requiring such medications, are eligible. Baseline brain scans are not required to confirm eligibility. Radiation therapy for bone or brain metastases within 2 weeks before first dose of study drug; or any other external radiation therapy or systemic treatment with radionuclides within 4 weeks before first dose of study drug. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible 6. The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarinrelated agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day), lowdose warfarin (≤ 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted. 7. The subject has experienced any of the following within 3 months before the first dose of study treatment: clinicallysignificant hematemesis or gastrointestinal bleeding Clinicallysignificant hemoptysis of ≥ 0.5 teaspoon (2.5ml) of red blood c. any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage 8.
