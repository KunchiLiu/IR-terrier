	<brief_summary>This phase I/II pilot trial seeks to demonstrate that prolonged administration of Campath-1H without prior marrow or stem cell harvesting can result in immunoablation similar to that achieved by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell sources in children and adolescents with severe treatment refractory systemic sclerosis (SSc).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Campath-1h Phase I/II Pilot Trial as Immunoablative Therapy for Refractory Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients, 8 to18 years of age, will be included if they have a proven diagnosis of diffuse cutaneous or systemic SSc as defined by the ACR criteria with evidence of active inflammatory disease Plus at least 1 of the following:SSc-related pulmonary disease with forced vital capacity (FVC) or hemoglobin-adjusted DLCO &lt; 70% and evidence of alveolitis by high-resolution CT scan or bronchoalveolar lavage. OR:History of SSc-related renal crisis or disease, not active at the time of screening OR:Moderate to severe upper and/or lower gastrointestinal involvement AND:Unacceptable toxicity or steroid dependence &gt; 0.3 mg/kg/d, OR:Failure to respond to, or unacceptable toxicity of MTX &gt; 1mg/kg in combination with cyclosporine or azathioprine or cyclophosphamide 2 kg/d or Rituximab 375 mg/m2 x 4 doses or Imatinib 800 mg/ OR:Disease recurrence after tapering medication above</detailed_description>

Unacceptable toxicity or steroid dependence &gt; 0.3 mg/kg/d, Failure to respond to, or unacceptable toxicity of MTX &gt; 1mg/kg in combination with cyclosporine or azathioprine or cyclophosphamide 2 kg/d or Rituximab 375 mg/m2 x 4 doses or Imatinib 800 mg/d, Disease recurrence after tapering medication above SSc patients, who fulfill the modified SCOT criteria, will be assessed for residual thymic function since our previous study of pediatric SSc patients demonstrated that the SSc patients had decreased thymic function as compared to age matched controls as measured by either TREC analysis or the number of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4+, CD31+). Patients with less than 50 CD3+, CD4+, CD45RA+, CD31+ cells/ul will be excluded because of concerns about their ability to reconstitute their immune system after immune ablation.
