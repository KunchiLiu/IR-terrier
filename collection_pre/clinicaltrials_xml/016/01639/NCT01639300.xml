	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses, as well as of repeated administrations of GNbAC1 in MS patients. Scientific research has shown that the expression of genes of a virus which is integrated in the Human genetic material, the Multiple Sclerosis associated RetroVirus (MSRV) could play a critical role in the causation of multiple sclerosis. GNbAC1 is an experimental medication, which neutralizes (i.e. inactivates) a protein of MSRV that might contribute to the development or deterioration of multiple sclerosis.</brief_summary>

Positive serology for viral hepatitis and HIV; Disease other than MS that could better explain his/her signs and symptoms; Previously treated with cladribine, lymphoid irradiation or depleting antibodies; Usage in the last 3 months of interferon beta or glatiramer acetate; Any usage in the last 6 months of mitoxantrone, cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy, natalizumab, fingolimod or immunoglobulin; Usage within 30 days prior to baseline of oral or systemic corticosteroids or ACTH; Inadequate liver function; Severe renal impairment; Severe psychiatric disorder; Known inability to undergo an MRI scan; Having participated in another clinical study within 6 months prior to study baseline except for patients who have participated or who are currently participating in an interventional study without any study drug intake.
