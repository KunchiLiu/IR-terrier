	<brief_title>COMPACT 2 - COMbining Plasma-filtration and Adsorption Clinical Trial 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock is a life-threatening clinical condition characterized by cardiovascular failure as a consequence of infection. Septic shock frequently causes multi-organ failure in the ICU. For this reason the extracorporeal therapies for the treatment of renal failure have become widespread in the ICU and, at the same time, new extracorporeal depurative techniques have been developed for the removal of inflammatory mediators. One of these techniques is CPFA (coupled plasma-filtration adsorption) that uses a sorbent once the separation between plasma and blood has been obtained with a plasma filter. The study objective is to clarify whether the application of high doses CPFA in addition to the current clinical practice is able to reduce hospital mortality in septic shock patients in intensive care unit. Secondary objectives are the resolution of septic shock and the reduction of ICU LOS (length of stay).</detailed_description>
