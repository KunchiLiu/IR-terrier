	<brief_summary>This study aims to use the corresponding pharmacogenetic analysis to increase the dose of irinotecan in the schemes commonly used standard chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer treatment first. The project aims to improve the therapeutic index of chemotherapy. This optimization is raised based on the administration of different doses of the drug depending on the genotype UGT1A1 gene. The research team proposes this project to demonstrate how the administration of high doses of irinotecan in the FOLFIRI scheme in patients with genotype UGT1A1 favorable (wild homozygous * 1 / * 1 and heterozygous * 1 / * 28), significantly improves the efficiency of the antineoplastic agent without significant increase in toxicity. Secondarily will assess the possible prognostic factors related to tolerance and efficacy. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of high doses of irinotecan in the FOLFIRI scheme in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a favorable genotype UGT1A1 (wild homozygous * 1 / * 1 and heterozygous * 1 / * 28).</brief_summary>
