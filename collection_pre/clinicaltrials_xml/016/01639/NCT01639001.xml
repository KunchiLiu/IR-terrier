	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, Randomized, Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Crizotinib single agent versus Chemotherapy Regimens (Pemetrexed/Cisplatin or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) in First-Line ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that Crizotinib is superior to first-line chemotherapy pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in prolonging Progression Free Survival (PFS) in East Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC whose tumors harbor a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene locus.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of locally advanced not suitable for local treatment, recurrent and metastatic nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus. No prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with brain metastases only if treated and neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks and are not taking any medications contraindicated in Exclusion Criteria Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document and willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures including completion of patient reported outcome [PRO] measures. Current treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial. Prior therapy directly targeting ALK. Any of the following within the 3 months prior to starting study treatment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack. Appropriate treatment with anticoagulants is permitted. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Grade &gt;=2, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation of any grade, or QTc interval &gt;470 msec. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Use of drugs or foods that are known potent CYP3A inducers/inhibitors Concurrent use of drugs that are CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. Known HIV infection History of extensive disseminated/bilateral or known presence of Grade 3 or 4 interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, including a history of pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis, but not history of prior radiation pneumonitis. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions (including severe gastrointestinal conditions such as diarrhea or ulcer) or psychiatric conditions, or endstage renal disease on hemodialysis, or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, and which would, therefore, make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
