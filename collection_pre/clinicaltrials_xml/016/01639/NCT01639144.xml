	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if applying PRP and PPP to surgical sites and the closing incision helps prevent infection and slow wound healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and Platelet-Poor Plasma (PPP) to Prevent Infection and Delayed Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, randomized study with patients blinded to either receiving platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) treatment or no treatment. We hypothesize that the antimicrobial properties of PRP and barrier properties of PPP (acting like a tissue sealant) will serve to inhibit deep incisional surgical site infection and help prevent delayed wound healing within 60 days of surgery. Thus, the incidence of infection and delayed wound healing will be lower in patients receiving PRP and PPP compared to patients who do not receive PRP and PPP. However, due to clinical equipoise, we do not know for certain that PRP and PPP is truly effective. The cost of preparing PRP and PPP is substantial, and involves a blood draw that would not otherwise be done. Thus, it is important to know if this treatment is effective or not.</detailed_description>
