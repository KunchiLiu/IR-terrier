	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial investigates the effect of the extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) on periodontal and endodontical parameters. The ESWT is a scientifically approved non invasive method to influence bone turnover and tissue regeneration. The hypotheses of this trial are that ESWT increases the periodontal stability of orthodontically aligned teeth as well as increase the blood flow. Increasing the periodontal stability would reduce the retention phase, relapse risk and accelerate the rehabilitation of the surrounding tissues.</brief_summary>
