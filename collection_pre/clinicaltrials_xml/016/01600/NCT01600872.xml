	<brief_summary>Both oxidative stress and Bisphenol A (BPA) had been associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). BPA, one of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), is an environmental estrogen used in the synthesis of plastics, is a "high-volume production" chemical with widespread human exposure. BPA was been reported in several female reproductive disturbance. However, the pathological pathway of BPA impact on female reproductive system had not been well-understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a role in the modulation of gamete quality and gamete interaction. Persistent and elevated generation of ROS leads to a disturbance of redox potential that in turn causes oxidative stress (OS). The first part of The investigators study is aim to evaluate the oxidative stress impact on the biochemical parameters in women with PCOS; the secondary part of the investigators study is to investigate the BPA on the clinical and biochemical of women with PCOS; finally, the investigators plan to test the hypothesis that BPA might increase oxidative stress and then elevated ROS in women with menstrual disturbance, furthermore, the role of oxidative stress and BPA impact on insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance will be also investigated. Study and control cases will be included. Serum total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), Bisphenol A (BPA), and clinical/biochemical parameters will be obtained for all cases. Oxidative stress and BPA will be evaluated with all clinical/biochemical parameters for all subjects.</brief_summary>
