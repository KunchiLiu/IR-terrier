	<brief_title>A Prospective Comparison of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Platelet-Rich Plasma Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently there are three treatments that are considered standard of care; rest, tenotomy and tenotomy with injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Tenotomy is performed by passing a needle through the abnormal tendon repeatedly until the needle has passed through all areas of the abnormal tendon with softening of the tendon. Tenotomy with PRP injections is performed in the same manner but includes an injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the tendon. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of tenotomy versus PRP treatment.</detailed_description>
