	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and validity of conventional radiographs of the lumbo-sacral spine when the patient is lying on a special table which facilitates maximal lumbo-sacral flexion. The results gained from the radiographs with the patient on the table will be compared with those gained from standard flexion-extension radiographs of the lumbo-sacral spine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Lumbo-sacral Instability Using Custom Made Table - a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After enrollment in the study patients will complete a set of questionnaire concerning degree, extent and quality of their low back problem. Afterwards a lateral conventional radiograph of the lumbar spine with the patient on a custom made positioning table will be taken. The table facilitates optimal flexion of the lumbar spine. Afterwards sagittal translation and rotation are measured on the flexion-extension radiographs and the radiograph taken on the custom made table. Differences between the measurements will be determined.</detailed_description>
