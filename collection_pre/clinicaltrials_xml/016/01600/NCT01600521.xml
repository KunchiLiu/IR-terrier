	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combined therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The combined therapy contained paeoniflorin (Brand name: Pafulin), which has anti-inflammation properties, and Cervus and Cucumis polypeptide injection (Brand name: Songmeile), which has bone healing, pain relieving, and anti-inflammation properties. The hypothesis is that this remedy, which has long been used by the world's largest RA community, is effective and safe when tested by modern clinical standards and criteria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study of a Natural Remedy for Rheumatoid Arthritis vs. Commonly Used Conventional Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blinded randomized study on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, patients were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: Paeoniflorin (PAE) + Cervus and Cucumis polypeptide injection (CCPI), Methotrexate (MTX) + Leflunomide (LEF), and MTX + LEF + CCPI. The therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated by the 7 core set measures of American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Adverse effects, their severity, and the evaluators' professional judgments of relationships between the adverse effects and the drugs were documented.</detailed_description>
