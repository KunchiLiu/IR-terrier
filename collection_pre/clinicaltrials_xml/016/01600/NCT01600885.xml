	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is 1. To establish the feasibility of fMRI studies of the interaction of guanfacine and ketamine. 2. To explore the possibility that guanfacine can ameliorate the negative effects of ketamine on task-related prefrontal activation. 3. To assess the strength of any interaction between guanfacine and ketamine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subjects will be interviewed over the phone and, if appropriate, will be scheduled for a screening session. Participants who meet study criteria will participate in two study sessions separated by at least two weeks. The sessions will be identical except on one day they will receive guanfacine and on the other, they will receive a placebo.</detailed_description>
