	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis and falls occur with increasing frequency among the elderly. Osteoporosis and fall increases the risk of fracture. Falls in the elderly are associated with a high morbidity and mortality with potentially life-threatening consequences of falls including fractures. Besides fracture fall may cause long term problems such as disability fear of falling and loss of independence. Today osteoporosis is diagnosed by bone scan of the hip and spine. The investigators want to investigate whether other more accessible and less expensive testing methods can be used to diagnose osteoporosis. Additionally, the investigators will examine the incidence of osteoporosis among the elderly in the municipality of Odense. Finally, the investigators would like to investigate the association between factors that can lead to falls and to investigate the performance of older and whether there are changes in functional ability over time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Odense Fallers and Osteoporosis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives 1. To define the prevalence of osteoporosis in a falls clinic population, and compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic and non-fallers. 2. To evaluate the usefulness of peripheral bone scanning techniques in a falls clinic population. 3. To determine the prevalence of vertebral fractures in a falls clinic population and compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic and non-fallers 4. To investigate functioning, disability, health related quality of life and perceived need for rehabilitation in a falls clinic population including variation in a one year period, and compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic and non-fallers.</detailed_description>
