	<brief_summary>Vegetable is well known to prevent chronic disease,however, the mechanism of its nutrients and non-nutrients still remains to be discovered.We design a feeding study which provides plant foods to subjects one by another and monitoring metabolomic changes up to 7 hours.The goal of this study is to establish a protocol for documenting metabolomics response to plant foods and try to characterize plant foods in terms of their anti-hypertension potentials with metabolomic profiling information.</brief_summary>
