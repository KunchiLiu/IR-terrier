	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the association of serum ferritin and homocysteine levels with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in women with polycystic ovary syndrome The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease, affecting 5-10% of women with reproductive age. Insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance are well-known long-term consequence of women with PCOS. Recent evidence suggests that increased body iron might be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistance disorders, furthermore, hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic and thromboembolic disorder. The investigators plan to retrospectively review the medical records of female patients who visited the Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic at the Wan Fang Medical Center at Taipei Medical University from Jan 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011.</brief_summary>
