	<criteria>Subject is male or female, 5084 years of age, inclusive. Subject is at average risk for development of CRC and has undergone a screening colonoscopy with a normal result at least 30 days and no more than 120 days before providing a stool sample for the study. For the purposes of this study, a "normal" colonoscopy result is defined as no polyps of any size detected or removed (including benign, hyperplastic polyps). Subject is able to understand the study procedures, and is able to provide signed consent to participate in the study and authorizes release of relevant protected health information through signing a HIPAA consent. Subject is able and willing to provide stool samples at least 30 days and no more than 120 days after undergoing a colonoscopy that resulted in normal findings, according to the written instructions provided to them. Subject has any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator should preclude participation in the study. Subject had any findings on recent or any previous colonoscopy including benign, and/or hyperplastic polyps of any size. (Note: Tissue biopsies that result in no histopathology findings are acceptable.) Subject has a history or recent diagnosis of CRC or adenoma. Subject has a history of aerodigestive tract cancer. Subject has had a positive fecal occult blood test or FIT within the previous six (6) months. Subject has had a prior colorectal resection for any reason other than sigmoid diverticular disease. Subject has had overt rectal bleeding, e.g., hematochezia or melena, within the previous 30 days. (Blood on toilet paper, after wiping, does not constitute rectal bleeding) Subject has a diagnosis or personal history of any of the following highrisk conditions for colorectal cancer: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) and Crohn's disease. Greater than or equal to (&gt;=)2 firstdegree relatives who have been diagnosed with colon cancer. (Note: firstdegree relatives include parents, siblings and offspring). One firstdegree relative with CRC diagnosed before the age of 60. Familial adenomatous polyposis (also referred to as "FAP", including attenuated FAP). Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (also referred to as "HNPCC" of "Lynch Syndrome"). Other hereditary cancer syndromes including but are not limited to PeutzJeghers Syndrome, MYHAssociated Polyposis (MAP), Gardner's Syndrome, Turcot's (or Crail's) Syndrome, Cowden's Syndrome, Juvenile Polyposis, CronkhiteCanada Syndrome, Neurofibromatosis and Familial Hyperplastic Polyposis.</criteria>
