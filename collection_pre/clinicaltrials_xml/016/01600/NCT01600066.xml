	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea has been linked to erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, small studies suggest that treatment of sleep apnea by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may reverse erectile dysfunction in affected patients. The present study aims to investigate in a larger cohort if severe sleep apnea is independently associated with erectile dysfunction and if 6-12 months of CPAP therapy lead to an improvement of erectile dysfunction.</brief_summary>
