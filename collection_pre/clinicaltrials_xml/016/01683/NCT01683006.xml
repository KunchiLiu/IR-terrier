	<brief_title>Influence of Skeletal Muscle Paralysis on Metabolism in Hypothermic Patients After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild hypothermia improves neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Neuromuscular blockers are in use, together with analgesia and sedation, during the cooling process in many centers to prevent shivering. However, neuromuscular blockers are accused to be associated with various side effects causing serious harm and/or leading to prolonged ICU stay. Furthermore, the use of neuromuscular blockers may mask epileptic activity. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of neuromuscular blockers during therapeutic hypothermia need to be re-evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate if continuous application of neuromuscular blockers is necessary to prevent shivering and thereby avoiding an increase in energy expenditure in patients during therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming after cardiac arrest (initial 72h).</detailed_description>
