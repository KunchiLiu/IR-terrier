	<brief_summary>This study aims at assessing factors that affect patient choices for end of life care. 300 patients would be assigned either to a control arm (questionnaire alone) or intervention arm (standardized explanation+ questionnaire). Our intervention is a standardized explanation which explains what code status, advance directive and end of life care mean. Based on patient responses, factors that affect choices of code status would be analyzed. We will also evaluate if a standardized explanation improves patient understanding of end of life issues. This would be determined by generating a composite score of correct responses to a subset of objective questions in the questionnaire</brief_summary>
