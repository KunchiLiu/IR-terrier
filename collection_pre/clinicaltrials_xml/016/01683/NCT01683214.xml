	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting this study to test the usefulness of a new type of analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings called brain network activation or BNA. BNA allows to identify patterns of activation in brain networks and to track their changes over time. The investigators want to examine the possible role of brain network activation (BNA) in the diagnosis of mood disorders and predicting improvement over time. The procedure conducted with patients diagnosed with a mood disorder will be compared to people who do not have a mood disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Network Activation Analysis to Diagnose/Assess Treatment of Unipolar Major Depression and Bipolar I Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel approach to ascertain use of BNA strategy and technology for the use in confirming diagnosis and predicting effect of specific treatment(s)in the various stages of affective/mood disorders. The goal is to develop non-invasive technology to confirm diagnosis via biological outcomes, and to study the preliminary data of predicting response/non-response to specific interventions before clinical effects are shown.</detailed_description>
