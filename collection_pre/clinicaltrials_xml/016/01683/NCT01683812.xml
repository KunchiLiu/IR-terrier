	<brief_summary>The purpose of this descriptive study is to provide information on the feasibility of using the cranial cup, a new positioning device, in a small sample of prematurely born infants with elongated head shapes as a result of laying on their abdomens, during the convalescent phase of their hospitalizations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cranial Cup Use for Correction of Head Shape Deformities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cranial cup is a non-invasive, non-restrictive, adjustable orthotic device that grows with the infant and maintains proper body alignment while promoting normal head shape development. While the cranial cup is not yet FDA approved, it is considered a non-significant medical device and it has successfully corrected asymmetric positional head shape deformities in hundreds of healthy newborns less than 4 months of age cared for by the Children's Hospital Boston outpatient plagiocephaly clinic. Additionally preliminary analysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial currently underway suggests that the cranial cup may be useful in prevention of positional head shape deformity in a cohort of hospitalized infants of varying gestational ages. However, the cranial cup has never been used for correction of the most common form of positional head shape deformity in hospitalized premature infants; namely dolichocephaly. Thus, the purpose of this descriptive study is to provide information on the feasibility of using the cranial cup in a small sample of prematurely born infants with dolichocephaly during the convalescent phase of their hospitalizations. Information obtained from this descriptive study will be used to determine if a larger investigation using the cranial cup is warranted in this specific patient population.</detailed_description>
