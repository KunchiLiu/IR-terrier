	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at evaluating whether the computer-based cognitive exercises in the Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program are critical to improving work and cognitive outcomes in consumers with serious mental illness and cognitive impairment enrolled in supported employment (SE), or whether a streamlined version of TSW without this component (the Cognitive Skills for Work (CSW) program) is equally effective for some or all consumers. An RCT will be conducted at two sites (Mental Health Center of Greater Manchester in New Hampshire and Thresholds Inc. in Illinois) with 244 consumers randomly assigned to one of two groups (122 each, with approximately 122 participants having schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 122 of the participants having other diagnoses): 1) TSW, or 2) CSW. The TSW and CSW programs will be delivered by the same Cognitive Specialists, who will work as members of the SE team to integrate cognitive and vocational services. All participants will continue to receive SE services. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment at 8 months (after completion of the active teaching components of TSW or CSW), and at 16 and 24 months post-baseline to evaluate cognitive functioning, symptoms, and quality of life. All work outcomes will be tracked weekly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding How Cognitive Remediation Works</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unemployment is a major burden for people with severe mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia, with competitive work rates typically between 10-20%. Over the past two decades, supported employment (SE) has been shown to improve competitive work in persons with SMI, and it is now considered an evidence-based practice (EBP). However, there is a need to improve the effectiveness of SE, as 30-60% of consumers work little or not at all, and jobs are often brief and end unsuccessfully. Cognitive remediation, when combined with vocational rehabilitation, has shown promise for improving work outcomes, including in consumers in SE. The most extensively studied approach is the Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program, developed by this research group, which incorporates computer-based cognitive exercises to restore cognitive skills and teaching compensatory strategies by a Cognitive Specialist who is integrated into the vocational rehabilitation team. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two conducted in SE programs (including one previously conducted by this research group), have shown that adding the TSW program to vocational (SE) services improves work and cognitive outcomes compared to vocational (SE) services alone. The proposed study takes the next bold step of "dismantling" the TSW program to evaluate whether the cognitive practice exercises component is critical to improving outcomes in SE, or whether a more streamlined and efficient version of the program that focuses only on teaching compensatory skills is sufficient. The study will also yield important information about whether some consumers benefit from computer cognitive exercises, but not others, permitting the TSW program to be individually tailored to consumers' personal needs. In preparation for the proposed study we developed, standardized, and pilot tested a variant of the TSW program, the Cognitive Skills for Work (CSW) program, that teaches compensatory skills for managing cognitive difficulties but omits computer cognitive exercises, resulting in a program that is approximately one-half the intensity of the original TSW program. A small ongoing pilot study indicated that consumers in SE could be readily engaged and retained in the CSW program and obtain work, supporting the feasibility of this streamlined version of TSW. The proposed research will be an RCT conducted at two high fidelity SE programs, comparing the effects of the TSW and CSW programs in consumers enrolled in SE. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1. Primary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will have better competitive work outcomes than those in the CSW program. This hypothesis is based on the fact that virtually all cognitive remediation research on SMI has included cognitive exercises designed to restore cognitive skills, such as the computer-based cognitive exercises in TSW, with some programs also teaching compensatory strategies. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, and TSW is found to be not significantly more effective than CSW, then dissemination efforts can focus on the more efficient CSW. 2. Secondary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will improve more in cognitive functioning than those in CSW. This hypothesis is based on the same rationale as Hypothesis #1. Exploratory Analyses In addition to evaluating whether the TSW and CSW programs differ overall in their impact on vocational and cognitive outcomes, we will explore whether consumer characteristics can be identified that predict a differential response to either program. For example, it is possible that consumers with more severe cognitive impairment will respond better to the full TSW program, whereas those with less severe impairment may benefit equally well from the more efficient CSW program. The proposed research has high potential impact for improving the outcomes of SE, an established EBP for increasing competitive work in SMI, but whose effectiveness is limited by the extent of consumers' cognitive impairment. Maximizing the efficiency of the TSW program, a cognitive remediation program shown to improve work outcomes in two RCTs of SE programs, by determining whether a more streamlined version of the program that requires about one-half the time to implement (the CSW program) is equally effective, could reduce the costs of disseminating and implementing the program, making it accessible to more consumers. This study could also help identify which consumers benefit most from the cognitive exercises component of TSW, thereby facilitating tailoring of the program to the individual's personal needs. Ultimately, this research could play a critical role in making the dream of competitive work a reality for many consumers with SMI.</detailed_description>
