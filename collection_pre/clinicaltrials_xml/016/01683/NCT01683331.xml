	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1: To determine the clinical efficacy of early initiation of insulin therapy in decreasing the incidence of NODAT among de novo kidney transplant patients with manifested post-transplant hyperglycemia during the first week after transplantation. Hypothesis 1: Early initiation of insulin therapy protects beta-cell from early stress related to the surgery and use of higher doses of immunosuppressive medications, and leads to lower incidence of NODAT at 1 and 2 years. Specific Aim 2: To determine the improvement in overall glycemic control with the early initiation of insulin therapy. Hypothesis 2: Early initiation of insulin therapy results in greater overall control of glycemia compared to standard care of dietary counseling, life-style modification, oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as needed at 1 year. Specific Aim 3: To determine the improvement in beta-cell function among patients assigned to the early initiation of insulin therapy at one year post-transplantation. Hypothesis 3: Early initiation of insulin therapy protects beta-cell from glucotoxicity of post-transplant hyperglycemia and preserves better beta-cell function at 1 year.</brief_summary>
