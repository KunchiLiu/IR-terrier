	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the hormonal/metabolic reponse to ingestion of sugar compared to consuming artificial sweetened drink, and to evalute macronutrient consumption 24 hours post ingestion of the drinks. We hypothesize that artificially sweetened (AS) consumption will lead to a relatively similar hormonal/metabolic responses as glucose consumption and therefore to secondary rise of caloric intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Oral Glucose Compared to Sweetener Drinking on Hormonal/Metabolic Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the last two decades, the prevalence of overweight and obesity doubled. at the same time, individuals have increasingly turned to artificially sweetened (AS) foods and beverages in an attempt to lose weight, or control it. several studies have found that there may be a connection between artificially sweetened food and beverages consumption and paradoxical weight gain and increased incidence of metabolic syndrome. the causal relationship between AS use and weight gain haven't been proven yet. The participants will be invited to 2 meetings in which they will consume, in a randomized double blind way: 1. A beverage containing 75 gram glucose 2. A beverage containing 0.42 gram artificially sweetener (Aspartame, similar sweetness level) During each meeting, the participants will drink the sweetened drink followed by blood work, as done in oral glucose challenge or tolerance test (OGTT / GTT). Also, they will record their macronutrient\caloric consumption during the 24 hour following the test.</detailed_description>
