	<brief_summary>The current study aims to test the efficacy of treatment for a device that utilises a thermal pulsation system, which applies heat from the inner surface of the eyelids (Lipiflow) in patients suffering from meibomian gland dysfunction. Patients will be asked to undergo a one-time treatment with Lipiflow and the investigators will monitor them for changes in tear film and lipid composition, as well as changes in the anatomy of meibomian glands for over a study period of 12 weeks. Additionally, dry eye symptoms will be documented in form of questionnaires. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment will be effective in improving clinical signs and will relieve dry eye symptoms for the patient. If this method of managing Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is found to be efficacious and safe, it will be made available to patients in Singapore.</brief_summary>
