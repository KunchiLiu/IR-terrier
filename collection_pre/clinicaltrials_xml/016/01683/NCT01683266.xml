	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To compare the efficacy of a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus (overall, regardless the injection time) in terms of change of HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (scheduled Month 6) in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus Secondary Objective: - To compare HOE901-U300 and Lantus when given in the morning or in the evening in terms of: - Change of HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (scheduled Month 6) - Change from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), plasma glucose prior to injection of study drug, plasma glucose at 03:00 hours, mean plasma glucose (8-point profiles), glucose variability, treatment satisfaction and health related quality of life in participants with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) - Reaching target HbA1c values and controlled plasma glucose (all and reaching target without hypoglycemia) - Frequency of occurrence and diurnal distribution of hypoglycemia by category of hypoglycemia (symptomatic, asymptomatic, nocturnal, severe, probable and relative) - Safety and tolerability of HOE901-U300 including development of anti-insulin antibody (AIAs) during the 12-month study period</brief_summary>
