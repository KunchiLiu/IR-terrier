	<brief_summary>Variable ventilation has been shown to improve lung function and reduce lung damage as well as inflammation in different models of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Also, variable ventilation is able to recruit lungs. The present study will investigate whether variable as compared to non-variable ventilation improves post-operative lung function and reduces systemic inflammation in patients submitted to open abdominal surgery.</brief_summary>
