	<brief_summary>In this first study of inhaled apomorphine in Parkinson's disease patients, the primary objective is to find the minimum efficacious dose of apomorphine that is useful in rescuing patients during 'off' periods. Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of inhaled apomorphine will be assessed during the study.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Parkinson Disease</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Apomorphine</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients with established idiopathic PD (via fulfilment of Steps 1 and 2 of the UK Brain Bank Criteria), of at least 3 years duration prior to study entry, who were on specific and optimised antiParkinson medication (levodopa and/or dopamine agonists), and with motor fluctuations. 2. Patients with a modified Hoehn and Yahr disease severity scoring of between 2 and 4 in an "on" state. 3. Men or women aged over 30 years. 4. Patients with a signed and dated written valid consent obtained prior to participation. 5. Female patients must have been of nonchildbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who was postmenopausal) or of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screening. 6. Patients who experienced motor fluctuations with recognisable "off" periods in control of motor symptoms, as assessed by the motor fluctuation questionnaire (patients were to have reported at least 1 "Yes" response to the questions in the motor fluctuation questionnaire). 7. Patient willing and able to comply with study procedures. 1. Patients who had participated in a trial with an investigational product within 3 months prior to randomisation at Visit 2. 2. Patients with serious uncontrolled disease including serious psychological disorders likely to interfere with the study and/or likely to cause death within 6 months of the study completion. 3. Patients with previous intolerance to apomorphine. 4. Patients with a previous significant complication from oral dopamine agonist therapy including hospitalisation following dopamine agonist introduction and/or the development of hallucinations or other adverse neuropsychiatric features following introduction of sc apomorphine. 5. Women lactating, pregnant, or of childbearing potential not using a reliable contraceptive method. 6. Patients with known HIV or active chronic hepatitis B or C infection. 7. Patients with any clinically significant abnormality following review of screening laboratory data and full physical examination. 8. Patients who, in the Investigator's opinion, were unsuitable for the study for any reason. 9. Patients with clinically significant blood test abnormalities and previous medical history/intercurrent illnesses that may have compromised the safety of the patient in the study. 10. Patients with major ECG abnormalities (as judged by the Investigator). 11. Patients with a FEV1 &lt;65%. 12. Patients showing a postural decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of &gt; 20 mm Hg, or showing significant clinical symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension. 13. Patients with persistent elevation of BP, with average systolic readings of 160 mm Hg or average diastolic readings of 100 mm Hg. 14. Patients taking anabolic steroids, traditional antipsychotics (unless low dose), and antiemetics other than domperidone. 15. Patients taking agents of the 5HT3 antagonist class including ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron. 16. Patients with existing cancer and those in remission for less than 5 years. 17. Patients with evidence (as ascertained from examination, tests or history) to indicate cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, central nervous system, pulmonary system, or bone marrow disorders that in the Investigator's opinion compromised patient safety. 18. Patients who were known nonresponders to apomorphine treatment for "off" episodes. 19. Patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse in the 12 months prior to entry. 20. Patients with a history of clinically significant allergies to VR040 formulation constituents (including lactose and opioids) and domperidone. 21. Patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia, dementia, "Parkinson plus" syndromes, or unstable systemic disease</criteria>
