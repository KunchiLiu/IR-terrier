	<brief_summary>Karl Storz GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung) company developed a cholangioscopic device, which is designed to give a better flexibility to the cholangioscopy tip in order to enable optimal diagnostic and therapeutic precondition. Other than the conventional mother-baby technique, the insertion of the cholangioscope (baby part) is done by a port at the side of a specially developed duodenoscope (mother part) which is prepositioned distally to the control unit, near to the patient's mouth. Better manoeuverability of the device tip will lead to both a better accuracy in taking biopsies as well as a better flexibility in lithotripsy manoeuvres. This study is designed to test the efficiency of the device in relation to this assumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Multicenter Evaluation of a New Short-access-cholangioscope for Biliary Duct Strictures and Gall Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangioscopy is a subsidiary treatment in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP), used for special issues. In the context of ERCP, a long,thin shaped device is introduced through the working channel of a duodenoscope and then through the papilla into the biliary duct. Inspection of the biliary duct can be used for tumor biopsies as well as for gall stone lithotripsy by laser or electrohydraulic technique. Manoeuverability of cholangioscopes is limited by the length of the scope, even more, since most of the device body is stuck in the working channel. The newly designed cholangioscope by the company of Karl Storz GmbH is introduced through a shortened working channel. Introduction of the cholangioscope is done by an innovative side port for the cholangioscope at 70 cm from the insertion tube's distal end. This leads to a better flexibility of the device tip. Better manoeuverability of the device tip will lead to both a better accuracy in taking biopsies as well as a better flexibility in lithotripsy manoeuvres. This study is designed to test the efficiency of the device in relation to this assumption.</detailed_description>
