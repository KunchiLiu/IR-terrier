	<brief_summary>Dysphagia occurs relatively commonly in patients with acute stroke, and can lead to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. By using the stroke registry of our hospital, we will evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia screening in Acute Stroke using High-resolution impedance manometry (DASH). The hypothesis tested in this study is that high-resolution impedance manometry (HRiM) can provide the clinical efficacy to evaluate dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dysphagia Assessment in Acute Ischemic Stroke Using High-resolution Manometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis tested in this study was that high-resolution manometry can provide the clinical efficacy to evaluate dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients. By using of stroke registry of our hospital, we assessed feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia screening in Acute Stroke using High-resolution impedance manometry in patients with acute stroke. The registry had the contents of two evaluation steps; the first step was the process to identify the patients with risk of possible aspiration and the second step was for detection of silent aspirators. Firstly, the patient was interviewed regarding difficulties with food intake, chewing and swallowing, and the neurological signs were confirmed by two independent neurologists. After then, the patients were stratified into three aspiration risk group and controlled by proper diet program. Finally the emergence of aspiration pneumonia was observed.</detailed_description>
