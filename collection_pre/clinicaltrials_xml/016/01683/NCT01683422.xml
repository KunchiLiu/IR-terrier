	<brief_summary>The current trial will provide important data on the recurrence rates and patterns of failure using state of the art target agent, chemotherapy and proton beam technology for patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC). A median survival of 10 months or greater would be considered evidence of a regimen potentially worthy of further study as a new treatment paradigm in one arm in a future phase III trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas AJCC stage IIII with unresectable or borderline unresectable disease as defined by NCCN guidelines Radiological resectability is defined by the following criteria on abdominal imaging: 1. No evidence of tumor extension to the celiac axis, hepatic artery or superior mesenteric artery. 2. No evidence of tumor encasement or occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or the SMV/portal vein confluence 3. No evidence of visceral or peritoneal metastases Borderline and Unresectable cases would be defined as those that do not meet the criteria in section and also show no evidence of distant metastatic or intraperitoneal disease.
