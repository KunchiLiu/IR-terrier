	<brief_summary>HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Large investigations support an inverse correlation between HDL-C levels and coronary heart disease. Therefore a treatment lowering HDL-C such as niacin could reduce the risk of atheroprogression not only through its benefit in terms of lipid profile, but also by reducing atherosclerotic inflammation. The study aims at showing that a therapy targeting HDL-C increase in HIV-infected patients on suppressive cART has the potential for reducing subclinical atherosclerotic inflammation associated with HIV itself in HIV-individuals on cART. NILACH is a randomised, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled, 48 weeks trial to test the effect of the newly marketed niacin/laropiprant on carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in 90 subjects. - Regimen 1: ER niacin/laropiprant 1g/20 mg for the first 4 weeks and 2g/40mg from week 5 to the end of the study (the titration aims to reduce adverse reactions) - Regimen 2: ER niacin/laropiprant placebo p.m. The primary end point is the change in mean common carotid intima-media thickness from baseline and 48 weeks, compared between the niacin/laropiprant group and the placebo group. The proposed in vivo experiments should provide insights on the potential benefits of niacin treatment of cardiovascular disease in HIV patients. In addition, we will be able to further clarify the role of systemic inflammatory mediators in the development of early atherosclerosis of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Detection and treatment of non-infectious co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have become essential for HIV-infected individuals exposed to lifelong antiretroviral therapy and go beyond mere management of opportunistic infections or virologic suppression.</brief_summary>
