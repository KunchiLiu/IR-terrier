	<brief_summary>Itch is a common side effect of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Investigators designed a pilot single-center phase II study evaluating the effects of Aprepitant, a neurokinin receptor inhibitor, in managing biological therapy-induced pruritus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aprepitant in the Management of Biological Therapies-related Severe Pruritus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators enroll patients affected by solid tumors which present itch refractory to standard treatment ("refractory group") and patients who did not receive any treatment for pruritus ("naïve group"). The intensity of itch will be evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. In the refractory group Aprepitant (125 mg on day 1; 80 mg on day 3; 80 mg on day 5) will be administered after at least 1 week of standard systemic treatment. In the naïve group, Aprepitant will be administered after the first onset of severe pruritus. The primary end point is to evaluate the effect of aprepitant in managing pruritus both in naive and refractory group.</detailed_description>
