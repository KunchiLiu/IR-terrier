	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled intervention trial with 1,500 pregnant and postpartum women to examine the efficacy of an enhanced model of ongoing post-test support for women attending antenatal and postnatal care in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Through the intervention, the investigators will tailor voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV to the ANC setting and provide a continuum of psychosocial support for pregnant women through: (1) a standardized health education video before HIV pre-test counseling; (2) HIV pre- and post-test counseling sessions that prepare women for decisions related to testing, serostatus disclosure and anti-retroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and help women plan strategies for sexual risk behavior change; (3) two additional post-test counseling sessions postpartum focusing on legal education and referral, partner testing, sexual risk behavior change and family planning decisions and; (4) an active referral system to post-test support groups run by a clinically trained staff psychologist and (5) an active referral system to legal services run by a lawyer at the clinic. Through this intervention trial the investigators will be testing the following hypotheses: H1: Women receiving the intervention will have significantly lower sexual risk of HIV at 14 weeks and 9-months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. Sexual risk of HIV will be measured by: STI incidence (Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia), consistent condom use, unprotected sex in past 30 days, and unprotected sex since delivery. H2: Women receiving the intervention will report significantly better outcomes related to prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) service uptake at 14 weeks and 9 months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. PMTCT service uptake will be measured by acceptance of HIV VCT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women; acceptance of ARVs, adherence to national infant feeding guidelines, and family planning use among HIV-positive women. H3: Women in the intervention arm will report significantly better psychosocial outcomes at 14 weeks and 9 months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. Psychosocial outcomes will be measured by: perceived social support, emotional distress, and partner violence among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.</brief_summary>
