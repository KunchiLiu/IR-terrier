	<brief_summary>This will be a Phase I study. During the Phase I study, our goals are: 1) screen a number of cancer biomarkers in Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) from women who have no mammographically detectable tumors, and those who have detectable tumors, 2) identify all the detectable markers and 3) establish that biomarkers detected in NAF could also be detected in the biopsied tumor tissue that was removed for diagnostic purpose in subjects who have detectable tumors.</brief_summary>
