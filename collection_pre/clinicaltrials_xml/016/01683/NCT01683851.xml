	<brief_summary>Hypothesis The use of Isolite® system does not produce upper airway obstruction in the pediatric population during dental treatment with conscious sedation. Purpose: Report the changes in airway patency and pediatric patient's behavior when Isolite® system is used for dental treatment with conscious sedation. Objectives: 1. Determine changes in pulse rate 2. Determine changes in SpO2 3. Recognize breath sound's changes possibly associated with airway blockage 4. Evaluate if the isolite® system is well tolerate by the pediatric population for dental treatment under conscious sedation 5. Relate the use of Isolite® with the frequency of head reposition to open the airway.</brief_summary>
