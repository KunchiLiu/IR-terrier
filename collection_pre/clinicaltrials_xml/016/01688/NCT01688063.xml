	<brief_summary>The primary objective of Part A is to compare the change in elasticity measurements at baseline and at 3 months between subjects who have had a resurfacing or tightening procedure and those who have not. The secondary objective for Part A is to develop baseline elasticity scores for ages 18-35, 36-50, and 51-65 and for Fitzpatrick skin types I-II, III-IV, and V-VI. The primary objective of Part B is to compare the age of the scar and surrounding tissue with the elasticity measurements.</brief_summary>
