	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to further define the optimal non-surgical treatment strategy for partial thickness rotator cuff tears. The specific aim of this study is to determine the outcomes of treatment of partial thickness rotator cuff tears with corticosteroid or platelet rich plasma (PRP). Subjects with partial thickness rotator cuff tears will be randomized to receive an injection of PRP or corticosteroid. Shoulder function and tendon healing will be evaluated using the patient surveys as well as ultrasound. Subjects will be followed for one year to determine the outcomes for each treatment. The hypothesis is that there is no difference in healing rate or functional outcomes in patients treated with corticosteroid injections vs. PRP injections for the treatment of partial thickness rotator cuff tears.</brief_summary>
