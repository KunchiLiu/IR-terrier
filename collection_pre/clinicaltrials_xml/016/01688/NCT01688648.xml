	<brief_title>Comparison Between Lidocaine, Dexmedetomidine, and Their Combined Infusion in Subjects Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lidocaine has been reported to have an antiarrhythmic and myocardial protective effect. A previous study has reported that low-dose lidocaine infusion can decrease the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia during the first 24 hours after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). A recent study also reported that the lidocaine infusion during CABG could decrease the myocardial injury by measuring the CK-MB and Troponin-I blood level. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist and reduces the sympathetic tone and neuroendocrine stress response. Dexmedetomidine was reported to have a cardioprotective effect by a previous animal study. However, there was no clinical study evaluating the cardioprotective effect of dexmedetomidine. Therefore, we are trying to evaluate and compare the antiarrhythmic and myocardial protective effect between lidocaine, dexmedetomidine, and their combined infusion in subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft.</detailed_description>
