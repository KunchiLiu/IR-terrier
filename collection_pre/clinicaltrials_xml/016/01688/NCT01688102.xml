	<brief_summary>Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either oral vitamin D pills OR ultraviolet light treatment. The investigators will compare how these two methods of raising vitamin D levels will affect cholesterol levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Oral Vitamin D Versus Narrow-Band UV-B Exposure on the Lipid Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility, including serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;20ng/ml. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) oral vitamin D3, 50,000 units weekly for 8 weeks or 2) narrow-band UVB radiation, 2 treatments/wk for 8 weeks. Duration of treatment will be based on skin type. After 8 weeks, 25(OH)D levels will be measured monthly. For participants with levels &lt;35 ng/ml, additional doses of oral vitamin D3 or UV radiation will be administered. A subset of partcipants from both groups will participate in a skin biopsy cohort, where skin biopsies are obtained before and after 8 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
