	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether AMG 334 is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects and migraine patients. As part of the secondary objectives, this study will be conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of AMG 334 after single SC or IV doses in healthy subjects and migraine patients as well as to characterize the effect of AMG 334 on the capsaicin-induced increase in dermal blood flow after single SC or IV doses in healthy subjects and migraine patients.</brief_summary>
