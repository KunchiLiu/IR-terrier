	<brief_summary>Grape seed proanthocyanidins have been reported to possess a hypotriglyceridemic effect after an acute or chronic consumption in rodents. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of an acute consumption of proanthocyanidins before a breakfast meal in humans. Moreover, the mechanisms implicated in the reduction of plasma triglycerides levels by grape seed proanthocyanidins in humans should be elucidated as well as its activity on vascular function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention will consist in the administration of 2 capsules containing the grape seed proanthocyanidins extract or 2 empty capsules (placebo) just before breakfast, which will consist of 100g of white bread, 75g of salami, 50g of fatty cheese, 125g of yogurt (10% fat), 25ml of olive oil and water ad libitum. The nutritional composition of this meal is as follows: 1.200 Kcal of energy content, 15% of energy from proteins, 22% from carbohydrates and 63% from fat (35% saturated fat), and 120mg of cholesterol.
