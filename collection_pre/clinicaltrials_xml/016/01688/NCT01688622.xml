	<brief_summary>Glypican4, CTRP3, CTRP5 are emerging novel adipokines mediating obesity and inflammation related disorders. RBP4 and adiponectin are well known important adipokines. Therefore, we examine the circulating levels of theses adipokines in the subjects with or without metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, we tried to clarify the effect of exercise on the circulating these adipokines.</brief_summary>
