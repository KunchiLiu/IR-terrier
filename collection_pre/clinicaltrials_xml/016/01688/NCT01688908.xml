	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of endoscopy screening on esophageal cancer (EC) and determine the most cost-effective strategy of endoscopy screening in high risk population of China, 668 villages of Hua county, a high risk area of esophageal cancer, were randomized into screening arm and control arm in a ratio of 1:1 and the total sample size is over 30,000 (~16,000 per group). Participants in the screening arm will accept standard endoscopy examination to detect early esophageal cancer and no screening were designed in control arm. The incidence of advanced EC and EC-specific mortality will be compared within the two groups to test the hypothesis that endoscopy screening would detect early stage cancer and the incidence of advanced stage EC and EC-specific mortality will be lower than control group. Cost-effectiveness analysis will also be conducted to find the most cost-effective strategy of endoscopy screening in rural China.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Endoscopy Screening on Esophageal Cancer in China (ESECC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common invasive carcinomas in China and almost half of new cases of EC worldwide were found in China. Hua county of rural Anyang is a high risk area of EC. The annually mortality rates of EC in local area are 70-100/100,000 respectively. Due to the long asymptomatic period of EC, the vast majority of the clinical diagnosed cases are of advanced stages leading to a fairly poor 5-year survival (less than 20%). But it can be increased to 70-90% by early detection and treatment. Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (UGE) screening has been proved to be efficacious to detect early EC. Screening tests of EC were started in the 1970s, but the true beneﬁt is inconsistent and is uncertain due to lead-time bias, which is the amount of time by which the diagnosis is advanced by the screening procedure; and length-time bias, where screening is more likely to detect slow-growing disease rather than altering the person's duration of life. Therefore, there is a strong need for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), especially long-term RCTs, to determine the efﬁcacy, cost-effectiveness, and any adverse effects of screening for esophageal cancer. Aims: 1. Establish clinical criteria of population-based endoscopy screening on EC in high risk region of China; 2. Evaluate the efficacy of endoscopy screening on EC; 3. Determine the most cost-effective strategy of endoscopy screening in high risk population of China; 4. Construct a hazard model of EC to facilitate personalized screening. Study field and participants 1. This study would be conducted in all the 22 towns (a higher administrative division than "village" but lower than "county") of Hua County, Anyang, a high risk area of ESCC in Northern China. 2. All men and women older than 45 years in target villages are eligible unless they met the following exclusion criteria: inability to provide informed consent, history of EC, contraindications of UGE (blood mediated infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease and mental disorder), severe or terminal disease; life expectancy less than 5 years, or UGE within the previous 5 years. 3. The total sample size will be at least 32000 (16000 per group), which equals to 5-7% of the total population with the age ≥45 years in Hua County. Randomization Six hundred and sixty-eight villages were randomly selected from 846 villages of Hua County with the total population ranged from 500 to 3000. All candidate villages were blocked randomized into two groups, namely, the screening group (334 villages) and the control group (334 villages) in the ratio of 1:1. The individual sample size of each village was determined based on the weight of its total population in the total population of the entire group. Screening procedure 1. Participants in the screening arm will accept standard UGE examination, in which, duodenum, pylorus, stomach, cardiac and esophagus will be examined and tissue specimens will be biopsied from standard sites of esophagus if no visual abnormality is detected. 2. Participants with the lesions equal to or higher than severe hyperplasia will be advised and arranged to accept standard treatment in Anyang Cancer Hospital or other local general hospitals. Follow-up and endpoint The onset of advanced EC and the EC-specific death are adopted as endpoints in this study. Annually face-to-face interview about the vital events, including the experience of UGE, onset of cancer and death, were designed. The information of clinically diagnosed cases and cause-specific death would also be obtained from the "Cooperative medical care system", a national health registration and health-care system in rural China. Nearly 100% of the residents in local area have been involved in this system, which makes it an ideal information source of clinical diagnosed cases and death. Statistical analysis and hypothesis test 1. The incidence of advanced EC and EC-specific mortality will be compared within the two groups to test the hypothesis that UGE screening would detect early stage cancer and the incidence of advanced stage EC and EC-specific mortality will be lower than control group. 2. Cost-effectiveness analysis (the cost of saving 1 person-year or reducing 1 person-year of incidence of advanced EC etc.) will be conducted to find the most cost-effective strategy of endoscopy screening in rural China. 3. All the participants will be combined and treated as one cohort. A prediction model could be fitted adopting the cancer status (EC/ no EC) as the dependent variable and a series of potential risk factors as independent variables, such as age, sex, family history, tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet habits, nutritional status, current discomfort syndromes of upper gastrointestinal as well as genetic markers etc. Based on this, one might be able to determine what screening strategy he/she should adopt as well as the extent of risk reduction if he/she accept the suggested screening plan.</detailed_description>
