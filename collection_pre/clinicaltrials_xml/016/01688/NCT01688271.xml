	<brief_summary>This study will determine the efficacy of a teaching program incorporating hybrid simulation in training practicing anesthesiologists on ultrasound (US)-guided continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB). This study will also examine the extent of practice change following participation in a regional anesthesia teaching program incorporating hybrid simulation. In addition, this study will assess remaining obstacles to incorporating the use of US-guided perineural catheters through identifying potential future interventions and "tool-kits" for setting up perineural catheter programs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subjects will complete a pre-course survey to assess prior experience then participate in a standardized one-day workshop comprised of two sessions; 1) a didactic lecture and model scanning session and 2) a simulation session. Quantitative and qualitative assessments will be performed using video analysis by two blinded reviewers after equipment orientation (baseline), following first session, and following second session. Performance times, number of attempts, and composite scores for procedural performance and ergonomics will be analyzed within and between groups. Every 3 months for one year, subjects will be surveyed to assess implementation of PNB in practice and identify remaining barriers.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Anesthesiologists in practice ten years or more; active board certification (American Board of Anesthesiologists); active license to practice medicine in California; and willingness to spend one full day (8 hours) participating in the standardized workshop and undergo interval survey and interview followup for one year. Formal training (e.g., postgraduate fellowship) in regional anesthesia; current practice includes the routine performance of USguided PNB (â‰¥10 blocks per month); or visual, hearing, or other communication impairment that would interfere with video recording or require substantial deviation from the standardized teaching curriculum.</criteria>
