	<brief_title>Imaging During Surgery in Diagnosing Patients With Prostate, Bladder, or Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the ability of fluorescent imaging and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in a clinical setting to distinguish benign from malignant tissue. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To qualitatively determine the possible benefit of PAI and fluorescent imaging over traditional white light imaging. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fluorescence imaging and PAI during robot assisted laparoscopic surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a pathologic confirmation of prostate cancer, bladder cancer, or kidney cancer based on previous biopsies or procedures OR a strong concern for a kidney malignancy based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients with a surgical history or anatomic variant that would preclude robot assisted laparoscopic approaches to their surgery (i.e. history of ventral hernia repair with mesh) Patients with medical comorbidities who cannot tolerate laparoscopic surgery secondary to intraabdominal carbon dioxide insufflation Patients with documented allergy or adverse drug reaction to indocyanine green or baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL</criteria>
