	<brief_summary>This study proposes to balance supply and demand of male circumcision through a systematic scale-up of coordinated biomedical surgical and behavioral counseling services. The study will compare the combined biobehavioral sexual risk reduction intervention to the standard of care, which focuses exclusively on the provision of circumcision services alone, with the goal of optimizing both local and national HIV prevention efforts.</brief_summary>
