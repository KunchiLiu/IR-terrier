	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to determine if intra-arterial (IA) chemotherapy is safe in the treatment of progressive diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). IA administration of the chemotherapeutic agent enhances the regional distribution of the drug, thereby increasing the local delivered dose while minimizing systemic toxicity. It also provides a treatment option for these patients at the time of tumor recurrence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Delivering the chemotherapeutic agent directly to the tumor via the arterial system avoids the complications and adverse events associated with toxicity from systemic chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
