	<brief_summary>Ilaprazole is a novel proton pump inhibitor and metabolized by CYP3A4 and 2C19. Thus genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4 and 2C19 may have effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Ilaprazole.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study of Ilaprazole to Evaluate the Effect of CYP Genetic Polymorphism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effects of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics were measured in healthy Korean volunteers</detailed_description>
