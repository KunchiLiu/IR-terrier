	<brief_summary>The study is being done to determine if the Endovent pulmonary catheter kit, used for port access surgery, can be used as a passageway for a pacing wire. The study hypothesis is that the Endovent kit can be used effectively as a passageway for a pacing wire system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Transvenous Pacing Wire During Minimally Invasive Port Access Aortic Valve Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many times cardiac surgery requires the use of epicardial pacing in order to wean the patient from bypass. During minimally invasive port access valve surgery, it may not be possible to place the leads on the surface of the heart because of the limited surgical exposure. In this case, transvenous pacing is used. Minimally invasive port access surgery uses specially designed, FDA approved catheters for the procedure. We wish to review the effectiveness of being able to place the wires through the catheters and pace the patient.</detailed_description>
