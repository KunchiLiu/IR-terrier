	<brief_summary>Renal sympathetic nerves contribute to development of hypertension. Sympathetic overactivity also induces insulin resistance and it could therefore be assumed that a renal denervation might improve insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that glucose metabolism is improved in patients with treatment resistant essential hypertension both 1 and 3 months after renal denervation compared to a control group with treatment resistant essential hypertension. Fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide decreased significantly as did insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR. The investigators wish to investigate the effect of renal denervation on insulin sensitivity using the gold standard - the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and to investigate the degree of insulin resistance in muscle, liver and adipose tissue.</brief_summary>
