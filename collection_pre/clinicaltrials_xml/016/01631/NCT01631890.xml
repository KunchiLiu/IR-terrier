All patients with gastric varices with no history of gastric variceal bleed (Group C) will undergo Endoscopic ultrasound and Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy at baseline, at the end of first year and at the end of study. The patients who presented to Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences with gastric variceal bleed or develop Gastric Variceal bleed during hospital stay will be randomized into Group -A (conventional Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy + Glue) and Group-B (Endoscopic Ultrasound followed by Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy+Glue) therapy for gastric varices. Total 90 patients will be enrolled and randomized into group A and Group B after resuscitation and urgent Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy with standard therapy for bleeding gastric varices to achieve hemostasis.</brief_summary>
