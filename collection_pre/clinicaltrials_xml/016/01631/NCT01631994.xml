	<brief_summary>Summary: This study investigates the use of oral dissolving metoclopramide during standard video capsule endoscopy. Metoclopramide is a pro -motility agent, that is, this medication helps with movement through the stomach and small bowel. This study will help us determine the effectiveness of oral dissolving metoclopramide on transit time through the stomach and small bowel of the video capsule that is ingested. This study may help with better diagnoses of pathology in the small bowel. Each patient enrolled in the study will either be assigned to a group that only ingests the capsule or the group that receives the oral dissolving metoclopramide plus capsule. Each patient will undergo the same standard procedures and precaution used during standard video capsule endoscopy. The patients that will qualify for the study are patients that are in need of video capsule endoscopy for further imaging of the small bowel. The patients must meet the inclusion criteria provided in the protocol and must not meet any of the exclusion criteria in the protocol. The hypothesis is that the patients that ingest the metoclopramide will have better capsule images and transit time and will allow for enhanced diagnosis of small bowel pathology.</brief_summary>
