	<brief_summary>Scientists have studied how fasting and nutrients affect brain function in animals. The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of both fasting and food intake on brain function and memory in humans. To do this the investigators will use functional MRI to observe the brain and its function while fasting and after a meal. Understanding the action of these hormones in the brain may eventually lead to new ways to help people avoid obesity or lose weight.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subjects will participate in a short phone screening interview and if eligible, will come to the University of Washington hospital 2 times. At the first health screening visit, we will go over the subjects' medical history, weight and height, and eating habits. This visit will take an hour or so and eligible subjects will then schedule the study visit. For the study visit, subjects will have to fast overnight from 9:30 pm the night before and arrive at the hospital at 8:00am. At 8:30 am, the subject will have a 30 minute MRI scan of the brain done in the University of Washington Radiology Department. During the MRI scan they will see pictures of common objects and foods and be asked to remember the photos they saw. At 9 am subjects will eat a standard breakfast, and they will not eat again until after the second MRI. The time of their second MRI will be randomly assigned to one of seven time points anywhere from 15 minutes to 5 hours after the breakfast. After the MRI, subjects will be allowed to eat freely from food we provide. Subjects will receive $10 for the health screening visit, and $50-85 depending on the length of the visit.</detailed_description>
