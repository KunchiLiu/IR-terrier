	<brief_title>Improving the Reproductive Outcome of Poor Quality Ova by Injection of Autologous Somatic Mitochondria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maternal age at first delivery constantly rises in developed countries. Oocyte quality decreases with advanced age, thus the rate of age-related infertility continuously increases. Presently oocyte donation is the only prompt solution for this widespread problem. Deterioration of mitochondrial function was suggested as one of the explanations for the age-related deterioration of oocyte quality. The supplementation of the ageing oocyte with autologous mitochondria from dividing somatic cells can be a possible solution for energetic enrichment, without introducing foreign mtDNA. We established a non-hazardous clinical grade system to prepare functional autologous mitochondria concentrate from the granulosa cells aspirated during oocyte pick up. The mitochondrial preparation was examined and found to be non-toxic. The activity of the respiratory chain was constant and unaffected by age or ovarian response. Moreover, the mtDNA in the mitochondrial preparation was found to be intact in all samples examined, including those from older and low responding patients.</detailed_description>
