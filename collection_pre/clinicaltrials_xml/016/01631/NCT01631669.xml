	<brief_summary>Hypotheses: H1: Celecoxib, when given less than five days after injury will result in a statistical decrease in the incidence and/or severity of radiographically apparent Heterotopic Ossification when compared to controls. H2a: A biomarker profile will accurately predict which patients in the treatment group will respond to Celecoxib prophylaxis for Heterotopic Ossification. H2b: A biomarker profile will accurately predict which patients in the control group are at highest risk of developing Heterotopic Ossification</brief_summary>
