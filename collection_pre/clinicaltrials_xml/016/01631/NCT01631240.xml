	<brief_summary>This proposed calibration study is designed to evaluate the correlation of urinary sodium excretion between NHANES timed urine and 24-hour urine collections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NHANES Urinary Sodium Calibration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted with 400 volunteer participants aged 18-39 years old. Participants will be asked to collect urine samples over a 24-hour period. One-third of the participants (n=133) will be asked to collect a second 24-hour urine 4-11 days later. A 24-hour dietary recall interview will be collected after the completion of each 24-hour urine collection. Results from this study will be used to assess how well the sodium excretion estimated from NHANES timed urine correlates with data from 24-hour urine collection. It will provide valuable information on the potential of NHANES timed urine collections to be used to characterize trends in U.S. population sodium intake.</detailed_description>
