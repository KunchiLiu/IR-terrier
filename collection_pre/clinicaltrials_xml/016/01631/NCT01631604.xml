	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to quantify the safety degree of the patient's gait, to detect the reason for the fall and quantify the biomechanical parameters related to fall. This study also aims to evaluate the effect of different rehabilitation treatments and their effect on the risk of falling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Characteristics Following a Fall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients suffering from motor disabilities as a result of orthopedic or neurologic impairments will be tested at the gait and motion laboratory. Each patient will be secured with a ceiling-mounted safety harness and will walk on the path wearing passive light-reflecting markers and surface electrodes. High-speed cameras will record the subject's movements and the markers will be tracked to produce data of joint angles, velocities and accelerations. Dynamic EMG will be recorded from various muscles. During the examination, the gait of the subjects will be disturb by either (i) a visual or sound signal that requires the subject to stop immediately, or (ii) walking different terrains, or (iii) tying a string to the foot and pulling it shortly to induce a trip.</detailed_description>
