	<brief_summary>Minor mental health problems, MMHP, like mild depression and anxiety, and medically unexplained symptoms, MUS, symptoms with no known underlying organic disease, are strongly associated to each other. MMHP and MUS have an impact on well-being and quality of life, lead to impaired social and cognitive function and could result in reduced work capacity. The investigators have designed the present study as a pragmatic trial to investigate the effectiveness of an integrative treatment model, therapeutic acupuncture, versus conventional treatment in patients with MMHP or MUS in primary care. The investigators examined whether the effects of the integrative treatment model differed from those achieved with therapeutic acupuncture or conventional treatment. Primary endpoints were anxiety and depression (assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), health-related quality of life (SF-36) and coping with stress, sense of coherence (SOC) during the eight weeks of treatment interventions. Statistical power was calculated based on an expected 50% reduction in HAD anxiety and depression scores after eight weeks of integrative treatment; a 30% reduction in acupuncture; and 20% in conventional care. A total of 120 (40/arm) were needed to achieve a power of 83% at p &lt;0.05. Treatment effects were calculated as the difference between values at baseline, after four weeks and after the complete intervention period, i.e. after eight weeks. Nonparametric analyses were carried out to test differences between independent samples (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U) and related samples (Wilcoxon).</brief_summary>
