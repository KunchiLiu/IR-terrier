	<brief_summary>Haemochromatosis is a preventable genetic iron overload disorder. Untreated, it can shorten life due mainly to liver cirrhosis and cancer. It can be prevented by blood donation to maintain normal iron levels. It is unclear, however, whether treatment is necessary when individuals have moderate elevation of iron in the body. This research project will study the effects of treatment in this group by assessing a number of scans, questionnaires and blood tests in treated and untreated individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mi-iron - Moderately Increased Iron - is Reducing Iron Overload Necessary?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is mounting evidence that treatment of moderate iron overload in HFE related hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is not necessary. This project aims to undertake a randomised patient-blinded trial of erythrocytapheresis compared to sham erythrocytapheresis (using plasmapheresis) in individuals who have serum ferritin (SF) above the upper limit of the normal range but &lt; 1000ug/L (defined here as moderate iron overload) due to HFE mutations and to compare the prevalence of symptoms and objective markers of disease in the two treatment arms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. HFE C282Y homozygous. 2. Aged 18 70 years . 3. SF above the upper limit of the normal range of 300µg/L but less than 1000µg/L with a currently or previously raised TS (&gt;greater than the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory). 1. HH due to genotypes other than HFE C282Y homozygosity. 2. Normal SF, SF &gt; 1000µg/L. 3. Other major risk factor(s) for liver toxicity or other significant comorbidities including positivity for hepatitis B or C, excess alcohol consumption (&gt; 60g/day in males and 40g/day in females) or body mass index &gt; 35. 4. Has had venesection therapy for HH in the last two years.</criteria>
