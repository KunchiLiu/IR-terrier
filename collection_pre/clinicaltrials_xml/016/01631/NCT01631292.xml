	<brief_summary>In this study, we will provide supplemental vitamin D in postmenopausal overweight/obese women, and hypothesize that it will not affect areal BMD, but will alter bone compartments (trabecular and cortical bone). In addition, higher vitamin D intake will increase serum 25OHD and suppress serum PTH and bone turnover during weight reduction. Secondary outcomes include the influence of vitamin D and weight loss on markers of insulin resistance and on cognitive tests of attention, learning, and memory.</brief_summary>
