	<brief_summary>Total knee replacement is very common in Germany. After surgery patients have severe pain in the knee; initiation of the physiotherapy, however, is important in the first three days after surgery. Continuous femoral blockade and continuous (lumbar) epidural analgesia are commonly used after surgery. Both methods are used in Germany. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. We wanted to answer the question which method of analgesia - after total knee replacement - is better concerning complications and function (after 3 months) ?</brief_summary>
