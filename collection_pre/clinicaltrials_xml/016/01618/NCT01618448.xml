	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Tolvaptan in the Treatment of Cardiac-Induced Edema in Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventional, phase III, 2-arm parallel group, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized 1:1, double-blind study, comparing Tolvaptan and placebo in hospitalized HF patients with signs or symptoms of congestion at the time of randomization in spite of standard therapy.This study intends to demonstrate that a repeated 4-day treatment with Tolvaptan in addition to standard of care (SOC) is superior to SOC alone for the treatment of clinical relevant cardiac-induced volume retention parameters in patients hospitalized for worsening HF initially treated with conventional therapy including diuretics.</detailed_description>

Patients capable of giving informed consent to participate in the study of their own free will. 1. Cardiac surgery within 60 days of enrollment 2. Patients with an assisted cardiac mechanical device 3. Patients receiving CRT (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) within 60 days of enrollment. 4. Patients with active or significant complications or symptoms as follow: Suspected decrease in circulatory blood flow Refractory endstage HF (patients considered to require mechanical circulatory support, continuous intravenous positive inotropic therapy, referral of cardiac transplantation, or hospice care) Cardiac valvular disease with significant heart valve stenosis Sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation within 30 days prior to screening examination Acute myocardial infarction within 30 days prior to screening examination Cerebrovascular disorders within 6 months prior to screening examination (other than asymptomatic cerebral infarction) Patients with a definite diagnosis of active myocarditis or amyloid cardiomyopathy Poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus (HbAlc 10%) Anuria (urinary output less than 100 ml per day) History of Hyperthyroidism Urination impaired due to urinary tract stricture, urinary calculus, tumor in urinary tract, or other cause Hemofiltration or dialysis Patients unable to sense thirst, inappropriately respond to thirst or those who have impaired oral fluid intake. 5. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to benzazepine derivatives such as mozavaptan hydrochloride or benazepril hydrochloride 6. Patients who are severely obese (BMI exceeding 35 kg/m2) 7. Patients with systolic blood pressure in the decubitus position below 90 mmHg 8. Patients with any of following abnormal laboratory values: Total bilirubin exceeding 3.0 mg/dL, hemoglobin of less than 9 g/dL, serum creatinine exceeding 3.0 mg/dL, serum sodium exceeding 147 mEq/L, or serum potassium exceeding 5.5 mEq/L 9.

Patients who received any investigational drug other than Tolvaptan within 30 days prior to the screening examination 11. Patients with general physical conditions, which may confound the results of the study, pose additional risk or preclude evaluation and assessments in this study</criteria>
