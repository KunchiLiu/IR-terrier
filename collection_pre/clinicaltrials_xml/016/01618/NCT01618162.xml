	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide in insulin na√Øve subjects inadequately controlled with SU (sulphonylurea) alone or in combination with metformin. All subjects will continue their pre-trial SU treatment with or without metformin treatment without changing the frequency or dose throughout the trial.</brief_summary>
