	<brief_summary>This study was conducted to explore the influencing factors, subjects and testers' evaluation about pain measurement with hand-held pressure algometer with different size probes. Methods:100 healthy undergraduate students(50 males and 50 females) were recruited into this study. Pain measurement including pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance(PTO) was carried out by the hand-held pressure algometer with different size probes (from 1cm2 to 0.01cm2) on three different measuring spots in right forearm. We recorded subjects' skinfold thickness, time per test procedure, types of pain perception, receptivity and degree of accuracy as well as testers' level of laborious.</brief_summary>
