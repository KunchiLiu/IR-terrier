	<brief_summary>Severe burns result in persistent and extensive fat deposition in liver and muscle tissue. This may be related to the prolonged insulin resistance observed following burn. In this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that essential amino acids act in synergy with exercise to improve liver steatosis and muscle lipid metabolism, and thus also affect insulin sensitivity. Children with burns will participate in six weeks of exercise training with/without amino acid supplementation. Before and after the intervention, measurements will be done to determine muscle and liver fat content, muscle fat and protein metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
