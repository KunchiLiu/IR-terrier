	<brief_summary>Many types of cardiovascular disease begin when the layer of cells lining blood vessels (endothelial cells) start to function abnormally. This causes white blood cells (monocytes) to enter the blood vessel wall and eventually form lesions. Fats from foods we consume are carried in the blood for 3-8 hours after a fatty meal in small particles known as chylomicrons (CM) and chylomicron remnants (CMR). The overall aim of this project is to investigate the idea that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) protect against heart disease by modifying the effect of CMR on endothelial cells and monocytes. We hypothesize that n3-PUFA carried in CMR reduce detrimental events which promote blood vessel damage and activate protective mechanisms to improve the function of arteries.</brief_summary>
