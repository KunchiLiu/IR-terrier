	<brief_summary>Overall Design: This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study which will be conducted in three arms (as described below). Each arm will be conducted in two parts: a Phase 1 part which will include dose escalation and a Phase 2 part which will include four cohorts in specific disease indications. Phase 1 will also include a food effect study of E7449 as a single agent. Once the MTD in the Phase 1 single agent arm and the Phase 1 combination arms of this study has been achieved, the sponsor will submit the relevant safety information and recommended Phase 2 dose to the IRB/Health Authorities. Arm 1: E7449 will be administered as a single agent. Arm 2: E7449 will be administered in combination with TMZ. Arm 3: E7449 will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subjects: 1. Subjects with measurable or nonmeasurable disease following the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1, Appendix 1) for Phase 1 part of the study.

Males or females age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of informed consent. 11. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [betahCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of betahCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a doublebarrier method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a doublebarrier method as described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. 12. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and their female partner must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). 13. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.
