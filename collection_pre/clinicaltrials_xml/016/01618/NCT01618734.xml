	<brief_title>Eltrombopag and Romiplostim Used Alternatively in Patients With Immune Thrombopenia (ITP): Efficacy and Safety.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrombopoietin mimetics agents are available since 5 years in France through clinical trials first and then after their license. Two drugs are used: romiplostim and eltrombopag. These molecules have the same receptor on the megacaryocyte and induce the same stimulation of this cell leading to the differentiation and the proliferation into platelets. But romiplostim and eltrombopag have 2 different characteristics: the way of administration (oral for eltrombopag and subcutaneous for romiplostim) and the binding site to the C-MPL receptor on megacaryocyte. The aim of this study is to describe ITP patients who received these two drugs alternatively in order to know if there is a benefit for switching these molecules in clinical practice.</detailed_description>
