	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated that altered microvascular blood flow is an important marker of severe sepsis. Usually, these patients need invasive ventilatory support, frequent use of sedatives and it is unknown if these agents interfere or not on microvascular blood flow. The goal of this study was to compare effects of propofol and midazolam infusions on sublingual microcirculation of septic shock patients.</brief_summary>
