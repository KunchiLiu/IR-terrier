	<brief_summary>The clinical and pathological similarities between LRRK2 related parkinsonism and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) indicate that monogenetic LRRK2 parkinsonism may be a paradigm for the development of Lewy bodies disease, and a careful look at discrepancies between these two conditions may provide insight into the pathogenesis of PD. The early involvement of the enteric nervous system (ENS) during PD led to theories that an as yet unidentified external agent entering the ENS causes PD . If lesions of the ENS are found in patients who present with a genetic form of parkinsonism would go against this notion, and thus provide insight to the pathophysiology of the disease.</brief_summary>
