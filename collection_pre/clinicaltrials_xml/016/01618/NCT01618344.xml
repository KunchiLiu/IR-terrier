	<brief_title>Smart-phone Application to Promote Medication Adherence in Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-adherence to oral medications is a prevalent problem in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer that may impact both survival and quality of life while on treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore use of a smart-phone medication reminder application to promote adherence to oral medications by AYA with cancer. The study's primary aim is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of using a smart-phone medication reminder application to promote adherence to oral medications by AYA with cancer as well as to characterize application use. Secondary aims include: 1) to obtain initial estimates of intervention effect- measured by pre-intervention to post-intervention differences in perceived behavioral control for adherence, intention to adhere, and adherence behavior - to inform design of a future trial powered to detect a clinically significant effect of smart-phone medication reminder application use on adherence to oral medications; and 2) to examine the relationships among perceived behavioral control for adherence, intention to adhere, and adherence behavior. A pre-post single group design will be used. Data will be collected weekly for 4 weeks before introduction of the intervention and for 8 weeks following introduction of the intervention. Analytic approaches will include descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling.</detailed_description>
