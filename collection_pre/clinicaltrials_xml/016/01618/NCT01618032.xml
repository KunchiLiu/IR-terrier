	<brief_summary>Restrictions on ankle dorsiflexion are common in subjects with chronic ankle instability (CAI). In fact, this is one factor that can contribute to the recurrence of such injuries. Passive mobilization techniques to improve ankle dorsiflexion are commonly used in physiotherapy treatments. However, no studies have compared manipulative techniques of mobilization techniques in subjects with chronic ankle instability. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of two mobilization techniques on ankle dorsiflexion in patients with chronic ankle instability.</brief_summary>
