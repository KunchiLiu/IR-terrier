	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that the microarchitecture of bone influence the degree of periprosthetic bone loss after total knee arthroplasty surgery. The investigators collected the bone fragment at the distal femur while performing total knee replacement and take quantitative radiography analysis . Before and after the surgery(6 month ,12 month) , the investigators check the BMD at identical location of the distal femur by using dual energy absorptiometry. The investigators will use linear regression to evaluate the relationship between the microarchitecture and the degree of bone loss.</brief_summary>
