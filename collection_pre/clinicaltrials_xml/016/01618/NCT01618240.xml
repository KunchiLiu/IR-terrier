	<brief_summary>First part of a 2 part study with the same IRB protocol #, and labeled 'A'. Investigators hypothesized that clinical muscle strength assessment (manual muscle testing) predicts the ability to protect the airway during swallowing in long-term ventilated subjects. More specifically, the investigators hypothesized that low muscle strength is associated with the inability to clear secretions from the peri-laryngeal area (valleculae and pyriform sinus residue scale (VPSR scale [NRS: 0-4] of &gt; 1) and entering the materials into airway (PAS scale [1-8]&gt; 1), which should predispose to endotracheal aspiration.</brief_summary>
