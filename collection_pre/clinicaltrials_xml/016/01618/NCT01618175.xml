	<brief_summary>Background: acute bronchiolitis (AB) is a common reason for hospitalization of infants in all population groups, and is usually due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The main cause for hospitalization is often a need for oxygen, but can also include high fever (with a suspected secondary bacterial infection) or increasing respiratory distress. In a minority of cases (some of which can be identified in advance by defining risk groups) a serious illness may develop, including risk of respiratory failure and death. Most cases will just require supplemental oxygen and suction of secretions from the nose (as listed in the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics - AAP). However, this apparently "simple" treatment still requires continued hospitalization. This results in a sharp increase in bed occupancy in Israeli hospital pediatric departments in the winter months. In recent years two studies from developed countries have been published where safety has been demonstrated for home oxygen treatment for babies with AB. However, feasibility studies have not been published yet, for example for populations living in poor conditions. The General Health Services (Klalit) in Israel provides integrated hospital and community health service to the majority of the population living o in our region, thus presenting an opportunity for optimal interventions related to this disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To develop a model of community based safe handling of AB in various communities in southern Israel. Methods: A prospective intervention study examining the safety and health expenditures in infants with AB treated first in hospital but then discharged earlier with home oxygen while monitored in the community. Contribution to the focus areas, and the impact of results on health policy planning: 1) Reducing hospitalization days and general financial savings. 2) Ability to implement these findings to populations with variable socio-economic backgrounds. 3) Prevention of nosocomial infections related morbidity. Innovation and uniqueness in the study: test of this hypothesis precisely in our region, where populations have different socio-economic backgrounds, will build a model that may be suitable for all levels of society.</detailed_description>
