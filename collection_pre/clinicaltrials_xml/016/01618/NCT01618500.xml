	<brief_summary>A novel computerised neuropsychological test battery for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) has been developed. The aim is to provide the clinician with a free of charge, standardized tool, assessing the cognitive decline or improvements in the cognitive domains specific for NPH. Results from the battery indicate good reliability and validity for the computerized tests Results from the computerised battery seems promising. However, ability for the battery to detect cognitive improvements after a shunt operation remains to be tested. Study objectives 1. Improvement after shunt. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of shunting on neuropsychological performance in NPH patients, using a computerized battery. 2. Feasibility. The ability to complete the test battery by the intended patient group will be tested. 3. Baseline profile. Baseline scores for NPH-patients will be compared to scores of healthy individuals (from previous study).</brief_summary>
