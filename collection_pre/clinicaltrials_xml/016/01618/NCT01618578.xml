	<brief_title>The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) in Patients With CRPS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with CRPS of the upper limb distortions of body representation and impairments of sense of body ownership are well-known. To investigate the body schema and body image stability of these patients in comparison to patients with upper limb pain of origin other than CRPS and healthy subjects, we conducted a series of rubber hand illusions. This well - established paradigm is elicited by visuo-tactile stimulation of one´s own real hand and a visible hand and forearm prosthesis. The present study investigates 1) if and how far patients with CRPS are susceptible to experience the illusion 2) how far the illusion strength differs between CRPS and patients with unilateral pain of the upper limb of other origin and healthy subjects 3) how far parameters, e.g. neglect-like severity symptoms, body plasticity, empathy, duration of disease and pain intensity influence the illusion strength.</detailed_description>
