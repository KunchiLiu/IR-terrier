	<brief_summary>This trial tests whether hands-on training is superior to expert demonstration regarding the management of shoulder dystocia (stuck shoulder) during delivery on a training model.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) Evaluation of Shoulder Dystocia Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We prospectively randomize probands to a 30 min hands-on (group 1) and a 30 min demonstration (group 2) training session teaching a standardized SD algorithm scheme on a pelvic training model. Probands are tested with a 22 item Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scoring system after training and 72 hours thereafter. OSATS scores are the primary outcome. Performance time (PT), self assessment (SA), confidence (CON), and global rating scale (GRS) are the secondary outcomes. Statistics will beperformed using Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis.</detailed_description>
