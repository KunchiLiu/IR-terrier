	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare BIAsp 30 twice daily individually adjusted by the subject versus BIAsp 30 twice daily individually adjusted by the investigator both combined with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with premixed human insulin. Subjects to continue their OAD background treatment: Metformin plus/minus alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.</brief_summary>
