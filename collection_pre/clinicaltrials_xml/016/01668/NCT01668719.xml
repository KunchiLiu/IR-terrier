	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of elotuzumab and to see how well it works when given together with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma that is likely to recur (come back), or spread (high-risk). Lenalidomide and bortezomib may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Also, bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, also work in different ways to kill cancer cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving elotuzumab together with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone may be a better way to block cancer growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1211 Bortezomib, Dexamethasone, and Lenalidomide With or Without Elotuzumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the appropriate Phase II dose of elotuzumab to use in combination with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To assess whether incorporation of the novel agent elotuzumab into the treatment algorithm of high-risk multiple myeloma (HRMM) will improve progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase II) III. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of this treatment strategy in this patient population. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of elotuzumab, followed by a phase II, randomized study. PHASE I: INDUCTION: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14; and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 (and on day 15 of courses 1 and 2 only). Patients also receive elotuzumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1 and 2 and on days 1 and 11 of courses 3-8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE: Patients receive bortezomib SC or IV on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21; dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15; and elotuzumab IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: INDUCTION: Patients receive bortezomib SC or IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-14; and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (patients who received a course of chemotherapy prior to registration will begin protocol treatment with course 2 and receive a total of 7 courses of protocol therapy). MAINTENANCE: Patients receive bortezomib SC or IV on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21; and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: INDUCTION: Patients receive bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone as in Arm I. Patients also receive elotuzumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1 and 2 and on days 1 and 11 of courses 3-8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE: Patients receive bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone as in Arm I. Patients also receive elotuzumab IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 6 years.</detailed_description>
