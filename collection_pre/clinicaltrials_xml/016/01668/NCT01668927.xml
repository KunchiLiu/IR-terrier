	<brief_summary>The increase of antibiotic resistance to H. pylori causes failure of treatment. Furazolidone, amoxicillin and tetracycline are good candidates for rescue therapy since resistance to these three antimicrobials was rare. It is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of these four bismuth-containing quadruple regimens with above antibiotics as empirical rescue therapies for H. pylori eradication.</brief_summary>
