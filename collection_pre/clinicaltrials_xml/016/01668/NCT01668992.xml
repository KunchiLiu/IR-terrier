	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the impact of a family-based intervention on the well-being of Burmese migrant and displaced children and families living in Tak province, Thailand. The methodology used in the impact evaluation study is a randomized waitlist controlled trial. The study hypothesizes that participation in a family-based intervention will lead to improved parenting practices and child and family outcomes, as follows. Primary hypotheses: 1. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report increased knowledge and use of positive parenting skills compared to control; 2. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report less use of physical punishment and other harsh forms of discipline compared to control; 3. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will report higher levels of family functioning and cohesion compared to control. Secondary hypotheses: 1. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will report lower levels of externalizing and internalizing child behaviors compared to control; 2. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will report higher levels of child resilience and psychosocial well-being compared to control; 3. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report lower levels of alcohol use compared to control.</brief_summary>
