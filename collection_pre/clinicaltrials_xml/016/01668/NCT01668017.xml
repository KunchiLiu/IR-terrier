	<brief_summary>This is a two-part trial. "Solid tumor" in this protocol means solid tumor excluding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Part 1: Dose Escalation Phase in subjects with solid tumor (Cohort A) and HCC (Cohort B). The dose will be increased from 45 mg twice a day (BID) with 3+3 cohort method up to the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pimasertib established as single agent in the global studies for each arm independently. Part 2: The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) defined in Part 1 will be confirmed in more subjects in Cohort A (N=18) and Cohort B (N=6) separately. Following the recommendation by the Safety Monitoring Committee, Cohort B was discontinued due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and there will be no further enrollment of subjects to this cohort. This decision is based upon review of safety and efficacy information.</brief_summary>
