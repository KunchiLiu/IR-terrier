	<brief_title>Edible Plant Exosome Ability to Prevent Oral Mucositis Associated With Chemoradiation Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of plant (grape) exosomes to prevent oral mucositis associated with chemoradiation treatment of head and neck cancer. Also, to be evaluated is the effect of grape exosomes on the production of cytokines and immune responses to tumor exosomal antigens, metabolic and molecular markers in these patients.</detailed_description>
