	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to assess a new system for the automatic detection, quantification and treatment of Near Fall (NF) episodes in healthy older adults with a history of falls. The system is comprized of a treadmill and a virtual reality simulation which provides a motor-cognitive challenge to provoke NF. The challenges provided by the system are individualized and using machine learning algorithms will enable the identification and detection of NF under different conditions and allow for the most suitable treatment.</brief_summary>
