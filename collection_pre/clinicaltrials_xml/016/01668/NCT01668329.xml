	<brief_summary>Septic shock is a frequent pathology responsible for over 30000 deaths/year in France. Its outcome has not been improved despite the knowledge on inflammatory processes; a reason for these lack of results may lay on the lack of data on the precise dynamics of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades and their consequences. We intend to achieve accurate monitoring of the inflammatory process on a small group of non-immunocompromised patients. Our goal is to obtain quality data, repeated over time, by limiting the technical variability.</brief_summary>
