	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Depression in Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In dialysis patients, low QOL and depression affects clinical outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. Therefore at the point of treating dialysis patients, It is important to provide not only physical health but also psychosocial health. QOL could be decided by physical health (i.e. sign and symptom, laboratory results, death) and psychological health (i.e. fatigue, pain, consciousness of health and satisfaction). And also generally it is well known that physical and psychological functions in dialysis patients are decreased. And especially depression is common disease in dialysis patients. It is also well known that about from 25 to 50 percent of dialysis patients have depression which could result in low QOL moreover hospitalization, complication, and mortality. But there is no QOL and depression study with hydration status. Therefore the investigators would like to explore it. The objective of the study is to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and depression in dialysis patients and assess the hydration effect on QOL and depression over time</detailed_description>
