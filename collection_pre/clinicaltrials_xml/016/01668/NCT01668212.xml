	<brief_summary>Perifollicular Doppler could reflect the quality of the follicle's vascularization and, consequently, the one of the oocyte that ensues from it. Perifollicuar Doppler is the analysis, in ultrasound, of the blood flow in vessels surrounding the follicle. The goal of this study is to evaluate if there is a link, in natural cycle In Vitro Fertilization, between the quality of the vascularization and the one of the oocyte, the embryo and the pregnancy.</brief_summary>
