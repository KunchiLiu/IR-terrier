	<brief_title>Efficacy of Immunomudulatory Therapy With All-trans Retinoid Acid for Adults With Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP), an acquired immune disease is characterized by impaired generation of autoantibody-specific platelet. At least 30% adult patients turn into refractory ITP. The pathogenesis of ITP remains to be elucidated. Now ,CD4+ helper cells have been classified as belong to T-helper 1(TH1), T-helper 2(TH2), T-helper17and Regulory T cell(Tregs). All-trans retinoic acid(ATRA) mainly applied in skin disease and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Recently, ATRA is also a immunomodulator which can induce differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis of cells, and immunomudulatory. In the international, the investigators first treat RITP with ATRA. To investigate the therapeutic effects of ATRA on RITP, and using new index in the cells, cytokines and molecular biology of three in-depth study of its mechanism.</detailed_description>
