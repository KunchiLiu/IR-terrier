	<brief_summary>Inflammation has been known to be a pivotal pathogenic mechanism of obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adipose tissue functions as a major endocrine organ by adipokine mediated modulation of a number of signaling cascades in target tissues, that has pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities. Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel adipokines. Therefore, the investigators tried to clarify the clinical meaning of these two adipokines in the subjects with or without metabolic syndrome</brief_summary>
