	<brief_title>Warfarin Versus Aspirin in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>randomised open labelled prospective study We enroll patients with CHADS2 score 1 non-valvular AF with chronic kidney disease, and analyze all thromboembolic event or major bleeding event during follow-up period. Warfarin group take dose adjusted warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) and aspirin group take aspirin 100mg daly. Thromboembolic events: Ischemic stroke or systemic arterial occlusion Major bleeding: gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding (code 430, code 431, code 432 by ICD-9-CM codes) -&gt; Only the first event of each case will be used for the analysis</detailed_description>
