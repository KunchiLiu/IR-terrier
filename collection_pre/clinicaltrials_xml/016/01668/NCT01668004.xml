	<brief_title>The Incidence of Extra-Articular Manifestations in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis Treated With Golimumab (MK-8259-012)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, history-controlled, multi-site study of GLM in participants with AS. For evaluation of the primary study outcome measure, participants will serve as their own control. The period before start of treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent will serve as historical control for the incidence of extra-articular manifestations, with a review of the medical records done for the previous 1-year period. Each participant will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from the time the participant signs the Informed Consent Form through the final contact. After screening, two to four weeks before study start, each participant will be receiving study treatment for approximately 12 months, depending on the response to GLM after 3 months. All participants will be followed for a minimum of 12 months, irrespective of the duration of GLM treatment.</detailed_description>
