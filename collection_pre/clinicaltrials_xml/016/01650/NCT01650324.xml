	<brief_title>A Single-dose Phase 1 Study of DBPR108 in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study represents the first administration of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor DBPR108 to humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties following single oral doses in healthy subjects. DPP4 is a validated drug target for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes. Objectives of the study will be to characterize the safety and tolerability of single doses of DBPR108; to characterize the single dose PK of DBPR108 in plasma and urine; to characterize the single dose PD of DBPR108 on glucose, glucagon, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity, and total and active forms of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in plasma levels and insulin and C-peptide in serum levels.</detailed_description>
