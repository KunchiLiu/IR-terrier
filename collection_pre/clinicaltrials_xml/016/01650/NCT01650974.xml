	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal OXygen Therapy in High Risk Patients of Hypoxia Undergoing Diagnostic BRONCHOscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxemia is frequently seen during diagnostic bronchoscopy. Nasal prong or other existing oxygen supply methods are often difficult to maintain adequate oxygenation during bronchoscopy. In particular, bronchoscopy to patients already showing hypoxemia can be dangerous even though applying conventional oxygen therapy. Thus, we want to elucidate the usefulness of nasal high flow oxygen therapy to hypoxemic patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy.</detailed_description>
