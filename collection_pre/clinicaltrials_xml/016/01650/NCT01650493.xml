	<brief_summary>Three toothpastes will be compared, two toothpastes in each subject, to establish whether changes in the depth or area of an artificially created area of tooth decay is the same for each toothpaste.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective is to evaluate the demineralization and remineralization effects of two experimental fluoride containing dentrifices on enamel and root surface lesions compared with a control dentrifice. Study is a partially randomized, 3-period cross over study involving 30 subjects who need a full-coverage crown on a posterior tooth. Each subject will use each of the study dentrifices over 3 months according to a randomization scheme. Subjects will brush daily with the assigned dentrifice unsupervised. Subjects will each have two provisonal crowns for use during the study. These crowns will contain three hard tooth tissue sections located at interproximal sites. The three tooth tissue slabs will consist of an artificial enamel caries lesion, an artificial root caries lesion, and a sound root. After removal, the tooth slabs will be evaluated using polarized light and photomicrographs for changes in area and depth of lesions.</detailed_description>
