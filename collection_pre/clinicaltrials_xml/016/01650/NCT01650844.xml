	<brief_summary>This project aims to improve guideline-based asthma care using enhanced communication and screening tools, telemedicine and directly observed therapy of preventive medications in city schools. Web-based screening will be used to identify children with persistent or poorly controlled asthma and to send reports to the child's primary care doctor. Children in the SB-TEAM group will receive a telemedicine asthma assessment in school and be prescribed a daily preventive asthma medication to be taken through school-based directly observed therapy. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the use of the SB-TEAM intervention for improving guideline based care, enhancing adherence to effective preventive medications and at reducing morbidity among young urban children with asthma.</brief_summary>
