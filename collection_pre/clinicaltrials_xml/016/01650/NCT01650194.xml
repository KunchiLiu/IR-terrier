	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. Subjects diagnosed with cancer of the prostate that is getting worse and spread to the bone despite receiving hormone treatment will be enrolled and receive study treatment until disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine Safety and Tolerability of Enzalutamide (MDV3100) in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate in Bone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the study duration, all subjects will maintain androgen deprivation with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist or orchiectomy. Study drug will be administered until disease progression. Disease progression is defined as a composite endpoint consisting of either clinical deterioration, radiographic progression or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria.</detailed_description>
