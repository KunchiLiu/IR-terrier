	<brief_title>Show Equivalence of the Modified BreathID Compared to Currently Approved BreathID in H.Pylori Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ¹³C-Urea Breath Test (UBT) is a non-invasive test for detecting the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection by the organism's urease activity. In the presence of H. pylori, the ingestion of urea, labeled with the non-radioactive isotope 13C, results in production of labeled 13CO2, which can be quantified in expired breath. Each test is performed using a test kit consisting of a 13C-urea tablet and citrica powder to be dissolved in tap water ("13C-urea solution"). Before and after ingestion of the 13C-urea solution, samples of exhaled breath can be collected using a nasal cannula for real-time analysis and comparison to baseline concentrations. The patient's exhaled breath is analyzed and the ratio between 13CO2 and 12CO2 is computed. The patient is considered H. pylori positive when the difference between the ratios exceeds a predefined threshold (5 delta over baseline (DOB)). The current device marketed by Exalenz is large and costly. Exalenz has built a smaller, cheaper and more reliable new generation device for this application. Equivalence is being demonstrated in this study.</detailed_description>
