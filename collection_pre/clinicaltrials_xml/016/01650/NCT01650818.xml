	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Training in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scarce evidence is available regarding aerobic exercise training of patients with ALS. Some studies using transgenic mouse models of familial ALS have shown markedly slowed disease progression, improved functional capacity, and extension of survival in animals undergoing aerobic exercise training. In humans, only one non-randomized study has shown that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training was of little beneficial effect in a small group of patients with Kennedy disease, a rare X-linked progressive neuromuscular disease involving lower motorneurons, presenting a pathophysiological picture quite different from that of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, the safety and the effects of aerobic exercise training on functional capacity and quality of life of patients with ALS have not been systematically evaluated as yet in a randomized, controlled trial with an adequate sample size.</detailed_description>
