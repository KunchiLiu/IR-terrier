	<brief_title>Genetic Load and Phenotype in Aggressive AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to test individuals who have already progressed to various forms of AMD to evaluate correlations between genetic markers and particular features of AMD including geographic atrophy and pigment epithelial detachments. We hypothesize that patients with more aggressive forms of AMD will have a higher genetic burden contributed by markers in ARMS 2, Complement Factor H (CFH), Complement component 3 (C3), Complement component 2 (C2) , Factor B (FB), or other genetic polymorphisms associated with CNV.</detailed_description>
