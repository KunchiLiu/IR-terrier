	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the existence of a relationship between the presence of certain abl polymorphisms (or haplotypes) upon CML diagnosis and the occurrence of primary resistance to the treatment of CML by imatinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Response in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in Function of Abl Polymorphisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first secondary objective of this study is to identify, in patients not responding to treatment, possible changes in the polymorphisms of interest during the course of the disease, reclassifying such polymorphisms as mutations. The second secondary objective is to compare the control patients in terms of polymorphism frequency on the nonpathological abl fraction.</detailed_description>
