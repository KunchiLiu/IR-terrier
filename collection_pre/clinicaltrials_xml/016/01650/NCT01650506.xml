	<criteria>Confirmed pathologic diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer, OR Prior diagnosis of ER or PR positive breast cancer [HER2 negative] that is demonstrated to be both ER and PR negative (no or rare staining) on the patient's most recent biopsy. Patients with measurable or nonmeasurable metastatic disease (RECIST 1.1). At least one prior treatment for metastatic disease. Availability of adequate tumor tissue for exploratory analysis and plan to obtain the material (see section 12.6). Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. No chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given within 2 weeks prior to the start of protocol treatment. Patients must be ≥ 18 and &lt; 80 years old. Performance Status: ECOG 02. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. Patients must have recovered from uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia. Required Laboratory Values: ANC ≥1,250/mm3, platelets ≥75,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL, total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, AST/ALT ≤3.0 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN, Patients must have either a normal serum creatinine (&lt;= IULN) OR estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min (CockcroftGault formula) within 14 days prior to registration. Concomitant Medications: Erlotinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Patients CANNOT be receiving enzymeinducing or enzyme inhibiting agents listed here: Inhibitors: Amiodarone, Amprenavir, Atazanavir, Chloramphenicol, Clarithromycin, Conivaptan, Cyclosporine, Darunavir, Dasatinib, Delavirdine, Diltiazem, Erythromycin, Fluconazole, Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Fosamprenavir, Imatinib, Indinavir, Isoniazid, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, Lapatinib, Miconazole, Nefazodone, Nelfinavir, Posaconazole, Ritonavir, Quinupristin, Saquinavir, Tamoxifen, Telithromycin, Troleandomycin, Verapamil, Voriconazole. Inducers: Aminoglutethimide,Bexarotene, Bosentan, Carbamazepine, Efavirenz, Fosphenytoin, Griseofulvin, Modafinil, Nafcillin, Nevirapine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifabutin, Rifampin, Rifapentine, St. John's wort, Sulfadimidine, Sulfinpyrazone, Troglitazone, Troleandomycin. All concomitant medications must be recorded. Sexually Active Patients: For all sexually active patients, the use of adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) will be required prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Nonpregnant status will be determined in all women of childbearing potential. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent. Active CNS disease a. Subjects with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowable if they have been clinically stable for at least 6 weeks since completion of definitive treatment, are off steroids (if the steroids were part of the CNS disease treatment), and in the case of brain metastases, have stable or improved imaging at least 6 weeks after completion of their definitive treatment. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent either the giving of informed consent or the receipt of treatment. Patients pregnant or nursing. Patients who have used tobacco or nicotine products or medications within the last three months given their significant effect on erlotinib drug levels. Diabetes. Defined as HgbA1C ≥ 6.5%. Prior metformin treatment OR EGFR targeted therapy. Rapidly progressive disease as judged by the investigator (Examples include rapidly deteriorating performance status or symptomatic lymphangitic spread). Patient has any condition associated with increased risk of metforminassociated lactic acidosis (e.g. congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association {NYHA} Class III or IV functional status, history of acidosis of any type; habitual intake of 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day).</criteria>
