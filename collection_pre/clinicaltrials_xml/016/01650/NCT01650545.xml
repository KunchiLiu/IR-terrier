	<brief_summary>This is a single-center pilot study to investigate the efficacy and safety of aerosolized liposomal cyclosporine A in the treatment of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal cyclosporine A in the treatment of chronic rejection. Pulmonary function and changes in BOS grade are the primary end points.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerosol Liposomal Cyclosporine for Chronic Rejection in Lung Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized single-center pilot study to investigate the efficacy and safety of aerosolized liposomal cyclosporine A (L-CsA) in the treatment of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients with Grade 1 or 2 BOS. The primary endpoints will include: - Improvement or stabilization of pulmonary function test (FEV1) from baseline - Stabilization of histology (no deterioration from baseline) - Safety of the preparation The secondary endpoints will include: - Pharmacokinetics and distribution of CsA in blood - - Change in cytokine levels from BAL specimens.</detailed_description>
