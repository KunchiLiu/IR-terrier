	<brief_summary>Infarct size is a major determinant of prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI). It has been reported that Cyclosporine A (CsA) administered immediately prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) significantly could reduce reperfusion injury and consequently infarct size in ST elevation MI (STEMI) patients. CYCLE trial is a multicenter, controlled, randomized open label study, with blind assessment of endpoint measures. The objective is to determine whether a single i.v. dose of CsA within 6 hour onset of symptoms of STEMI in 444 patients, improves outcomes after successful primary PCI, by reducing myocardial injury associated to reperfusion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The possibility of optimizing the results of an early and effective reopening of the occluded artery by reducing/avoiding the impact of the so-called reperfusion injury has been for many years one of the most elusive objectives of pharmacological research, with evolving hypothesis and targets. A recently published trial has provided support to a line of investigation focused on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, the so-called permeability transition, as cause of irreversible myocardial injury associated to reperfusion. In fact, a single dose of the widely used immunosuppressant agent, CsA, a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, was reported to limit ischemia−reperfusion injury in 50 patients with anterior MI who underwent primary PCI. Since infarct size and left ventricular function are the main determinants of long-term morbidity and mortality, a single measure to limit infarct size is of potential clinical benefit. Therefore the results of the previously mentioned trial should be replicated in a larger sample size, before going on to a trial with clinical endpoints. - Sample size Assuming an incidence of the primary endpoint of 55% in the control group, we calculated that 444 patients (222 patients per group) will be required for the study to have 80% power to detect a 25% relative improvement (resulting in an endpoint frequency of 68.7% in the CsA group) with a 5% drop-out rate and a two-sided alpha level of 5%. The size of the trial will allow to investigate treatment benefit for the secondary endpoint hsTnT: assuming a concentration of 2.7 ng/mL on day 4 (common SD=2.1) in the control group, the study will have a 90% power to show a 25% reduction with CsA at a two-sided alpha level of 5%. - Safety Adverse events with intravenous CsA (i.e. anaphylactoid reactions/anaphylactic shock, acute renal failure, or hypertensive crisis) are reported to be very rare. In this trial, patients will receive only one iv dose of CsA, therefore we expect a low probability of adverse effects related to repeated administrations, i.e. acute renal failure or hypertensive crisis. Nonetheless a close monitoring of the safety of the single dose of CsA is foreseen with monthly examination of data of safety by the Steering Committee.</detailed_description>
