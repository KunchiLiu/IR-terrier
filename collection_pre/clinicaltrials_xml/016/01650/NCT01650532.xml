	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to test the effects of an 8-week supervised, site-based, group yoga intervention on cognition and functional fitness in older adults. The SAY Exercise study will compare the yoga group to a stretching group to determine if the program improves attention and cognition, reduces functional limitations, enhances functional performance in everyday activities, as well as psychological health in sedentary older adults between 55-80 years of age. The investigators also propose to assess heart rate variability using a 3-lead EKG and salivary cortisol levels to understand the moderators of the yoga-cognition relationship.</brief_summary>
