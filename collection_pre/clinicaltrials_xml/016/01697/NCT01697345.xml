	<brief_summary>It is well documented that women who have breast cancer may experience a decrease in quality of life and sexual functioning due to side effects from adjuvant endocrine therapy, typically aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Women taking AIs are more likely to report unpleasant urogenital and vaginal symptoms due to the physiologic suppression of estradiol. This treatment can impair sexual functioning and cause a decreased sexual health quality of life. At the present time, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the vulvovaginal or sexual side effects related to the use of AIs. The lack of treatment options is concerning because the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer continues to increase; their longevity, also, continues to increase with the use of newer adjuvant chemotherapies. Local health care practitioners have observed that the benefits of vaginal testosterone for sexual health in breast cancer survivors are similar to the benefits of vaginal estrogen in women without breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a daily compounded vaginal testosterone cream for 4 weeks (28 days) on breast cancer survivor's reported experience of vulvovaginal symptoms accompanying the use of AIs and their associated quality of life and sexual functioning.</brief_summary>
