	<brief_title>Impact on Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Total Gastrectomy or Proximal Gastrectomy for Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall, the incidence of stomach cancer worldwide is declining with geographical variation. However, an increase in the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction, called cardia or AEG has been observed in recent years. AEG may represent a specific histopathological and biologic entity. In the treatment AEG there is argument over whether proximal gastractomy(PG) or total gastractomy (TG) should be done. The quality of life (QOL) of the patients following TG or PG arouses people's attention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences of the quality of life in patients undergoing total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Pathologically confirmed gastric malignant tumor at FUSCC (biopsy may be performed at other institutions but slides must be confirmed at FUSCC, as is routine care at our institution), and the patients be assessed can achieve R0 radical dissection through total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy by three specialists. Patients 2075 years old Normal organ function, able to tolerate surgery, no clear contraindication for surgery No evidence of metastases of adjacent organs be able to provide followup over 2 years No specific treatment for gastric cancer before surgery In line with the Declaration of Helsinki and the requirements of the hospital ethics committee. The subjects were able to understand and comply with the trial protocol, and signed informed consent. • AEG SiewertⅠtype patients Synchronous or metachronous (less than five years) and patients with other malignancies. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension Associated with blood diseases Serious heart/ lung and kidney dysfunction or with metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism. Suffering from a serious neurological disease or psychological diseases affecting the life.</criteria>
