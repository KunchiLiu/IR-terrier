	<brief_summary>The incidence of cartilage pathology has grown due to the ageing population, and the increase in sports participation and its associated trauma. The aim of the treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis consists in reducing pain and improving the knee function in order to limit the sport, professional and social negative impact in the youngest patients. The symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis associates painkillers and non steroid anti inflammatory drugs (nsad). In case of ineffectiveness of the oral drugs intra articular injections are proposed. Intra articular injections of hyaluronic acid are recommended by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Nevertheless their efficacy remain non predictable in patients so as the duration of clinical improvement which does not exceed 6 months. The articular cartilage has a limited capacity for self-repair due to the low mitotic activity of chondrocytes and its avascularity. Platelet-rich plasma is a natural concentrate of growth factors: PDGF, TGF b, IGF-1, FGF and the cytokines, liberated by platelet degranulation. The influence of these growth factors in the cartilage repair is being widely investigated in vivo and in vitro. These factors could stimulate the chondral reparation via a neovascularization, a collagen synthesis and an activation of the chondrocytes. The hypothesis is that the intra articular injection of PRP, with its capacity to enhance articular cartilage repair, could be a therapeutic alternative to hyaluronic acid in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis resisting the oral drugs. Material and methods: We intend to conduct a comparative, monocentric prospective randomized, double-blind study on 80 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to compare the results of 2 intra articular treatment: platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic acid.</brief_summary>
