	<brief_title>Optimal Improvement of Vein Graft Patency Long Term by the Implementation Of Novel Endoscopic Harvesting Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational study of 100 patients who will undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting. Eligible candidates will undergo lone Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) procedures with endoscopic vein harvesting using best harvesting practices, defined as: systemic heparinization prior to vein manipulation, standardization of vein graft harvesting techniques, pressure limiting syringe and 3 month use of dual anti-platelet therapy. Patients will undergo a CT angiography at 30 days and 12 months to assess vein graft patency.</detailed_description>
