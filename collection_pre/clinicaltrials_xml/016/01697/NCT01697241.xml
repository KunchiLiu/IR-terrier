	<brief_title>Effect of Exercise as Non-surgical Treatments on Time to Total Hip Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip replacements are performed at an increasing rate, also in younger and less disabled patients. Recent studies indicate non-surgical interventions being effective in reducing pain and disability also at later stages of disease when hip replacement is considered. Possible, non-surgical treatments can be used to postpone hip replacement. The effect of education and supervised exercise on time to hip replacement is largely unknown</detailed_description>
