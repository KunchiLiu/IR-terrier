	<brief_summary>Electroporation will increase the efficiency of DNA priming in terms of immune responses and will lead to a dose sparing DNA vaccine regimen. Furthermore increased DNA vaccine concentration will reduce the number of shots necessary to deliver the full dose and induce comparable immune responses as with lower DNA vaccine concentrations.</brief_summary>
