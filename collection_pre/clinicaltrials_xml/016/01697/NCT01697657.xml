	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Europe and Oceania. The aim of this trial is to investigate whether insulin detemir combined with insulin aspart compared to NPH insulin combined with insulin aspart could reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes whilst maintaining the same degree of glycaemic control subjects with type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
