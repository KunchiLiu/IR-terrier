	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a prospective cross-over study to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes control and the pro-inflammatory markers involved in microvascular complications in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes. The investigators expect to see a significant improvement in glycemic control and a reduction of serum pro-inflammatory markers in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, who are treated with vitamin D.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Between 13 to 21 years of age, with at least Tanner stage 4 sexual maturity for males or postmenarchal females, and T1DM for at least 1 year. To ensure that inclusion criteria for sexual maturity are met, a physical exam for research purposes will be performed. 2. HbA1c between 7 to 9% 3. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL in males and &lt; 1.2 mg/dL in females) and adequate liver function (AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) 4. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (25OH vit D level &lt; 30ng/mL) which will be determined on initial screening labs after consenting subjects. 1. Less than 13 or greater than 21 years of age 2. Less than Tanner stage 4 sexual maturity for males or premenarche 3. HbA1c less than 7% or greater than 9% 4. T1DM for less than 1 year 5. Vitamin D sufficient (25OH vit D level &gt; 30 ng/mL) 6. Currently taking any medication that can interfere with vitamin D synthesis or metabolism, including but not limited to Orlistat, Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Antituberculosis drugs 7. Currently taking any medication other than insulin that alters blood glucose levels, including but not limited to systemic glucocorticoids 8. Inadequate renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dL in males and &gt; 1.2mg/dL in females) or inadequate liver function (AST and ALT &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) 9. Evidence of malabsorption or short gut.</criteria>
