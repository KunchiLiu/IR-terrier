	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the appropriate dosing regimen of fosaprepitant, when administered with ondansetron (with or without dexamethasone), for the prevention of CINV in children from birth to &lt;17 years of age. Fosaprepitant is a prodrug to aprepitant. All participants who complete the randomized Cycle 1 may elect to receive open-label fosaprepitant during optional Cycles 2-6.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Safety and Tolerability of Fosaprepitant for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in Children (MK-0517-029)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under Amendment 01, 0517-029 enrolled participants in the following age cohorts: 2-&lt;6, 6-&lt;12 and 12-17 years old. The study was randomized, partially-blinded, with parallel group assignment. Participants were randomized to one of three fosaprepitant doses or the control group. (Amendment 02 and Amendment 03 were country-specific amendments in Brazil that were required as per local regulations with no change in study design.) Under Amendment 04, the 12-17 year old cohort was closed since that cohort fully enrolled. An additional fosaprepitant dose was added and all participants were allocated to this one treatment group. Amendment 04 was open-label and enrolled participants in the following age cohorts: 0-&lt;2, 2-&lt;6 and 6-&lt;12 years old.</detailed_description>
