	<brief_title>Impact of Roux-En-Y Pouch Reconstruction Compared With Conventional Roux-En-Y Reconstruction on Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Total Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total gastrectomy has been indicated mainly for advanced gastric cancer located from the upper to middle third of the stomach or multiple gastric cancers.The most common method of creating a way for food is called a "Roux-en-Y", in which one part of the intestines is connected with the end of the esophagus (the swallowing tube) in the abdomen, and another connection is made between the intestines ' lower down. Patients with total gastrectomy suffer from poor food intake, anemia, and poor digestion because of loss of gastric reservoir or a lack of normal hormonal secretion for digestion. It often is associated with a limitation of postoperative quality of life (QOL). To improve postoperative nutritional status and QOL, surgeons have tried to establish ideal reconstruction after total gastrectomy and the optimum procedure for reconstruction has been discussed. This study will compare the postoperative quality of life (QOL) of gastric pouch reconstruction with the usual reconstruction to see if the pouch makes patients feel better.</detailed_description>
