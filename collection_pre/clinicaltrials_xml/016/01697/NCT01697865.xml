	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to compare the clinical benefit and safety of two different surgical techniques of primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for the treatment of shoulder pseudoparalysis from chronic rotator cuff disease with associated teres minor dysfunction. The first surgical technique includes a concomitant latissimus and teres major transfer (transfer group) and the second technique does not include a concomitant latissimus and teres major transfer (control group).</brief_summary>
