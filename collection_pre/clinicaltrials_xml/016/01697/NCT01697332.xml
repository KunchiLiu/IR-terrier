	<brief_summary>The overall objectives of our study are to determine the capabilities of hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI to measure lung function and its potential to sensitively detect pulmonary disease and its progression in COPD. We hypothesize that measurement of alveolar surface area, septal thickness, and capillary transit time measured with hyperpolarized 129Xe will correlate better with quality of life measures in COPD subjects than traditional diagnostic measures such as spirometry and Computed Tomography.</brief_summary>
