	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I study. This study is the first time that a new experimental drug called 18FFluoroglutamine, or F-Glutamine, is being used in people. F-Glutamine is a drug designed to be used with PET scanners that can 'see' where F-Glutamine goes in the body, after its injected. PET scanners are one of the kinds of scanners you normally find in a hospital radiology department. The researchers have found that tumors in animals absorb F-Glutamine. The researchers believe that scans with F-Glutamine might be able to find tumors in patients. This first in-human study is being done to see how long F-Glutamine lasts in the blood, when it is given to people in tiny amounts by an injection, and to see where F-Glutamine goes in the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study doctors plan to use F-Glutamine in another trial to see if scans with F-Glutamine are better for finding tumors compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study: PET Imaging of Cancer Patients Using [18F] 4-L-Fluoroglutamine (2S,4R)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients with history of histologicallyconfirmed solid malignancy and/or lymphoma (histology confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology.) Disease measurable or evaluable as defined by RECIST 1.1 or other tumor response criteria from an MSKCC IRBapproved clinical research protocol. NOTE: Study patients do not need to be participating in an MSKCC approved clinical trial prior to study recruitment. Age between 2190 Negative serum pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing age and potential (as defined by MSKCC Standards &amp; Guidelines), from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment. Patients will be advised against having unprotected sexual intercourse from the time of the negative serum pregnancy test until after completing their participation in the study. Inability or refusal to have at least one peripheral intravenous line for intravenous access (as applicable to the day of [18F] 4LFluoroglutamine (2S,4R) injection and blood draws.) Breastfeeding Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g., due to claustrophobia) Hepatic: from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment For each patient, the upper limit of normal (ULN) value for a particular assay will be defined by the normal reference values of the laboratory that performed the assay. Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x (ULN) AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN Albumin &lt; 3 g/dl GGT &gt; 2.5 x ULN IF Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN. Renal: Creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min, from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)</criteria>
