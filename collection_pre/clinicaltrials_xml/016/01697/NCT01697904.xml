	<brief_summary>Preterm infants are born with immature lungs and often require help with breathing shortly after birth. This traditionally involves administering 100% oxygen. Unfortunately, delivery of high oxygen concentrations leads to the production of free radicals that can injure many organ systems. Term and near-term newborns deprived of oxygen during or prior to birth respond as well or better to resuscitation with room air (21% oxygen) compared to 100% oxygen. However, a static concentration of 21% oxygen may be inappropriate for preterm infants with lung disease.Purpose of the study is to investigate if preterm neonates where resuscitation is initiated with 21% fiO2 and adjusted to meet transitional goal saturations (Limited oxygen strategy or LOX) would have less oxidative stress as measured by the oxidative balance ratio of biological antioxidant potential/total hydroperoxide compared to infants where resuscitation is initiated with pure oxygen and titrated for targeted saturations of 85-94% (Traditional oxygen strategy or TOX). Secondary outcomes of interest included need for other delivery room resuscitation measures, respiratory support and ventilation/oxygenation status upon neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, survival to hospital discharge, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other short-term morbidities.</brief_summary>
