	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (24-week treatment-comparison phase) with an open-label reference arm of active comparator (dienogest) followed by 28-week long-term treatment phase. The primary objective of this study is to confirm the superiority of BAY86-5300 when administered with an extended flexible regimen for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain in comparison to placebo in Japanese endometriosis patients within 24 weeks. The secondary objective is to investigate the long-term safety of BAY86-5300 in patients treated with an extended flexible regimen for one year, and the bleeding pattern of BAY86-5300 when administered with an extended flexible regimen compared to dienogest.</brief_summary>
