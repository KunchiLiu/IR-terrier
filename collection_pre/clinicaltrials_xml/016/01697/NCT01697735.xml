	<brief_summary>Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that are often prescribed for patients with high cholesterol and who are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). But there are many patients whose hyperlipemia are not well controlled. If investigators are simply doubling the statins, that only 6% of the benefit can be received. And it often has significant side effects in elder patients. Several studies have suggested that the use of berberine can effectively lower blood lipids. The chemical structure and mechanisms of drug is clearly, and the side effects are seldom, the price of berberine is very cheap. The purpose of this study is to observe the therapeutic effects of combination of statins and berberine on the patients with hyperlipemia whose level of the lipid are not well controlled when only using statins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Therapeutic Effects of Statins and Berberine on the Hyperlipemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are often prescribed statins, which are medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. By lowering cholesterol levels, these patients have a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease and so on. But there are many patients whose hyperlipemia are not well controlled.If investigators are simply doubling the statins, that only 6% of the benefit can be received.And it often bring significant side effects in elder patients. Several studies have suggested that the use of berberine can effectively lowering blood lipids.The chemical structure and mechanisms of drug is clearly, and the side effects are seldom, the price of berberine is very cheap. The purpose of this study is to observe the therapeutic effects of combination of statins and berberine on the patients with hyperlipemia whose level of the lipid are not well controlled when only using statins. This study will enroll patients who currently take cholesterol-lowering medications，but the level of lipid is not controlled well. Patients will be assigned to receive 500mg of Berberine twice a day(meanwhile they are taking 20mg of Atorvastatin daily for 8 weeks or 10mg of Rosuvastatin daily for 8 weeks). Investigators will occur at baseline and Weeks 4 and 8. Blood will be collected for laboratory testing, and standardized psychological questionnaires will assess fatigue at baseline and weeks 4 and 8. Pill count will be used to assess adherence of Berberine and statins treatment at weeks 4 and 8. At weeks 4 and 8, medication side effects will be monitored and tests of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine phosphate kinase (CPK) will be performed. At weeks 4 and 8, medication efficacy will be assessed and test of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) will be performed.</detailed_description>
