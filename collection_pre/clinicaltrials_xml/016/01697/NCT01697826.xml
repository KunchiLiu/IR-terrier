	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Topical Formulations Containing Clindamycin and Clotrimazole in Patients With Vaginal Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This is a Randomized, Comparative, Prospective, Open label, Single center study to compare the 3 day treatment course of intravaginal soft gelatin capsule containing clindamycin and clotrimazole versus intravaginal ER tablets of clindamycin and clotrimazole in patients with vaginal discharge and clinical diagnosis of bacterial, trichomonal, candidal or mixed vaginitis with respect to efficacy and tolerability; and to study the in vitro drug release pattern of intravaginal soft gelatin capsule and intravaginal ER tablets containing clindamycin and clotrimazole. - The study will be conducted in B.J. Medical College &amp; Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune. The study will be completed in 60 patients [30 patients in each group]. - The primary outcome measure is absence of any clinical sign suggestive of infective vaginitis and a vaginal swab that is negative for bacterial, trichomonal or candidal vaginitis at 8th day after start of treatment [Effectiveness in inducing a remission]. - The secondary outcome measures will be 1. absence of any clinical sign suggestive of infective vaginitis and 2. a vaginal swab that is negative for bacterial, trichomonal or candidal vaginitis at 29th day after start of treatment [Effectiveness in maintaining a remission] and ability to complete the 3day course without any break or experiencing intolerable side effects [Tolerability].</detailed_description>
