	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to verify the reliability of the solutes volumes issued by the Debiotech JewelPUMPTM controlled by its remote. Three clinical sites are participating in this study: - CHSF, Service of Endocrinology and Diabetology, CORBEIL-ESSONNES (91): Dr. Guillaume CHARPENTIER, Dr. Sylvia FRANC - Grenoble University Hospital, Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes Diseases, Nutrition, GRENOBLE (38): Pr Pierre-Yves BENHAMOU - CHU Jean Minjoz, Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, BESANCON (25): Professor Alfred PENFORNIS, Dr. Annie CLERGEOT The study will be conducted in 20 patients with type 1 diabetes treated by external insulin pump. Patients will be informed of the study during a screening visit. After signing the informed consent, they will return to the center where they will wear a JewelPUMPTM containing saline water, they will use their pumps in parallel. The investigator or nurse education will form the operation of the JewelPUMPTM and they will be instructed to replicate the same settings between their usual and JewelPUMPTM pump. The patient will be asked to complete visual analog scales of satisfaction with their usual treatment and the various elements of the devices (usual pump, and JewelPUMPTM) have been weighed using a precision balance to have a form of a base for comparison. Patients will leave home for a period of about three days, but they will have to come back every days to the center. They will be asked to collect all events arising (programming problems to deliver a bolus, hardware failure ...) in a booklet. At the end of study visit, patients will return to the center where the volumes will be assessed by the perfused weighed the various components and devices where they will complete the visual analog scales of satisfaction at endpoint.</brief_summary>
