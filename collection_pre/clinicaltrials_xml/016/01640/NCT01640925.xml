	<brief_summary>This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will compare the incidence of nosocomial infections (composite of primary bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) that occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients bathed with 2% chlorhexidine solution versus patients who receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloths).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of 2% Chlorhexidine Bathing on Nosocomial Infections in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon study enrollment, patients will be randomized to one of two study arms. Patients in study arm one will receive standard bathing (soap and water or non-medicated cloth) daily. Patients in study arm two will receive a 2% chlorhexidine bath on study day 1 and every 48 hours and a standard bath (soap and water or non-medicated cloths) on study day 2 and every 48 hours. Patients will be followed until ICU day 28 or discharged from the surgical ICU. Hypothesis: Compared to standard daily bathing, chlorhexidine-based bathing on ICU admission and every 48 hours will decrease the incidence of nosocomial infections.</detailed_description>
