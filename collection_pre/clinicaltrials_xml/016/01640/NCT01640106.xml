	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary (pilot) data regarding the feasibility of using dietary omega-3 supplementation in children with significant delays in language skills; a related secondary objective is to compare adherence to a dosage schedule of two easy-to-take formulations. A tertiary objective of this study is to collect preliminary (pilot) data pre- and post-supplementation to identify potential improvement of skills in a specific area of language development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS Hypothesis 1: Children with early developmental impairment in language will successfully take daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for a well-defined period of time (3 months); Hypothesis 2: Children with early developmental impairment will better adhere to administration of a small quantity of slightly fishy-tasting oil than to a large quantity of sweet-tasting paste; Hypothesis 3: A 3 month period of daily omega-3 supplementation will produce some improvement in fast-mapping language skills (a dynamic vocabulary learning skill that has been shown to rapidly improve after exposure to beneficial intervention).</detailed_description>
