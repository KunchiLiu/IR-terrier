	<criteria>A male or nonpregnant female (as indicated by a negative urine pregnancy test immediately on the day prior to first vaccine administration) between 20 to 60 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Women of childbearing potential agree to practice highly effective birth control throughout the study (from Screening to Month 3). Subjects are free of obvious health problems as judged by investigator (established by medical history and physical examination) before entering the study. Subject is physically and mentally capable of participating in the study and willing to adhere to study procedures to complete all elements of the study diary. Subjects provide signed informed consent after receiving a detailed explanation of the study protocol prior to any study procedures. Medical history of physicianconfirmed infection with an H5N1 virus or a history of vaccination with an H5N1 influenza vaccine. Subject is at high risk of contracting H5N1 influenza infection (e.g. poultry workers). Has received any other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks for inactivated vaccines or 4 weeks for live vaccines prior to enrollment in this study. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Subject has used oral or parenteral steroids, highdose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine. Subject has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days prior to first dose of study vaccine, or planned administration of any blood products during the study period. Subject has a known allergy to eggs or other components of the study vaccine. Subject has a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. Subject has a history of GuillainBarr√© Syndrome. Subject has an acute illness or temperature greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius by any method within 3 days prior to each vaccination. Subject has confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Subject has a rash, dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site reaction rating. Evidence of substance (alcohol or drug) abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, even if clinically stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Subjects with abnormal laboratory results at screening:(1) ALT or AST &gt; or = 1 x upper limit of normal (ULN). (2) Creatinine &gt; or = 1 x ULN. (3) Any significant laboratory abnormality as judged by the investigator Females are known pregnancy or a positive urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin test result prior to the first study vaccine dose, or are lactating or nursing. Subject has any other condition that disqualifies his/her participation in the study in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
