	<brief_summary>Maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is crucial during lifespan to retain health and functional autonomy. Sarcopenia, being the loss of muscle mass during aging, is a well-known phenomenon in the elderly and a major challenge viewed from an individual, and a socioeconomic point of view. Nevertheless, several studies have proved muscle tissue to be markedly affected by physical activity and nutritional interventions even at old age. Recently, a study in young individuals showed that an acute bout of easily tolerated low intensity exercise can prolong the muscle building effects of a milk protein intake compared to a non-exercised situation. Therefore, the major aim of the present project is to evaluate, whether a low intensity exercise regime in conjunction with milk protein supplementation can induce positive adaptations on parameters related to muscle size and function in elderly. The study focuses on the acute muscle protein synthesis response to low intensity exercise and protein supplementation measured with stable isotope tracer techniques. It is hypothesized that light muscle activity can augment and prolong the effects of protein feeding. If a light resistance exercise protocol as investigated in the present project can prove beneficial, elderly, frail elderly, and individuals undergoing rehabilitation can challenge sarcopenia in a new and tolerable way.</brief_summary>
