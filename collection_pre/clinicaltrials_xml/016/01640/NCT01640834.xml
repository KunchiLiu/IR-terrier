	<brief_summary>This study involves taking a single dose of 100 mg or 300 mg LY2409021 or placebo (an inactive medicine) taken as up to 3 capsules by mouth. The study will evaluate if this drug will reduce the amount of insulin a type 1 diabetic needs over 24 hours. This study includes a 7 day hospitalization period at the clinical research unit (CRU) and will involve screening within 30 days of the start of the study as well as telephone consultations within 5 days after discharge from the CRU.</brief_summary>
