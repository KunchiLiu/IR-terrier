	<brief_title>Insoles Effect on Pain and Daily Activities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain in weight-bearing joints limits individual's function and ability to perform daily activities, causes a negative effect on productivity and increased costs for social insurance. This pain is often the outcome of structural deformities or work-related foot pain often occurs in workers whose occupations include standing or walking for a long time. One of the most common reasons for prescribing insoles is to enhance functioning by reducing nonspecific pain in the foot, leg or low back pain. Reduction of pain is expected to improve quality of life in daily activities such as work and recreational activities. Persons actual use of the insoles, is a prerequisite for any effect it may have. It can be hypothesized that the use of the insoles is related to what the user thinks about their comfort, appearance, the amount of foot perspiration they induce, and other factors.</detailed_description>
