	<brief_title>Imaging Study of Allocation of Pacing Targets in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac Dyssynchrony and scar are important variables for realization of clinical response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Results from a previous study suggest that paced heart segment characteristics do predict this response and our ability to identify venous pathways to optimal segments is feasible using cardiac CT and MRI. In an ongoing feasibility study we are using these capabilities to guide the delivery of CRT lead systems to optimal myocardial targets. A computer software program has been developed that can create an interactive, 3D integrated cardiac model of coronary vein anatomy, myocardial scar and mechanical dyssynchrony. Although this feasibility study is ongoing, early results show this method of guiding the CRT leads to optimal targets with these individualized models to be safe and effective. This trial will be a larger multi-centre randomized blinded trial to determine the therapeutic impact of MRI guided Left Ventricular and Right Ventricular lead placement with respect to improving clinical response rates for CRT.</detailed_description>
