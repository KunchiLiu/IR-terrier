	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the effect of serelaxin (RLX030) infusion on the hepatic and renal circulation in patients with compensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Measurements were acquired non-invasively using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (study part A) and more directly via cannulation of the hepatic portal vein during a routine transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) check procedure (study part B), to determine the acute haemodynamic response to serelaxin (RLX030).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study Parts A and B: Cirrhosis of alcohol aetiology according to physician's assessment prior to screening. Part A: Cirrhosis with clinical and/or endoscopic evidence of portal hypertension (e.g. oesophageal varices). Part B: Cirrhosis with TIPSS in situ and PPG&gt;5mmHg. Fully functioning TIPSS without variceal filling as confirmed by portography. Study Parts A and B: Use of any drug to treat portal hypertension (e.g. vasodilators such as nonselective beta blockers or nitrates) within 1 month prior to screening. Decompensated cirrhosis (ChildPugh score &gt;9 points, and/or ascites requiring diuretics, and/or hepatic encephalopathy) at visit 1. Presence of any noncontrolled and clinically significant disease that could affect the study outcome or that would place the patient at undue risk. Part A: BMI (weight[kg] / height[m^2]) &gt; 40 kg/m^2. Any contraindication to having an MRI scan Part B: Contraindication to catheterization</criteria>
