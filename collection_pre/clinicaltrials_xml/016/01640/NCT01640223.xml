	<brief_summary>The aim this study is the acquisition and management of a data base for the development of the glycaemic regulation algorithms. This database will integrate the measures of blood glucose and the glycaemia level of the Dexcom sensor on a regular time, the injections of insulin delivered by Debiotech JewelPUMP and the level of insulin in the blood. This database will also contain the bolus of insulin injected at meals and the content of meals, the reduction insulin level during physical activity and the quantification of this physical activity. A study will also be conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of a bolus of insulin identical with the JewelPUMP either the usual pump of the patient.</brief_summary>
