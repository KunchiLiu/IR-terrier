	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of laboratory-treated T cells and to see how well they work in treating patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed), previously treated with donor stem cell transplant. Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into a person's T cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laboratory-Treated T Cells in Treating Patients With High-Risk Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Previously Treated With Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with high risk or relapsed AML, MDS, and CML after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) by adoptive transfer of virus-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8 T cells genetically-modified to express a high affinity Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)-specific T cell receptor (TCR). II. Determine the anti-leukemic activity associated with treating patients with relapsed AML, MDS and CML after allogeneic HCT by adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8 T cells genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific T cell receptor (TCR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and ability to migrate to and accumulate in bone marrow. II. Determine the maintenance of TCR expression and function of transduced T cells. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients with no evidence of leukemia or MDS post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cells intravenously (IV) over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30 kg) on days 0 and 14 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 14-28. ARM II: Patients with evidence of leukemia (AML or CML) or MDS (minimal residual disease or overt relapse) post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cells IV over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30 kg) on days 0 and 14 and aldesleukin SC BID on days 14-28. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at weeks 6 and 8, at 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually for up to 15 years.</detailed_description>
