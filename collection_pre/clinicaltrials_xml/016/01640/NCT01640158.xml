	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of plasticity-based, adaptive cognitive remediation on the cognitive abilities, functional status and quality of life of soldiers and veterans diagnosed with persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also referred to as a concussion, or blast exposure), as compared to a computer-based control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Broad-spectrum Cognitive Remediation: Effects of a Brain Plasticity-based Program in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-site, prospective, parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of plasticity-based, adaptive, computerized cognitive remediation treatment versus a computer-based control. Both the study and the cognitive remediation treatments meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must be 18 50 years of age at the time of consent 2. Subjects must have a diagnosis of mTBI 3. Subjects must have persistent cognitive dysfunction confirmed by an objective measure (as recommended by the ICD10 definition for postconcussion syndrome) or a subjective measure (as recommended by the DSVIV definition of postconcussional disorder). 4. Subjects must be at least three months out from their most recent TBI, concussion, and/or blast exposure to minimize the effects of spontaneous recovery, as verified through participant interview. 5. Subjects must be fluent English speakers. 6. Subjects must have adequate sensorimotor capacity to perform the program in the judgment of the consenting clinician. 1. Subjects must not have a history of penetrating head wounds or a diagnosis of moderate or severe TBI. 2. Subjects must not be inpatients. 3. Subjects must not have a diagnosis of an illness or condition with known cognitive consequences (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, cancer, multiple sclerosis). 4. Subjects must not show suicidal ideation as measured by the ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). 5. Subjects must now show signs of intoxication due to current substance abuse (including alcohol and/or illegal drugs) during any in person visit. 6. Subjects must not have clinically significant visual field deficits noted by the consenting staff member by direct observation or by medical history. 7. Subjects must not be judged to be lacking effort. 8. Subjects must not have problems performing assessments or comprehending or following spoken instructions. 9. Subjects must not be enrolled in a concurrent clinical trial involving an investigational pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, medical device, or behavioral treatment for TBI that could affect the outcome of this study.</criteria>
