	<brief_title>The Effect of Eating Frequency on Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migration studies, observational epidemiology and clinical trial data indicate that causes of adverse BP levels are mainly environmental , including lifestyle under which dietary factors play a role. Therefore, lifestyle modification is part of the current American Heart Association recommendations for prevention and control of adverse BP levels. Although the effects of nutrients and foods on BP have been studied extensively, other dietetic factors such as eating frequency and number of meals in a day have been less thoroughly investigated and warrant further research to explore their possible positive effect on BP.</detailed_description>
