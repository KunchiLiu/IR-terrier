	<brief_summary>Previous work in animal models suggests that inhalational anesthetic agents may accelerate Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, but it is unclear to what extent this may happen in humans. Here, the investigators propose to measure Alzheimer's disease-related neural markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients exposed to anesthesia while undergoing neurosurgical procedures that require lumbar drain placement. Patients will be randomized to either receive inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane or intravenous anesthesia with propofol. CSF and blood samples will each be collected at the induction of anesthesia, and then again ten and twenty-four hours later. CSF samples will be assayed for amyloid beta, tau, and other Alzheimer's disease-associated markers; blood samples will be assayed for serum inflammatory markers and used for genotyping studies. These studies should clarify the effect of common anesthetic agents on Alzheimer's disease related neural markers.</brief_summary>
