	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown that inflammation and matrix degradation have pathogenic effects on the myocardium by influencing heart contractility, inducing hypertrophy, degrading the matrix, or enhancing fibrosis, thus contributing to the continuous myocardial remodeling process. The sedative and antinausea drug thalidomide has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory and antioncogenic properties that could be of benefit in case of congestive heart failure (CHF). Previous, small investigations have shown an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and a favorable cardiac remodeling during thalidomide therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Several studies have shown that inflammation and matrix degradation have pathogenic effects on the myocardium by influencing heart contractility, inducing hypertrophy, degrading the matrix, or enhancing fibrosis, thus contributing to the continuous myocardial remodeling process. The sedative and antinausea drug thalidomide has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory and antioncogenic properties that could be of benefit in case of congestive heart failure (CHF). Previous, small investigations have shown an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and a favorable cardiac remodeling during thalidomide therapy. Purpose The primary objective of this study is to carry out a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of oral thalidomide on left ventricular morphology and function in patients with CHF</detailed_description>
