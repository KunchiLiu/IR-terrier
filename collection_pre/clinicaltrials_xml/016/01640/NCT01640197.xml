	<brief_summary>The effects of chronic resveratrol supplementation have yet to be investigated in healthy humans. It is hypothesised that the effects will be different to those seen in acute supplementation. This study will look specifically at cognitive performance, cerebral blood flow, subjective sleep, mood and health, blood pressure and plasma levels of resveratrol. It is hypothesized that these measures will be affected differently by acute and chronic supplementation.</brief_summary>
