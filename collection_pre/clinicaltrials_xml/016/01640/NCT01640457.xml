	<brief_summary>NOVOCART® Disc plus is being investigated to explore its clinical applicability, safety and efficacy in the repair of a herniated disc with an indication for an elective sequestrectomy, and of the adjacent degenerated disc, if present. The objective of this clinical study is to provide basis for a confirmatory study design (endpoints, methodologies) (Phase II), and to develop a safety profile (Phase I). This study further aims at developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical efficacy of the product as requested in the context of identity, purity and potency characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy With NOVOCART® Disc Plus (ADCT) for the Treatment of Degenerative Disc Disease in Lumbar Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a classical Phase II study with an implicated Phase I part. The Phase I/II combination study is a non-confirmatory study aimed at gathering preliminary clinical information on NOVOCART® Disc plus used in a new indication in the repair of a herniated disc. It will be conducted in a prospective, multicenter, unmasked, clinical trial including 120 subjects randomized to NOVOCART® Disc plus (NDplus, 60 subjects), media NOVOCART® Disc basic with no active cell component (NDbasic, 36 subjects) and to standard of care (SC) sequestrectomy as control (24 subjects). 24 patients will be enrolled in Phase I of the study (12 NDplus, 12 NDbasic) and 96 patients in Phase II (48 NDplus, 24 NDbasic, 24 SC). All subjects will be evaluated at 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-months post-t0 examination in the SC study arm and 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-months post-t5 examination in the NDplus and NDbasic study arms, and then 5 years post-t0/t5 to collect long-term clinical data. Efficacy measurements for functional improvement will be evaluated among NDplus, NDbasic and SC. Physiological effects observed from MRI measurements will be compared between appropriate treatments depending on expected treatment mechanisms. Safety data of NDplus will be combined with NDbasic to contrast against SC on procedure related risks and NDplus against NDbasic and SC together on graft-related adverse experiences. To optimize the usefulness of clinical information, data collected in the study may be analyzed and reviewed continuously. Early findings may be used to modify the study design when deemed appropriate and acceptable by the Sponsor's medical advisors. Data-driven adaptive actions include but are not limited to stopping enrollment early. The Sponsor will inform regulatory bodies, Ethic Committees, and investigators before implementing study design modifications. Cells and tissues collected from this study will be used in other in vitro-controlled experiments aimed at developing and validating known and novel biologic markers to quantify cell quality in the context of identity, purity and potency. Prognostic values of these biologic markers will be examined by correlating them with clinical data collected in this study. The study will follow each subject for a total of five years post-t0 examination in the SC study arm and post-t5 examination in the NDplus and NDbasic study arms to obtain long-term performance data. Patients must have a single-level acute disc herniation with an indication for an elective sequestrectomy. They may further have corresponding disc degeneration in the proximal adjacent segment (Pfirrmann Score Stage 3-4). A total of 120 adults will be enrolled in this study. Each patient will remain in the study for 5 years post t0/t5 examination to complete the planned follow-up phase. It is expected to take 6 years and five months to collect all required data for this study.</detailed_description>
