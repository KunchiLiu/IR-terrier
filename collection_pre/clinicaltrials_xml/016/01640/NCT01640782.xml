	<brief_title>Intergroup Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open label, randomised, multicenter, superiority study for efficacy. Patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction without gross or microscopic evidence of residual disease after surgery with curative intent and fulfilling all the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible for this study. Allocation to treatment will be done centrally using a randomisation scheme and will be stratified by center and nodal involvement (N- vs. N+). Access to random system will be allowed by phone or via web. All included patients in both groups will received fixed period of 18 weeks of treatment unless unacceptable toxicity or disease relapse during treatment. After cessation of therapy, patients will have a follow-up period while not receiving further treatment. After relapse further chemotherapy is left to the investigator's judgement. When the last patient is randomised, follow-up will be truncated at the achievement of the required number of events. Time to progression and time to death are the main study outcomes. During the course of the trial, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will advise the Steering Committee on efficacy and/or safety aspects of the study.</detailed_description>
