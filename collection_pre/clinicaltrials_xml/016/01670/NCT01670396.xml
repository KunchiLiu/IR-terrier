	<brief_title>Genetics Study of In-stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although drug-eluting stents (DES) have reduced restenosis rates compared with bare-metal stents, the restenosis rate is still high in the high-risk group. G protein plays important roles in the signal transduction leading to vascular smooth muscle proliferation. The initial and subsequent studies suggest that the T allele of C825T polymorphism is associated with enhanced transmembrane signaling via Gi proteins.</detailed_description>
