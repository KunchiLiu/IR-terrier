	<brief_title>Trial of GemOx±R Regimen in First-line Treatment of Elderly Aggressive B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin(GemOx) shows effective activity in patients with relapsed diffuse large-cell lymphoma and other solid tumors. Until now there is no clinical trial to evaluate its role in patients with elderly aggressive B cell lymphoma. The investigators therefore developed a two-weekly regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen to treat elderly aggressive B cell lymphoma and investigate its safety and efficacy. Primary Outcome Measures: - overall response rate Secondary Outcome Measures: - progression free survival - overall survival - safety and toxicity Enrollment: 100 Study Start Date: January 2012 Primary Completion Date: Dec 2012</detailed_description>
