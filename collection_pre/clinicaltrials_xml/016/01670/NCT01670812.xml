	<brief_title>Trial of FFP+HDMP+Rituximab for Ultra-high Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia remains incurable and particularly in ultra-high risk subgroup, and the prognosis of these patients is still dismal. This is a phase III, multicenter perspective clinical trial of combination of fresh frozen plasma(FFP), high dose methylprednisolone(HDMP) and rituximab for ultra-high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemiaThe. The main purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of this combinated regimen in subgroup of CLL patients. All the enrolled patients will be followed during and after the treatment period up to one year. Interim and final evaluation will be done after each cycle of treatment.</detailed_description>
