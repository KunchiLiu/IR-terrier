	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 planned doses of ONO-9054 in the eyes of adult male and female patients with ocular hypertension (OHT) or mild open angle-glaucoma (OAG). The secondary objectives are to evaluate Pharmacodynamics (PD) and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ONO-9054 and its metabolite in plasma and to compare its tolerability following morning and evening dosing.</brief_summary>
