	<brief_summary>This is a 6-week comparison of asenapine versus placebo as an add-on to ongoing antidepressant treatment in patients with major depression who have not had a complete therapeutic response to treatment with the antidepressant alone. The investigators hypothesize that added asenapine will produce greater reductions in depression than will added placebo.</brief_summary>
