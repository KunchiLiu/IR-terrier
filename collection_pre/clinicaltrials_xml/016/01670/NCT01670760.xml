	<brief_summary>The core temperature of the body normally decreases in response to anesthesia. Deep tissue temperature can be used to estimate of body core temperature. Deep tissue temperature of the forehead will be measured using a new technology known as zero-heat-flux thermometry. The usual way to measure internal body temperature is within the nasal cavity (nasopharyngeal temperature). Nasopharyngeal and deep tissue temperatures will be measured simultaneously during surgery and compared for agreement. The hypothesis of this trial is that deep tissue temperature as measured by zero-heat-flux thermometry will agree with nasopharyngeal temperatures during surgery.</brief_summary>
