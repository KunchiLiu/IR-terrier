	<brief_summary>Prevention in School (PS) is a modified School-Wide Positive Behavior Support Program at the universal prevention level, developed by Swedish researchers for the school years 4 -9. By defining and teaching school rules to all teachers and students, and by consistently acknowledging students when meeting behavioural expectations, the program aims to reduce problem behaviours in school areas and to improve the classroom learning climate. Against this background, the purpose of this study is to examine whether PS is more effective than schools' ordinary practices in meeting these goals.</brief_summary>
