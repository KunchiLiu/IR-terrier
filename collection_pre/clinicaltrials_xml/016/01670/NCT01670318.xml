	<brief_summary>Randomized trials have demonstrated an excellent safety and efficacy profile for the chromium everolimus-eluting stent. The platinum chromium everolimus-eluting sten (PtCr-EES) uses the identical antiproliferative agent and polymer but with a novel platinum chromium scaffold designed for enhanced deliverability, vessel conformability, side-branch access, radiopacity, radial strength, and fracture resistance. However, the efficacy of the PtCr-EES for complex coronary artery diseases subsets such as chronic total occlusion, bifurcation lesion, left main trunk disease, and small vessel diseases is still unknown.</brief_summary>
