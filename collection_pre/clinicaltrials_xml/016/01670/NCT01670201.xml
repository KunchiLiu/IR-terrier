	<brief_summary>The investigator will identify the test donor site and test location will be considered on the upper anterior thighs as being the most suitable if available. Circumferential donors will be considered acceptable as well. Treatment will be initiated in the operation room following debridement and split thickness grafting of wounds. Donors will be harvested at 0.010 - 0.012 in. thickness. Treatment and dressing of test donor site will include hemostasis post harvesting with epinephrine-soaked lap sponges. Once adequate hemostasis is achieved, a Mepilex Transfer Ag dressing will be applied directly to study site. Secondary dressing will include covering with ace wrap. Healing should be asses after 10-14 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation to Evaluate a New Donor Site Dressing in Surgical Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, open, non-controlled clinical investigation to evaluate the adequacy of donor site healing when using a new donor site dressing, Mepilex Transfer Ag approximately 20 subjects from 2 centres in the US, presenting with the need for surgical intervention and grafting for burn injury will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will have a selected donor site designated as a "study site".</detailed_description>

A subject who has had a malignant disease in the past, was treated with the expectation of a cure and is currently diseasefree, may be considered for study entry. 4. Use of penicillamine, corticosteroid or immunosuppressive medication within 2 months prior to enrollment, or current use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents which cannot be discontinued, or who is likely to be prescribed these medications or any other medications known to adversely affect wound healing during study participation. 5. Major uncontrolled systemic disorders such as hepatic, renal, neurologic, or endocrinologic disorders. 6. Requires immersion hydrotherapy at any time during study participation (note, showering hydrotherapy is allowed). 7. Subject unwilling to comply with 28 day followup. 8.
