	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-cancer effect of a pain medication called ketorolac (Toradol) on ovarian cancer cells in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity after surgery for ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Availability &amp; Effect of Post-OP Ketorolac on Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the seventh most common cause of cancer deaths in women across the globe. The majority of women, nearly 70%, will present with advanced stage disease that heralds a poor prognosis. Despite aggressive treatment that still favors initial debulking surgery followed by a platinum and taxane based chemotherapy regimen, most patients relapse after achieving a complete clinical response. Our group has shown that the ketorolac can inhibit gene activity which inhibits cell proliferation and migration.Ketorolac will be used in this study with the goal of producing specific inhibition of cell adhesion and migration in ovarian cancer cells retrieved within the peritoneal cavity after cytoreductive surgery.</detailed_description>
