	<brief_title>Vapocoolant (Pain Ease Medium Stream) for Intravenous Lines in Emergency Department Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vapocoolant sprays have been used to decrease the pain associated with painful medical procedures such as immunizations, needle aspirations, injections, venipuncture and intravenous cannulation. In general, vapocoolant sprays , have been found to be effective in decreasing the pain of various medical procedures. Moreover, the use of vapocoolant sprays ,unlike other local anesthetics , such as infiltrative lidocaine , is not associated with a painful injection and does affect the success rate of the procedure including intravenous cannulation and may even increase the success rate of the intravenous cannulation.</detailed_description>
