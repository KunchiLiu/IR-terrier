	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is characterize the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and steady-state plasma levels after once-daily oral dosing of prucalopride (R108512) as a solution, 0.01 mg/kg to 0.03 mg/kg, given to paediatric subjects with functional faecal retention (FFR) for 8 weeks. Hypothesis: Pharmacokinetic profile of prucalopride in paediatric subjects is expected to resemble the adult pharmacokinetic profile. Safety and tolerability profile are expected to resemble the adult profile.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prucalopride in Paediatric Subjects, With Functional Faecal Retention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open-label trial in which paediatric subjects (ages 4 to 12 years) with FFR were administered prucalopride in oral solution once daily for 8 weeks. Subjects who entered this extension trial had completed PRU-USA-12, a single-dose pharmacokinetic trial, usually within the previous week. Evaluations for efficacy, safety and tolerability were performed, and plasma samples for analysis of prucalopride levels were obtained at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. The initial dosage of prucalopride oral solution was 0.02 mg/kg/day. Dependent on the subject's response, the parent could adjust the dosage within a range of 0.01 mg/kg/day to 0.03 mg/kg/day.</detailed_description>
