	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the physiological, pathophysiological and potentially therapeutic implications of bile-induced glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in human glucose homeostasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Bile Acids on GLP-1 Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that even modest increments in endogenous GLP-1 secretion will elicit important antidiabetic effects of GLP-1. To evaluate whether bile acids have such effects, the investigators plan to perform intraduodenal infusion of two different bile acids and placebo.</detailed_description>
