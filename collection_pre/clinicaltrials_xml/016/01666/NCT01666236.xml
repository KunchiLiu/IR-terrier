	<brief_summary>Study the effectiveness of the treatment detachment of retinal pigment epithelium secondary to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Efficacy will be assessed by regression of polyp area after twelve months, compared to baseline. Treatment under study is a triple therapy with: 1) reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy (PDT), 2) intravitreal (IVT) triamcinolone and, 3) IVT ranibizumab, for the treatment of detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium (PED) secondary to Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with PCV associated with PED near the polypoidal lesion recently diagnosed, documented by FA, ICGA and OCT. Visual acuity between 20/40 and 20/400. Patients older than 50 years (both genders). Women must be postmenopausal for at least 12 months or surgically sterile. No previous treatment in the study eye. Accept and sign the informed consent. No condition that prevents the monitoring of the patient for one year. Transparent ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to allow good images of the fundus. Blepharitis or external eye infection. Allergy to ranibizumab, verteporfin, triamcinolone, fluorescein or indocyanine green. Patients unable to provide informed consent. Concomitant ocular disease that impairs visual acuity. Any intraocular condition (such as cataract or Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy) in the study eye, in the opinion of the investigator, could require surgery or medication during the followup (1 year). Active intraocular inflammation. Patients with Glaucoma and with ocular hypertension (IOP &gt; 25mmHg). Premenopausal women. Pregnancy or lactation. Effective treatment for active systemic infection or history of recurrent infection. Evidence of concomitant disease (cardiovascular, neurological, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine or gastrointestinal) uncontrolled.</criteria>
