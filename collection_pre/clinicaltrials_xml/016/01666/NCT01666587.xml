	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are two-fold. The first purpose is to determine the effect of taking vitamins on the recovery of an artery (blood vessel) following an induced temporary injury. The second purpose is to determine whether a specific vasodilator is less abundant after the injury and whether this contributes to increased constriction or after the injury. Finally, does vitamin consumption have an effect on the recovery from the injury if one of the substances in the blood that causes vessels to enlarge (dilate) is stopped?</brief_summary>
