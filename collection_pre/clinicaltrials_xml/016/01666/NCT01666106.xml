	<brief_title>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) Case Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the ONJ case registry is to describe the natural history of positively-adjudicated ONJ in subjects with cancer with an observation period of 5 years. Most of these subjects are expected to have received bone antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates or denosumab together with cancer-specific therapies (eg, chemotherapy, steroids, or anti-angiogenics). It is also possible that the registry will include subjects with cancer who developed ONJ without exposure to any antiresorptive therapy.</detailed_description>
