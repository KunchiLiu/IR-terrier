	<brief_summary>Rossoseq™ is registered for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions. Rosacea is one such inflammatory skin disorder that has not been studied yet for the use of Rossoseq™. Whilst rosacea is showing features of an inflammatory skin disorder [1], particularly stage 1 is poorly understood and treatment options are limited and therefore this study - within the target indication - will contribute to the learning about rosacea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Topical Rossoseq™ Compared to Vehicle in Rosacea Subtype 1 (Erythematotelangiectatic)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male or female subjects ≥18 and &lt; 85 years with a clinically diagnosed rosacea subtype 1 (erythematotelangiectatic) defined by a score of 6-15 for the primary and secondary features of the rosacea standard grading system (RSGS; Wilkin et al, 2004) will be enrolled. The study will consist of a Screening visit, Baseline visit (Week 0), a telephone call at Week 1, visits at Week 2 and 4, and a follow-up telephone call at Week 5. Eligible subjects may or may not be using medication for their rosacea at the time of screening. Subjects with concomitant use of rosacea treatments will be taken off their current medication and will return for a Baseline Visit at the end of the wash-out period. Eligible subjects will be stratified by gender at a ratio of 4:1 (Female: Male). Within the strata, subjects will be randomised at Baseline in a 2:1 ratio in favour of Rossoseq™ to receive either Rossoseq™ or vehicle. Efficacy will be evaluated using subject rating of the rosacea specific quality of life instrument (R-QOL; Nicholson et al, 2007) during office visits and applied over the phone during the week 1 and follow-up telephone call at Week 5. An investigator rating will be performed using a "0=absent" to "3=severe" grading of the RSGS primary features flushing, nontransient erythema, papules and pustules, telangiectasia and the secondary features burning or stinging, plaques, dry appearance, edema, ocular manifestations and phymatous changes during the office visits. Ocular manifestations and phymatous changes need to be absent to be eligible for the study. Photographs to document treatment effects will be taken at screening, baseline, week 2 and week 4.</detailed_description>
