	<brief_summary>To investigate pathomorphological and functional variations of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a Chinese population using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to find which kinds of Fundus characteristics indicated exudative AMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Population-based Study of Macular Choroidal Neovascularization in a Chinese Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This population-based study enrolled 59 patients (&gt;45 years old; 70 eyes) with early and intermediate-stage AMD from Youyi Street, Baoshan District, Shanghai, China. Comprehensive standardized ophthalmic examinations included visual acuity, anterior segment analysis by slit lamp, dilated fundus evaluation by direct ophthalmoscopy, 90D handheld lens, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FFA), and fast optic disk scans using OCT. The macular CNV characteristic profiles in early and intermediate-stage AMD were determined by OCT. Data were obtained at first visit and 6 to 24 months follow-up, and FFA and OCT outcomes of early and intermediate-stage AMD patients were analyzed.</detailed_description>
