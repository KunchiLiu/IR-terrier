The intervention group will receive a contraceptive implant postpartum, prior to discharge from the hospital. The control group will receive a contraceptive implant at the usual 6 week postpartum clinic visit. During prenatal care, participants will be consented and screened for enrollment. After delivery, these women will be assessed and consented for enrollment into the study. Women who consent for enrollment will be randomized. Women will be followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year after contraceptive implant insertion.
