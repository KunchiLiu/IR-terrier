	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to test the treatment of onychomycosis using a 0.65 millisecond pulsed 1064 nm laser fitted with a special onychomycosis handpiece. The investigators will compare the success rates of those receiving laser treatments with untreated patients. This study will provide a clinical basis for determining the relative effectiveness of an increasingly utilized treatment method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Onychomycosis Using a 0.65 Millisecond Pulsed Nd:YAG 1064 nm Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current antifungal treatments have low cure rates and numerous side effects. A new treatment method, pulsed laser, has been purported to have high rates of treatment in a much shorter time frame than other treatments. While the treatment method has become increasingly popular, studies of its efficacy are few. The investigators hope to learn the cure rate of a novel treatment that is being used by more and more patients. This knowledge will be essential to physicians as they consider employing this new technology in their treatment methods.</detailed_description>
