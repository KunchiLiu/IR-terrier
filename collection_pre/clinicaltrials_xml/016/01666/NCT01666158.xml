	<brief_summary>Consenting patients scheduled for esophageal resection surgery will be randomized to receive standard nutrition counseling (including nutritional supplements as needed) or standard nutrition counseling and exercise 4 weeks before surgery and 8 weeks after surgery. It is hypothesized that, compared with the group receiving nutrition alone, the addition of physical exercise to nutrition starting before surgery and continuing for 8 weeks after surgery will have a significantly greater impact on functional walking capacity during the prehabilitation period and during the postoperative period, and on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prehabilitation for Esophageal Resection Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled study in patients undergoing esophageal resection for cancer to determine the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on functional exercise capacity and postoperative pulmonary complications. Patients who accept to be enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either a standard nutritional intervention (including supplements as needed) as per current institution policy or standard nutritional intervention (including supplements as needed) combined with a physical exercise program before and after surgery. Specific aims The aims of this research project are the following: 1. To determine the extent in which a multimodal prehabilitation regimen optimizes functional recovery in patients suffering from esophageal cancer and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. 2. To understand further which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to prehabilitation interventions, and predict change in later outcome measures.</detailed_description>
