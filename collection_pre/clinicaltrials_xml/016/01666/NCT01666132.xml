	<brief_summary>Intramyocardial, NOGA guided injection of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and LVEF &lt; 40%. The primary objective is to determine whether the administration of the cells improves recovery of the left ventricular function. Secondary objective is the finding of clinical or paraclinical parameters to predict potential benefits of the treatment (basing on MRI characteristics such as size, transmurality of the myocardial infarction and peri-lesional ischemia). In the first part of the study 10 patients are treated without control group. This phase serves as feasibility and safety part of the study.</brief_summary>
