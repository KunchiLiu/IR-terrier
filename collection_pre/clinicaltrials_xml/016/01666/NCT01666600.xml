	<brief_summary>Patients with glioblastoma at first or second progression who have failed standard treatment that must have included radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and who are a candidate for a reirradiation can be included into the trial. In the phase I part the minimal tolerated dose (MTD)of BIBF 1120 in combination with radiotherapy will be investigated. Subjects in phase II will be randomised to receive reirradiation alone or reirradiation + 2 x MTD BIBF1120.</brief_summary>
