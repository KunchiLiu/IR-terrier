	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor, with approximately 200,000 new cases diagnosed per year. Several different local therapies are available for treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy Significant advances have been made in the technical aspects of surgery and of radiotherapy which have improved both the cancer control outcomes as well as the morbidity of treatment. Despite these significant advances, approximately 30% of patients treated with definitive local therapy experience recurrent disease. Recurrent disease after prostatectomy usually manifests with rising PSA (blood test for prostate cancer). The PSA level is often of limited use in differentiating local recurrence (ie. recurrence in the prostate bed) from recurrence outside of the prostate bed ( extra-prostatic recurrence). One PET radiotracer which has shown promise in the staging and restaging of patients with prostate carcinoma is anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3-[18F]FACBC) which is a synthetic amino acid analog. FACBC demonstrated higher accuracy compared with 111Indium-capromab-pendetide in the restaging of patients with suspected recurrent prostate carcinoma. The major goal in this proposed investigation is to use advanced molecular imaging to better guide post-prostatectomy decision making, in terms of guiding the decision to deliver radiotherapy, and in terms of the exact areas treated with radiotherapy. Investigators will perform a study with 162 patients in whom there is a strong suspicion of prostate cancer that has returned to the body after having a prostatectomy. Half of these patients will have radiotherapy decision-making and delivery per the usual routine, and half of these patients will have the radiotherapy decision and volumes guided by the FACBC test. The major goal of the investigation is to see whether the FACBC improves the selection and the cancer control rates of post-surgery patients with a rising PSA who undergo radiotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, post radicalprostatectomy Detectable PSA ECOG/Zubrod Performance Status of 02 Negative technetium 99m MDP or F18 PET bone scan for skeletal metastasis CT or MR scan of abdomen and pelvis which does not suggest presence of metastatic disease outside of the pelvis Willingness to undergo pelvic radiotherapy. Contraindications to radiotherapy (including active inflammatory bowel disease or prior pelvic XRT) Inability to undergo anti3[18F]FACBC PETCT Age under 18 Metastatic disease outside of pelvis on any imaging or biopsy Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years Severe acute comorbidity, defined as follows: Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization in the last 3 months Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocolspecific requirements may also exclude immunocompromised patients</criteria>
