	<brief_title>Autoantibody Specificity and Response to IVIG in ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune bleeding disorder, in which platelet surface GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX are the two most frequently targeted autoantigens. Our previous studies in animal models of ITP demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) could protect against anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated thrombocytopenia but failed to ameliorate ITP induced by most anti-GPIb/IX antibodies. The objective of this human study was to evaluate the association between the specificity of anti-platelet autoantibodies and response to IVIG treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(1) the diagnosis of ITP was based on the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia and the absence of any obvious initiating and/or underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia in accordance with the recently released international consensus guidelines,(2) a diagnosis was established during the 4 weeks prior to initiation of IVIG treatment, (3) age ≥ 18 years, (4) a platelet count of ≤ 20 × 109/L, and (5) a bleeding score ≥ 9 at the time of admission according to the clinical scoring system described by Khellaf et al. to assess the severity of hemorrhage. a history of any ITPspecific treatment administered prior to or concomitantly with the IVIG</criteria>
