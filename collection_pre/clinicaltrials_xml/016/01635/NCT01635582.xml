	<brief_title>Home Based Computer Gaming Hand Exercise Regimen for People With Arthritis Affecting the Hands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel computer gaming hand exercise regimen has been designed for people with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Osteo arthritis (OA) affecting the hands. The design allows a broad range of common objects of daily life to be seamlessly transformed into 'therapeutic' input devices by instrumenting with a small motion sense mouse. Based on individual abilities and treatment needs, objects are selected to train specific fine/ gross dexterous functions. The object manipulations (therapeutic exercises) are then used to control and play any commercially available computer game, making practice challenging and engaging. The study is of six weeks duration comparing the computer gaming and conventional hand exercises in thirty people diagnosed with RA or OA affecting the hands. The investigators hypothesize that the game based exercises will improve hand function and reduce pain/stiffness and be feasible compared to the conventional hand exercises.A mixed-effect repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to test pre to post treatment outcomes. This will be the first study to evaluate the therapeutic effects and feasibility of the computer gaming hand exercise regimen in people with RA or OA.</detailed_description>
