	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Canakinumab to Treat Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center prospective placebo-controlled cross-over phase II study. - To assess if canakinumab can induce clinical improvement and/or complete clinical remission of chronic idiopathic urticaria at week 4 as compared to placebo - To compare canakinumab and placebo treated patients in the percentage who achieve complete clinical remission at week 1, 2, 4, and 8. - To compare the percentage with clinical improvement as measured by UAS7 score at week 1, 2, 4, and 8 in canakinumab and placebo treated patients - To compare the percentage of canakinumab and placebo treated patients with 75% and 100% improvement of their baseline (Run-in-period) UAS7 score at week 1,2,4,and 8 - To compare the daily wheal score for Days 1 to 7 in canakinumab and placebo treated patients</detailed_description>
