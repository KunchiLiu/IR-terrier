	<brief_summary>This research project examines the effectiveness of different video laryngoscopes in a out-of-hospital emergency intubation. Since in preclinical airway management severe incidents with esophageal failures of intubation may partly happen or rather endotracheal Intubation may completely fail, it is of great importance to evaluate alternative ways of endotracheal intubation in out-of-hospital emergency medicine. Video laryngoscopy has been proven in everyday clinical practice and may clinically be superior in most situations when compared to endotracheal Intubation using a conventional laryngoscope. No data exist, if different video laryngoscope types perform differently in the out-of-hospital setting. The investigators hypothesize that there would be no difference with regard to intubation time, intubation success, and intubation morbidity between different models of video laryngoscopes.</brief_summary>
