	<brief_summary>This research is being done to compare the physical and quality of life benefits of two different types of exercise- tai chi versus strength training- for female cancer survivors who have had chemotherapy. Each exercise- tai chi and strength training- will be compared to participants in a group that performs flexibility and relaxation exercises, which is expected to have different benefits than either tai chi or strength training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and strength training to prevent falls in female cancer survivors. II. Determine the mechanism by which tai chi and strength training each reduces the risk of falls. III. Determine how well the benefits of each intervention persist after structured training stops. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Quantify and compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and resistance exercise on biomarkers common to both cancer progression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women cancer survivors. (Optional ancillary study) II. Quantify and compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and resistance exercise on biomarkers unique to CVD in women cancer survivors. (Optional ancillary study) III. Determine the influence of initial and changes in adiposity on changes in biomarkers from exercise. (Optional ancillary study) IV. Explore the effects of exercise training on a biomarker of accelerated aging in women cancer survivors. (Optional ancillary study) OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients attend strength training classes for 1 hour 2 days per week. ARM II: Patients attend tai chi classes for 1 hour 2 days per week. ARM III: Patients attend supervised stretching and relaxation classes for 1 hour 2 days per week. In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with stage IIII cancer other than cancers of the brain or spinal cord (confirmed by patient selfreport on the Health History Questionnaire; if patient is unable to confirm either the site of her cancer or that her stage of cancer is &lt; stage IV, we will send a letter to her physician to confirm this criterion) Completed chemotherapy &gt; 3 months prior to enrollment and no concurrent adjuvant therapy other than hormone manipulation therapy for breast cancer (confirmed by patient selfreport on the Health History Questionnaire; if patient is unable to confirm whether or not she completed chemotherapy 3 months prior to enrollment, we will send a letter to her physician to confirm eligibility on this criterion) Postmenopausal (confirmed by selfreport on the Health History Questionnaire; menopausal status could also be confirmed by a recent [&lt; 6 months from enrollment] laboratory report documenting serum folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 30 mIU/ml and/or serum estradiol &lt; 30 pg/ml) Currently underactive (&lt; 60 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week in the last month) (confirmed by selfreport on the Health History Questionnaire) Cognitive difficulties that preclude answering the survey questions, participating in the exercise classes or performance tests, or providing informed consent (confirmed by the professional opinion of the Principal Investigator, Dr. Kerri WintersStone) A medical condition, movement or neurological disorder, or medication use that contraindicates participation in moderate intensity exercise (confirmed by selfreport on the Health History Questionnaire, and by physician clearance; if in the professional opinion of the Principal Investigator, Dr. Kerri WintersStone, contraindications other than those identified by the patient or physician are present, she may consider the participant ineligible)</criteria>
