	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study protocol is to collect imaging data on embryos followed to blastocyst stage (Day 5-6) and correlate Eeva System parameters with comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) results, implantation and live birth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlating Time-Lapse Parameters Detected by the Eeva™ System With Comprehensive Chromosome Screening Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study was designed to determine if there is a correlation between the Eeva System parameters and CCS results. Embryos will be selected for transfer based on CCS results and morphology. The Clinical site will have no access to the Eeva analysis at the time of the transfer.</detailed_description>
