	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Intravenous (IV) acetaminophen plus rescue opioids for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain in neonates and infants (age &lt; 2 years) compared to placebo plus standard of care rescue opioids as well as characterize the concentration-effect relationship (PK/PD) of the intravenous acetaminophen as compared to the control group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is â‰¥ 28 weeks gestational age and &lt; 2 years old at study enrollment Subject will undergo surgery or had a traumatic injury expected to produce moderate to severe pain and patient is expected to require analgesic treatment for acute pain for 24 hours Subject has a medically reasonable need for IV treatment due to their underlying procedure(s) or medical condition(s) for the duration of the study Subject has reliable vascular access for administration of study medication and PK sampling Subject has a bodyweight which, in the opinion of the Investigator does not preclude participation in the study. Subject is free of other physical, mental, or medical conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, make study participation inadvisable or make it impossible to accurately assess efficacy or safety endpoints Subject's parent or guardian must provide written informed consent prior to participation in the study Subject's parent or guardian must have the ability to read and understand the study procedures and have the ability to communicate meaningfully with the study investigator and staff Subject is not able to comply with the sampling requirements of the study Subject has known or suspected hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or the excipients of IV acetaminophen Subject has any significant medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator contraindicates participation in the study or impairs the assessment of efficacy or safety (for example, neurologic diseases such as hemiplegia, demyelinating disorders, or neuromuscular paralysis, or requirement for prolonged mechanical ventilation making it impossible to assess pain scales using the LNPS or the FLACC) Subject has participated in another interventional clinical study within 30 days of the planned study randomization date PreRandomization (Qualification) Inclusion Criteria Subject has not been administered any of the following: any acetaminophencontaining product, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, central alphaadrenergic agents (e.g., clonidine, dexmedetomidine) or ketamine within 6 hours of T0 received a regional or neuraxial (caudal, epidural or spinal) anesthetic with local anesthetics within 6 hours of T0 Subject does not have abnormal LFTs from a sample obtained postoperatively/posttrauma and prior to randomization above the following limits: TBL &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal range for age, OR ALT (SGPT) &gt; 3 X ULN, OR If neonate, in the absence of intentional anticoagulation, INR &gt; 1.5 X ULN or PT &gt; 1.5 X ULN Subject does not have significantly impaired renal function or known significant renal disease which in the opinion of the Investigator would contraindicate study participation. Subject had a nursing assessment documenting moderate to severe pain (pain intensity score of at least 4 on the LNPS or FLACC) within 6 hours prior to randomization Subject required at least one dose of parenteral opioid medication for pain management (i.e., not preemptive therapy) during the 6hour prerandomization period, and is anticipated to require at least one dose of parenteral opioid medication during the 24 hour treatment period If subject is breast feeding, mother has not been administered any acetaminophen containing product in the previous 6 hours to T0 and throughout the treatment period</criteria>
