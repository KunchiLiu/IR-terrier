	<brief_summary>To prevent bronchial aspiration during induction of anaesthesia it has been a common procedure to perform a cricoid pressure, called Sellicks Maneuver, to occlude esophagus, and thereby prevent aspiration. During the last ten years the efficiency of this maneuver has been discussed, since it probably prolong the intubation time and do not significantly reduces the risk of aspiration. The hypothesis is that Sellicks Maneuver prolong the time of intubation and reduces the view of the laryngeal inlet, during intubation with a videolaryngoscopy. The hypothesis is tested by a double-blinded randomized study where patients is intubated twice, with and without Sellicks Maneuver, in a randomized order. The specific cricoid pressure is blinded to the personal performing the intubation.</brief_summary>
