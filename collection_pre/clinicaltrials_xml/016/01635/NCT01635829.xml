	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the drug) interactions between multiple doses of phenytoin 200 mg every 12 hours or carbamazepine 200 mg every 12 hours and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours at steady-state (constant concentration of medication in the blood) in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Potential Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between Phenytoin or Carbamazepine and Telaprevir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), 2-panel, sequential treatment study. In this study 24 healthy participants will be randomly assigned equally to 2 panels. In Panel 1 the participants will receive telaprevir in Part 1 (telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 1 to Day 9 followed by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 10) and phenytoin/telaprevir in Part 2 (phenytoin 200 mg every 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the morning on Day 17; and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 8 to Day 16 followed by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 17). In Panel 2 the participants will receive telaprevir (telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 1 to Day 9 followed by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 10) and carbamazepine/ telaprevir (carbamazepine 200 mg every 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the morning on Day 17; and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 8 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the morning on Day 17). In both panels, Part 1 and Part 2 are separated by a washout period of at least 2 weeks and maximum 4 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory examinations, vital signs and physical examination throughout the study period.</detailed_description>
