	<brief_title>Homeopathic Treatment for Depression in Peri- and Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perimenopausal period is characterized by an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Major depression is one of the most disabling medical conditions worldwide. At present, it is becoming more difficult to prove that antidepressants actually work better than placebo in clinical trials.Use of homeopathy to treat depression is widespread, but there is a lack of clinical trails about its efficacy in depression in peri- and postmenopausal women. Previous trials suggest that individualized homeopathic treatments improve depression in general population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individualized homeopathic treatment and fluoxetine are more efficient than placebo for moderate depression in peri- and postmenopausal women.</detailed_description>
