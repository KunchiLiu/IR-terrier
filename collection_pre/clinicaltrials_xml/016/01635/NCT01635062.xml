	<brief_title>The VALIDATE-D Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate whether vitamin D receptor agonist therapy (calcitriol) in diabetes lowers renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in a manner similar to an ACE inhibitor. This is a physiology study, focused on evaluating hormonal changes in the circulating and tissue RAS when compared to placebo. Subjects with type 2 diabetes and obesity and normal kidney function will undergo evaluation of their circulating and renal-vascular RAS activity and urinary protein at baseline, after withdrawing interfering medications, while on a controlled electrolyte diet, and in controlled posture settings. They will then randomly receive a study medication (calcitriol or placebo) for 3 weeks followed by a re-assessment of their RAS parameters. The main outcomes that will be evaluated following calcitriol/placebo include measures of the circulating RAS (primary), as well as measures of the renal-vascular RAS, urine protein, adipocytokine levels, and adipose-tissue RAS activity (secondary) In an extension phase, Lisinopril will be added to the study drug for another 2 weeks followed by another assessment of the primary and secondary outcome parameters, and subjects will continue lisinopril+study drug for 3 additional months for one final assessment of RAS parameters and urinary protein.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. TypeTwo Diabetes (treated with diet alone, with oral hypoglycemic agents, or with a single injection of basal insulin daily) 2. Normal blood pressure, or Mild (Stage 1) Hypertension that is either untreated, or adequately treated with a single antihypertensive drug. 3. Age &gt;18 years and &lt;70 years 4.
