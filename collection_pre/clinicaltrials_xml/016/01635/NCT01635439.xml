	<detailed_description>A controlled release hydrophilic matrix (Controlled Therapeutics Ltd., East Kilbride, Scotland) which provides a gradual release of dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2) was introduced in 1995 (Propess, Ferring Pharmaceuticals).

Prostaglandin E2 causes softening and dilatation of the cervix and subsequently produces uterine contractions which may induce labour.</detailed_description>
