	<brief_title>Paraspinous Anesthetic Block for Non-Responsive Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be allocated into one of two groups (intervention or placebo), and will be submitted to the corresponding procedure (paraspinous anesthetic block or placebo puncture in subcutaneous tissue). In the first appointment, pain will be measured with the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale); quality of life and function basal level will be evaluated by scales SF-36 (Medical Outcome Short-Form (36)Health Survey)and FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index), in Portuguese validated versions. Procedure will be realized as planned for each group. Second appointment will occur one week after the procedure, and VAS scale will be applied. Third appointment will occur in one month. VAS scale will be applied again,and procedure will be repeated if patient does not have a reduction of at least 30% of pain. Next consultations will occur at two months, three months, four months and five months, with application of VAS scale to keep monitoring evolution of pain. At six months of study, VAS scale will be applied along with SF-36 and FSFI questionnaires, to evaluate improvement in pain and in quality of life and function level.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with benign pelvic pain nonresponsive to pharmacological treatment, lasting at least 6 months, located in the anatomic pelvis, anterior abdominal wall, infraumbilical region, lumbossacral region or buttocks. Pain must be hard enough to cause functional impairment or to motivate medical counseling. The absence of physical findings does not decreases the importance of pain, nether excludes the possibility of pelvic pathology. Patients who do not want to take part in the study Age under 18 years old Pelvic pain lasting less than 6 months Relief or resolution of pain with pharmacological treatment Pain of neoplastic origin Known allergy or report of adverse reaction related to lidocaine</criteria>
