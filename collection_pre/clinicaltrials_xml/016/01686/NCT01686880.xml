	<criteria>Age ≥18 years. Cirrhotic liver demonstrated by typical liver dysmorphy on imaging and/or liver biopsy. HCC with at least one lesion measuring more than 1 cm in diameter with a single dynamic imaging technique (CT or MRI), showing intense arterial uptake followed by washout of contrast in the venousdelayed phases, or diagnosed by biopsy. Borderline resectable disease eligible for surgical resection or radiofrequency destruction. No extrahepatic dissemination. ECOG Performance status &lt; 2. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Signed written informed consent (approved by an Independent Ethics Committee) obtained prior to any study specific baseline procedures. Decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B, C). Extrahepatic tumour spread. Previous or concomitant malignancies within five years other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Pregnancy, lactation or refusal to use adequate contraceptive measures (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence). Preexisting other hepatic disease (liver abscess, hepatic sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, sclerosing cholangitis, …). Previous transarterial radioembolization (TARE). History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition of the administered materials. Bleeding diathesis, history of cardiovascular ischemic disease or cerebrovascular incident within the last six months. Major surgery within four weeks. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Uncontrolled Diabetes.</criteria>
