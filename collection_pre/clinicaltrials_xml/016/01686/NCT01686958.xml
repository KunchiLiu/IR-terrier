	<brief_title>Safety Study of MRI-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue to Treat Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system. The technology is developed for patients with organ confined prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation of prostate tissue. The treatment is conducted completely within an MRI suite, which enables real-time temperature images of the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is delivered. Using MRI thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over the intensity of the ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the pattern of thermal coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland, thereby reducing the risk of possible damage to important surrounding anatomy such as the rectum, urinary sphincters, neurovascular bundles and pelvic bone. This coagulation method, therefore, has the potential to have lower complication rates than conventional therapies.</detailed_description>
