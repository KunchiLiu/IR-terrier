	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, validation study of a extempore made tracer compared with a commercial. Studies with tracer have no medical effects but are used for studying human physiology, in this case pharmacokinetic variables of endogenous albumin distribution and turnover at different levels of inflammation. 1. Primary Objective: - Do the extempore made tracer 123-iodine labeled albumin an commercially manufactured SERALB-125 give identical values of calculated blood plasma volume and capillary leakage measured as transcapillary escape rate of albumin? 2. Secondary Objective: - How do three different measures of albumin turnover correlate in volunteers? - How do the pharmacokinetic parameters of endogenous albumin vary between the three study groups?</brief_summary>
