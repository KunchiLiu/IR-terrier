	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Compare 3 Different Strengths of an Extended Release Formulation of ASP015K to an Immediate Release Formulation of ASP015K</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study involves 3 parallel groups. Subjects in each group will receive 3 single-dose treatments with a washout period of at least 7 days separating the dosing between two consecutive treatments. Dosing conditions include both fed and fasted conditions.</detailed_description>
