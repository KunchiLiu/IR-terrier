	<brief_summary>Both XueZhiKang and Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that are often prescribed for individuals with high cholesterol and who are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several studies, including one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, have suggested that the use of statins is more frequently associated with fatigue. And XueZhiKang may be not. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of these two medications on fatigue in persons who are at moderate to low CVD risk based on the risk estimation system in ESC(European Society of Cardiology)/ESA(European Atherosclerosis Society) guidelines (2011) for the management of dyslipidemias.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of XueZhiKang on Fatigue：Comparing With Simvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are often prescribed statins, which are medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. By lowering cholesterol levels, these individuals have a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease and so on. While statins are effective at lowering cholesterol levels, their effect on fatigue is obvious and has been suggested by several studies, including one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. And XueZhiKang may be not. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of these two medications on fatigue in persons who are at moderate to low CVD risk based on the risk estimation system in ESC(European Society of Cardiology)/ESA(European Atherosclerosis Society) guidelines (2011) for the management of dyslipidemias. This study will enroll individuals who do not currently take cholesterol-lowering medications. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 600mg of XueZhiKang twice a day, or 20mg of simvastatin daily for 4 weeks. Study visits will occur at baseline and Week 4. Blood will be collected for laboratory testing, and standardized psychological questionnaires will assess fatigue scores and physical activity levels at baseline and week 4. Pill count will be used to assess adherence of XueZhiKang and simvastatin treatment at week 4. At week 4, medication side effects will be monitored and tests of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and creatine phosphate kinase (CPK) will be performed. At week 4, medication efficacy will be assessed and test of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) will be performed.</detailed_description>
