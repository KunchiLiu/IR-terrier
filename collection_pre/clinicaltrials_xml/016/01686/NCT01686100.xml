	<brief_summary>Coronary artery surgery (CABG) is necessary to improve blood circulation in many patients with coronary artery disease. This is done by using alternative blood vessels (grafts) to bypass the stenosed coronary arteries. In CABG, vein grafts are traditionally used where surrounding tissue is removed, this may damage the vessel and influence its patency. The "no-touch" technique was developed by Professor Domingos Souza at the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Ã–rebro University Hospital. This technique includes taking out the vein with its surrounding tissue and by this way the vessel is less damaged. The first two follow ups have shown that no-touch grafts had better patency than conventionally extracted graft at 18 months and 8.5 years. This long term follow up is a continuation of the randomized trial started in 1993 where the patency and incidence of stenoses in the no touch and conventional vein grafts has been studied.</brief_summary>
