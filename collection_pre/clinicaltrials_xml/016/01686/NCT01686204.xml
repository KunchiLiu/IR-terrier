	<brief_summary>The main objective of this work is to conduct a clinical trial in obese and non-obese individuals testing the ability of low-fat dairy yogurt to improve gastrointestinal health and reduce chronic inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that short and long-term consumption of low-fat dairy yogurt will reduce inflammation to a greater extent in obese individuals by improving intestinal barrier function.</brief_summary>
