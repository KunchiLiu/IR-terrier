	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how inspiratory flow pattern influences CO2 elimination in people without primary lung disease. The hypothesis is that a long mean distribution time, caused by a long postinspiratory pause and high end-inspiratory flow, will promote CO2 exchange in the alveoli.</brief_summary>
