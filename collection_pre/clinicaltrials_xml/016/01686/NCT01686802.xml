	<brief_summary>Children 5-17 years of age who have undergo orthopedic day surgical procedures for definitive management of fractures, tendon release, etc. will be randomized to receive either ibuprofen or oral morphine as needed for pain relief for 48 hours post-operatively at home. Pain will be assessed using the self-report Faces pain scale revised (FPS-R). We hypothesize that oral morphine will result in significantly lower pain scores on the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) compared to ibuprofen. It is hoped that the results of this trial will create a new option for post-operative pain management in children.</brief_summary>
