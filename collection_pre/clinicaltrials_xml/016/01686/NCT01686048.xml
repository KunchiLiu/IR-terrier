	<brief_summary>Ambrosia is known for its allergenicity in the USA causing hay fever and asthma. Israel has always been considered "clean" of Ambrosia but over the past years growth of Ambrosia plants has been detected in several locations in Israel. In the proposed study, patients referred for routine allergic evaluation will also be skin tested with Ambrosia allergens, in addition to their regular prick skin tests with all other airborne allergens.</brief_summary>
