	<brief_summary>Innlandet Hospital in Gj√∏vik is a center for patients suffering from morbid obesity in Hedmark og Oppland, Norway. Patients with either BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 or with BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 and complications who opt for "gastric bypass" surgery, go through a standard program including a thorough clinical examination and information on the operation, followed by a learning and coping program that consists of standard dietary advise for weight loss and includes weekly visits during 8 weeks. This research project concerns a subgroup in the patient population described above: morbidly obese patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this group it will be investigated how an 8 week preoperative milk-free diet affects digestive functions and weight loss. It is known that milk may cause stomach complaints and may make it more difficult to loose weight.</brief_summary>
