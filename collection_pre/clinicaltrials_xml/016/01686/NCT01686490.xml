	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial was to develop the initial sections of a video/DVD cassette that provided guidance about mastering stressful situations for patients who had been informed that they need an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). We adapted the existing LifeSkills video (which was already been shown effective in patients with heart diseases) to the specific needs of patients with AICD's. Before its development, we held separate focus groups with healthcare providers of AICD patients, pre-implantation patients, and post-implantation patients. After the video/accompanying workbook was produced, we held an additional focus group with patients who had received the video/workbook before receiving their AICD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients who had received the video/workbook told the focus group leader that they wanted more information about their AICD and a clearer presentation about how stress management was related to living with their AICD.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients (age&gt; 21 years old) For one of the initial focus groups and for the focus group of patients who had watched the produced modules: Patients who have received a recommendation for an AICD and have agreed to have it in the preimplantation stage (do not already have the implant) For the other initial focus group: patients who already have an AICD. Patients who are medically unstable [New York Heart Association class IV heart failure, recent (within 30 days) myocardial infarction or admission for unstable angina or worsening heart failure, inpatients, or patients who were admitted less than 1 month before potential enrollment will be excluded]. Patients who are suffering from other medical illnesses: only the following categories will be exclusionary: Diseases that cause severe cognitive impairment that may lead to inability to understand or follow study procedures (i.e., severe dementia, identified by the patients' inability to repeat the study procedures and by a minimental status exam that will be done if dementia is suspected); Diseases that cause severe psychotic symptoms leading to disorientation (i.e., hepatic encephalopathy). Patients who are actively suicidal (suspected from the suicide question on the depression questionnaire Patients who cannot understand the study procedures due to cognitive or language barriers (provided an effort was made to offer translation). The process for dealing with individuals who indicate that they may be suicidal, depressed or anxious will be as follows: Immediately upon receipt of the completed questionnaires at the coordinating office, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Impact of Event Scale will be evaluated. If the responses indicate suicidal ideation the subject will be called and asked to contact his/her primary care provider for an immediate appointment. The primary care provider will be contacted that day to inform him/her of the finding. If the responses to the Impact of Event Scale or the BDI indicate stress or depression, a letter will be sent to the subject recommending that he/she contact the primary care provider. A copy of the letter will be forwarded to the PCP.</criteria>
