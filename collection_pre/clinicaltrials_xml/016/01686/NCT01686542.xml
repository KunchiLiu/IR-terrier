	<brief_title>CPVI Plus Renal Sympathetic Modification Versus CPVI Alone for AF（Atrial Fibrillation） Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basic studies suggested that sympathetic nerves over-activity played an important role in the pathophysiological changes of arrhythmia occurrence. Present studies of renal ablation show a new method to decrease sympathetic nerves activity. Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) is an accepted ablation method for atrial fibrillation. The investigators plan to evaluate the efficiency and safety of CPVI plus renal sympathetic modification for atrial fibrillation ablation comparing with CPVI alone. The trial is going to recruit 100 patients randomized into two groups (CPVI+RSM group VS CPVI group = 50:50) with a follow-up duration of 4 years. The investigators aim to observe the relapse of atrial tachyarrhythmia lasting more than 30 seconds, the incidence of composite cardiovascular events after renal sympathetic modification, and safety and efficacy of the intervention, comparing with CPVI alone.</detailed_description>
