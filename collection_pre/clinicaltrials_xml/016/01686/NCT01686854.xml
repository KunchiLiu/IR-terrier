	<brief_summary>Comparison between different treatments of obesity in the short and medium term: prescriptive diet therapy compared to to cognitive-behavioral approach in the treatment of obesity according to the method of clinical trial. According to the Italian guidelines on obesity, the target to reach is the weight loss of 10% compared to the initial weight, obtained in six months and maintained for the next 5 years. The guideline considers six months as the time required to lose weight, but many patients are not able to achieve this result. Since in clinical practice many patients fail to achieve this weight loss in six months, it was decided to extend to 12 months the time to reach the target. As an intermediate goal it has been proposed to achieve a weight loss of at least 5% on respect of the basal weight in six months.</brief_summary>
