	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to understand whether patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) who receive a type of Cognitive-behavioral therapy called Exposure and Ritual Prevention (EX/RP) can discontinue their medication if they first do well with EX/RP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Attaining and Maintaining Wellness in Obsessive-compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study begins with a Preparatory Phase, wherein all eligible participants receive up to 25 sessions of Exposure and Ritual Prevention (EX/RP) therapy. At the end of the Preparatory Phase, those who have achieved wellness (mild to minimal symptoms) enter the Study Phase. Those who do not achieve wellness will not continue in the study and are referred for treatment elsewhere. Those who enter the Study Phase are then assigned by chance to one of two groups. One group will continue on the SRI medication and the other group will discontinue the SRI gradually over 4-6 weeks as it is replaced with a placebo (sugar pill). Neither patients nor study staff will know which group a participant is in. Both groups will continue to receive monthly sessions of EX/RP. The study will examine who has the best response to treatment in this study, including taking blood samples for genetic testing to see whether there are genes that can predict who will or will not benefit from EX/RP.</detailed_description>
