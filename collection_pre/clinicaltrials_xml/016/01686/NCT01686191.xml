	<brief_summary>Kidney disease is a common problem after heart transplantation. It may be caused by anti-rejection medications such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus. However, the reason why some people develop kidney problems after a heart transplant, but other people do not, is not fully known. This study plans to learn more about the relationship between a person's genetic make-up (DNA) and the risk of kidney problems after a heart transplant. The long-term goal of this research is to identify genetic variations that may help predict the development of kidney problems after heart transplantation.</brief_summary>
