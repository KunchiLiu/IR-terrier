	<brief_summary>Patients who will be scheduled for intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab will be recruited in this prospective self-controlled trial. Fundus photography will carried out at baseline immediately before injection and at 3, 7 days and 30 days after the first injection. Using image analysis software, measurements summarized as the central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE). Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference between arteriolar/venular diameter before and after injection of intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab in the treated and untreated eye</brief_summary>
