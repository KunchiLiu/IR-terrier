	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) Trial is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the MitraClip System for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) in Symptomatic Heart Failure Subjects who are treated per standard of care and who have been determined by the site's local heart team as not appropriate for mitral valve surgery. This randomized controlled trial will provide the opportunity to strengthen or add labeling claims regarding safety and clinical benefits of the MitraClip System for symptomatic heart failure patients with moderate-to-severe or severe functional mitral regurgitation. Approximately 610 subjects will be randomized at up to 100 investigational sites with approximately 305 subjects targeted to receive the study device. As part of the COAPT trial, a subset of patients will be registered in the cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) sub-study. The objective of this sub-study is to evaluate the exercise responses in a sub-cohort of COAPT subjects who receive MitraClip device (Device group) compared to the Control group who do not receive MitraClip device. (Note: the CPX Sub-study subjects will contribute to the analyses of the COAPT primary and secondary endpoints)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional Mitral Regurgitation (The COAPT Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, parallel-controlled, multicenter clinical evaluation of the MitraClip device for the treatment of clinically significant functional mitral regurgitation in symptomatic heart failure subjects who are treated per standard of care and who have been determined by the site's local heart team as not appropriate for mitral valve surgery. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the MitraClip device (Device group) or to no MitraClip device (Control group). As part of the COAPT trial, a subset of patients (at least 50 up to 100 in total) will be registered in the CPX Sub-study, which is designed as a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio to the MitraClip or no MitraClip device), parallel-controlled, multicenter study registering approximately 50-100 subjects in up to 50 qualified US sites from the COAPT trial. Subjects registered and randomized in the CPX Sub-study will contribute to the total enrollment approximately of 610 subjects in the COAPT trial. Roll-in subjects will not participate in the CPX Sub-study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Symptomatic functional MR (≥3+) due to cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or nonischemic etiology determined by assessment of a qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained within 90 days and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) obtained within 180 days prior to subject registration, with MR severity based principally on the TTE study, confirmed by the Echocardiography Core Lab (ECL). The ECL may request a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm MR etiology. Note: Functional MR requires the presence of global or regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which are believed to be the primary cause of the MR. If a flail leaflet or other evidence of degenerative MR is present, the subject is not eligible even if global or regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present. Note: Qualifying TTE must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on optimal therapy including Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) and at least 30 days after: 1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT 2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRTD) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRTD that results in increased biventricular pacing (from &lt;92% to ≥92%) 2. In the judgment of the HF specialist investigator at the site, the subject has been adequately treated per applicable standards, including for coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation and heart failure (e.g., with cardiac resynchronization therapy, revascularization, and/or GDMT). The Eligibility Committee must also concur that the subject has been adequately treated. 3. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II, III or ambulatory IV. 4. The Local Site Heart Team (CT surgeon and HF specialist investigators) and the Central Eligibility Committee concur that surgery will not be offered as a treatment option and that medical therapy is the intended therapy for the subject, even if the subject is randomized to the Control group. 5. The subject has had at least one hospitalization for heart failure in the 12 months prior to subject registration and/or a corrected brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥300 pg/ml or corrected nTerminal pro brain natriuretic peptide NTproBNP ≥1500 pg/ml measured within 90 days prior to subject registration ("corrected" refers to a 4% reduction in the BNP or NTproBNP cutoff for every increase of 1 kg/m2 in BMI above a reference BMI of 20 kg/m2). Note: BNP or NTproBNP must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on GDMT and at least 30 days after: 1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT 2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRTD) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRTD that results in increased biventricular pacing (from &lt;92% to ≥92%). 6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is ≥20% and ≤50% within 90 days prior to subject registration, assessed by the site using any one of the following methods: echocardiography, contrast left ventriculography, gated blood pool scan or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Note: The method must provide a quantitative readout (not a visual assessment). 7. The primary regurgitant jet is noncommissural, and in the opinion of the MitraClip implanting investigator can be successfully be treated by the MitraClip. If a secondary jet exists, it must be considered clinically insignificant. 8. Creatine KinaseMB (CKMB) obtained within prior 14 days &lt; local laboratory Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). 9. Transseptal catheterization and femoral vein access is determined to be feasible by the MitraClip implanting investigator. 10. Age 18 years or older. 11. The subject or the subject's legal representative understands and agrees that should he/she be assigned to the Control group, he/she will be treated with medical therapy and conservative management without surgery and without the MitraClip, either domestically or abroad. If the subject would actively contemplate surgery and/or MitraClip if randomized to Control, he/she should not be registered in this trial. 12. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial and agrees to its provisions, including the possibility of randomization to the Control group and returning for all required postprocedure followup visits, and has provided written informed consent. 13. Left Ventricular End Systolic Dimension (LVESD) is ≤ 70 mm assessed by site based on a transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) obtained within 90 days prior to subject registration. For the CPX Substudy: Subjects have to meet the COAPT study eligibility criteria to be registered in the CPX Substudy. 1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) requiring continuous home oxygen therapy or chronic outpatient oral steroid use. 2. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. 3. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) within 30 days prior to subject registration. 4.

Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has not reached its primary endpoint. Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials. 30.

For the CPX Substudy: Subjects who have any contraindications to CPX and are not capable of performing CPX per investigator's assessment should not be registered in the CPX Substudy.</criteria>
