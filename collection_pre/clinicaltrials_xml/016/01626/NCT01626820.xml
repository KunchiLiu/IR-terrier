	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female 18 years of age and older at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of any influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the study start or planned use of such vaccines during the study period. Administration of any other vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to study enrolment or during the study period. Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within the six months preceding the study vaccination. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric or neurological illness. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Insulindependent diabetes mellitus. Presence of blood dyscrasias, including hemoglobinopathies and myelo or lymphoproliferative disorder. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose. A history of any demyelinating disease including Multiple Sclerosis and GuillainBarré syndrome. History of chronic alcohol abuse and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Any significant disorder of coagulation that increases the risk of intramuscular injections or treatment with coumadin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g. lowdose aspirin, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency are eligible. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral® and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to consumption of eggs, and/or reactions to products containing mercury. A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination. Pregnant and/or lactating/nursing female. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.</criteria>
