	<brief_summary>Dose escalation study with a dose expansion phase, to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of two dose levels of BKM120 when administered orally.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of BKM120 in Adult Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm study, with a starting dose of BKM120 at 80mg/day. Two dose levels: 80mg/day and 100mg /day will be tested in the dose escalation phase. At least 3 patients will be enrolled at each dose level and at least 6 evaluable patients required to be treated at the recommended Phase II dose(RP2D)/MTD dose. After dose escalation the 80mg/day and the 100mg /day dose levels will be expanded to evaluate up to approximately a total of 15 patients each (if 100mg is determined as the RP2D/MTD).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with histologicallyconfirmed, advanced unresectable breast cancer or advanced carcinoma with squamous cell histology (including NSCLC, SCCHN, and esophageal) who have progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard anticancer therapy exists Patient must provide a representative archival or fresh tumor biopsy for shipping to a Novartis designated laboratory for profiling. Note: one block or ≥ 15 unstained slides is required to determine the PI3K activation status. Whenever possible ≥ 20 unstained slides is preferred. Patient has measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 guidelines for solid tumors Patient is an adult (female or male) ≥ 18 years of age on the day of consent signature Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤ 2 Patient has received previous treatment with a PI3K inhibitor Patient has symptomatic CNS metastases Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may participate in this trial. The patient must have completed any prior local treatment for CNS metastases ≥ 14 days prior to the start of study treatment (including radiotherapy and/or surgery). If the patient is receiving ongoing corticosteroid therapy, the following criteria must be met: The patient must be receiving a stable or decreasing dose ≤ dexamethasone 4 mg/day or equivalent antiinflammatory potency of another corticosteroid The dose of corticosteroid may not have been escalated for at least 14 days before the start of study treatment Patient is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment with corticosteroids (&gt;dexamethasone 4 mg or equivalent antiinflammatory potency of another corticosteroid) or another immunosuppressive agent. Note: Topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intraarticular) are allowed. Patients with previously treated and asymptomatic brain metastases, are permitted to use corticosteroids as per specific protocol criteria Patient is currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A. The patient must have discontinued strong inducers for at least one week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the treatment is initiated. Switching to a different medication prior to starting study treatment is allowed. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
