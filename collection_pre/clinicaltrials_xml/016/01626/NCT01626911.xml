	<brief_summary>Our animal studies found that continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI in the celiac trunk) of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) could alleviate inflammation, improve global hemodynamics and restore organ function in a porcine model of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP,unpublished). In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effects of CRAI of LMWH in the treatment of SAP patients. The investigators suppose CRAI could help improve the outcomes of these patients.</brief_summary>
