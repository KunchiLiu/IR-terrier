	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this study is to ascertain if salt intake affects ophthalmic artery (OA) blood flow. In addition, we will study both the eye and kidney response to ACE inhibition compared to placebo while controlling salt intake in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesize that salt intake will affect OA blood flow. We will initially look at both eye and renal response to subjects on a low salt diet (10mEq Na/day) followed by response to high salt diet (200mEq Na/day). In addition, we may look at eye response while subjects consume their regular diet.</detailed_description>
