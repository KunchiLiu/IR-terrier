	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking into RNA in samples from younger patients with T-cell (T) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying RNA in Samples From Younger Patients With T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Characterization of the transcriptomic landscape in diagnosis and relapse of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the direct comparison with corresponding physiological samples (human thymus). - Perform high-throughput transcriptome ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing using matched diagnostic T-precursor pediatric ALL samples (peripheral blood or bone marrow). OUTLINE: Archived peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are analyzed for long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) expression and sequencing.</detailed_description>
