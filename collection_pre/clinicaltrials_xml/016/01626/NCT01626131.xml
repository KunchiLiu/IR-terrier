	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot intervention study is to examine the efficacy of exercise for reducing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric and somatic symptoms. The sample will be composed of veterans aged 18-65 with combat-related PTSD (N = 40). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in the exercise training group (n = 20) will receive three 60-75 minute sessions per week of combination aerobic and resistance training for eight weeks. In the control stretching group, participants (n = 20) will receive training in whole-body flexibility three times per week for eight weeks. Secondary objectives include 1) determining feasibility of the intervention (as measured by the percentage of prescribed days of exercise completed by each participant, and percentage of time exercising completed at the prescribed intensity and duration); 2) determining the influence of exercise training on aerobic fitness and strength in the sample; and 3) determining whether psychiatric/somatic symptom improvements are associated with improvements in fitness and strength. Finally, exploratory objectives will include examining whether exercise training can improve early signs of heart disease, and whether certain biomarkers (using MRI and fMRI data and inflammatory markers) are associated with treatment response.</brief_summary>
