	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, Phase II study designed to enroll and treat up to 64 patients. All patients in this study will receive ofatumumab and bendamustine as an IV infusion for 6 cycles (a cycle is defined as 21 days in length). Patients will receive as an IV infusion bendamustine Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 1 through 6 and ofatumumab Days 1 and 8 during Cycle 1 only and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 6.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Bendamustine and Ofatumumab in Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Who Are Poor Candidates for R-CHOP Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While R-CHOP has improved survival and is considered standard of care for patients with DLBCL, the toxicities associated with R-CHOP are substantial in the elderly population. This is one of several reasons the outcome of older patients is worse than the corresponding younger patients. Bendamustine is an alkylating agent which causes intra- and inter-strand cross-links between DNA bases. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD 20 antibody well tolerated by elderly patients. Ofatumumab targets a novel epitope of the CD20 molecule on B cells and remains on the cell surface twice as long as rituximab. The combination of both agents allows for a potentially efficacious, less toxic regimen.</detailed_description>

Patients with active/symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement based on clinical evaluation by lumbar puncture, PET, CT or MRI. 2. Known sensitivity to bendamustine or any component of bendamustine. 3. Known anaphylaxis or sensitivity to ofatumumab. 4. Major surgery within 28 days of Cycle 1, Day 1.

Prior use of investigational anticancer agents for lymphoma. 7. HIVrelated lymphoma. 8. Known active HIV or HCV infection, or known seropositivity for HIV, or current or chronic HBV or HCV infection. HBV test required at screening or a negative result within 6 weeks of screening. 9. Concurrent active or history of other malignancies, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of cervix or breast. Patients with previous malignancies are eligible provided they have been treated with curative intent and disease free for &gt;= 1 year. 10. Serious (grade 34), active, intercurrent infection requiring therapy, or deep seated or systemic mycotic infections. 11. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to registration or New York Hospital Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or significant conduction system abnormalities, in the judgment of the Investigator. 12. Concurrent uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric conditions likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study, in the judgment of the Investigator 13. Patients who have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). 14. Treatment with any known nonmarketed drug substance or experimental therapy within 5 terminal half lives or 4 weeks prior to enrollment, whichever is longer, or currently participating in any other interventional clinical study. 15. Significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition including, but not limited to, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological, cerebral or psychiatric disease which in the opinion of the investigator may represent a risk for the patient. 16. Male patients unable or unwilling to use adequate contraception methods from study start to one year after the last dose of protocol therapy.</criteria>
