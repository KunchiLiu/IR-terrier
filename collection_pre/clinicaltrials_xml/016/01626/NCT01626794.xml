	<brief_summary>This study will test the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of VARIVAX™ manufactured with the Varicella Enhanced Process (VEP) compared with the VARIVAX™ 2007 Process. The primary hypotheses being tested are 1)VARIVAX™ VEP will induce varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody responses that are non-inferior to those induced by VARIVAX™ 2007 process at 6 weeks after vaccination 1, and 2) VARIVAX™ VEP will induce an acceptable anti-VZV antibody response rate at 6 weeks after vaccination 1.</brief_summary>
