	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine the optimal effective dose of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum pratense based on reduction of upper airways reactivity after 5 months of treatment with different dosages of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum pratense compared to placebo. Furthermore, safety and tolerability will be assessed by the number of related Adverse Events of different dosages of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum pratense compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
