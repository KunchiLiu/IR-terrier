	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to find out whether the bioavailability of PT Dexa Medica's formulation of 4 mg perindopril tert-butylamine tablets was equivalent to that of the innovator's product (Prexum® 4 mg, Servier).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Two Formulations of Perindopril 4 mg Tablet Under Fasting Condition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next morning were given orally one tablet of the test drug (Perindopril 4 mg tablets of PT Dexa Medica) or one tablet of the reference drug (Prexum® 4 mg, Servier). Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and at 20, 40 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192 hours after drug administration. Three weeks after the first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, t max, and t1/2, were determined based on the concentrations of the perindopril parent compound and the metabolite perindoprilat, using high-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry detector (LC-MS/MS).</detailed_description>
