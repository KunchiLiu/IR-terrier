	<brief_summary>Topography guided laser treatment enables the surgeon to correct higher order aberrations in corneas with irregular astigmatism. Several case reports and small uncontrolled trials have been published on the combination of this treatment with corneal cross linking (CCL) in patients with ectatic corneal diseases. This randomized study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combined treatment of corneal cross linking with a partial topography guided excimer laser treatment in eyes with progressive ectatic corneal diseases.</brief_summary>
