	<brief_summary>The study is primarily being performed in order to demonstrate bioequivalence between the Orfadin (nitisinone) suspension and the marketed capsule formulation. The study will also contain a comparison of the bioavailability of the suspension given with food and on an empty stomach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence of Orfadin Suspension Compared to Orfadin Capsules, and the Effect of Food on the Bioavailability of the Suspension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, randomized 3-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive single oral 30-mg doses of nitisinone as a suspension (fasting and with food) and as hard gelatin capsules (fasting only). There will be a 2-week washout period between the doses. There will be a screening visit within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. During each treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinic from the afternoon on the day before drug administration (i.e., on Day -1) and remain at the clinic until the 48-hour post-dose blood sample has been collected in the morning of Day 3. They will then return for ambulatory visit in the morning of Day 4 (72-hour sample). A follow-up visit will take place 7-14 days after the last dose.</detailed_description>
