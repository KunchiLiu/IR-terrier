	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to learn more about eating practices of survivors of childhood Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors (including brain and spinal cord tumors). Recent research shows that childhood cancer survivors are experiencing many health issues months or even years after active cancer treatment (for example, irregular blood sugar levels, overweight/obesity, and heart disease). To address this growing concern, researchers at MD Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital and Texas Children's Cancer Center have joined forces to learn more about how to design a program that would promote healthy lifestyles among survivors of childhood cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MyChoice: An Application of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18v2) Among Adolescent and Young Adult Survivors of Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A one-time assessment will be conducted for all participants through the Assessment Center website. No treatment or intervention will be provided. Two websites will be set up (Site A and Site B). The only difference between the two sites is the order that the questions will appear. The actual questions will remain the same. Only the adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of CNS tumors eligible after screening will be invited to respond to the survey. Following the final screening, the eligible participants will be randomized to Site A or Site B. Each participant will complete the web-based questionnaire that has a total of 53 questions. For site A, the order of the questions will be TFEQ-R18v2, multifactor screener, and EQ-EMA. For site B, the order of the questions will be EQ-EMA, multifactor screener, and TFEQ-R18v2. The 53 questions came from the original TFEQ-R18v2, the multifactor screener used in the National Cancer Institute's Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study, and the adapted TFEQ-R18v2 for use via EMA methodology. Multifactor screener is a short assessment tool used to evaluate dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, percentage of energy from fat, and fiber. Eating Questionnaire-EMA (EQ-EMA) was adapted based on the original TFEQ-R18v2 for use via EMA methodology. The changes made were related to a change in verbiage to reflect our goal of assessing a participant's current behavior before and after an eating episode.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adolescent or Young Adult (AYA), 15 to 39 years old who has survived a primary CNS tumor 2. Has been off therapy without relapse for at least 6 months 3. Able to speak, write, and read in English 4. Has access to the internet 5. Has telephone access 6. Currently lives in the United States 1. Is in foster care 2. Is experiencing severe cognitive impairments that do not allow them to engage in basic conversations [We are excluding individuals who may experience severe cognitive impairments because participants will need to provide assent (if &lt;18 years old) or consent (if &gt;=18 years old) and will need to have the ability to independently complete the TFEQR18v2, Multifactor screener, and EQEMA. Through the phone screening conducted by the MDACC graduate research assistant (GRA), a person is determined to not be severely cognitive impaired if the participant is able to respond to basic questions such as their age, whether or not they have internet access, and telephone.] 3. Is incarcerated at the time of enrollment.</criteria>
