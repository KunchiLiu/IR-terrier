	<brief_summary>Liquid potassium-magnesium citrate (KMgCit) as a pharmaceutical formulation will lower blood pressure among patients with pre- or Stage I hypertension on their customary diet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Value of Liquid Potassium Magnesium Citrate in Controlling Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this protocol, the investigators want to explore whether KMgCit taken during a customary dietary setting, might serve as a "surrogate" for the DASH diet to lower blood pressure. This study has obvious biomedical importance. Lifestyle modifications are often recommended for pre- or Stage I hypertension. The DASH diet is such a modification that has been shown to be effective. However, this diet is costly and difficult to adhere to long-term. If KMgCit were shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure, it would provide a safe and convenient alternative to the DASH diet.</detailed_description>
