	<criteria>Male and female adults aged ≥40 years Patients with stable COPD according to GOLD strategy (GOLD 2011). Patients with airflow limitation indicated by a postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 30% and &lt;80% of the predicted normal, and a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70. Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. Patients with an mMRC ≥ grade 2 History of long QT syndrome or prolonged QTc Patients who have had a COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1. Patients with Type I or uncontrolled Type II diabetes Patients with a history of asthma or have concomitant pulmonary disease Patients with paroxysmal (e.g. intermittent) atrial fibrillation. Only patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and controlled with a rate control strategy for at least six months could be eligible Patients who have clinically significant renal, cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, immunological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or hematological abnormalities which could interfere with the assessment of safety Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
