	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. It aims to demonstrate that (1) Chinese medicine prescription "Wu Zhu Yu Tang" can prevent Acute Mountain Sickness(AMS) (2) "Wu Zhu Yu Tang" can prevent AMS especially for Yang-Xu body constitution. We will randomize 240 unacclimatized healthy adults. They will be randomized after stratification of the Yang-Xu score and the AMS history to receive Chinese medicine during one ascent and placebo during the other ascent. We will take them in Hehuan mountain for two days hike (24 hours) and an overnight over 3,000m. One month before the study, the subjects will fill the "Body Constitution Questionnaire BCQ" in order to evaluate their body constitution. Before, during and after the two days hike we will measure their blood pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. The incidence of AMS will be measured by the Lake Louise Self Report (Lake Louise Score â‰¥4 with headache), we will also report the Lake Louise Clinical Assessment score and Lake Louise Functional Score.</detailed_description>
