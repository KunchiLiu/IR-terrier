	<brief_summary>The overall contribution of this study is to increase the knowledge of the efficacy of strength and aerobic exercise on knee related quality of life, knee pain,physical function and the morphology of the cartilage in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Knee OA is one of the most important diseases within musculoskeletal conditions affecting a considerable number of people worldwide. This randomized controlled trial will involve one intervention group delivered strength exercises compared to another intervention group delivered aerobic exercise (ergometer cycling). The two intervention groups will be compared to a control group undergoing usual care. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed comparing the three groups. The study is funded from The Research Council of Norway.</brief_summary>
