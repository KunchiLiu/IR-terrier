	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare Dysport treatment results after current clinical practice injection technique and high-concentration dilution to the neuromuscular junction targeted injection technique and low-concentration dilution in the elbow joint assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale 4 weeks post treatment. The hypothesis is that one high volume injection centrally located in the area/band of the NMJ zones will be as effective as the technique used today in current medical practice.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision of written informed consent prior to any study related procedures Subjects male or female, aged 18 or older Upper limb spasticity post stroke or traumatic brain injury Spasticity position pattern type 1, 3 or 4 Elbow flexor muscles spasticity MAS 2 to 3 At least 2 consecutive previous treatment cycles of BoNTA for current diagnosis The latest treatment cycle demonstrating good treatment efficacy where the Dysport dose administered was considered to be adequate according to Investigator judgement Need of the same treatment modality as the previous treatment cycle, Last BoNTA treatment 1224 weeks ago Poor response to BoNTA treatment, according to Investigator Need of Dysport doses &gt;800U in the upper limb Concomitant treatment with BoNTA for other indications than spasticity Any elbow flexor contracture prohibiting MAS evaluation and/or elbow flexion improvement of at least 1 step on the MAS Cutaneous or joint inflammation in the affected upper limb Is likely to start other spasticity treatment during the study Is likely to start physiotherapy treatment during the study Other ongoing neurological disorder (e.g., myasthenia gravis) History of dysphagia or aspiration Use of agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., aminoglycosides) Treated with an investigational medicinal product within 30 days before start of the study Known sensitivity to BoNTA or any components of Dysport, Is at risk of pregnancy or is lactating. Females of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (UhCG) at visit 1 and must be using adequate contraception. Non childbearing potential is defined as postmenopause for at least one year, surgical sterilisation or hysterectomy at least three months before the start of the study, Has a history of, or known current, problems with alcohol or drug abuse, Has a mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study, and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude, Has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise the subject's safety or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objective(s) of the study.</criteria>
