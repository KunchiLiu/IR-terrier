	<brief_summary>This trial is testing ramucirumab (LY3009806) administered to Chinese participants with advanced solid tumors that are resistant to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe ramucirumab is and whether it causes any side effects. The study will also measure how much ramucirumab gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.</brief_summary>
