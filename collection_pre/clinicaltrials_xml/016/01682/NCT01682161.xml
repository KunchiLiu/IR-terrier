	<brief_title>A Comparative Study to Evaluate the Evolution of Medication Satisfaction and Adherence in Patients Unsatisfied With Current Oral Atypical Antipsychotics by Switching Medication to Paliperidone Palmitate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective (patients are first identified and then followed forward as time passes), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), comparative and open-labeled (all people know the identity of the intervention) study. The study mainly consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (14 days before administration of study medication), treatment phase, and the follow-up phase (28 days after the last dose of the study medication). In the treatment phase, patients will be randomly assigned equally in 2 groups (Group 1 and Group 2), on the basis of known and unknown characteristics. Group 1 (immediate switch group): Patients will be administered with paliperidone palmitate immediately after randomization and will continue throughout the treatment phase. Group 2 (delayed switch group): Patients will remain on current oral antipsychotics until Week 8, and later on will be completely switched to paliperidone palmitate. However, during the first 8 weeks if the symptoms or satisfaction with MSQ further deteriorates for Group 2, they may be switched into paliperidone palmitate earlier. Safety evaluations will include evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination and these will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 148 days.</detailed_description>
