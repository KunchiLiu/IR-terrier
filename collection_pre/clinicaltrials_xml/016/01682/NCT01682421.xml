	<brief_summary>After corneal transplantation, topical corticosteroids are used to reduce the risk of rejection. However, the optimal postoperative treatment regimen is unknown. In most cases, a topical steroid is administered for at least 6 months after surgery, but it remains to be determined whether potent steroids offer better protection than weak steroids. Also, the length of the treatment is debated. Since the use of steroids is not without potential serious ocular side effects, it is of considerable importance to investigate these problems. The study aims to examine the frequency of rejection episodes after posterior lamellar keratoplasty; specifically comparing a short course of potent steroids versus a long course of weak steroids.</brief_summary>
