	<criteria>Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures including the genetic sampling and analyses Volunteers will be males or females aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) and with a weight of at least 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive. Provision of signed, written, and dated informed consent for optional genetic research. If a volunteer declines to participate in the genetic component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the volunteer. Male volunteers should be willing to use barrier contraception, ie, condoms from the day of first dosing until 2 weeks after dosing with the IP in Treatment Period 5. Females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the CPU (including checkin at each treatment period), must not be lactating and must be of non childbearing potential, confirmed at screening History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in the study History or presence of GI, hepatic, or renal disease or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IP Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results as judged by the Investigator Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</criteria>
