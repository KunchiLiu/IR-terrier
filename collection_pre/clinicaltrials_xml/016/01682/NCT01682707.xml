	<brief_summary>Opioids provide greater patient comfort during intubation, but are not able to abolish completely the release adrenergic hormones during the laryngoscopy, which may cause undesirable hemodynamic changes. In this study the investigators selected two techniques commonly used for intubation, laryngoscopy and track light, so the investigators can verify which intubation techniques provides less hemodynamic changes in coronary patients under standard anesthesia induction.</brief_summary>
