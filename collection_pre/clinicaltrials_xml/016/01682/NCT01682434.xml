	<brief_summary>Laser in situ keratomileusis is a successful procedure for the treatment of low to moderate myopia. Advances over the last decade have allowed LASIK to also correct higher order wavefront aberrations. In low myopia, there seem to be a minor effect of such wavefront-guided treatment. However, it remains to be established whether there is a beneficial effect in higher degrees of myopia. The study aims to determine whether myopic subjects (-6 to -10 diopters) with higher-than-average preoperative higher-order aberrations have benefit of wavefront-guided treatment. Subjects are randomized to wavefront-guided treatment in one eye, and conventional treatment in the other.</brief_summary>
