	<brief_summary>Wide Pulse Pressure is frequently present in the normal, full-term neonatal population. This study will evaluate the frequency and persistence of wide pulse pressure in the neonatal population. Using a prospective study design in the Regular newborn and Observation nurseries of SIUH, North site. Healthy newborns that are between 0-72 hrs of age will have their blood pressures measured using the oscillometric method. This data will offer insight into whether the presence of wide pulse pressure in otherwise healthy newborn infants warrants further cardiovascular evaluation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Infants with gestational age &gt; or = 35weeks and birth weight &gt; 2500g, who are hemodynamically stable, have no cardiorespiratory abnormalities and have no evidence of sepsis. If a blood culture was drawn due to the presence of maternal risk factors (e.g. maternal fever, prolonged rupture of membranes), patients will be included only if the blood culture result is negative and in case of intrapartum antibiotic treatment, ancillary blood tests (CBC with differential, CRP) are also within the normal range Infants with gestational age &lt; 35weeks or birth weight &lt; 2500g and with evidence of neonatal sepsis either culture proven or clinically suspected.</criteria>
