	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that AFOLIA, a recombinant manufactured human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) has a similar efficacy and safety profile compared to the widely used and marketed r-hFSH Gonal-f.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study Comparing Efficacy and Safety of AFOLIA vs Gonal-f® in Women (35 to 42) Undergoing IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of the clinical pregnancy rate in the AFOLIA group compared to the Gonal-f group as the primary endpoint. Comparison of the number and size of follicles, the number of cycle cancellation, the hormone parameters and adverse events in the AFOLIA group compared to the Gonal-f group as secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>
