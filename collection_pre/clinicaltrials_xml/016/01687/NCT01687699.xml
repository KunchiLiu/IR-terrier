	<brief_summary>Aldosterone receptor blockers reduce cardiac-related morbidity and mortality. Recently, we demonstrated that long-term low-dose spironolactone is clinically safe in many hemodialysis (HD) patients. In the present study, we assess whether low-dose spironolactone treatment reduces the high incidence of cardio- and cerebrovascular (CCV) morbidity and mortality in HD patients. The investigators' hypothesis is that aldosterone receptor blockade by spironolactone reduces the risk of both CCV morbidity and death among HD patients.</brief_summary>
