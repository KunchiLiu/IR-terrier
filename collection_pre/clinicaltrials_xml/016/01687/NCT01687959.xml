	<brief_summary>Timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy following after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography for acute biliary pancreatitis is a controversial issue. There are still many confounding findings offering either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours following endoscopic sphincterotomy or delayed surgery after 6 weeks. Peritoneal plasmin system is known to be an important factor in peritoneal healing and adhesion formation. Measurement of tissue concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator and its specific activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 are thought to be helpful to show peritoneal adhesions after endoscopic sphincterotomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peritoneal fibrinolysis is crucial in peritoneal healing processes and subsequent adhesion formation. It is expected that endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is a trauma causing adhesions around the hepatobiliary area. Such adhesions may cause some difficulty for consequent gallbladder surgery. For that reason, tissue measurements of factors indicating degree of peritoneal healing and adhesion is helpful for timing of such surgical interventions. Patients are going to be randomized to early and delayed surgery groups. Sampling of peritoneum around the gallbladder during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is performed. Tissue concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator and its specific activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 are going to be studied by using commercial assays. Peritoneal fibrinolytic activity and surgical outcomes are going to be compared.</detailed_description>
