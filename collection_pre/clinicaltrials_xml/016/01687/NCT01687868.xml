	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the beach chair position may be at risk for adverse neurologic events due to cerebral ischemia. Dexmedetomidine, a potent alpha adrenoceptor agonist which dose-dependently reduces arterial blood pressure and heart rate, decreases the hemodynamic and catecholamine response in the perioperative period. dexmedetomidine has an effect of peripheral vasoconstriction thus it is theologically appropriate for reducing bleeding for arthroscopic operation field. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of dexmedetomidine on cerebral oxygen saturation, cognitive function, hemodynamic stability and operative field in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the beach-chair position.</brief_summary>
