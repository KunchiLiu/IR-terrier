	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the Blazer Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter for the Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ZERO-AF trial is a prospective, multicenter, single blind, 1:1 randomized study. The trial is designed to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of the Blazer® Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter are non-inferior to the safety and effectiveness of the control catheters, for the treatment drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The control catheters are open-irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheters that are approved in the United States for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, when used with compatible three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping systems.</detailed_description>
