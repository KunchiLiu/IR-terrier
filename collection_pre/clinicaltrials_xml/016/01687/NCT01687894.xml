	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing surgery in beach chair position (BCP) are at risk for cerebral ischaemia. The impacts of arginine vasopressin (AVP) on haemodynamics and cerebral oxygenation are evaluated during surgery in BCP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vasopressin to Prevent Hypotension During Beach Chair Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing shoulder surgery in BCP under general anaesthesia are randomly allocated to receive i.v. normal saline (control group) or AVP 0.05 or 0.07 U kg-1 (AVP group, n = 15 each) 2 min before moving into BCP. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) are measured before (pre-sitting in supine position) and after patients assumed BCP.</detailed_description>
