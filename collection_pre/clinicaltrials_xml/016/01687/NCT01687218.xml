	<brief_summary>MTN-017 is a Phase 2, multi-site, randomized, six-sequence, two three-period, open label crossover study, examining the effects of oral Truvada and reduced glycerin 1% tenofovir gel. The study population will be sexually active, HIV-uninfected males who are 18 years of age or older, who report a history of receptive anal intercourse in the past 3 months. Each of the study product regimens offers different advantages to participants seeking an effective HIV prevention agent. How these relative advantages will compare in terms of safety, acceptability, systemic and local absorption, and adherence will be examined within this study.</brief_summary>

Willing to not take part in other research studies involving drugs, medical devices, vaccines or genital products for the duration of study participation (including the time between Screening and Enrollment) 11. Men and transgender females who agree to take part in the PK, PD and Mucosal Immunology Subset, must also agree to abstain from: Inserting anything into the rectum, including abstaining from RAI for 72 hours after the collection of biopsies Taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin and/or other drugs that are associated with increased likelihood of bleeding following mucosal biopsy collection for 72 hours prior to and following the collection of biopsies. 1. At Screening, participantreported symptoms, and/or clinical or laboratory diagnosis of active anorectal or reproductive tract infection requiring treatment per current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines or symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Infections requiring treatment include symptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection, Neisseria gonorrhea (GC), syphilis, active herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions, anogenital sores or ulcers, or symptomatic genital warts. Note: HSV1 or HSV2 seropositive diagnosis with no active lesions is allowed, since treatment is not required. In cases of nonanorectal GC/CT identified at screening, one rescreening 2 months after the screening visit will be allowed 2. History of inflammatory bowel disease as reported by participant history 3.

Known allergy to methylparaben and/or propylparaben 5. Known allergy to any of the study products. 6. Per participant report, use of the following medications and/or products within 12 weeks prior to screening, and/or anticipated use or unwillingness to abstain from use throughout study participation: Any investigational products Systemic immunomodulatory medications Use of Heparin, including Lovenox® Warfarin Plavix® (clopidogrel bisulfate) Rectallyadministered medications or products, containing N9 or corticosteroids 7.

Symptoms suggestive of acute HIV seroconversion at Screening and Enrollment 9. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives would make the patient unsuitable for the study or unable/unwilling to comply with the study requirements. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, colorectal abnormalities, substance abuse, or renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological or psychiatric disease.</criteria>
