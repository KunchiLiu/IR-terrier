	<brief_title>Differential Effects of Lipids on Cardiovascular Diseases: A CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) as risk factors for cardiovascular events is well-documented. The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration found approximately log-linear adjusted associations of cholesterol concentrations with risks of first-time non-fatal myocardial infarction; coronary heart disease (CHD) death; ischaemic, haemorrhagic and unclassified stroke. They also found that triglycerides concentration was not independently related with CHD risk after controlling for HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, and other standard risk factors. The Prospective Studies Collaboration found that Higher HDL-C and lower non-HDL-C levels were approximately independently associated with lower ischaemic heart disease mortality. By focusing on broad outcomes these large meta-analyses conflate the association between development of the different cardiovascular disease (CVD) phenotypes, disease progression and mortality from cardiovascular causes. With linked electronic health records, we have the potential for a cohort with sufficient size and clinical detail to investigate the association between lipid concentrations and initial presentation of a range of CVD phenotypes across cerebral, coronary, abdominal and peripheral arterial circulations.</detailed_description>
