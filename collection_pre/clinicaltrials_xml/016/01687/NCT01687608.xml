	<brief_title>Open-Label Single Ascending Dose of Adeno-associated Virus Serotype 8 Factor IX Gene Therapy in Adults With Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia B is a genetic X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in blood-clotting Factor IX (FIX) activity. FIX is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood as a proenzyme. Current treatment for hemophilia B is based on replacement of the deficient FIX with IV injections of recombinant FIX protein prophylactically or as needed to treat bleeding episodes. This clinical program will test a gene transfer approach involving the use of a gene delivery vector carrying a FIX gene. This first-in-humans study is intended to evaluate the safety, kinetics, and if possible, the dose of AskBio009 required to achieve stable plasma FIX activity between 10% and 40% of normal activity.</detailed_description>
