	<brief_summary>Periconceptional supplementation with folic acid - the synthetic form of the B-vitamin folate - reduces the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spina bifida. The underlying biochemical mechanisms for how folic acid affects health outcomes however are unknown. The naturally occurring form 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is now available and discussed as an adequate substitute to folic acid. This study aims to determine the effect of folic acid compared to 5-MTHF on cellular mechanisms. Stable isotope tracer protocols will be used that allow determining the effect of folic acid on the dynamics of metabolic pathways in the human body. Hypothesis: Supplementation with high-dose folic acid alters the turnover rate of folate dependent pathways in healthy humans; but 5-MTHF does not. Genetic variations in a key enzyme of the folate metabolism will aggravate the effect of folic acid on the metabolic pathways.</brief_summary>
