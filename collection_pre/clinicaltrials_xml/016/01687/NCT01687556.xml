	<detailed_description>Acne vulgaris is one of the most prevalent skin disorders of sebaceous follicles, affecting more than 85% of adolescents in United States. Acne can persist throughout the adulthood, and even a mild form of acne might progress to permanent scarring on the face, chest and back, thereby causing significant physical and psychosocial morbidities. Acne is a multifactorial disease of which etiology has not been fully elucidated, although considerable progress has been made in understanding its pathogenesis during last decade. The major pathogenic features of acne include abnormal ductal keratinization, sebum overproduction, Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation. Common acne medications such as topical retinoids, antibiotics and isotretinoin are associated with irritation and incomplete responses, increased bacterial resistance or untoward side events, respectively. Thus there is a continuing need for a novel, effective agent targeting different aspects of acne pathogenesis, with minimal side effects. In the recent decade, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, has attracted much interest on account of its potent anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and antimicrobial activities. Preclinical, observational, and clinical trial data have indicated that EGCG can inhibit tumor initiation, promotion, progression, and angiogenesis. EGCG also suppresses neutrophil chemotaxis, and has been suggested to improve many diseases that have inflammatory components such as diabetes, kidney injuries, arthritis, allergies, dental caries, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurodegenerative diseases. In skin, EGCG has been investigated mainly in light of antioxidative, immunopotentiating and anticarcinogenic properties against chemicals or ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, EGCG has lipid-lowering and antiandrogenic properties, and can downregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ expression. Based on these observations, it can be inferred that EGCG might be effective in the treatment of acne.</detailed_description>
