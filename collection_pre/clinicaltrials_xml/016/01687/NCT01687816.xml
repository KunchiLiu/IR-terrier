	<brief_summary>This is a prospective specimen collection study targeting patients presenting with Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and/or Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) in an out-patient setting. A non-invasive, user friendly sampling technique, using midturbinate flocked swabs will be used. These nasal swabs will be collected in different volumes of viral transport media (0.5mL and 3.0mL), for different dilution range of the viruses present in the collected biological specimen. The collection of nasal swabs samples will support the optimization of point of care detection methods for respiratory viruses responsible for ILI and/or ARI.</brief_summary>
