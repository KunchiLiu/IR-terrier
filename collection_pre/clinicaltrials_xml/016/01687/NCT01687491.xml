	<brief_summary>This study is a clinical trial monocentric, open, randomized ENOXA 速 versus LOVENOX 速, conducted on two parallel groups of patients admitted in emergency for acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Anti-Xa Activity of ENOXA 速 Versus LOVENOX 速 in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients included in this study with an acute coronary Syndrome be admitted to the emergency room and receive treatment with enoxaparin. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment in this indication is usually spread over a week. The experience of the study intends to focus only on the first injection administered in selected patients. Two assays are carried out, including an assessment of the anti-Xa activity initially before injection of enoxaparin, and 4 hours after administration of the first syringe. Clinical monitoring is intrahospital from the date of hospitalization of patients included until emergency exit (transfer to another service, or return home) Tolerance assessment (clinical and biological) is performed during follow-up.</detailed_description>
