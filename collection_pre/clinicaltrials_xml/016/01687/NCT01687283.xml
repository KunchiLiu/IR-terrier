	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group phase III local registration study for a treatment period of 12 weeks. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID in treatment of Chinese adult and adolescent patients with severe persistent asthma for a treatment period of 12 weeks versus budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID. The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Fluticasone Proponate Inhalation Solution in Adult and Adolescent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male or female subjects between 17 to 70 (inclusive) years of age with severe persistent asthma meeting the inclusion criteria and having completed the screening period of 2 weeks will, in a proportion of 1:1, randomly receive fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID or budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The clinic visit will be arranged at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks during study treatment. If the subjects meet the criteria of pre-defined asthma control at treatment 4 weeks or 8 weeks, they will have one chance to be treated with the half dose of study drug. 2 weeks after completion of study treatment or after early withdrawal from study, the follow-up visit will be performed to assess the post-treatment adverse events. The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12 week treatment period. Safety assessments include adverse events, vital signs, oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis, hematological, biochemical tests), 24-hour urinary cortisol and 12-lead ECG. The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chinese male or female outpatients aged &gt;=17 years and &lt;=70 years A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is premenarchal, postmenopausal), or Childbearing potential, has a negative urinary pregnancy test at screening and agrees to take contraceptive precautions (including abstinence) (referring to appendix 1: Highly Effective Methods For Avoidance Of Pregnancy In Women Of Childbearing Potential) which, in the opinion of the investigator are adequate to prevent pregnancy during the study. A documented clinical history of asthma for a period of at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 based on the Guidance of Asthma Management and Prevention 2008 in China (refer to appendix 2). Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200mL reversibility of FEV1 within 1530minutes following inhalation of 200400ug of salbutamol aerosol within 12 months prior to visit 1 or at the Screening Visit. Subjects have prebronchodilator FEV1% predicted between &gt;=40% and &lt;80% at visit 1. Subjects on a stable dose at least 2 weeks with high dose ICS (eg. Fluticasone Propionate 500ug twice daily or other ICS with equivalence doses, refer to Appendix 3) or moderate dose ICS plus LABA (eg. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmoterol 250/50ug , twice daily; or Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate in maintainance160/4.5ug, two inhalation, twice daily; or other product equivalence doses). Subjects and/or their legally acceptable representative (if applicable) is willing to give informed consent to participate in the study, and having ability to comply with study procedures (including patients can use Nebulizer correctly, be able to understand and complete the diary cards and be able to record their PEF using a peak flow meter). The subjects and/or their legally acceptable representative (if applicable) will need to give additional informed consent to be eligible for blood pharmacokinetic samplings. History of Lifethreatening asthma: Defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures. Bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study. A subject must not have current evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma. Subjects have any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study. Subjects will not b eligible for the runin if he/she has clinical visual evidence of candidias at visit 1. Current smoker or a smoking history of 10 pack years or more. A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars or pipe tobacco) within the past 3 months. Patients who are pregnant or lactating. Patients having any known or suspected hypersensitivity to corticosteroids or the excipients of study drug, including Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan monolaurate, Monosodium phosphate dehydrate, Dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous, Sodium Chloride and Water for Injection. Patients who have evidence of alcohol abuse. Patients who will have a preplanned surgery operation in 6 months. Liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;= 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) / bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Has QTc &gt;= 450 msec or &gt;= 480 msec for patients with bundle branch block at the time of screening. A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating Investigator, sub Investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating Investigator. No subject is permitted to perform night shift work from Visit 1 until completion of the study treatment period. Use of the following medications within the following time intervals prior to visit 1 or during the study: Medication / No use within the following time intervals prior to Screening (Visit 1) or at any time during the study Systemic or oral corticosteroids / 2 weeks Depot corticosteroids /12 weeks AntiIgE (e.g. Xolair)/ 12 weeks Oral longacting beta2agonists (e.g. bambuterol) and inhaled longacting beta2agonists (e.g. salmeterol, formoterol) or combination products containing inhaled longacting beta2agonists (e.g. Seretide, Symbicort) / 12 hours (the stable dose of ICS/LABA combination within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 could be continued during the runin period) Theophyllines, slowrelease bronchodilators, anticholinergics, ketotifen, nedocromil sodium, sodium cromoglycate, Antileukotrienes including suppressors of leukotriene production and antagonists / 1 day Inhaled shortacting beta2agonist / 4 hours (salbutamol will be supplied for rescue during the study) Potent Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors(e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconzole) / 4 weeks Prescription or over the counter medication that would significantly affect the course of asthma, or interact with sympathomimetic amines, such as: anticonvulsants (barbiturates, hydantoins, carbamazepine); polycyclic antidepressants; betaadrenergic blocking agents; phenothiazines and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors /1 day Chinese traditional medicines used for treatment of asthma and other allergic diseases / 1 week Any other investigational drug / 30 days or within 5 half lives, whichever is longer</criteria>
