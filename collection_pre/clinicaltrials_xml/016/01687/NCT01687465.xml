	<brief_summary>Lasers are important therapy in glaucoma. They are a pivotal point in treatment between medical and surgical care. Over the last 10 years a new laser has emerged as the usual laser treatment: Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). SLT works as well as the older laser used: argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT). However SLT has many theoretical benefits over ALT including causing less damage to the tissue it affects. One of the potential patient centered benefits of this laser is that it may be repeatable. It is even possible that the old laser ALT may be useable after an SLT treatment. This study aims to uncover whether repeat laser is possible after SLT and if so which laser is more effective (ALT vs SLT). The potential of repeating laser therapies may delay surgical treatment and its complications. Also understanding which laser to use will help eye doctors know how to treat their patients at this point of the disease.</brief_summary>
