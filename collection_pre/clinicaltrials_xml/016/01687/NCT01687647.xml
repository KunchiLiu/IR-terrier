	<brief_summary>Workers exposed to asbestos are at high risk of lung cancer. Medical follow-up of this population relies on repeated CT-scans which are more accurate for detection of peripheral lesions, and expose to X-rays and to risk of false-positives. Analysis of sputum using automate cytometry may be of interest in this population, alone or in combination with CT-scan. An ancillary study will evaluate the interest of blood predictive biomarkers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>High professional asbestos exposure Member of a former cohort recruited between 2000 and 2006 in Caen, Rouen and Le Havre (inclusion criteria: 5075 years at the time of initial recruitment, high intermittent asbestos exposure &gt;= 1 year, or high discontinuous asbestos exposure &gt;=10 years). All the living members of the cohort will be contacted: a maximum of 1000 subjects is expected, probably less.
