	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1: To investigate whether, in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) patients, the combination of sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine is safe and well tolerated Specific Aim 2: To investigate whether, in LAM patients, 6 months of combination therapy with sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine results in improvement of indicators of disease, and whether the gains are sustained after stopping therapy. Specific Aim 3: To investigate the potential role of a LAM-specific peripheral blood signature to predict rates of disease progression and determine responsiveness to combination therapy. This will be a phase I dose escalation study of the combination of sirolimus (2 mg adjusted to keep trough levels between 5-15 ng/ml) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg or 400 mg) taken orally daily. Up to 18 adult women with LAM will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
