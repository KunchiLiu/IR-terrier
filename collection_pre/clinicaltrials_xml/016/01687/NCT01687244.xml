	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of INSTILADRIN (rAd-IFN with Syn3) when given intravesically to patients with high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who are refractory to or have relapsed from BCG therapy. The pharmacodynamics of INSTILADRIN will also be studied by measuring the interferon (IFNα2b) levels excreted in the urine. rAd-IFN is a non-replicating recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vector encoding the interferon alpha-2b (IFNα2b) gene. Syn 3 is clinical surfactant excipient which enhances the ability of the adenoviral vector to transfect cells in the bladder wall.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Criteria for Evaluation: Efficacy: A Response is defined as no evidence of recurrence of a high grade tumor by cystoscopy, cytology or if clinically indicated, biopsy. Safety: The safety and tolerability of INSTILADRIN will be evaluated based on adverse event reports, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory values and results of physical examination.</detailed_description>

Female subjects of childbearing potential must use maximally effective birth control during the period of therapy, must be willing to use contraception for 1 month following the last study drug infusion and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test upon entry into this study. Otherwise, female subjects must be postmenopausal (no menstrual period for a minimum of 12 months) or surgically sterile. 10. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or willing to use a double barrier contraception method upon enrollment, during the course of the study, and for 1 month following the last study drug infusion. 11.
