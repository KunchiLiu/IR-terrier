	<brief_summary>Functional dyspepsia is a very common medical condition, which occurs in up to 30% of people in the community. However, results of current pharmacological treatment on functional dyspepsia are unsatisfactory. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic that has been used in treatment of non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In particular, bloating and abdominal pain was improved by rifaximin treatment in this group of IBS patients. Whilst there is considerable overlap in symptoms of functional dyspepsia and IBS, the investigators test whether rifaximin is also effective in curing post-prandial distress symptoms related to dyspepsia.</brief_summary>
