	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib when given together with ipilimumab in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors or other sarcomas that cannot be removed by surgery or have spread to other places in the body. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving dasatinib together with ipilimumab may be a better treatment for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors or other sarcomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors or Other Sarcomas That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with ipilimumab in combination with dasatinib in subjects with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and other advanced sarcomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, immune-related response criteria, and Choi criteria. II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6months). IV. Overall survival (OS). V. Immunological correlative studies. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib. Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days. Patients then receive dasatinib PO QD and ipilimumab intravenously (IV) once on weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10. Beginning on week 24, patients then receive dasatinib PO QD and ipilimumab IV once every 12 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3 months.</detailed_description>
