	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to confirm that Ulinastatin is a safe and effective drug and it can reduce the incidence of postoperative hepatic failure in HCC patients. To evaluate that Ulinastatin can improve survival in HCC patients or not.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ulinastatin Preventing Postoperative Hepatic Failure in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a serious disease with high incidence at home and abroad, still shows a rising trend. Postoperative hepatic failure remains a major reason of liver resection's failure. • As broad spectrum of enzyme inhibitors, Ulinastatin has the valid therapeutical effect of hepatic failure and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal experiment. And it restrain inflammatory mediator to release. But it's lack of clinical evidence that Ulinastatin reduce the incidence of postoperative hepatic failure in HCC patients The purpose of the study is to assess the effort for comparing Ulinastatin's drug protection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for postoperative hepatic failure and to evaluate that Ulinastatin can improve survival in HCC patients or not.</detailed_description>
