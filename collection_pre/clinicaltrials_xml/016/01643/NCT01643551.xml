	<brief_title>Neuron Specific Enolase in Ventricular Assist Device Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients eligible for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) typically have severe heart failure, which is characterized by poor cardiac output. The relatively abrupt increase in cardiac output that follows implant of a LVAD may cause reperfusion injury. Furthermore, selected patients may have particularly severe consequences of such injury, including refractory acidosis and vasoplegia. Neuron specific enolase (NSE) has been established as a biomarker of reperfusion injury. We hypothesize that changes in NSE following LVAD will be greater than the changes in NSE noted in a control population of patients undergoing non-VAD cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
