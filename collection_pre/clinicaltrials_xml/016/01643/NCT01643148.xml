	<brief_summary>Objective: Evaluate body mass index (BMI), leptin, Leptin/adiponectin (L/A) ratio and cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 together as reliable biomarkers for breast cancer. Patients: Consecutive patients aged between 40 - 60 years, with breast disease and informed consent. Interventions: Patients' Anthropometric and laboratorial characteristics classified by BMI in the group of cancer and patients with benign breast disease as well as biochemical tests of leptin, adiponectin,CA 15-3, hemoglobin, glucose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels were obtained as well as a blood sample to analyze CA 15-3 levels with a electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Hypothesis: Using together leptin, L/A ratio, CA 15-3 and BMI could offer a reliable approach to detect high risk women to develop breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Serum levels of leptin, adiponectin and CA 15-3, as well as anthropometric and biochemical parameters were analyzed in 88 female patients attending mammography study. Predictive values of BMI, leptin, L/A ratio and CA 15-3 were determined with 95% confidence interval (CI).</detailed_description>
