	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will allow us to examine how quickly and to what extent plasma amino acids levels rise after ingesting a single dose of either whey or albumin protein. The investigators anticipate that the amino acids from albumin concentrate protein will rise as quickly and to the same extent as amino acids from whey protein. These findings will help us to understand the biological availability of these proteins and efficacy of the supplement so that consumers may be presented with nutritional options.</brief_summary>
