	<brief_summary>Screening studies for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) in 65 to 79 years aged men, have shown a significant reduction in AAA related mortality. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of screening for AAA in men in the Netherlands has been demonstrated by using a Markov model. Screening might be even more (cost-) effective if targeted on high risk groups, such as patients with a particular cardiovascular disease with a known increased risk of having an AAA. Project SCAN (Screening CardioVascular patients for Aortic aNeurysms) is a project focused on targeted AAA screening to proactively diagnose patients at high risk of having an aneurysm that eventually may rupture. This pilot project aims to study the value of a screening protocol in daily practice to detect AAA's in high risk patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Offering PAD and CAD patients a non-invasive abdominal ultrasound after a careful process of shared-decision making 2. Recording data on aneurysm detection on all PAD and CAD patients screened: 1. General information (age, gender) 2. Medical history on CardioVascular risk factors (such as smoking history, hypertension, and other cardiovascular medical conditions - only information that is already recorded in the patient's medical history chart) 3. AAA - Yes/ No (Yes if ≥3 cm AAA) 4. If ≥3 cm aneurysm, record exact size and outcome in time (surveillance, treatment, no treatment) 5. If treated, record treatment type (EVAR or Open) and outcome</detailed_description>
