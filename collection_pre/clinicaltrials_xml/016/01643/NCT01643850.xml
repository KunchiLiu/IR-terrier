	<brief_summary>This study, designed as a proof of concept study of MCS110 in pigmented villonodular synovitis, will assess the clinical response to MCS110 treatment in Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) and Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCTTS) patients after multiple intravenous doses of MCS110 using magnetic resonance imaging to assess tumor volume, and to evaluate pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability in this population.</brief_summary>
