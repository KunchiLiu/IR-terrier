	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this trial is to compare prospectively stent opening of Supera (IDEV Technologies) versus a reference stent (LifeStent, Bard Medical) using C-arm CT. A secondary goal is to correlate stent opening with stent patency as documented by Doppler ultrasound at one year post implantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Patient (or legally authorized representative) must give a written informed consent. Symptomatic peripheralartery disease with moderate or severe intermittent claudication and failure of medical treatment (Rutherford stage 2,3) or chronic critical limb ischemia with pain while the patient is at rest (Rutherford stage 4) or chronic critical limb ischemia with ischemic ulcers (Rutherford stage 5, 6) and stenosis of more than 70 percent or occlusion of the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery with a targetlesion length of ≥ 8 and ≤ 20 cm and at least one patent (less than 50 percent stenosed) tibioperoneal runoff vessel (TASC A,B,C lesions)25. Proximal popliteal artery is defined as the popliteal artery above the joint line. The distal portion of the lesion should be located at least 4 cm above the joint line and the distal end of the stent 2 cm above the joint line. ABI ≤ 0.9 at rest. ToeBrachial Index (TBI) may be used if ABI is inadequate. Lesion with a calcification percentage of at least 25% based on CTA evaluation (within 6 months of patient enrolment) Acute critical limb ischemia Untreated inflow disease of the ipsilateral pelvic arteries (more than 50 percent stenosis or occlusion). Renal failure, creatinine clearance &lt; 50 µmol /l Severe allergy to iodine contrast Patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders or patients who cannot receive anticoagulation or antiplatelet aggregation therapy Lesions &lt; 8 and &gt; 20 cm in length Calcification volume of less than 25%</criteria>
