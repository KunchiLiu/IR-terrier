	<brief_summary>Hematology-oncology patients may require frequent lumbar puncture for diagnosis, assessment and therapy. When LP is difficult, the patient may endure multiple attempts, prolonged anesthesia time, and with failure of LP may require fluoroscopy-guidance with associated radiation exposure. This investigation will evaluate lumbar punctures performed in the intraoperative setting by oncologists with ultrasound guidance performed by the anesthesiologist in the leukemic pediatric population. The investigators hypothesis is that anesthesiologist guided ultrasound assistance will decrease intraoperative time, number of attempts and need to have the procedure done with fluoroscopy minimizing radiation exposure.</brief_summary>
