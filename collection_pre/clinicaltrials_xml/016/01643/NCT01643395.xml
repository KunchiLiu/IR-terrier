	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to prove the efficacy of vertebroplasty in patients suffering from acute non osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Vertebroplasty consists in the injection of cement (PMMA) in the damaged vertebral body to prevent further collapse. Our study will compare vertebroplasty versus conservative therapy (brace).</brief_summary>
