	<brief_summary>For distal sciatic nerve block this prospective, randomised comparison with ultrasound guided distal subepineural block tested the hypothesis, that intraepineural injection of local anesthetic using nerve stimulation technique is common and associated with high success rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Distal Sciatic Nerve Block - a Comparison With Nerve Stimulator Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Classical methods for nerve localization (loss of resistance, cause of paresthesias, nerve stimulation technique)assumed that the target is a close approximation to the nerve, without epineural perforation. Intraneural injections were considered as evitable, with high risk for nerve damages. Ultrasound guidance provided for the first time a real-time visualization of the spread of local anesthetic. Some recent studies proved, that an intraneural injection using nerve stimulator technique is common and not necessarily accompanied with nerve damages. In the ultrasound group (group US) the investigators tested the hypothesis, that an intraneural injection of local anesthetic generate a high success rate and a short onset time without clinical apparent nerve damages. In the nerve-stimulation group (group NS) the investigators tested the hypothesis, that an intraneural injection of local anesthetic is common, and in case of intraneural injection accompanied likewise with high success rate and shorter onset time. For the sciatic division the investigators tested the hypothesis, that classical methods of nerve localization (nerve-stimulation technique, cause of paresthesias) are not able to avoid epineural perforation.</detailed_description>
