	<brief_summary>Endonase, a kind of protease, is known to cause both extensive degradation of mucins and a reduction in mucus viscosity. As part of the search for more effective forms of therapy against H. pylori when it colonizes not only the surface of the surface mucosal cells but also the surface mucous gel layer covering the mucosal surface of the stomach. The investigators decided to investigate whether or not endonase might have additive effect of pronase on the efficacy of the second-line eradication therapy against Helicobacter pylori.</brief_summary>
