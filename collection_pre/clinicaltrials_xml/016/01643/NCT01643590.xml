	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of using JVS-100 to treat heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of JVS-100 Administered to Adults With Ischemic Heart Failure.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>90 subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy will be randomized to receive a single dose of 15 or 30 mg of JVS-100 or matching placebo. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either placebo, 15 mg or 30 mg of JVS-100. Subjects will be monitored overnight for 18-24 hours post dose and have scheduled visits at 3 days post-injection for safety evaluations. All subjects will be scheduled for follow-up visits at approximately 30 days (1 month), 120 days (4 months), and 360 days (12 months) to assess safety and cardiac function.</detailed_description>
