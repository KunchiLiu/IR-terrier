	<brief_summary>A comparison of pulse wave characteristics, as measured by peripheral tonometry, in pre and post Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulse Wave Analysis in Advanced Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulse waveforms, especially central pressure waveforms, are predictive of cardiovascular events. Peripheral waveforms have been correlated to central waveforms. Peripheral waveforms can be easily measured through applanation tonometry. In this study the investigators hypothesize: 1. That previously established peripheral tonometry techniques would apply to patients with advanced heart failure, including continuous flow LVADs and facilitate serial evaluation of central hemodynamics without invasive monitoring. 2. That temporary changes in LVAD speed will be evident in frequency spectrum analysis of peripheral, non-invasive waveforms. 3. That clinical events involving LVAD will have characteristic frequency spectra.</detailed_description>
