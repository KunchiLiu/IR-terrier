	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study was to develop an interactive Internet-based program (WeBREATHe: Web-Based Respiratory Education About Tobacco and Health) to train pediatric respiratory therapists and nurses to provide brief, hospital-based tobacco cessation interventions to parents of pediatric patients. The WeBREATHe program was based on a Phase I prototype which was evaluated with 50 pediatric respiratory therapists and nurses. In Phase II, the investigators redesigned and expanded the program with input from 50 educators, nurses and respiratory therapists from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Then the investigators evaluated the Phase II program in a randomized trial in which 215 respiratory therapists and nurses from two large, urban children's hospitals were randomly assigned within hospital to either the Intervention (Training) Condition, or to a Delayed Treatment (Training) Control condition. Participants' demographic and tobacco use history were measured at baseline, and tobacco cessation intervention behaviors, attitudes, knowledge, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy regarding delivery of a tobacco cessation intervention were measured at baseline, 1 week post-training, and at 3 months post-training. User satisfaction measures were also collected at 1 week post-training from Intervention Condition participants. The investigators hypothesized that participants in the Intervention Condition would have increased tobacco cessation behaviors, positive attitudes and self-efficacy, and decreased perceived barriers than participants i the Delayed-Treatment Control Condition. Following evaluation, the investigators developed a final version of the interactive training program and created the administrative infrastructure for a marketable product.</brief_summary>
