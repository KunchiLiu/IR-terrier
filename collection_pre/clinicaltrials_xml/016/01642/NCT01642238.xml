	<brief_title>Antithrombotic Effects of Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HORIZONS-AMI Trial compared the effectiveness of heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) versus bivalirudin in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing stent deployment 1. Overall the data showed benefits associated with the bivalirudin treatment with lower rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, re-infarction and non-CABG related major bleeding; However, the data seems to indicate a non-significant increase in acute stent thrombosis in the bivalirudin group. This observation seems to suggest the potential benefits of adding an antiplatelet agent to bivalirudin. A study by Dangas G et al found that in the HORIZONS-AMI patients, the group receiving 600 mg loading-dose of clopidogrel had significantly lower 30-day unadjusted rates of mortality, reinfarction and stent thrombosis than the 300 mg loading-dose group, without increase in bleeding rate. Furthermore, even though the benefits of bivalirudin were independent of the clopidogrel loading dose; the 600mg LD was associated with more benefits with both anticoagulation regimens. Similar observations have been reported in the ARMYDA-6 MI study. It is our hypothesis that using ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel, given its more potent and faster activity, would have greater antithrombotic activity and therefore may reduce the rate of acute stent thrombosis when administered in combination with bivalirudin + ASA in AMI patients. To investigate this hypothesis, we will compare the antithrombotic effects of ticagrelor with clopidogrel, when administered in combination with ASA and bivalirudin, in healthy human volunteers using a cross-over study design. The antithrombotic activity will be assessed pre-treatment and 2-hours and 24-hours post treatment, using methodologies including Badimon Perfusion chamber, VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, platelet aggregation with Multiplate Analyzer and Thromboelastography.</detailed_description>
