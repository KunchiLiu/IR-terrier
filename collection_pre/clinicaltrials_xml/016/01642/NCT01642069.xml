	<brief_summary>This laboratory study is looking into genes in samples from younger patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). Studying samples of blood, tissue, and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in RNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective: Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Cryopreserved mRNA Study Population Description: Samples from AAML0531 Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether NUP98/JARID1A expression is a recurrent translocation in NUP98-rearranged cases in pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). II. To screen the Children Oncology Group (COG) samples for genetic aberrations in pediatric AMKL. OUTLINE: Cryopreserved specimens are analyzed for NUP98 fusion to NSD1, JARID1A, and TOP1, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearrangements, and other gene expression profiling by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results are then compared with each patient's outcome data.</detailed_description>
