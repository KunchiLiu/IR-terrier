	<brief_summary>Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common course of cognitive decline and thereby the course of more than half of all cases of dementia. A proper AD diagnosis is rested on a number of examinations and tests, which combined can make AD diagnosis likely. But no single test or examination can unambiguous determine whether the patient has AD or not. Comparatively no examination or test can with accuracy predict whether a healthy person or a person with only mild cognitive (MCI)impairment in time will evolve AD. Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, linear CT analyses and Timed Up and Go - Dual Task (TUG-DT) are relatively inexpensive and and widely available diagnostic methods, which have the potential to diagnose AD at an early stage in a reliable accurate way. But they also have the potential to predict which patients diagnosed with MCI have particular risk of developing dementia. The purpose of the study is to investigate the relations between qEEG, CSF biomarkers, CT analyses and TUG-DT outcome and clinical features in healthy persons as well as patients with MCI and AD Furthermore to investigate whether qEEG or CSF biomarkers can predict which patients with MCI will in time evolve AD.</brief_summary>
