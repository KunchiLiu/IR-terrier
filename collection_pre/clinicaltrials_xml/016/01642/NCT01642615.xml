	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Dexlansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules for Healing of Erosive Esophagitis and Maintenance of Healed Erosive Esophagitis and Relief of Heartburn in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being tested to treat adolescents who have erosive esophagitis and heartburn and maintenance of healing of EE. The study planned to enroll approximately 60 patients. The study consisted of 3 periods: 1. Screening ((21 [+5] days) 2. Treatment (8 weeks for healing, 16 weeks for maintenance), 3. Post-Treatment Follow-up (up to 3 months). During screening, participants used an electronic diary (eDiary) daily to document the presence of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms and the degree to which heartburn hurt (hereinafter referred to as severity), and to record their use of rescue medication (antacid). During the first 8 week treatment period, all participants received dexlansoprazole 60 mg, once daily (QD). At the Week 8 visit, participants underwent endoscopy to assess healing of EE. Participants whose EE had not healed were discontinued from the study. Participants whose EE had healed were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - dexlansoprazole 30 mg QD - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants were asked to take one tablet each morning without regard to food throughout the study. Throughout both phases of the Treatment Period, all participants continued to use the eDiary to document the presence or absence and severity of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms and the use of rescue medication. This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study was 39 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone during the study</detailed_description>

The participant has a medical history of symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) for at least 3 months prior to Screening (signed informed consent form and assent, if applicable) as assessed by the investigator. 4. The participant has met the electronic diary qualification criteria as assessed by the electronic daily diary defined as follows: heartburn (burning or hurting in your throat, chest, or stomach) on at least 3 of 7 days.(Note: if an endoscopy done within 1 week of signing informed consent and assent is used to confirm diagnosis of EE, the subject does not need to meet this criterion). 5. The participant has endoscopic evidence of EE (LA Grade AD) based on the screening endoscopy. 6. The participant is male or female and aged 12 to 17 years, inclusive. 7. A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent and assent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after last dose of study medication. 8. A female participant of childbearing potential who is or may become sexually active agrees to routinely use adequate contraception from the time of signing the informed consent and assent until 30 days after the last dose of study medication. 1. Participant has evidence of cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, metabolic, endocrine or gastrointestinal disease, or serious allergy, asthma, or allergic skin rash that suggests clinically significant, uncontrolled underlying disease or condition (other than the disease being studied), which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 2.
