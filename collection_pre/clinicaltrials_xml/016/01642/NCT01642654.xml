	<brief_summary>Objectives: The purpose of this research was to assess modifications caused by a concurrent water exercise program on plasma nitrite (NO3), cerebral vascular resistance and cholesterol in the elderly and analyze the correlations between these variables after intervention. Methods The sample was composed of 40 women mean age 69,21 Â±5,27 years old, divided into an intervention (WG) and control group (CG). It was to measure nitrite concentration (NO3) by the Griess reaction; internal cerebral arteries were assessed by Doppler ultrasound to determine the resistivity index and Cholesterol was determined using the colorimetric enzymatic method and test kit. Intervention with water exercise program consisted of three weekly sessions for 16 weeks.</brief_summary>
