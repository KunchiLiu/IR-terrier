	<brief_title>OBS in Adolescent and Adults With EOE: A Phase II, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Study With an Open Label Extension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory disorder of the esophagus and is a recognized clinical entity. Symptoms include feeding problems, heartburn, regurgitation, vomiting, abdominal pain and food impaction. The symptoms of EoE may be similar to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but do not resolve with gastric acid suppression. EoE is defined histologically as the presence of &gt; 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high power fields on one or more esophageal biopsy specimens. This Phase II study is comparing oral budesonide (OBS) to placebo to demonstrate that OBS induces a histologic response and a symptom response using a Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire over a 16 week course of therapy.</detailed_description>
