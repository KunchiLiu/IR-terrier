	<brief_summary>The goal of the Optimum Omega-3 (OO3) Diet Study is to assess whether swapping specific food ingredients in diets can significantly change omega-3 blood profiles with 10 weeks of a 7-day menu in men and women (18-40 years old). We want to look at the effect on a person's response to cognition, satiety and physical fitness. Investigators think that low omega-6 and moderate omega-3 fatty acid diets may regulate emotional response and help to return to normal after load carrying activities. We plan to test the effects of improving overall fatty acids on emotional response, satiety, and physical fitness levels by a diet with an improved omega-3 to omega-6 diet compared to a control diet.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of the Optimum Omega-3 (OO3) Diet Study is to assess whether swapping specific food ingredients in components of US Military Garrison diet can significantly change blood profiles of n-3 HUFAs (highly unsaturated fatty acids) from baseline with 10 weeks of a 7-day menu in men and women (18-40 years old), and its effect on a person's response to cognitive measures, satiety and physical fitness (Adjunct Studies). The Department of Defense is interested in strategies to improve body composition of n-3 HUFAs and whether such strategies help people respond better emotionally. It is felt that low omega-6 and moderate omega-3 fatty acid diets may improve the regulation of emotional responses, and may accelerate return of muscle strength and lower limb range of motion after fatiguing exercise such as walking while carrying a heavy load. We plan to test the effects of improving overall fatty acids on cognitive response, satiety, and physical fitness levels by substituting all chicken meat, eggs, beef, oil and other ingredients in 7 days of 3 meals plus snacks with like products that have low omega-6 PUFA (and/or enhanced omega-3 PUFA) in comparison with a control diet in which the ingredients have not been replaced.</detailed_description>
