	<brief_summary>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain. The primary aim of this study is to describe the soft tissue and bony structural ultrasound (US) findings identified in the lateral hip and iliotibial band (ITB) in patients presenting with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in an outpatient rheumatology clinic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GTPS, widely known as trochanteric bursitis, encompasses a spectrum of disorders (gluteal tendinopathy, tears, bursitis, and ITB syndrome) that are difficult to distinguish by clinical exam alone. Better understanding of US imaging characteristics in relation to clinical symptoms may be helpful in identifying those patients who would most benefit from corticosteroid injections and other non-operative treatment options. Point-of-care musculoskeletal US use has been shown to reduce repeated hospital appointments, improve accuracy of diagnosis, and provide expedited treatment, thus improving quality of care in an outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. US assessment is not routinely included in the management of GTPS patients and ideal imaging modalities are not established.</detailed_description>
