	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Levamisole Combined With Cyclosporine A in Patients With Classic Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis, Patients may be at high risk of thrombosis and may develop bone marrow failure or aplastic anemia, with low white blood cell and platelet counts,because the manifestation and pathologic processes are complicate,the treatment is very difficult,this study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Levamisole combined with cyclosporine A in patients with classic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</detailed_description>
