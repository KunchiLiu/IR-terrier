	<criteria>For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com Men and women ≥18 years of age Subjects with histologically or cytologicallydocumented squamous cell NSCLC who present with Stage IIIB/IV disease or with recurrent or progressive disease following multimodal therapy (radiation therapy, surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced disease) Disease recurrence or progression during/after one prior platinum doubletbased chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease Measurable disease by computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 A formalin fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or unstained slides of tumor sample (archival or recent) must be available for biomarker evaluation. Specimens must be received by the central lab prior to randomization. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient Subjects with untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are treated and subjects are neurologically returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization Prior therapy with antiProgrammed death1 (PD1), antiProgrammed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1), antiProgrammed cell death ligand 2 (PDL2), antiCD137, or antiCytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways) Prior treatment on the first line study CA184104 first line NSCLC study Prior treatment with Docetaxel Subjects with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drugrelated pulmonary toxicity Treatment with any investigational agent within 14 days of first administration of study treatment</criteria>
