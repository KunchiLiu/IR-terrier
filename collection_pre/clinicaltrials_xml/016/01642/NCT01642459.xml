	<brief_title>The Outcomes of Arteriovenous Fistula Cannulated From Different Direction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred access for hemodialysis, and cannulation technique is very important factors affect the outcomes of AVF. Rope-ladder cannulation is one kind of the standard puncture techniques which is used commonly in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. There are many complications for rope-ladder cannulation, such as venous aneurysm and vascular stenosis, which may induce AVF dysfunction. For the venous outflow way, there always be aneurysm followed by stenoses at the sites of needle connected with the arterial line in rope-ladder cannulation patients. The investigators hypothesis that the directions of inserted arterial needles should affect the AVF outcomes. The present prospective study will compare the outcomes of AVF between the puncture direction at arterial needle sites same as blood flow and opposite to blood flow.</detailed_description>
