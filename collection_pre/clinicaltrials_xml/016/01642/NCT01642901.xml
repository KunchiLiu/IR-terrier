	<brief_summary>Maintenance of bone mass following spinal cord injury (SCI) is essential to fracture prevention and the associated morbidity of bed rest and further secondary complications. Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid (ZA) is an FDA-approved drug that has been shown to be more effective than other agents in reducing bone mass resorption and leg fractures in post-menopausal women, but has not been studied in patients with acute SCI. This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IV ZA to prevent bone loss early after SCI. Up to 48 subjects will be randomized to receive a one-time dose of 5 mg of IV ZA versus placebo within 21 days of an SCI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Maintenance of bone mass following spinal cord injury (SCI) is essential to fracture prevention and the associated morbidity of bed rest and further secondary complications. Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid (ZA) has been shown to be more effective than other agents in reducing bone mass resorption and fracture of the legs in post-menopausal women, but has not been studied in acute spinal cord injury. Two previous studies of ZA in persons with subacute SCI, while promising, were inconclusive. As stated in the long range plan of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), one goal in the area of health and function is to "focus on the onset of new conditionsâ€¦exacerbation of existing conditions, or the development of coexisting conditions." This study is intended to demonstrate reduction in loss of bone mass at the hip and knee regions in acute SCI in a rigorous study of sufficient size to determine effectiveness of our intervention.</detailed_description>
