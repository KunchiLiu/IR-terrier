	<brief_summary>The number of long-term cancer survivors is growing. As a result, treatment-related morbidity - such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, functional decline and fatigue - is impacting quality of life and impairing survival. Metabolic syndrome in the general population is currently treated with lifestyle advice to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce caloric intake. This approach is still underused as standard care for cancer survivors. The aim of this study is investigate whether a tailored PA program that starts early (during curative chemotherapy with cardiovascular toxic potential) is superior in terms of reducing long-term cancer-treatment-related metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular morbidity to a program that starts late (after completion of chemotherapy).</brief_summary>
