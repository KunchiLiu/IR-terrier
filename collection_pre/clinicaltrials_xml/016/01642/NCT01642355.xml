	<brief_summary>The objective of IMPACT (Investigation of Motivational Interviewing and Prevention Consults to Achieve Cardiovascular Targets) is to determine the best management strategy for patients undergoing cardiovascular intervention. IMPACT is a prospective randomized trial that will enroll 400 patients post-cardiovascular intervention. The study will compare different cardiovascular prevention strategies: (1) usual care, (2) cardiovascular prevention consult, and (3) cardiovascular prevention consult with a behavioral intervention program over a 6-month period. The trial hypothesis is that for patients undergoing a cardiovascular intervention, a prevention consult and behavioral intervention is superior to usual care in reducing cardiovascular risk. The primary endpoint will be non-HDL cholesterol. Secondary endpoints include other lipid values, metabolic risk, smoking cessation, physical activity, nutritional status, medication adherence and quality of life. IMPACT is scheduled to begin enrollment in the June of 2012.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Primary aim: The primary aim is that a targeted Cardiovascular Prevention consult will reduce non-HDL cholesterol compared to usual care at 6 months post-intervention. Secondary aim: The secondary aim is that a targeted Cardiovascular Prevention consult plus a behavioral intervention will reduce non-HDL cholesterol compared to usual care at 6 months post-intervention.</detailed_description>
