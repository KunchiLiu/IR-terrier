	<brief_summary>There is no consensus about the optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhotic portal hypertension, While this group of patients are classified as hepatectomy contraindication according to guidelines from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). With improvement of surgical technique, preoperative evaluation, and perioperative management,especially the Precise Hepatectomy Technique, more and more studies confirmed the safety of surgical intervention to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension.However, most of the previous studies were either retrospective or with small samples. The investigators project is a prospective randomized controlled trial, planning to compare the safety, efficacy and quality of life between precise hepatectomy and combined interventional treatment on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhotic portal hypertension, to make a further understanding of optimal strategy.</brief_summary>
