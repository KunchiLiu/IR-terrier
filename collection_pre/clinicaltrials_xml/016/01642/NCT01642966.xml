	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated, crossover study. Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) subjected to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), are randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to either ticagrelor 90mg x2 or prasugrel 10mg x1 for 15 days. At Day 15± 2 days, coronary diastolic blood flow velocity in left anterior descending artery (LAD) is evaluated at baseline (bCBFV) and under 2 min adenosine infusions (maximal diastolic CBFV- maxCBFV) at gradually increasing doses of 50μg/kg/min, 80μg/kg/min, 110μg/kg/min and 140μg/kg/min with at least 5 min recovery intervals between infusions. A crossover directly to the alternate treatment is performed followed by the same evaluation at Day 30±2 days .</brief_summary>
