	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (Enoxalow® - T) pharmacodynamics parameters are similar to the comparator drug (Clexane® - C) in healthy subjects following administration of single intravenous dose. The objective of this randomized, crossover, clinical trial is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile of the test drug Enoxalow® - T produced by Blau Farmacêutica, compared to the comparator drug Clexane®, produced by Sanofi-Aventis, by determining pharmacodynamic activities (including anti FXa and anti-FIIa), as surrogate markers for their circulating concentrations of the drug.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition other pharmacodynamic tests such as Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) activity, as well as the ratio of anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity will be compared as secundary obectives.</detailed_description>
