	<brief_summary>The aim of these studies is to firstly determine the pharmacokinetic profile of orally administered enteric coated sodium propionate. Subsequently, the most efficacious dose at improving glucose tolerance following an oral glucose challenge will be determined. The investigators will then determine the mechanism of action of propionate, whether it acts by altering beta cell function directly or by augmenting the incretin effect or both</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHS spends £1M per hour, 10% of its yearly budget, treating diabetes. In the UK cases of diabetes are expected to top 4 million by 2025. There is an urgent need for new therapies. The short chain fatty acid propionate is a natural substance produced by digestion of fermentable carbohydrates. Preclinical and early human data demonstrate it improves pancreatic function and glucose control. The investigators aim to conduct proof of principle studies to determine if oral delivery of propionate improves glucose control in patients at risk of developing diabetes.</detailed_description>
