	<brief_summary>Meibum lipids are modified in patients with MGD, resulting in tear instability, evaporative dry eye, and eyelid inflammation. These changes add to corneal damages and exacerbate ocular symptoms, which are all associated with the constant release of inflammatory mediators. To our knowledge, there has been no study on tear cytokine levels in MGD patients treated with topical loteprednol etabonate. The investigators, thus, evaluated both inflammatory tear cytokine levels and corresponding clinical outcomes for analyzing the efficacy of topical loteprednol etabonate in moderate and severe MGD. The aim of this research was to determine the concentration of inflammatory tear cytokines in patients with MGD and to compare the changes in tear cytokine levels between topical loteprednol etabonate and warm compress treatment group and warm compress only treatment group.</brief_summary>
