	<brief_title>Post-marketing Surveillance Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of Abiraterone Acetate Among Adult Filipino Male Patients With Advanced Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), observational study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate in male Filipino patients with advanced metastatic CRPC who have received prior chemotherapy containing a taxane. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled. Abiraterone acetate will be administered according to the approved product insert with a low-dose glucocorticoid (prednisone or prednisolone).
