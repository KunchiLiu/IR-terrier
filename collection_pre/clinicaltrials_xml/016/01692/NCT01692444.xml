	<brief_summary>Airway remodelling is an abnormal tissue repair following bronchial inflammation, which contributes to none reversible pathological features, such as bronchial and peri-bronchial fibrosis. It also influences the prognosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and its mechanisms remain largely unknown. The role of fibrocytes has been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of asthma, lung fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension. However, the recruitment of blood fibrocytes and their involvement in COPD airway remodelling remain unknown. The main objective of the study is to analyse the distribution and quantify the number of the peri-bronchial and blood circulating fibrocytes in patients with different stages of COPD compared to control subjects.</brief_summary>
