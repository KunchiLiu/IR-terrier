	<brief_summary>Large randomised trials have shown that cardiovascular medications prescribed to patients at high cardiovascular risk are effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events. Their use is recommended in the United Kingdom and international guidelines (e.g. the National Institute of Clinical Excellence). However, these medications do not prevent cardiovascular events in all patients and there is now a body of research investigating the effects of cardiovascular medications on outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI), including clinical presentation, infarct size and post-MI mortality. However, the independent effects of cardiovascular drugs on post-MI all cause mortality are unclear, and there are limitations to many of the published studies in terms of their cardiovascular drug exposure data. This project utilizes prospectively collected data on cardiovascular drug use, and links to MI data from hospital and mortality records.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients in GPRD practices which are deemed "up to standard" by GPRD criteria will be included if their practice agreed to be linked to the Myocardial Ischaemic National Audit Project (MINAP), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) datasets. Patients must have at least one year of GPRD "up to standard" registration before the date of first myocardial infarction. Age over 18. First myocardial infarction occurring between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2008, as recorded in the HES data or MINAP. Patients will be excluded if they do not fulfil one of the inclusion criteria.</criteria>
