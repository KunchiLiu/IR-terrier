	<brief_summary>Adequate perfusion and oxygenation is essential for the function of the inner retina. Although it is known that oxygen tension is very well autoregulated in the retina, the physiological mechanisms behind this regulation process are not fully explored. The development of new instruments for the non-invasive measurement of oxygen tension in retinal vessels now allows for the more precise investigation of these physiological processes. The current study seeks to evaluate the retinal oxygen saturation in healthy subjects while breathing different oxygen mixtures to achieve a hypoxic and a hyperoxic state.</brief_summary>
