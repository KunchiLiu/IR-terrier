	<brief_summary>To determine whether spa therapy has a beneficial effect on pain and disability in the management of shoulder pain due to chronic rotator cuff lesions, this multicentre randomized prospective clinical trial includes patients with shoulder pain due to chronic degenerative rotator cuff tendinopathy who attend French spa resorts as outpatients. Subjects are randomized into two groups: immediate spa therapy (18 days of standardized treatment) and control (spa therapy delayed for 6 months). All patients continue usual treatments during the 6-month follow-up period. The main endpoint is the mean change in the DASH score at 6 months. Secondary endpoints are the mean change in SF-36 components, treatments used, and tolerance. The effect size of spa therapy is calculated and the proportion of patients reaching minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) is compared between groups.</brief_summary>

Corticosteroid treatment for concomitant disease could be continued at a stable dose. Shoulder xrays within the previous 18 months were required in all cases. shoulder pain related to neurological or vascular disorders or neoplasms; referred pain from internal organs; systemic rheumatic conditions; inability to complete questionnaires because of cognitive impairment, or language difficulty; contraindication (immune deficiency, evolving cardiovascular conditions, cancer, infection, nonequilibrated diabetes mellitus) or intolerance to any aspect of spa treatment; spa treatment within the previous 6 months; steroid injection within the previous 3 months; physiotherapy in the previous month; changes in nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) administration within the previous 5 days or in other analgesic drug use within the previous 12 hours.</criteria>
