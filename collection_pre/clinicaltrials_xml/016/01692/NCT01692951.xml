	<brief_summary>Surgical removal of tumor at an early stage remains the primary treatment for most cancers. However, there is currently no reliable screening blood test for detection of lung, colon, or breast cancer. The Specific Aims are to: 1) assess the diagnostic accuracy of six FFA metabolites to detect lung and colon cancer in surgical patients; 2)determine the rate and extent to which FFA metabolites decrease over time after surgery for lung and colon cancer; and, 3)determine the positive and negative predictive values and overall test accuracy for diagnostic prostate and breast biopsies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>potential breast cancer patients who have early stages of breast cancer prior to surgery potential prostate cancer lung cancer colon cancer 1) Patients will be excluded from enrollment if they have severe liver disease (ALT three times the upper limit of normal). Patients will also be excluded who have taken aspirin or COX inhibitors within 48 hours of surgery. 2) Patients will be excluded if a pathologic diagnosis is already available,from a previous needle biopsy (coordinator will remain blinded). 3) Patients will be excluded have received preprocedure chemotherapy or radiotherapy</criteria>
