	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to improve the prognosis of the development of alcohol consumption by considering a variety of biological, psychological and social risk and protective factors. Therefore, young people who have been hospitalized due to acute alcohol intoxication within the past 5 to 12 years will be interviewed in order to assess aspects of healthy or impaired psychosocial development. The study will also include a control group of young adults who were in hospital due to other medical conditions. The identification of relevant cases will be based on medical records of several children's hospitals. These records will be analysed with regard to potential predictors of developmental hazards and protective factors.</brief_summary>
