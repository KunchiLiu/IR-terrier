	<brief_title>A Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of Rilpivirine Hydrochloride (Edurant) Among Adult Filipino Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-I Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the study medication), multi-center, observational (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes) study. The total duration of the study will be 3 years, and approximately 60 patients who would use rilpivirine hydrochloride in routine clinical practice with a dosing regimen stipulated in the product insert (ie, 25 mg once a day) will be enrolled. As this is an observational study, assessment of patients will be based on the accepted clinical practice in the Philippines. Patients will be monitored from baseline and throughout the 48-week (2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 24th, 36th and 48th weeks) treatment period of rilpivirine hydrochloride.</detailed_description>
