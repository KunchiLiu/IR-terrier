	<brief_title>A Post Marketing Surveillance Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of Prucalopride in the Treatment of Chronic Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 12-week open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center, prospective (the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study) observational study assessing the safety and effectiveness of prucalopride among Filipino patients with chronic constipation. Chronic constipation is a condition in which bowel movements are infrequent or incomplete for a prolonged time. The use of prucalopride should be used in accordance with the approved product label and will follow the normal medical practice of the investigators. Patients should take 2 mg prucalopride tablet orally once daily. For elderly patients (&gt;65 years old), patients with renal impairment not requiring dialysis or patients with severe hepatic impairment, 1mg prucalopride once daily should be given. Patients will be asked to fill-up a patient diary daily for 12-weeks to monitor the bowel movement during the study period. All adverse events and concomitant medications taken by the patients during the study will be documented accordingly. Patients will be monitored during the 12-week period of observation while the patients are in prucalopride treatment.</detailed_description>
