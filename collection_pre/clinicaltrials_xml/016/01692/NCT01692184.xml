	<detailed_description>Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the effect of a standard high-fat breakfast on the pharmacokinetics of AVL-292. Ten subjects will be enrolled to receive 2 single doses of 200 mg AVL-292, one with food (i.e., fed) and the other without (i.e., fasted), in a randomized sequence.</detailed_description>
