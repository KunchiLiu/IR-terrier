	<brief_summary>This research study is the first of its kind and will allow health care professionals and researchers to answer many questions about the reasons why anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury leads to knee pain and disability and osteoarthritis. We also hope that this study will be the beginning of new, more powerful and safer drugs to help patients with ACL injuries heal sooner and return to sports or daily activities pain free. Study participants will be recruited from the University of Kentucky and Vanderbilt University. The purpose of this research is to gather information on how safe and effective KenalogÂ® is in alleviating knee pain following ACL rupture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Treatment for Acute ACL Tear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injury to the knee during sports participation often involves partial of full detachment of the ACL. ACL tears cause pain, swelling and inflammation. While the swelling and inflammation usually goes away in time, individuals with ACL injuries may experience pain and notice knee instability (knee slipping, etc.). Often surgery can repair or replace the ACL within the joint, allowing individuals the ability to walk or run again pain free or participate in sports. Unfortunately, osteoarthritis of the knee, which also causes pain and swelling, can occur in that same knee 10-20 years later for reasons which are not well understood. In this research study, we hope to prevent and reduce the initial post-operative pain. The reduction of pain will allow for earlier movement of the knee joint and preparation for surgery. It may also reduce the risk to develop osteoarthritis in individuals with ACL injuries by treating them within 1-2 days after their injury.</detailed_description>
