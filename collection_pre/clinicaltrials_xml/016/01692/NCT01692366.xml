	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of daily oral doses of 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg SAR302503 and combined for the response rate defined with the â‰¥35% reduction of spleen volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI or computed tomography scan [CT] in patients with contraindications for MRI). Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety of SAR302503 for both pooled (300, 400, and 500mg) and individual doses population. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR302503 after single and repeat-dose. - To evaluate the effect on Myelofibrosis (MF)-associated symptoms (Key MF symptoms) as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF). - To evaluate the durability of splenic response. - To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on bone marrow with regard to changes on reticulin fibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study in Japanese Patients With Intermediate-2 or High Risk Primary Myelofibrosis, Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis, Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis With Splenomegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess eligibility (screening period 28 days), followed by a treatment period of at least 1 cycle (28 days) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue if patients are deriving benefit and do not have unacceptable toxicity or meet study withdrawal criteria.</detailed_description>
