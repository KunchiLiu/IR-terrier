	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of the proposed project is that after a fat overload, the postprandial response is different in both groups, suggesting that the LPP will present the most significant damage in endothelial vasomotion in obese individuals, especially those with GI and T2DM. After the fat overload, we hypothesized that there will be a worsening of endothelial function and microvascular reactivity in OB/DM2 and OB group compared to C, but also find lower concentrations of incretins in OB/DM2 group compared to other groups. These hypotheses may be confirmed by techniques for evaluating microvascular function, the use of DFT skin for vasomotion evaluation and finally analysis of analytes through metabolic and cardiovascular read by Multiplex kit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study About High Fat Meal and Postprandial Lipemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will be recruited 60 women aged 19-40 years, with a diagnosis of obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) treated at the obesity clinic at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)at Brazil. Microcirculation parameters and blood tests will be assessed at baseline and after this, the women will receive a high-fat meal containing croissant, salami, whole milk and cheddar cheese. After 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes this meal the microcirculation will be evaluated as well as blood collection.</detailed_description>
