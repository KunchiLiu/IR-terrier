	<brief_summary>To investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumour activity of AZD5363, as monotherapy, in patients with metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer. AZD5363 will be investigated in patients who have progressed after chemotherapy (Part A) and in patients who have progressed before receiving chemotherapy (Part B). Recruitment into Part A, Group 1 has been suspended. A new design for this group is currently being evaluated. Part A, group 2 patients (progressed after 1 or more 2nd generational anti-hormonal therapies) will receive AZD5363 480mg bid intermittently (4 days on/3days off). Part B will only start if there is evidence of anti-tumour activity along with AZD5363 having an acceptable safety profile in Part A. Part B will be conducted in pre-chemotherapy patients on a dose and schedule selected from Part A.</brief_summary>
