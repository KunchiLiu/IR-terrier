	<brief_summary>To compare retention rates of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab as first-line biotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to determine causes of discontinuation, retention-associated factors, and retention rates of possible second-line tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors (TNFi).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retention Rates of Adalimumab, Etanercept and Infliximab as First and Second-Line Biotherapy in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis in Daily Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this retrolective, multicentric study, medical charts of RA patients starting TNFi between March 2005 and April 2009 were reviewed, with follow-up between 2 and 6 years. The retention rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between TNFi was done after adjustment using a Cox model. Factors associated with better retention were identified by multivariate analysis. Medical charts of all patients with RA starting a first TNFα inhibitor therapy between March 1, 2005 (start of commercialization of adalimumab in France) and April 30, 2009 (allowing at least 2 years of follow-up) were systematically reviewed in detail by 2 rheumatologist investigators</detailed_description>
