	<brief_summary>To conduct a precision study to assess the microperimetry function of the Spectral OCT/SLO. The study will assess variability across measurements taken by three different operator-device configuration across clinical sites, variability between subjects within a given operator-device configuration, and variability within a subject for a single operator-device configuration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must be 21 years of age or older. Subjects recruited to Cohort 1 will have no known retinal disease except for refractive errors (7.5 D to +7.5 diopters).Subjects who are recruited to Cohort 2 will have one or more of the following retinal pathologies: early and intermediate AgeRelated Macular Degeneration, Geographic Atrophy, Diabetic Retinopathy (mild, moderate, severe), Macular Edema secondary to Diabetes, Retinal Vein Occlusion, Central Serous Retinopathy, Pattern Dystrophy, Epiretinal Membrane or Macular Hole. Subjects who have signed an informed consent form. Subjects who can comply with the protocol. Subjects younger than 21 years of age. Subjects who cannot comply with the protocol. Subjects who cannot complete the Simple Test procedures Subjects who are not available to be testing 3 times during the day (Morning, Mid Day, and Afternoon). Subjects with visual acuity worse than 20/100 (Best Corrected). Subjects with dense media opacities. Ocular surgery anticipated on the day of the study visit.</criteria>
