	<brief_summary>The study aims to: 1. Explore the properties of mesenchymal black spots, and to determine the value of mesenchymal black spots in diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). 2. Evaluate the incidences of gastric intraepithelial neoplasia and gastric cancer in patients with gastric mesenchymal black spot during CLE imaging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is confirmed to be a risk factor that may lead to the development of intestinal type gastric cancer. Previous study has shown that confocal laser endomicroscopy promising in the diagnosis of GIM. The investigators have found an elevated incidence of mesenchymal black spots in patients with GIM during previous CLE imaging. This study aims to explore the properties of mesenchymal black spots, and to determine the value of mesenchymal black spots in diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia by confocal laser endomicroscopy.</detailed_description>
