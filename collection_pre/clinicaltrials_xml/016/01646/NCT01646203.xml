	<brief_title>A Study of IMC-TR1 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first-in-human Phase 1 study of IMC-TR1.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Part A and Part B: Patients must be appropriate candidates for experimental therapy, with a solid tumor that has failed standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available, and evidence of progressive disease Part A only: Patients must have histological or cytological evidence of a solid tumor which is advanced and/or metastatic Part B only: Patient who have failed firstline therapy/standard of care and have histological or cytological evidence of a cancer type for which evidence of activity was observed during Part A or for which preclinical evidence of potential activity has been observed Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) Part A only: Patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable disease Part B: Patients must have measurable disease Have adequate organ function including: Hematologic, Hepatic, Albumin, Coagulation and Renal function Have a performance status of ≤ 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Have discontinued previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug Females with child bearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test and must not be breastfeeding Have an estimated life expectancy that is &gt; 3 months Have clinically significant cardiac disease, including: Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry, unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled hypertension Major electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities Major abnormalities documented by echocardiography with Doppler Have known predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of the ascending aorta or aortic stress Have QTc interval of &gt; 500 msec on screening ECG Have other known serious preexisting medical conditions Have received prior investigational therapy targeting TGFβ or its receptors Have a known sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies or other therapeutic proteins, to agents of similar biologic composition as IMCTR1 Have a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, active inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic steroid use Are currently using or has received a systemic thrombolytic agent within 28 days prior to enrollment Are receiving: â€¢ fulldose warfarin â€¢ intravenous heparin or lowmolecularweight heparin â€¢ chronic daily treatment with aspirin at a dose greater than 325 mg per day or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications known to inhibit platelet function Have evidence of retinal disease or are a monocular patient Have received a solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or untreated metastasis Have acute or chronic leukemia Have a known active fungal, bacterial, and/or viral infection including human immunodeficiency virus or viral hepatitis requiring treatment Has a positive fecal occult blood test within 14 days prior to enrollment</criteria>
