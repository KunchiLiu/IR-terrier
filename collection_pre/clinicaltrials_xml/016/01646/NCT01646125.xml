	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine if AUY922 had superior efficacy when compared to chemotherapy agents docetaxel or pemetrexed in patients whose tumor had EGFR mutations. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of AUY922, when administered i.v. on a once-weekly schedule at 70 mg/m2, versus docetaxel or pemetrexed in adult patients with advanced NSCLC, whose tumors harbored EGFR activating mutations, and had developed resistance to EGFR TKI.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced (stage IIIB who are not amenable to combined modality treatment) or recurrent or metastatic (Stage IV) nonsmall cell lung cancer. 2. Patients must have EGFR gene mutation in their tumors. This can be source documented by one of the following: • Provide a pathology report that indicates the patient's tumor had EGFR activating mutation in the past. Or: • Perform testing (local or central) in an archival tumor or a fresh baseline biopsy tumor tissue to show the presence of EGFR activating mutation. 3. Patients must have documented clinical benefit (CR, PR, or patients with SD for 6 months or greater) on prior EGFR TKI (e.g. erlotinib or gefitinib) followed by documented progression according to RECIST. 4. Patients must have received prior platinum containing treatment. 5. WHO performance status of 01 1. Patients who have received more than two prior lines of antineoplastic therapy for advanced disease. Chemotherapy administered as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment more than six months prior to study enrollment is not considered a prior line of therapy for purposes of this study. 2. Evidence of spinal cord compression or current evidence of CNS metastases. Screening CT/MRI of the brain is mandatory. Note: Patients who have been treated for CNS metastases by radiation or gamma knife surgery, who been stable for at least 2 months and have discontinued high dose corticosteroids will be eligible for protocol participation 3. Prior treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor</criteria>
