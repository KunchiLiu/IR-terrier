	<brief_summary>This randomized, open label, parallel-group study is designed to investigate whether periprocedural intensive statin therapy with atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin administration before PCI and 30-day continuous intensive treatment is superior to usual care, in terms of cardiovascular events for Chinese elderly patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Atorvastatin Versus Rosuvastatin Intensive Statin Regimens on Chinese Elderly Patients Undergoing PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1800 elderly patients (&gt;65 yr) with coronary artery disease undergoing elective PCI were randomized in 2:1 fashion into either intensive statin group or standard care group. Patients in intensive statin group is further randomized into two subgroups: administrated with either atorvastatin 80mg 12h prior PCI, then 40mg 2h prior PCI, followed by 40 mg/d for 30 days after PCI; or rosuvastatin 20mg 12h prior PCI, then 10mg 2h prior PCI; followed by 10 mg/d for 30 days after PCI, while the standard care group receives atorvastatin 20 mg/d. After angiography, patients who are not undergoing PCI procedure will be excluded from the study as selection failure. The last visit will be at 6 months after PCI. Clinical data such as troponin, CK-MB, Scr, CCR, ALT, AST before and 24h to 48h after procedure will be recorded. 1000 eligible patients will be finally enrolled.The study will be conducted at 12 centers in China.</detailed_description>
