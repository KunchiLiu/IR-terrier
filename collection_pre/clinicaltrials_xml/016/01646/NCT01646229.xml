	<brief_summary>Septic shock of intra-abdominal origin is likely due to Gram-negative bacteria or mixed pathogens and associated with high levels of endotoxin. The injury to the endothelium results in an increase of endothelial permeability, interstitial edema and release of nitric oxide (NO) that is a very potent vasodilatator. [6] Polymyxins obtained from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus polymyxa are antibiotics known for their ability to bind LPS in the outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall as well as free endotoxins with high affinity. Polymyxin-B has been shown to block the activation of cells by a wide variety of LPS. Studies converged to show an improvement in the treatment of septic shock by removing circulating endotoxin.Starting Polymyxin-B hemoperfusion during the operative time is to block the initiation of various deleterious biological cascades induced by endotoxemia such as systemic inflammation, disseminated coagulation disorders, and shock, leading to organ dysfunction and death.</brief_summary>
