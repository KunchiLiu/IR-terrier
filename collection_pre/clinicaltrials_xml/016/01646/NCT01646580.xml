	<brief_summary>Ciclopirox olamine (CiclochemÂ®) is a pyridone broad spectrum antifungal drug which has shown activity on dermatophytes, yeasts, moulds, actinomycetes and some bacteria. Its mechanism of action is based on a fungicidal activity by inhibiting the cellular captation of essential substances needed for the metabolism and growth of the fungi. On the other hand, this drug binds irreversibly with cell structures as mitochondria, ribosomes, microsomes and cell wall. After dermal application, Ciclopirox olamine undergoes skin penetration, being only absorbed a 1,5% of the applied dose. Clinical efficacy has been studied in patients above 10 years with superficial dermatomycoses (dermatophytoses, candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor) and the percentage of clinical healing ranged from 77% to 91% after 2-4 weeks of twice a day topical application. In all the studies, the safety profile has been very good, showing only a very low rate of adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. There are very few previous available data on the application of this compound in children under 10 years of age. A single study had been performed with a solution formulation in patients from 6 to 29 months with diaper candidiasis, showing good efficacy and tolerability in these patients. The present study aims to show the safety and tolerability of ciclopirox olamine in a cream formulation in patients from 3 months to 10 years with dermatomycoses.</brief_summary>
