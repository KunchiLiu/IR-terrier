	<brief_summary>In the U.S., rates of preterm birth and low birth weight have increased over the past 30 years. Poor birth outcomes are especially high among racial/ethnic minority populations. Maternal stress is an important factor that can lead to negative birth outcomes. Thus, programs that reduce stress during pregnancy could improve birth outcomes. Initial pilot work tested a mindfulness-based approach to stress reduction during pregnancy. Women in the pilot study had lower stress and improved coping after the program. For the current study, mindfulness is added to an existing prenatal healthcare program called CenteringPregnancy (CP). CP provides prenatal care through 10 group sessions. This study compares CP with a version of CP infused with mindfulness skills training. Effects of the two versions of CP on psychological stress and coping, stress hormones, and birth outcomes will be tested. Data will be collected from participants three times: twice during pregnancy and once after birth. Medical records will provide data on birth outcomes and other health factors. The study will provide initial information about a mind-body program to reduce stress and improve birth outcomes. Data from the study will inform the development of an R01 proposal for a larger study. The study will also help advance the long term goal of reducing health disparities.</brief_summary>
