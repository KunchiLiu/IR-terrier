	<brief_title>SHP-141C in Plaque Type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing immunoinflammatory disorder. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common (85% - 90%) type. Cutaneous features of individual plaques include circular with centrifugal expansion, induration with sharp demarcation from surrounding skin, erythema and hyperkeratosis. Psoriasis has a negative impact on physical and mental aspects of life that is similar to other major chronic conditions. The modalities of psoriasis treatments can be divided into four main categories: topical, phototherapy, systemic drug therapies and systemic biological treatments. The currently available treatments for psoriasis result in either disease suppression or disease remission.There are many treatment options for the management of psoriasis using topical modalities; however all are lacking with respect to patient satisfaction and durability of treatment. Most current topical treatments, and many treatments in development, are based on modifications of a steroid structure or on Vitamin D. Recent research has identified a broad role for histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in numerous signaling pathways critical to cancer cell survival, such as epigenetic inheritance, gene regulation, mitosis,signal transduction and importantly, inflammation. Theoretically modulation of HDAC could lead to clinical benefit in inflammatory diseases.</detailed_description>

Dermatological Conditions Subjects with erythrodermic, guttate, palmar, plantar or generalised pustular forms of psoriasis. Subjects with scalp, palmar or plantar psoriasis only.

Concurrent Medical Conditions History of clinically significant intercurrent disease of any type (other than psoriasis). A history of moderate or severe asthma during the last 10 years. Major chronic inflammatory disease . Congenital immunodeficiency or cancer prone syndrome. History of abnormal bleeding tendencies or thrombophlebitis, or a history of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV infection. History of malignancy (other than adequately treated skin carcinoma or carcinomainsitu of the cervix). 3. Laboratory Status Any evidence of organ dysfunction, which is confirmed on reexamination to be clinically significant (i.e. in the opinion of the Medical Officer would jeopardise the safety of the subject or impact on the validity of the study results), A creatinine clearance of less than 75 mL/min. Liver function test &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal other than an isolated bilirubin. Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, HIV antibodies. 4. Treatment with any of the following within 4 weeks prior to the commencement of study treatment and for the duration of the study: Systemic retinoids.

High potency topical corticosteroids. "Alternative medicine" treatments for psoriasis. Prolonged sun exposure or tanning bed use, which may in the opinion of the Investigator, modify disease activity. 5.

Vitamin D analogues and topical retinoids. Keratolytics, coal tar and dithranol. 6. Concurrent Medications Subjects have received or anticipate receiving a new medicine (prescription, overthecounter or herbal), given systemically or topically, within 14 days prior to the start of dosing. Subjects may be enrolled if stable on existing therapy (having been on it for at least 60 days) as determined by the Principal Investigator. 7.
