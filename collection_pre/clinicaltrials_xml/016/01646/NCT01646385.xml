	<brief_summary>This study will assess the rates of serious adverse events and death in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with etanercept over the long-term in real-life clinical practice. It will also assess whether there is any difference in the rate of serious adverse events in patients trated with etanercept in comparision to patients treated with conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The study will in addition quantify the efficacy of etanercept in this population by assessing the rates of important clinical outcomes such as changes in disease activity and disability/functioning.</brief_summary>
