	<brief_summary>Questions: Does an evidence-based exercise program increase activities of daily living and physical fitness in institutionalized older adults? Does this program decrease the care dependency of institutionalized older adults? Design: A randomized control trial using group-based exercise was performed in 14 assisted-living facilities for the elderly (&gt;70 years old). Outcome measures: Outcome measures were performance on ADL, physical fitness, and care dependency measures. The exercise program comprised group-based progressive resistance training, balance training, and functional training. The control intervention comprised social group meetings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To improve physical fitness, a combined exercise program including progressive resistance training, balance training, and functional training will be used in a sample of institutionalized elderly people. The exercise program has a frequency of 2 times a week and a duration of 16 weeks. The intensity is moderate, measured on a 0-10 scale. The level of intensity is specified as follows: on a 10- point scale, where no movement is 0 and maximal effort of a muscle group is 10, moderate-intensity effort is a 5 or 6, and high- intensity effort is a 7 or 8. There is currently insufficient evidence that a combined exercise program, developed to improve physical fitness, can improve ADL performance and care dependency also.</detailed_description>
