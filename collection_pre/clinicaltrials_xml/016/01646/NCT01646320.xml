	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if BMS-512148 (Dapagliflozin) as part of a triple combination therapy can improve (decrease) hemoglobin A1c in patients with type 2 diabetes after 24 weeks of treatment compared to a 2 drug oral antidiabetic therapy. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>

Subject who, in the judgment of the investigator, may be at risk for dehydration or volume depletion that may affect the interpretation of efficacy or safety data and concomitant use of loop diuretics in countries where this is not recognized in the Dapagliflozin label. 4. Subject is currently abusing alcohol or other drugs or has done so within the last 6 months. Acute Vascular Event: 5. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mmHg. 6. Cardiovascular Disease within 3 months of the screening visit [ie myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or revascularization (CABG/PTCA), unstable angina, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)]. 7. Congestive heart failure as New York Association (NYHA) class IV, unstable or acute congestive heart failure. Renal Diseases: 8. Moderate or severe impairment of renal function [defined as eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (estimated by MDRD) or serum creatinine (Scr) ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in males or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in females.] 9. Conditions of congenital renal glucosuria Hepatic Diseases: 10. Significant hepatic disease, including, but not limited to, chronic active hepatitis and/or severe hepatic insufficiency, including subjects with ALT and/or AST &gt; 3x ULN and or Total Bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN. Hematological and Oncological Disease/Conditions: 11. History of hemoglobinopathy, with the exception of sickle cell trait (SA) or thalassemia minor; or chronic or recurrent hemolysis. 12. Malignancy within 5 years of the screening visit (with the exception of treated basal cell or treated squamous cell carcinoma) 13. Known immunocompromised status, including but not limited to, individuals who have undergone organ transplantation or who are positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. 14. Donation of blood or blood products to a blood bank, blood transfusion, or participation in a clinical study requiring withdrawal of &gt; 400 mL of blood during the 6 months prior to the screening visit. Prohibited treatment and therapies: 15. Administration of any antihyperglycemic therapy, other than metformin and DPP4's, for more than 14 days (consecutive or not) during the 12 weeks prior to screening, as well as previous exposure to DPP4 or SGLT2 inhibitor in any DPP4 or SGLT2 inhibitor trial is an exclusion criterion. 16. Current treatment with potent cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors (in countries where dose adjustment would be required by the dapagliflozin label). 17. Administration of any other investigational drug or participation in any interventional clinical studies within 30 days of planned screening to this study. Subjects who failed to satisfy all eligibility criteria at screening and did not enter the leadin or openlabel period in CV181168 or CV181169 studies specifically, do not need to wait 30 days. 3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings a) Hemoglobin ≤ 11.0 g/dL (110 g/L) for men; hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL (100 g/L) for women b) Presence of hematuria: i) For male subjects being considered for Stratum A: microscopic hematuria present at Week 18 or Week 16 AND no common cause that can be confirmed is exclusionary. Male subjects with a confirmed common cause can be entered into the openlabel phase with a documented negative result for hematuria microscopic urinalysis performed by the central laboratory. ii) For male subjects being considered for Stratum B: microscopic hematuria present at Week 10 or Week 8 AND no common cause that can be confirmed is exclusionary. Male subjects with a confirmed common cause can be entered into the openlabel phase with a documented negative result for hematuria microscopic urinalysis performed by the central laboratory. NOTE: Female sub}ects with hematuria can be entered into the openlabel phase and be randomized, but should be investigated according to local standards and best clinical practices. (See Appendix 3) c) Other central laboratory test findings: − Abnormal free T4 values. Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value at screening will be further evaluated by free T4. Sub}ects with abnormal free T4 values will be excluded. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen Positive for antihepatitis C virus antibody 4. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction a) Subjects who have contraindications to therapy as outlined in the dapagliflozin and saxagliptin Investigator Brochure, the local dapagliflozin or saxagliptin package insert or the local metformin package insert, including current treatment with potent cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors (in countries where dose adjustment would be required by the local Onglyza (saxagliptin) label. 5. Sex and Reproductive Status a) Women who are pregnant 6. Other Exclusion Criteria 1. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated 2. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness 3. Subjects on a commercial weight loss program with ongoing weight loss, or on an intensive exercise program. 4. Employee of BMS, AstraZeneca (AZ), or their relatives. 5. Subject with any condition which, in the judgment of the Investigator, may render the subject unable to complete the study or which may pose a significant risk to the subject. 6. Subject is a participating investigator, study coordinator, employee of an investigator or immediate family member of any of the aforementioned. Open Label Treatment Period Note: Enrollment of subjects into the openlabel (Stratum A) treatment period, beginning eee 16 of the study with HbA1c values at the lower bound (≥ 8.0% and ≤ 9.0%) and Enrollment of subjects into the openlabel (Stratum B) eee 8, of the study with HbA1c values at the lower bound (≥ 7.5% and ≤ 8.5%) will be limited to approximately 50% of the total number of subjects randomized. • For subject in Stratum A: At Week 10 and Week 2 a FPG qualification check will be performed. Subjects with a central laboratory FPG value meeting &gt; 270 mg/dL will be scheduled for a followup visit (within 3 5 days) to obtain a second central laboratory FPG value. If the mean of the originally scheduled central laboratory FPG and the repeat central laboratory FPG value is &gt; 270 mg/dL, the subject cannot be randomized and must be discontinued. For subjects in Stratum B: At Week 2 a FPG qualification check will be performed. Subjects with a central laboratory FPG value meeting &gt; 270 mg/dL will be scheduled for a followup visit (within 3 5 days) to obtain a second central laboratory FPG value. If the mean of the originally scheduled central laboratory FPG and the repeat central laboratory FPG value is &gt; 270 mg/dL, the subject cannot be randomized and must be discontinued Double Blind Treatment Period Inclusion criteria: • For Stratum A AND Stratum B: − Subjects with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control, defined as central laboratory HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 10.5% obtained at the Week 2 visit of the openlabel treatment period.</criteria>
