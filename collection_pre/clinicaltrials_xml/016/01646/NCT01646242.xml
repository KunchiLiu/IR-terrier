	<brief_summary>Most of colorectal polyps founded during colonoscopy are diminutive polyps less than 6 mm. However, complete removal of diminutive polyps is required to prevent tumor recurrence and development of potential interval cancers. Currently, a variety of polypectomy techniques such as hot snare, cold snare, and cold forceps polypectomy are frequently used for the removal of diminutive colorectal polyps. In regard to the completeness of polypectomy, there are few data comparing cold snare polypectomy with cold forceps biopsy technique for removal of diminutive (1-5 mm) colorectal polyps. The aim of this study is to compare cold snare polypectomy with cold forceps polypectomy using double biopsy technique for removal of diminutive colorectal polyps.</brief_summary>
