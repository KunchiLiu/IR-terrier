	<brief_summary>After failure of initial ADT, addition of an anti-androgen is established to treat castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Substitution of the first anti-androgen and anti-androgen withdrawal results in treatment responses in 25-40% of patients for 4-6 months. A more effective second line treatment after failure of first ADT could prolong the time until the state of symptomatic HRPC, which is currently treated with docetaxel and accompanied by significant side effects. Since the importance of the IGF-signaling in PC is not only indicated by preclinical results but also by clinical efficacy of somatostatin analogs, further clinical research with the new somatostatin analog pasireotide is warranted. This study is designed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pasireotide LAR in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It also aims for a preliminary efficacy evaluation of pasireotide within the dose expansion part at the MTD. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by evaluation of different measures of prostate cancer e.g. changes in PSA, disease control rate (RECIST 1.1), symptoms and changes of biomarkers linked to the mode of action of pasireotide LAR. The study will also explore characteristics of patients who might benefit most from this treatment approach.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. ECOG 0 2 2. Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 3. Patients with CRPC (castration resistant prostate cancer): advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 4. Prior treatment with a GnRHagonist or GnRHantagonist for at least 6 months. The medication must not have been changed for at least 3 months prior to start of study treatment. 5. Prior treatment with an antiandrogen (e.g. bicalutamide, flutamide, cyproteronacetate) is allowed but not necessary. Patients treated with antiandrogen must have discontinued antiandrogen for at least 6 weeks prior to start of study treatment. 1. Dose escalation part only: prior treatment with an antiandrogen and GnRH agonist or antagonist is allowed. 2. Dose expansion part only: prior concomitant treatment with an antiandrogen and GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist for ≤6 weeks is allowed (in order to control flare up). 6. Serum testosterone within castration level (&lt;50 ng/dl or &lt; 1,7 nM) 7. Disease progression demonstrated by a rising PSA with or without metastases. PSA ≥2 ng/mL at study entry. Rising PSA is defined as two consecutive rises over a nadir value; the individual measurements are obtained at least 1 week apart. Exclusion criteria: 1. Dose expansion part only: Secondary hormonal manipulation of prostate cancer (other than GnRH agonist or antagonist) for more than 6 weeks, including concomitant antiandrogens. 2. Prior cytotoxic therapy e.g. with docetaxel, mitoxantrone. 3. Patients who have received radiotherapy of target lesions. Patients who have received local radiotherapy of nontarget lesions for local symptom control within the last 4 weeks must have recovered from any adverse effects of radiotherapy before recording baseline symptoms. Lesions treated with locoregional therapies within the last 3 months before study inclusion do not qualify as target lesions. Additional protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.</criteria>
