	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of 2 Different Prothrombin Complex Concentrates on the Pharmacodynamics of Rivaroxaban in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label (volunteers and staff will know the identity of all treatments), randomized (volunteers assigned to treatment by chance) study in healthy adult volunteers to assess the effects of 2 different Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs) (drugs that act to control bleeding) on the pharmacodynamics (ie, the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of a drug on the body) of rivaroxaban (a drug that acts to prevent the formation of blood clots). Eligible volunteers will receive treatment with rivaroxaban administered orally (by mouth) on Days 1-4. On Day 5, rivaroxaban will be administered orally before the randomized intravenous (IV) (into the vein) administration of 1 of 3 treatments: Profilnine SD (a 3-factor PCC), Beriplex P/N (a 4-factor PCC), or saline. Blood samples will be collected from healthy volunteers during the study to assess the activity of rivaroxaban. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. The total length of participation in the study for each volunteer will be approximately 28 days (includes a 21-day Screening Period and a 7-day Treatment Period).</detailed_description>
