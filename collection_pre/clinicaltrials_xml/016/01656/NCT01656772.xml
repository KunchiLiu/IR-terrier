	<brief_title>Vdrive Evaluation of Remote Steering and Testing in Lasso Electrophysiology Procedures Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Key to the success of an electrophysiology procedure is the ability to accurately map, sense and pace the heart. Electrophysiology mapping catheters are available in a variety of shapes and electrode configurations. The majority of these catheters are manipulated manually by the physician. The Vdrive simplifies these manipulations by allowing an operator to mechanically advance, retract, rotate, deflect and maneuver a circular mapping catheter. The circular mapping catheter is not altered in structure, function or indication in the same manner as the predicate device (Cardiodrive Catheter Advancement System). This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, controlled study comparing manual navigation of a circular mapping catheter with mechanical navigation by the Vdrive. A total of 120 patients are expected to complete the study: 80 patients in the Vdrive navigation arm and 40 patients in the manual navigation arm. Patients will be enrolled at a minimum of one site in the European Union where the product is currently marketed and the United States, where the Vdrive is considered to be investigational.</detailed_description>
