	<brief_summary>Fampridine-SR is registered for the treatment of walking incapacity in MS patients. Two pivotal trials show that app. 40% of MS patients with walking incapacity can improve walking speed averagely 25% when recieving the drug. This has been shown using the Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FW). No effect on cognition and upper limb function has been shown, but this has not been investigated in patients responding to the drug measured by the abovementioned test. The question is if this will be the case and also if another walking test, termed the Six Spot Step Test (SSST), will be more sensitive to the effect of Fampridine-SR. Primary outcome measure is the effect measured by SSST. The hypothesis is that SSST is not less sensitive to the effect of Fampridine-SR than T25FW.</brief_summary>
