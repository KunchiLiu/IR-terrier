	<brief_summary>To investigate the progression of the immunological response in living-donor kidney transplant recipients treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen. Clinical, immunological, and health-economic data collected during this Reference Group Trial will be used to corroborate historical renal transplantation statistics and generate reference ranges for future clinical studies that will test immunoregulatory cell therapy as an adjunct immunosuppressive treatment in renal transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Organ Donor: A prospective donor is eligible for the research if all of the following inclusion criteria apply: 1. Eligible for live kidney donation 2. Aged at least 18 years 3. An ABO blood type compatible with the organ recipient 4. Willing and able to provide a blood sample for The ONE Study Subprojects 5. Willing to provide personal and medical/biological data for the trial 6. Signed and dated written informed consent. In signing the donor information sheet/informed consent form (DIS/ICF), organ donors agree to provide a blood sample for the IM Subproject, and permit access to their medical records for the collection of specified demographic and medical/biological data for the trial. Organ Recipient: 1. Chronic renal insufficiency necessitating kidney transplantation and approved to receive a primary kidney allograft from a living donor 2. Aged at least 18 years 3. Able to commence the immunosuppressive regimen at the protocolspecified time point 4. Willing and able to participate in The ONE Study subprojects 5. Signed and dated written informed consent. Organ Donor: If a prospective donor fulfils any of the following criteria, then they are ineligible for the trial: 1. Genetically identical to the prospective organ recipient at the HLA loci 2. Exposure to any investigational agents at the time of kidney donation, or within 28 days prior to kidney donation 3. Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the Investigator and/or designated study personnel 4. Subjects unable to freely give their informed consent (e.g. individuals under legal guardianship). Organ Recipient: 1. Patient has previously received, or is scheduled to receive, any tissue or organ transplant other than the planned kidney graft 2. Known sensitivity to tacrolimus, mycophenolate, or corticosteroids 3. Genetically identical to the prospective organ donor at the HLA loci 4. PRA grade &gt; 40% within 6 months prior to enrolment 5. Previous treatment with any desensitisation procedure (with or without IVIg) 6. Concomitant malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years prior to planned study entry (excluding successfullytreated nonmetastatic basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) 7. Evidence of significant local or systemic infection 8. HIVpositive, EBVnegative or suffering chronic viral hepatitis 9. Significant liver disease, defined as persistently elevated AST and/or ALT levels &gt;2 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal range) 10. Malignant or premalignant haematological conditions 11. Any uncontrolled medical condition or concurrent disease that could interfere with the study objectives 12. Any condition which, in the judgement of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk 13. Ongoing treatment with systemic immunosuppressive drugs at study entry 14. Participation in another clinical trial during the study or within 28 days prior to planned study entry 15. Female patients of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at enrolment 16. Female patients who are breastfeeding 17. All female patients of childbearing potential UNLESS: 1. The patient is willing to maintain a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study 2. The career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures that there is no risk of pregnancy for the duration of the study (at the discretion of the local Investigator) 18. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup visit schedule 19. Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the Investigator and/or designated study personnel 20. Patients unable to freely give their informed consent (e.g. individuals under legal guardianship).</criteria>
