	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess the contraceptive efficacy of a nomegestrol acetate + 17ß-estradiol (NOMAC-E2) combined oral contraceptive (COC) in healthy, sexually-active American women at risk for pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding patterns of women taking NOMAC-E2 were assessed and compared to those of women taking a norethisterone acetate + ethinyl estradiol (NETA-EE) COC. The safety of NOMAC-E2 was also assessed. Participants were randomized to receive either NOMAC-E2 or NETA-EE in a 3:1 ratio. As of Amendment 1 (which increased the sample size of the NOMAC-E2 group), the randomization ratio was adapted accordingly for participants randomized after the sample size increase.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study was terminated early. The decision to terminate the study was based upon difficulties encountered with data collection (related to incomplete e-Diary entries) in concert with business considerations. The decision was not related to any new or unexpected safety or efficacy findings with NOMAC-E2. As a result of this early termination, none of the pre-specified efficacy endpoints were analyzed.</detailed_description>
