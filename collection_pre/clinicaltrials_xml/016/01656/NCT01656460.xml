	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation for Consolidation After Standard Chemoradiation for Stage 3 Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol will investigate the potential role of SBRT for patients with stage 3 NSCLC. Eligible patients will first have received standard 50.4 Gy chemoradiation. Patients entering the study will have the opportunity to receive SBRT as a noninvasive option as compared to surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, SBRT after 50.4 Gy chemoradiation represents a technique of radiation consolidation that may be more effective and less toxic than standard conventional fractionated radiation</detailed_description>
