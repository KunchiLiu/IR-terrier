	<brief_summary>Patients that have undergone pre-operative radiation for pancreatic carcinoma, that upon pathologic examination of the normal portion of the pancreatic gland that was in the radiation field showed acute and chronic changes in the pancreatic cells. The hypothesis for utilizing stereotactic radiation on pancreatic fistulae is that the treatment will decrease pancreatic secretions, thus decreasing autodigestion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation to Decrease Pancreatic Secretions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic radiation for cancer has been utilized to successfully treat the head of the pancreas, which is generally a well-tolerated procedure with minimal complications. Upon further investigation under the microscope, after resection during a complex Whipple operation, it is noted that particularly the exocrine glandular tissue atrophied substantially. Based on this information, the hypothesis for utilizing stereotactic radiation on the remaining pancreas is production of a fibrosis of the pancreas and a decrease in the production of exocrine portion of the gland. The use of stereotactic radiation will be performed on individuals that are non-surgical candidates.</detailed_description>
