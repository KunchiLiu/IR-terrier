	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis is that inhibition of Bv8 production in bone marrow cells of a mice wil reduce the rate of growth of a primary human tumor implanted in the mice. we will take mice and transform their bone marrow cells into non-Bv8 producing cells. than we will implant primary human tumor tissue (taken from surgical specimens after informed consent)in those mice and follow-up on the mice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Study of Bv8/PK-2 Inhibition in Human Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1-10 grams of human cancer tissue will be taken from surgical specimen without interference to the pathological data gathering process. those tissues will be implanted in nude mice that will either be treated with anti-Bv8 antibodies or will be transplanted with bone marrow in which Bv8 expression is silenced.</detailed_description>
