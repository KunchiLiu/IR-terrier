	<brief_summary>There are no data on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ATV/r-based HAART in HIV-infected Asian children. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ATV/r-based HAART in Thai HIV-infected children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atazavanir/Ritonavir-based HAART in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based HAART have been commonly prescribed as the first-line HAART for HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings. Protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART are the recommended second-line regimen after failing NNRTI-based HAART. The most commonly used PI in Thailand is lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). However, the metabolic complications of lopinavir/ritonaive (LPV/r) such as hyperlipidemia and lipodyrtrophy are common and a concern for HIV-infected children as it may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in the longer term. There are data on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ATV/r-based HAART in HIV-infected adults but none in children. Furthermore, many studies in both adults and children have shown that different ethnicities can result in different pharmacokinetic response to antiretroviral drugs. As a result of this, this study investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ATV/r-based HAART in HIV-infected Asian children.</detailed_description>
