	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion study of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) in combination with vemurafenib or vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in participants with BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma. Enrolled participants may continue treatment until they are no longer experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator and in alignment with the protocol.</brief_summary>
