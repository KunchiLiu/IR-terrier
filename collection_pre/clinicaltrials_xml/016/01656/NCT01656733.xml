	<brief_title>Nicotine Replacement for Smoking Cessation During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will examine the safety and efficacy of the nicotine inhaler as an aid to smoking cessation during pregnancy. The specific aims are: (1) To examine the efficacy of the nicotine inhaler compared to a matching placebo for smoking cessation during pregnancy; (2) To compare the nicotine inhaler with placebo on overall nicotine exposure (i.e., serum cotinine concentrations), and on birth outcomes (i.e., birth weight and gestational age); (3) To identify factors that determine which women benefit most from the use of the nicotine inhaler for smoking cessation during pregnancy; (4) To explore mechanisms by which the nicotine inhaler increases birth weight and gestational age. Subjects will be recruited from two prenatal clinics that serve primarily a low-income, minority population. Pregnant smokers (n=270) who smoke at least 5 cigarettes/ day will receive nurse-delivered behavioral counseling and be randomized to receive a 6-week course of treatment with either a nicotine inhaler or placebo, followed by a 6-week taper. Birth outcomes will be obtained on all participants</detailed_description>
