	<brief_title>The Effects of Mirror Therapy on Upper Extremity in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>55% to 75% of people after stroke have a paretic arm that causes motor impairment. Among novel rehabilitation interventions, MT was found to be beneficial and comparatively low-cost. MT reduced motor impairment possibly in part of recruiting the premotor cortex or balancing the neural activation within the primary motor cortex toward the affected hemisphere. However, the benefits in certain aspects of outcomes are under debate. Another treatment, MG, can be used to normalize muscle tone, suppress muscle spasticity, enhance residual volitional activity of hand and arm, or even increasing walking speed. In addition, providing MG stimulation might result in plastic changes in the primary motor cortex, and induced a long-lasting modulated effect on motor cortical excitability. The possible mechanism of brain plasticity underlying MG is collective with the mechanism behind the MT. Adding MG to MT might augment the cortical reorganization. In sum, combining MT with MG may supplement the disadvantage or uncertain effects of MT and broaden the benefited outcomes.</detailed_description>
