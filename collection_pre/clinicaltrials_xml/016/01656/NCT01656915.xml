	<brief_summary>Ex vivo LPS stimulation of whole blood will be a good alternative challenge to induce an inflammatory response and examine differences in the inflammatory response between healthy and compromised subjects. The purpose of the current study is to examine the inflammatory response in a younger population (35-45 yrs old) to see whether in this population also differences in the ex vivo LPS induced cytokine response exists between healthy and compromised subjects, as is seen in elderly subjects. Overweight subjects showing a state of disturbed blood glucose control will be included as subjects with compromised health and compared to healthy lean subjects with the same age (shifting from healthy towards unhealthy, not diseased). Hypothesis Ex vivo LPS stimulation of whole blood will induce a measurable inflammatory cytokine response in a healthy population that is different from a response of the compromised population. The investigators will include subjects aged 35-45 years that differ in health characteristics, especially blood HbA1c, fat% and waist circumference.</brief_summary>
