	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of lidocaine and tetracaine after 2-, 4-, and 12-hour application of 4 Synera® patches and a 4-hour application of 4 lidocaine/tetracaine patches without heat in healthy adult subjects and to monitor the frequency and nature of adverse events. In addition to determining the pharmacokinetics for a one-time application of 4 Synera® patches, steady-state pharmacokinetics were modeled and residual patch concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine were determined.</detailed_description>
