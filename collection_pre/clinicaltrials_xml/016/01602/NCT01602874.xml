	<criteria>Male or female subjects 8 to 17 years old. Children with bone maturation less than 8 years old should be enrolled with caution due to potential risk of tooth discoloration. Have a diagnosis of a serious infection (complicated intraabdominal infections [cIAI] or community acquired pneumonia [CAP] as applicable) requiring hospitalization and administration of IV antibiotic therapy. Criteria related indication (cIAI or CAP as applicable), e.g., sign of systemic infection, signs and symptom. Subject with any concomitant illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and/or completion of the study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's response (e.g., life expectancy &lt;30 days).</criteria>
