	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational drug called tabalumab in participants with Multiple Myeloma (MM) who have tried at least one other therapy in the past. Tabalumab will be given in combination with standard doses of two other drugs that are often used to treat MM. Study doctors will collect information about the effectiveness and side effects of this therapy.</brief_summary>
