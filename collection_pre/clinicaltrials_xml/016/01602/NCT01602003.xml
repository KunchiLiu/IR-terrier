	<brief_summary>Double-blind, randomized, multicenter, multinational (South Korea and India), parallel group study The study was divided into three parts: part 1 was a screening period started with an initial 2 weeks of exercise/diet program; part 2 was a double-blind treatment period during which eligible patients were randomized to Sitagliptin 100 mg qd (once daily), LC15-0444 25 mg bid (twice daily), or LC15-0444 50 mg qd groups and received the assigned treatment for 24 weeks; part 3 was for those patients who completed part 1 &amp; 2 and consented to receive another 28 weeks of treatment with LC15-0444 50 mg qd. Screening tests were performed on the patients who had given the written informed consent. After 2-week exercise/diet program according to the generally recognized guideline, eligible patients were assigned one of three treatment groups with 1:1:1 ratio. During the total of 24-week treatment period of part 2, each patient visited the study site at Week 6, 12, 18, and 24. Completing double-blind treatment for 24 weeks, each patient was asked to provide consent to participate in the part 3 of the study where all the patients were to receive LC15-0444 50 mg once daily. During 28-week treatment period of the part 3, each patient visited the study</brief_summary>
