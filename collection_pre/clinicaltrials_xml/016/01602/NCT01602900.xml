	<brief_summary>This study will investigate if a new experimental drug to treat Huntington's Disease gets into the brain. If it does get into the brain the study will explore the relationship between the amount of drug in the brain and the amount of drug in the blood. The study will involve healthy male volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healthy Volunteer Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Brain Occupancy Study of a Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) Inhibitor in Huntington's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, non-randomized, adaptive design PET occupancy study in healthy adult males. The primary aim of this study is to describe the relationship between plasma concentrations and brain PDE4 occupancy of GSK356278 over time. Up to 24 healthy volunteers may be administered single doses of GSK356278 in order to obtain 12 evaluable complete data sets of occupancy estimates. This study will help to optimize the dose selection for future clinical studies with GSK356278.</detailed_description>
