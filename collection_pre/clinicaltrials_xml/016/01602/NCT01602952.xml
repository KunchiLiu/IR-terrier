	<brief_summary>A Phase I/II multicenter study of IY5511HCl in Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients without optimal response or tolerance to Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Imatinib and/ or Dasatinib, Nilotinib) In this study, The efficacy and safety of CML patients who are resistant or intolerable to imatinib in the Chronic and Accelerated phases. Phase 1 1. To investigate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of oral Radotinib HCl bid (twice daily) in the Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML subjects who are resistant, suboptimal responsive, or intolerant to imatinib OR resistant or intolerant to at least one second-generation targeted anticancer agent while being resistant, suboptimal responsive, or intolerant to imatinib simultaneously. Phase 2 1. To investigate safety of oral Radotinib HCl in CML patients who are resistant or intolerable to imatinib in the chronic and accelerated phases. 2. To evaluate hematologic and cytogenetic efficacy of oral Radotinib HCl in CML patients who are resistant or intolerable to imatinib in the chronic and accelerated phases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Philadelphia Chromosome Positive CML Patients Without Optimal Response or Tolerance to Bcr-Abl TKI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Radotinib HCl, a targeted anticancer agent that inhibits the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. It is aimed at determining the optimal therapeutic dose and confirming safety and efficacy of Radotinib HCl. Phase 1 study began at St. Mary's hospital in Korea and Phase 2 study is ongoing at 9 Korean sites and about 7 sites in China, India and Thailand will take part in Phase 2. After determination of a safe and proper therapeutic dose in Phase 1, Phase 2 began continuously to evaluate efficacy in chronic and accelerated phases. Before the start of the Phase 2 trial, interim or final reports for the Phase 1 trial were reviewed by the Korean Food and Drug Administration.</detailed_description>
