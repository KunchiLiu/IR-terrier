	<brief_summary>This is a prospective cross-sectional, observational, single-center study of Alport patients, in which a single, first morning voided urine collection will be acquired and used to validate assays of urine biomarkers that reflect changes in glomerular protein filtration barrier function. The purpose of this study is to identify biomarkers indicative of changes in glomerular filtration function that occur during the course of proteinuric renal diseases such as Alport nephropathy.</brief_summary>
