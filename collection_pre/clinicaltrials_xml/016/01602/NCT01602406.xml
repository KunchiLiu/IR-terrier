	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, phase I study to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or a lower Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) of LJM716 in combination with trastuzumab in patients with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) or gastric cancer (MGC). The study consists of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part. LJM716 will be administered intravenously once weekly unless a less frequent dosing regimen such as every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks is introduced. Patients will continue on their trastuzumab dosing, administered intravenously once weekly at 2mg/kg. During dose escalation, a minimum of 15 patients are anticipated to be treated in successive cohorts. The dose escalation will continue until the MTD/RDE is declared. The RDE dose selected will either be the MTD or a dose below the MTD based on safety and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) considerations. Following the MTD/RDE declaration, approximately 20 MBC and 20 MGC patients will be enrolled in separate arms in the dose expansion part and treated at the MTD/RDE to further assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the combination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with confirmed HER2 positive, metastatic or nonoperable locally advanced breast or gastric cancer Metastatic breast cancer patients must have received a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 prior anti HER2 based regimens with documented progression on the most recent regimen which must contain trastuzumab, adotrastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib Metastatic gastric cancer patients must have received a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2 prior anti HER2 based regimens with documented progression on the most recent regimen which must contain trastuzumab or adotrastuzumab emtansine During the dose expansion part of study, all patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST criteria. Patients must have at least one prior trastuzumabcontaining regimen Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status â‰¤ 2 Patients with Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis which are: symptomatic or require treatment for symptom control and/or growing Prior treatment with any antiHER3 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 3) treatment Impaired cardiac function Prior to the first dose of study treatment, patients who have received systemic antineoplastic therapy or any investigational therapy within 4 weeks or within 5 half lives of the therapy prior to starting study treatment, whichever is shorter, or for cyclical therapy, within one cycle length (e.g. 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycinC). Patients who have a history of primary malignancy other than that being treated in this study, and currently requires active clinical intervention. Patients who do not have an archival tumor sample (or sections of it) available or readily obtainable. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
