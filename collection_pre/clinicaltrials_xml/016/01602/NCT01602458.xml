	<brief_summary>The study's objective is to compare the global scar outcomes in those treated with silicone only therapy (SOT) versus silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Control Trial for Preventative Scar Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this study are to: 1. Examine the difference between patient scores on the POSAS scale in those randomized to silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks. 2. Examine the difference between observer scores on the POSAS scale in those randomized to silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks. 3. Examine the difference between Vancouver scale in those randomized to silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks. 4. Examine the need for surgical intervention in those randomized to silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients who have undergone surgery within one month prior to enrollment patient must have a splitthickness or full thickness skin graft with extremity involvement secondary to a traumatic skin injury (burn, laceration, avulsion or degloving type injury) that has healed (based on clinician assessment of wound healing) patients with comorbid conditions patients must be referred to and attend scar management clinic at DCMC patients with concave scars at the site of the skin graft patients with skin graft scars larger than 4x7 inches patients with presence of current skin infection or history of dermatological condition such as eczema patients with skin grafts only on parts of the body other than extremities patients with reported silicone allergies</criteria>
