	<detailed_description>Obesity is a public health problem. Currently, the best treatment is surgery. However, 15% of patients after surgery have problems such as nausea, pain, vomiting, heartburn or regurgitation. To investigate these problems, an endoscopy is used. Yet, endoscopy has some disadvantages such as the need for intravenous sedation, need to take time off work, need for special endoscopy units and nurses and a delay in diagnosing because the endoscopy cannot be done at the time of the clinic visit. A new technology called clinic-based nasopharyngoendoscopy can potentially solve many of the problems with the current endoscopy. This study aims to determine that this new technology is just as effective in diagnosing problems as the current gold standard.</detailed_description>
