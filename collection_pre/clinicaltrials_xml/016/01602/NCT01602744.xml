	<brief_title>The Use of STOPP/START Criteria for Medication Intervention Among Elderly Population Living in a Geriatric Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inappropriate prescribing is common in older people and is associated with adverse drug effects,hospitalization and falls. In this trial we want to check the efficacy of the screening tools STOPP/START which were developed and validated in order to reduce inappropriate prescribing. STOPP comprises of 65 indicators of drug-drug, drug-disease interactions and therapeutic duplication. START incorporates 22 evidence based indicators of common prescribing omissions. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that screening the medications of older patients living permanently in a geriatric hospital will improve their quality of life. The compliance of the doctor working in the geriatric hospital to the recommendations of the screening tools will also be checked.</detailed_description>
