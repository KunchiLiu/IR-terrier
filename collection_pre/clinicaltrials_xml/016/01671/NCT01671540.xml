	<brief_summary>In this study the invetigators seek an answer on the following hypothesis: - What are the long term effects of an IPV treatment evaluated with classical outcome parameters? (FEV1, Raw) - Is the possible effect noticeable on the novel technique and is this comparable with the classical outcome parameters?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of IPV Assessed With Functional Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Multicenter study conducted in university Hospital Antwerp (UZA) and ZNA Middelheim. Tests are taken before and after one week IPV treatment. IPV is applied for 1 week during the physical therapy treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary desease (COPD) patients admitted to the hospital for an excarebation. The IPV treatment is an additional treatment upon the standard treatment of the patients. The standard treatment consists out of existing drainage techniques to remove secretion out of the lungs by means of breathing control exercises. Patients are randomized into either the experimental group or the control group. The control group receives a standard physical therapy treatment without additional IPV treatment.</detailed_description>
