	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether TissueGene-C, an allogeneic human chondrocytes expressing Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-b1, is effective and safe in patients with degenerative arthritis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of TissueGene-C to Degenerative Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of normal chondrocytes and transduced chondrocytes that express growth factors to regenerate the damaged cartilage tissues. In the clinical trial Phase 2b, the investigators compared TissueGene-C to placebo during 6 - months trial with 54 outpatients who have had degenerative arthritis. The outpatients are assigned to TissueGene-C or placebo in 1:1 ratio, and will be monitored and recorded for improving clinical symptoms, sports activities, and function of the knee, and for the presence of adverse events.</detailed_description>

Showed clinically significant hematology, serum chemistry, and urine test results at the screening visit 2. Falls under Inclusion Criteria 6 but with the damage in the relevant lesion considered ICRS Grade IV sized more than 6 cm2 3. Took glucosamine, chondroitin, or any natural medicine within 14 days before the injection of the investigational product (but if the 14day washout period had elapsed, the patient can be enrolled in this study) 4. Has taken antiinflammatory drugs (prescribed or overthecounter) within 14 days before the injection of the investigational product (but if the 14day washout period had elapsed, the patient can be enrolled in this study) 5. Has taken immunosuppressive agents, including antirheumatic drugs (e.g., methotrexate or antimetabolites) within 3 months before enrollment in this study 6. With a history of drug abuse within one year prior to enrollment in this study, or showed positive results in the urine drug test or the serum alcohol test at the screening visit 7. Received an injection in the target knee within two months before enrollment in this study 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding female 9. With another joint disease apart from degenerative arthritis (e.g., systemic rheumatic inflammatory disease associated with the knee or chondrocalcinosis, hemachromatosis, inflammatory arthritis, necrosis of the trochanter, Paget's disease adjacent to a joint in the femur or tibia, ochronosis, hemophilic arthropathy, infectious arthritis, Charcot's disease in the knee joint, villonodular synovitis, synovial chondromas) 10. With an infectious disease, including HIV or hepatitis 11.
