	<brief_summary>Chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs) impact negatively on patients' quality of life. Standard treatment in the UK for patients with VLUs is compression bandaging or stockings. The MIST ultrasound system is a noncontact device which delivers low frequency ultrasound through a gentle saline mist directed at a patient's wound. This study aims to determine whether the use of the MIST device used in combination with standard treatments can improve healing of VLUs compared to UK standard practice. This will be assessed by measuring any reduction in wound size in the two groups after receiving 8 weeks of either Standard Care once a week or MIST combined with Standard Care three times a week.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIST Ultrasound Therapy Compared to United Kingdom Standard Care for the Treatment of Non-healing Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are wounds which are often chronic and difficult to heal. VLUs affect between 1 and 3.2 people per 1000; they cause pain, reduced mobility and impact negatively on patients' quality of life (QoL). Standard treatment for patients with VLUs is the application of strong, sustained compression with bandages or stockings. This pragmatically-designed study aims to determine whether the use of a device called MIST used in combination with standard treatments can improve healing of VLUs compared to UK standard practice. It will also show whether the MIST regimen improves participants' QoL and reduces the incidence of infection. The MIST ultrasound system is a non-contact device which delivers low-frequency ultrasound through a gentle saline mist directed at a patient's wound. Patients (over 18 years old) will be invited to take part in this study if they have had a VLU for 6 weeks or more, which measures between 5 and 100 cm^2, and is not infected. Participants with diabetes must show good blood glucose control, and those with underlying chronic disorders which may affect wound healing will be excluded. All study participants will receive four weeks of standard treatment once a week at a single clinic at the Wound Healing Research Unit (WHRU), University Hospital of Wales. Patients whose wounds reduce by more than 40% during this time will be withdrawn from the study. Remaining patients will be randomly allocated to either the active group or the control group to receive a further eight weeks of treatment. Participants in the active group will receive treatment with the MIST device three times a week, as well as standard care (change of compression bandage and dressings) three times a week. The control group will receive UK standard care (which is dressing and compression bandage change at least once a week). The participants' ulcers will be measured and photographed once a week, and the wound characteristics will be assessed. Changes in participants' health related QoL will be assessed using a questionnaire at the beginning and end of the trial. Wound recurrence rates 90 days after the end of the treatment will be assessed by telephoning patients.</detailed_description>
