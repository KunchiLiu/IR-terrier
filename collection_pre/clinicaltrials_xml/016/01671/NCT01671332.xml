	<brief_title>Docetaxel +/- Suramin in 2nd Line Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall purpose of the study is to determine whether or not the inclusion of suramin to standard treatment with docetaxel improves progression-free survival for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the second and third line settings. Secondary objectives include: - To compare response rate of patients in both treatment arms - To compare overall survival of patients in both treatment arms - To compare toxicity in both treatment arms - To determine whether the survival benefit from suramin is associated with reduced M-phase entry in peripheral blood lymphocytes</detailed_description>
