	<brief_summary>This multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax (GDC-0199, ABT-199) administered in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) (MabThera/Rituxan) or bendamustine and obinutuzumab (BG) to participants with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL. The study will explore two schedules for drug administration, Schedule A (venetoclax introduced before other agents) and Schedule B (introduced after other agents). In addition, the study will explore two venetoclax combination regimens: venetoclax+BR and venetoclax + BG (the latter is optional). The study is comprised of two stages for each participant population: a dose-finding stage and a safety-expansion stage. The dose-finding stage will explore multiple doses of venetoclax to be used in combination with fixed doses of BR or BG.</brief_summary>
