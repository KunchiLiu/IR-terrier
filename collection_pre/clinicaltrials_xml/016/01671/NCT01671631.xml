	<brief_summary>The assessment of non-culprit stenoses is an important issue in ACS. Adenosine administration is currently required for functional evaluation of stenosis severity using the fractional flow reserve (FFR). An alternative adenosine-independent index of coronary stenosis, the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), was recently introduced. Aim of the present study will be to evaluate the trans-stenotic instantaneous wave-free pressure gradient (iFG), the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and the fractional flow reserve (FFR) in ACS patients.</brief_summary>
