	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Biomarkers for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is being done to study changes in muscle imaging over time in people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will be used to evaluate skeletal muscle in study participants. This research is being done to assess how changes in muscle imaging correspond to muscle strength and function. Qualified participants will be asked to complete 5 study visits over 21 months. Each visit will include muscle strength and function testing in addition to the MRI/MRS scan. The investigators plan to use MRI and MRS in developing outcome measures that can be used in future clinical trials for FSHD.</detailed_description>
