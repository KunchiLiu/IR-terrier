	<brief_title>Comparison of Bacterial Contamination Rates Between Isolation and Non-isolation Rooms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show high touch areas maybe contaminated with organisms such as Methicillinâ€”resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. MRSA can live on hospital surfaces for 9-14 days. Patients in rooms that were previously MRSA isolation rooms are at higher risk for developing a hospital-acquired infection. This study is to determine if medication cabinets located outside of MRSA isolation rooms and their contents, particularly medications and the pharmacy delivery folders are at a higher risk of having MRSA colonization on them. This study will use conventional methods to determine if MRSA colonization is present and compare results between non-isolation and isolation rooms. This will evaluate if alternate measures for the reduction of MRSA colonization are needed for the MRSA isolation rooms in regards to medication delivery and storage.</detailed_description>
