	<brief_summary>This is a study in healthy participants with high levels of "bad" cholesterol who are already taking a popular type of cholesterol-lowering medication called statins. Following multiple doses of LY3015014, investigators will study the safety and tolerability of the drug, how the body handles the drug, and the drug's effect on the body. Participants will remain in the study for about 3 months, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days before the study starts.</brief_summary>
