	<brief_summary>Sinonasal gas exchange is facilitated by the unique anatomy and topography of the sinonasal interface that represents a collection of airfoils creating an aerodynamic structure. The airflow during respiration generates positive and negative pressures that power the gas exchange between the sinuses and the nose. Major surgical alteration of the interface reduces the rate and velocity of the exchange. Minimally invasive procedures aimed at preserving the natural anatomy, topography and aerodynamic configuration of the interface will have negligible effects on sinonasal gas exchange.</brief_summary>
