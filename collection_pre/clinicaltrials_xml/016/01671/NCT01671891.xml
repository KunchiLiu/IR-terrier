	<brief_summary>Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. However, there's also no reliable and sensitive method to monitor diseases and evaluate therapy responses till now. Circulating tumor cells, which could reflect tumor's status correctly and reliably, may be a promising method in this field. This study is to investigate the role of circulating tumor cells in evaluating and predicting the responses of chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
