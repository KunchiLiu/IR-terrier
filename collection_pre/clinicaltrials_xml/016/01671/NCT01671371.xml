	<brief_title>Point-of-Care Ultrasound in the Emergency Department Evaluation of Syncope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Syncope is one of the more common presentations to the Emergency Department, representing between 1.2-1.5% of all evaluated patients and up to 6% of admissions. Due to an often broad and overlapping differential diagnosis, syncope represents a disease entity that often requires extensive workup. This typically involves laboratory tests, EKGs, x-rays, computed tomography, or other studies that are costly, time-consuming, and, in the case of diagnostic imaging, frequently involves ionizing radiation. Yet, despite extensive testing, an exact diagnosis is not made in up to 50% of cases. Cardiac causes of syncope include myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, volume depletion, arrhythmia, among other entities, many of which are life threatening. Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) has been used for inpatient syncope evaluations for several decades. In the Emergency Department, echocardiography is currently being used at the point-of-care (POC) in a limited and focused approach to a variety of conditions. However, POC ultrasound has never been systematically evaluated as a diagnostic or prognostic tool specifically for syncope in the Emergency Department. We aim to determine if an ultrasound-based protocol is effective as an adjunct in the evaluation of syncope. Our research study will examine the utility of POC ultrasound in the diagnosis, imaging and laboratory utilization, and prognosis of syncope in the Emergency Department.</detailed_description>
