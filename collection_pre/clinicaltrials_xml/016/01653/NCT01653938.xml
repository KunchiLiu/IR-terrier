	<brief_title>A Trial of a CPR Video in Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: To compare the care preferences for CPR and intubation among subjects randomized to video and subjects randomized to the current standard of care without the video. Hypothesis 1: Subjects randomized to the video intervention will be significantly more likely to opt against CPR and intubation compared to those who do not see the video. Aim 2: To compare code-status documentation in the electronic medical records between subjects randomized to the video and those who are receiving the current standard of care without the video. Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to the video are more likely to have their code status correctly documented in the electronic medical records compared to those who do not see the video. Aim 3: To compare knowledge and decisional conflict of subjects randomized to video and subjects randomized to the current standard of care without the video. Hypothesis 3: When compared to subjects randomized to the current standard of care, subjects in the video intervention group will have higher knowledge and lower decisional conflict (lower decisional conflict scores) when asked to choose CPR and intubation preferences.</detailed_description>
