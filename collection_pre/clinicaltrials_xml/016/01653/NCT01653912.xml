	<brief_title>Dose-finding Study in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PKB116611 is an open-label Phase I/II study of the investigational drug GSK2110183 given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel to subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer. Phase I is a dose escalation evaluation of daily oral doses of GSK2110183 administered in combination with every 3 week carboplatin and paclitaxel to any subject with recurrent ovarian cancer. Phase II is a single arm evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the combination identified in Phase I to subjects with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.</detailed_description>
