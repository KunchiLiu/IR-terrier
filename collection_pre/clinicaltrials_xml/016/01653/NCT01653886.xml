	<brief_title>Palatability (Energy I Pilot)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the pilot study was to test for differences in palatability ratings of the four menus that will be administered during the ENERGY I project. During the pilot study, palatability ratings were collected for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) from four different menus that were served to participants during the main ENERGY I trial. The menus consist of three diets that vary in dietary fat and energy density: 1) high fat/high energy density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density. In addition to these three menus, the menu from the baseline period of the trial will also be tested for palatability.</detailed_description>
