	<brief_title>Boceprevir With Peginterferon Alfa-2b and Ribavirin in the Treatment-naive Patients Infected With Genotype 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Boceprevir 800 mg three times per day (TID) orally (PO) (hereafter called Boceprevir) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μg/kg once per week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) plus weight-based dosing (WBD) of ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to standard of care (SOC) (therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG)+ribavirin (RBV) WBD) in previously untreated adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4 infection. Primary Trial Objectives: - The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Boceprevir in combination with PEG 1.5 μg/kg QW SC plus WBD of RBV (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to the efficacy of SOC (therapy with PEG+RBV WBD) in the Control Arm in previously untreated adult subjects with CHC genotype 4 infection</detailed_description>

Subjects must be willing to give written informed consent for the trial and for the pharmacogenetic testing. Subjects who are unwilling to provide written informed consent for pharmacogenetic testing may be included in the trial; however, pharmacogenetic samples must not be obtained. Subject must have previously documented CHC genotype 4 infection. Subjects with other or mixed genotypes are not eligible. The HCVRNA result obtained from the central laboratory at the screening visit must confirm genotype 4 infection and be more10,000 IU per mL Previously untreated patients with Pegylated interferon Subject must have a liver biopsy or fibrotest and fibroscan with histology consistent with CHC and no other etiology. Subject who is coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus. Prior treatment with interferon, ribavirin and/or investigational agent for hepatitis C. Prior treatments with herbal remedies with known hepatotoxicity are exclusionary. All herbal remedies used for hepatitis C treatment must be discontinued before Day 1. Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit in this trial. Subject who received any of the following medication(s) within 2 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit that are highly dependent on CYP3A4.5 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and or lifethreatening events such as: orally administered midazolam, pimozide, amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine and ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine).
