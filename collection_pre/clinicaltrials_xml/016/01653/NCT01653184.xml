	<brief_title>Effect of Omega-3-fatty Acids on Blood Levels Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Patients With Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is observational data in the current literature suggesting that the intake of foods high in marine sources of omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish, may lower the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A large prospective study is underway to determine whether oral supplementation with 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids is beneficial for subjects with dry AMD. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the change in serum omega-3 index (blood level of omega-3 fatty acids) after 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation versus 2 grams.</detailed_description>
