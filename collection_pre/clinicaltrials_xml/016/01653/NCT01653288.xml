	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the impact of a psychosocial intervention, Coping Coach, delivered online to children who have experience an acute medical event. The core study hypotheses are that children receiving the intervention will (1) endorse fewer maladaptive trauma-related appraisals and (2) demonstrate more adaptive coping (more support-seeking, more cognitive restructuring, less avoidant coping) at a 6-week follow-up, and (3) demonstrate lower severity of post traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and higher health related quality of life (HRQOL) at 12 week follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of "Coping Coach," a Web-based Preventive Intervention for Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and provide an initial evaluation of the efficacy of Coping Coach, a new web-based intervention for children experiencing acute medical events. The study aims to (1) assess and maximize intervention feasibility, (2) conduct an initial efficacy testing (pilot RCT) for proximal outcomes (appraisals, coping) and subsequent child health outcomes (PTS reactions, HRQOL), and (3) refine the conceptual framework and optimize the intervention effectiveness. Study Design: This study will progress in multiple stages: Pilot study: 20 children experiencing a potentially traumatic medical event will be given the Coping Coach intervention with follow-up at 6 weeks. This pilot will examine initial feasibility, usability, acceptability, and child engagement/ comprehension of the intervention. Additional Pilot Study (2015): 20 children treated in the ED or admitted to the hospital with injury due to non-family violence will be provided with the Coping Coach intervention. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as baseline, 6- and 12-week assessments parallel those from the RCT stage described below. This pilot will examine feasibility, engagement, and estimate pre-post changes in key measures in children with violence exposure. RCT: A wait-list design will compare intervention use with a waitlist control on proximal and child health outcomes at 6, 12, and 18 weeks after baseline enrollment. The Coping Coach intervention will be provided to the waitlist control after the 12 week assessment. 70 children will be enrolled, 35 in each arm. (Assessment of feasibility and engagement will continue in this stage.) The rest of this CLINICALTRIALS.GOV record describes the RCT (N=70). The Pilot and RCT combined will help us prepare for rigorous large-scale RCT of Coping Coach.</detailed_description>
