	<brief_summary>There is uncertainty about whether a live attenuated vaccine (LAIV) offers additional benefit over inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in providing indirect benefit to those who are unvaccinated through herd immunity. The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV can provide increased community-wide protection over TIV. Children aged 3 to 15 years in Hutterite colonies from Alberta and Saskatchewan will be randomized to one of two regimens: TIV or LAIV. The primary outcome of this study will be laboratory-confirmed influenza as detected by PCR in all participants (i.e vaccine recipients and nonrecipients). Secondary outcomes will include influenza-like illness, hospitalization, pneumonia, death, antibiotic use, absenteeism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Live Versus Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Study in Hutterite Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to test whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV can significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in the entire community compared to TIV. We hypothesize that ≥70% uptake of LAIV compared to a similar uptake of TIV among healthy children and adolescents will reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in LAIV colonies by 50% compared to TIV colonies. Other specific objectives are to determine if LAIV reduces influenza in the healthy children and adolescents immunized and if LAIV reduces the following relative to TIV in all participants: influenza-like illness, antimicrobial prescriptions, physician-diagnosed otitis media, school or work-related absenteeism, physician visits for respiratory illness, lower respiratory infection, pneumonia, hospitalizations, and death. We will assess reactogenicity in both study groups.</detailed_description>
