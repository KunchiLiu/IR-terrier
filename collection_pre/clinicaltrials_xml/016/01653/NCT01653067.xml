	<brief_summary>The STORM-trial consists of two parts. In the part I (dose escalation of Temsirolimus) the primary objective is to establish a maximum tolerated dose of Temsirolimus in combination with Rituximab and DHAP. Secondary objective is to prove ability to mobilize stem cells in patients scheduled to high dose therapy. In the part II (full target dose) the primary objective is to evaluate the ORR in patients with relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The secondary objective is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and Toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STORM: Temsirolimus, Rituximab and DHAP for Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open label, single arm, phase II study. There will be no placebo usage within this trial. In the part I, dose escalation part, of this trial 6 patients will be included in each dose level. There will be 4 cohorts, administering up to a maximum of 4 cycles 25 mg, 50 mg, 75mg or 100mg Temsirolimus in combination with Rituximab and DHAP. Treatment regimen part I: Part I - Cohort A, B, C, D, X Temsirolimus 25 (A), 50 (B), 75 (C),100 (D) or 15 (X) mg, Day 1, 8, Rituximab (375 mg/m² day 2) Dexamethasone 40mg day 3-6 Cisplatine 100 mg/m² day 3 Cytarabine 2x2 g/m² day 4 ...repeat day 22, up to a maximum of 4 cycles In part I, after inclusion of 6 patients, each patient has to receive at least 1 complete cycle w/o dose limiting toxicity until the enrollment into the next cohort can be initiated. In the part II of the trial 40 patients will be included to receive the full target dose, established within the part I of the study.</detailed_description>
