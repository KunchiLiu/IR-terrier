	<brief_summary>Statins have been used to low cholesterol to prevent and treat coronary artery diseases. It was also reported that statins could protect endothelial function and cardiac function during coronary artery bypass graft. We recent found simvastatin reduced myocardial injury during noncoronary artery cardiac surgery in single medical center. We further investigate that whether simvastatin can protect myocardium during noncoronary artery cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and improve cardiac function with long term use postoperatively in two medical centers.</brief_summary>
