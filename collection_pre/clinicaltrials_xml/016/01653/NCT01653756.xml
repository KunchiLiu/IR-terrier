	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, 2-way cross-over study designed to examine the effect of IPI-145 on lung function and inflammatory indices in mild, allergen-reactive asthmatic subjects undergoing allergen challenge.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male or female adults between 18 and 60 years of age Diagnosis of asthma (mild) for at least 6 months prior to Screening Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥70% of predicted value at Screening A positive skin prick test to test allergen Any prior treatment with a phosphoinositide3kinase (PI3K) inhibitor other than IPI145 in a previous clinical study Acute asthma exacerbations within 6 weeks prior to Screening Use of any medication for the treatment of asthma other than a shortacting β2 agonist (as needed) within the 4 weeks prior to Screening Participation in another clinical study within minimum of 30 days prior to study Screening A positive screen result for active or latent tuberculosis A history of cardiovascular disease The concomitant use of acidreducing agents and cholinesterase inhibiting medication Inadequate hepatic function defined by Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 1.5 times greater limit of normal (ULN) Inadequate renal function defined by serum creatinine greater than 2.0 milligrams/dL</criteria>
