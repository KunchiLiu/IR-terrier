	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare two single-use laryngeal mask airways the LMA Unique and the LMA Supreme, in pediatric patients. The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Supreme will be superior to the LMA Unique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) - Unique and LMA-Supreme in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to compare the LMA Unique and LMA-Supreme in children undergoing anesthesia. The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Supreme will be superior when compared with the LMA Unique at two different standardized intracuff pressures (40 and 60 cm H20). Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which equilibrium is reached. The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, feasibility of use, and complications will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
