	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Br√∏set anger management model in reducing violent behavior amongst clients who are violent in intimate partnerships and who voluntarily seek help. Violence in intimate partnerships constitutes a serious problem worldwide and there is reason to believe that cognitive behavior therapy has some effect on the reduction of violent behavior. However, there are currently too few randomized controlled studies to conclude about the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy for this client group.</brief_summary>
