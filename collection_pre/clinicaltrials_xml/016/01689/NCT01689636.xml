	<brief_summary>Open-label, single-center, single-treatment group, baseline-controlled (for safety) study of the safety and biodistribution of Technetium Tc 99m EC20 in four normal subjects and four subjects with known or suspected ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Biodistribution of Technetium Tc 99m EC20 in Normal Volunteers and Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single-center, open-label evaluation of a single injection of Tc 99m EC20 containing 0.1 mg EC20 labeled with 15 - 20 mCi of technetium-99m in normal volunteers and patients with known or suspected ovarian cancer. Two normal volunteers and two patients also were to receive an injection of 0.25 - 2.0 mg folic acid 1 to 2 minutes prior to the injection of Tc 99m EC20. Serial blood samples and urine were collected during the 24-hour period following each injection for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Serial whole body images were acquired during the 24-hour postdose period for dosimetry evaluations. Safety was monitored through predose and postdose physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs and clinical laboratory evaluations. Adverse events were monitored from the time of signing of Informed Consent to 24 hours postdose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects were to be females 18 years of age or older who met the following criteria: 1. The four normal subjects were to be normal, as established by medical history, physical examination, and laboratory data, including CBC, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. 2. The two subjects with obvious advanced stage ovarian cancer were to have either histopathologically proven stage 3 or 4 disease or clinically obvious disease defined by 2 of the following 3 conditions: (1) pelvic mass (2) omental "caking", or (3) ascites. 3. Subjects were to have newly diagnosed, treatment refractory, or recurrent disease. Subjects were to be treatment na√Øve or at least 2 months since last nonsurgical treatment. Subjects were to have normal kidney and liver function. 4. The two subjects with suspected ovarian cancer were to have a known mass. Subjects were to have normal kidney and liver function. 5. Subjects were to provide informed consent prior to enrollment. The following subjects were to be excluded: 1. Subject was pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Subject was simultaneously participating in another investigative drug or device study, or had completed followup phase of any previous study within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study. 3. Subject had a known history of chronic abuse of drugs or alcohol or had tested positive in the prestudy urine drug abuse screen. 4. Subject was currently taking folic acid supplements and could not stop taking the supplements for a period of 3 days (2 days prior to the study and one day after last imaging procedure). 5. Subject had physical condition that was unsuitable for radionuclide imaging. 6. Subject had been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere with the assessment of the biodistribution of Technetium Tc 99m EC20.</criteria>
