	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine (ADACEL®, Tdap vaccine) as a booster dose in adolescents in Japan. Primary Objective: - To assess the immunogenicity of Tdap (SP306) when administered as a single dose in Japanese adolescents Secondary Objective: - To assess the safety of Tdap vaccine when administered as a single dose in Japanese adolescents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (ADACEL®) as a Booster in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive a single booster dose of Tdap vaccine (ADACEL®) on Day 0 and undergo immunogenicity assessment from blood samples provided prior to, and 28 days post-vaccination.
