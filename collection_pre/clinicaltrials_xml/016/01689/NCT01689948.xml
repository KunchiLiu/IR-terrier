	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly patients. By its prevalence and its medical and social consequences, AD represents a dual challenge to public health and society. The elderly want to stay in their homes even when their lives are altered by a chronic progressive disease. Their caregivers claim in turn a support at home. But this desire is questioned because of the characteristics of the disease, e.g. the altered relational function by the cognitive impairment and the behavioural disorders associated. Outpatients non-drug therapies represent a potential support that adapts to patient with an AD or mixed dementia, especially in their milder forms. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a weekly rehabilitation's intervention at home and its acceptability by both the patient and the caregiver. The study of its efficiency in terms of autonomy will be the next step.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alzheimer Disease : Rehabilitation's Intervention at Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol is based on weekly rehabilitation's intervention at home. All home visits and assessments of the patient and his caregiver will be made by the rehabilitation's therapist himself. Twelve weekly interventions at home are planed. The first five are needed to define a realistic and achievable goal of treatment which is accepted by the dyad and the therapist. The following seven interventions will achieve this goal by rehabilitation's intervention (e.g. occupational therapy, psychomotor approach). Four filmed sessions for dyad's assessment are planned (at inclusion, at weeks 5 and 12 after inclusion and 3 months after the last intervention).</detailed_description>
