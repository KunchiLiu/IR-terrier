	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sprifermin (AS902330) (recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-18 [rhFGF-18]) as an adjunct treatment to subjects following microfracture (MFx) surgery for cartilage injury of the knee. Primary Objectives - To evaluate the effect of Sprifermin (AS902330) intra-articular knee injections as adjunct to microfracture (MFx) surgery on the composition of the refilled cartilage in the target knee, as measured by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cartilage (dGEMRIC) time constant 1 (T1) relaxation time at 6 months after MFx surgery - To evaluate the safety profile of Sprifermin (AS902330) when administered intra-articular into the knee as adjunct to MFx surgery in subjects with cartilage injury of the knee Secondary Objectives - To further support the efficacy and safety of Sprifermin (AS902330) as an adjunct to MFx for cartilage injury repair through symptomatic outcomes and quantitative MRI measurement</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with candidature for MFx surgery on the femoral articular surfaces (medial or lateral condyles or trochlear groove), with intact subchondral bone Subjects with moderate to severe pain in the target knee prior to surgery; average score greater than equal to (&gt;=) 4.0 over 7 consecutive days on numeric rating scale of pain intensity (completed within 30 [+15] days before surgery) Intraoperative inclusion criteria: Subjects with 1 or 2 focal chondral lesions per target knee, where peripheral debridement to healthy cartilage results in all of the following: Each lesion has an area of &gt;= 1 square centimeter (cm^2) and less than equal to (&lt;=) 4 cm^2 Each lesion is &lt;= 6 millimeter (mm) in depth, as measured from the surrounding subchondral plate Arthroscopic confirmation that each nonosteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesion is between International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Grades I and III (D); a Grade III nonOCD lesion is equivalent to an Outerbridge Grade IV lesion with minimal subchondral bone loss Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria could apply Subjects with prior marrow stimulation treatment of the target knee, that is, MFx, microdrilling, abrasion chondroplasty or cartilage repair including, but not limited to, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), matrix/membrane autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI), or osteochondral transplantation (autologous or allogeneic) Subjects with body mass index (BMI) of greater than 35 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) at screening Malalignment of the target knee greater than 5 degrees as measured from the mechanical axis, as confirmed by alignment (long bone) Xray images Subjects with clinical and/or radiographic disease diagnosis of the target knee joint including, but not limited to the following: generalized osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis, or avascular necrosis Subjects who have any contraindication to MRI or gadoliniumbased or iodinated contrast agents according to the site's standard practice guidelines Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria could apply</criteria>
