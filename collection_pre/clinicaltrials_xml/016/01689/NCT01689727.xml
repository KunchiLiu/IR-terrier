	<brief_summary>Many types of cancers overexpress a receptor for the vitamin folate (Folate Receptor). This Phase 2 study will utilize a standard imaging radionuclide, technetium-99m, conjugated to a ligand (EC20) designed to bind to the folate receptor. The study is designed as an open-label, baseline-controlled study.</brief_summary>
