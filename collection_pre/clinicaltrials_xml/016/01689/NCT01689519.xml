	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib (GDC-0973), compared with vemurafenib and placebo, in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by the study site investigator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Study Comparing Vemurafenib vs Vemurafenib Plus Cobimetinib (GDC-0973) in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Melanoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with histologically confirmed melanoma, either unresectable stage IIIc or stage IV metastatic melanoma, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition. Unresectability of stage IIIc disease must have confirmation from a surgical oncologist. Patients must be naïve to treatment for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced disease; stage IIIc and IV). Prior adjuvant immunotherapy (including ipilimumab) is allowed. Documentation of BRAF V600 mutationpositive status in melanoma tumor tissue (archival or newly obtained tumor samples) using the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test. Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Consent to provide archival for biomarker analyses. Consent to undergo tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. Adequate hematologic and end organ function. History of prior rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) or mitogenactivated protein kinase (MEK) pathway inhibitor treatment. Palliative radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Major surgery or traumatic injury within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment. Active malignancy other than melanoma that could potentially interfere with the interpretation of efficacy measures. Patients with a previous malignancy within the past 3 years are excluded except for patients with resected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, melanoma insitu, carcinoma insitu of the cervix, and carcinoma insitu of the breast. History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmological examination that is considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration. Uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure. Serum cholesterol ≥ Grade 2. Hypertriglyceridemia ≥ Grade 2. Hyperglycemia (fasting) ≥ Grade 2. History of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) lesions (including carcinomatous meningitis) are excluded. However, patients are eligible if: 1. All known CNS lesions have been treated with stereotactic therapy or surgery, AND 2. There has been no evidence of clinical and radiographic disease progression in the CNS for ≥ 3 weeks after radiotherapy or surgery. Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease. History of malabsorption or other condition that would interfere with absorption of study drugs. Pregnant, lactating, or breast feeding women.</criteria>
