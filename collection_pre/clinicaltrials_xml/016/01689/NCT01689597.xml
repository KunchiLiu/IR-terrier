	<brief_summary>This pilot study intends to establish the efficacy of 2 different doses of epidural morphine for pain management after perineal trauma when using multimodal analgesia as well as the feasibility of conducting a larger randomized clinical trial. Women with traumatic vaginal delivery will be randomized into 3 groups with 10 patients each and receive 2.5 mg epidural morphine, 1.25 mg epidural morphine, or epidural saline. The primary outcome is total opioid consumption for breakthrough pain in the first 24 hours.</brief_summary>
