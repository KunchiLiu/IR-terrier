	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of steady-state concentrations (constant concentration of medication in the blood) of TMC435 on the single dose pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) of atorvastatin, the active metabolites ortho- and parahydroxylated atorvastatin, simvastatin and the active metabolite simvastatin acid. Plasma hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitory activity after a single dose of atorvastatin or simvastatin, either alone or in combination with TMC435 will be also evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between TMC435, Atorvastatin and Simvastatin in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, 2-panel, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study in healthy participants to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between TMC435 and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and simvastatin. The study consists of a screening period (21 days prior to the first intake of study medication), a 17-day treatment period and a 5-7 days follow-up period. Approximately thirty six healthy participants will be equally divided to 2 panels (n=18 per panel). Within each panel all participants will receive the same treatments in the same order. In Panel 1, each participant will be administered a single oral 40-mg atorvastatin dose on Day 1 and Day 13. The participants will receive TMC435 at a dose of 150 mg once daily from Day 4 until Day 15. In Panel 2, each participant will be administered a single oral 40-mg simvastatin dose on Day 1 and Day 13. TMC435 at a dose of 150 mg will be administered once daily from Day 4 until Day 15. Treatment duration (including Day -1) will be 17 days for both panels (Panel 1 and Panel 2). Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study.</detailed_description>
