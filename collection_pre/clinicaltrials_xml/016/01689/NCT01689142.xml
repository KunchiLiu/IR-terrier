	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus in terms of change of HbA1c from baseline to endpoint (scheduled at month 6 [week 26]) in japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary Objectives: To compare a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus in terms of change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), preinjection plasma glucose, 8-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profile. To compare a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus in terms of occurrence of hypoglycemia</brief_summary>
