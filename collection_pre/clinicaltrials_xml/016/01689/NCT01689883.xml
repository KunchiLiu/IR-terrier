	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the study is to test whether the use of small electrical currents to stimulate proprioceptors of the upper limb can result into enhancing the benefits of robotic-assisted therapy. The stimulation technique used is "Stochastic Resonance" (SR). In previous studies, it has been shown that SR has the effect of increasing afferent traffic from Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles. This effect is referred to as "sensory enhancement". Also, SR has been shown to improve the results of physical therapy in an animal model. The study is intended to explore the use of SR in stroke survivors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1: To establish a procedure to optimize the delivery of the SR stimulation to the target organs. The investigators hypothesize that there is an optimal level of stimulation for an individual that will lead to the highest level of sensory enhancement. The investigators will determine such level of stimulation by measuring the impact of different stimulation levels on the quality of the movements performed by subjects while being stimulated. Aim 2: To gather preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of SR stimulation in stroke rehabilitation. The investigators plan to combine the optimal SR stimulation, determined in Aim 1, with robotic-assisted rehabilitation to perform a preliminary assessment of the size of the improvement associated with the delivery of SR stimulation. The investigators hypothesize that robotic-assisted rehabilitation in combination with SR stimulation of proprioceptors leads to larger motor gains than robotic-assisted rehabilitation alone.</detailed_description>
