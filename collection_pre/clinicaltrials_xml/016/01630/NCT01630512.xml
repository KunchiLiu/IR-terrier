	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Depression in Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a common co-morbidity of diabetes, negatively affecting physical performance, glycemic control, adherence to medication, and dietary, and exercise recommendations. Modalities of psychotherapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can reduce depressive symptoms in patients with medical conditions. However, proper designed randomized trials assessing and comparing effectiveness of these psychological interventions are rare. This longitudinal study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CBT and MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in diabetes patients. Furthermore, potential moderators and mediators of treatment effect will be explored, as well as the role of common factors and treatment integrity.</detailed_description>
