	<brief_summary>Strokes are the first cause of acquired physical disability among adults. Some studies proved that depression is often an unrecognized complication from stroke, associated with a vital prognosis, functional and cognitive pejorative diagnosis. It led us to pose the hypothesis of the existence of a particular psychological state after stroke particularly favorable to a psychotherapeutic alliance. So, this longitudinal monocentric study aims to estimate the feasibility of a talk therapy and its impact on the anxio-depressive symptomatology after stroke.</brief_summary>
