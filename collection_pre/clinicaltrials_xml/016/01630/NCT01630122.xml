	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel, validated panel of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) histology-predictive genes (the "A/S signature) as a diagnostic tool for use with small-volume Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) biopsies. Objectives: 1. To establish FNA biopsy requirements for FNA-based subtype classification of NSCLC. 2. To define a "fixed statistical model" of histologic subtype prediction in NSCLC. Study methods: To establish FNA biopsy requirements for gene expression-based subtype classification of NSCLC, patients with presumed newly diagnosed NSCLC, where radiographic studies and clinical description favor a probable diagnosis of NSCLC, will undergo FNA biopsy according to current standard techniques . For this part of the study, approximately 40 biopsies of confirmed NSCLC will be collected for analysis. To define a fixed statistical model of histologic subtype prediction in NSCLC, we will prospectively collect 50 FNAs. These FNAs will represent Adenocarcinoma (AC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) cases at a ratio of approximately 1:1. Additional cases of not otherwise specified (NOS), should they be encountered, may also be collected for later analysis. FNA samples qualified based on cell number or ribonucleic acid (RNA) yield (depending on the findings of our primary objective)will be assayed on the QGS platform.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients undergoing a diagnostic FNA by the following diagnostic modalities utilizing FNA: Transthoracic Needle Biopsy (TNB), Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUSTBNA), Transesophageal Ultrasound Scanning with FNA (EUSFNA). Patients must have radiographic evidence for presumed lung cancer or have a previously diagnosed NSCLC with potential recurrence. Patient undergoing FNA of potential NSCLC metastatic lesions are also included (e.g., patients with hepatic metastases). Age &gt;18 years. Used to define adult age who can independently provide consent. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients whose FNA biopsy is unable to provide subtype classification by pathology or is nondiagnostic.</criteria>
