	<brief_summary>The Re-Shape CV-Risk Study is a clinical study where renal adrenergic denervation (RDN) is done in high risk patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. RDN is a mini-invasive, percutaneous technique where an ablation catheter is inserted through a femoral artery into the renal arteries, for destruction of the adrenergic nerve bundles in the artery adventitia by means of radio-frequency ablation. RDN leads to sympathetic denervation of the kidneys, which in the "Symplicity trials" led to an impressive reduction of blood pressure (- 33 /-11 mmHg). In a pilot study, where 40 % of the patients had diabetes, RDN seemed to have beneficial effects not only on blood pressure, but also on insulin sensitivity and hyperinsulinaemia. The investigators aim to introduce RDN as a clinical study where blood pressure reduction and methodical, technical aspects will be evaluated, but more importantly, also additional effects of RDN on sub-clinical organ damage (endothelial function, vascular stiffness, fundus-, heart-, kidney injury), quality of life, arrhythmia, and glucose metabolism. The investigators hypothesis is that RDN will have positive effect on glucose metabolism, QOL and sub-clinical organ damage.</brief_summary>
