	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Doses of Carbetocin for Prevention of Uterine Atony, During Elective Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the world, and it is most often caused by uterine atony. To prevent this complication, uterotonic medication is used during elective cesarean section. Carbetocin, a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin, has been used for this purpose for many years. This medication has numerous side effects: hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, etc. Using a smaller dose of carbetocin might lower the incidence of these side effects, without compromising prevention of uterine atony in a low-risk group of patient.</detailed_description>
