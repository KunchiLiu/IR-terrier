	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to 12 month) safety and effectiveness of a Nitinol Self-Expanding Paclitaxel-Eluting stent for the treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia (i.e. rest pain or non-healing foot ulcers) due to the presence of arterial lesions in the below-the-knee arteries of maximally 50mm long.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient presenting with rest pain or minor tissue loss (Rutherford Clinical Category 4 or 5) Patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations at the specified times Patient is &gt;18 years old Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study Patient has a projected lifeexpectancy of at least 12 months Patient is eligible for treatment with a SelfExpanding PaclitaxelEluting stent Male, infertile female, or female of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study procedure Evidence at screening of ≥50% de novo lesion (or restenosis after previous PTA) in the infrapopliteal arteries, confirmed by angiography Reference vessel diameter visually estimated to be ≥3.0mm and ≤4.5mm Identifiable distal target vessel which upon completion of the intervention, is anticipated to provide reconstitution of blood flow to the foot. Guidewire successfully traversed lesion Length of target lesion is &lt;50mm Untreated flowlimiting inflow lesions Perioperative unsuccessful ipsilateral percutaneous vascular procedure to treat inflow disease just prior to enrollment Has had a previous peripheral bypass affecting the target limb Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or nonstudy limb Nonatherosclerothic disease resulting in occlusion (e.g. embolism, Buerger's disease, vasculitis) Patient has a contraindication or known untreated allergy to antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, thrombolytic drugs or any other drug anticipated to be used Patient has hypersensitivity to contrast or device material that cannot be adequately pretreated Patient has known uncontrollable hypercoagulable condition, or refuses blood transfusion Life expectancy of less than 12 months Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that may clinically interfere with the study endpoints Patient has other comorbid condition(s) that in the judgment of the physician precludes safe percutaneous intervention Has endstage renal disease defined as undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure Known allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated prior to the study procedure Patient with known hypersensitivity to heparin, including those patients who have had a previous incidence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT)type II Treatment of ipsilateral nonstudy inflow lesions with other materials than regular guidewires, regular PTA balloons, bare metal stents and/or paclitaxelcoated stents Additional treatments of the study lesion requiring materials/procedures other than standard guidewires, regular PTA balloons and/or a SelfExpanding PaclitaxelEluting stent (e.g. thrombectomy, reentry catheters, CTOwires, cutting balloon, cryoballoon, etc)</criteria>
