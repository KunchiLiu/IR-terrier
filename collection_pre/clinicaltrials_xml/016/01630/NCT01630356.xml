	<brief_summary>This study was designed to test the hypothesis whether a novel intervention that uses motivational interviewing along with immediate feedback and follow-up counseling calls is effective in educating the household members about the health hazards of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure and reducing children exposure to secondhand smoke at households in Armenia. The study was a randomized control trial with two arms: intervention and control groups. The sample population for the study included households with a non-smoking mother and at least one child 2 to 6 years of age residing with at least one daily smoker. The study team recruited the households through pediatrician's offices in polyclinics (primary healthcare facilities) utilizing multistage random sampling. Trained interviewers made two baseline (one week apart) and two 4-month follow-up household visits to conduct measurements, interviews and intervention. Measurements included surveys, air nicotine monitoring in homes and hair samples from children to assess changes in nicotine concentration over time. SHS concentration was estimated by sampling vapor-phase nicotine using a filter badge treated with sodium bisulfate. Airborne nicotine monitors were used in all homes to measure SHS concentration at baseline and 4 month follow-up. At least one monitor was used in each home, preferably in the main room in which the family congregates. Personal exposure to SHS in 2-6 years old children was assessed using biological samples of hair. A small sample of hair (approximately 30 - 50 strands, 2-3 cm) was cut near the hair root from the back of the scalp where there is the most uniform growth pattern between individuals which minimizes the variability of the results. The intervention included an in-person counseling session with distribution of a tailored educational brochure and demonstration/feedback measurement of indoor PM2.5 (at second baseline visit); it also included one and two months follow-up counseling calls. The control group received only a brief educational leaflet on the hazards of second-hand smoke exposure.</brief_summary>
