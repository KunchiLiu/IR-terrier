	<brief_title>Contact Force Sensing Use in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compares patients who have this procedure where this contact information is known (unblinded) versus those where the contact information is not known (blinded). The outcome is the rate of acute reconnection at 1 hour after achieving pulmonary vein isolation.</detailed_description>
