	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to assess the therapeutic effects and the safety profile of IMAB362 combined with EOX (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine) as first-line treatment for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach, the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction compared to EOX alone. Furthermore, sufficient binding of IMAB362 to the target cells is necessary for antitumoral activity. Thus, two dose levels ensuring a serum level above the in vitro predicted clinical efficacy threshold will be investigated.</brief_summary>
