	<brief_summary>Men with castrate resistant prostate cancer who are switched from a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists from a LHRH agonist will experience a fall in prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Switching to a Lutenizing Hormone-releasing Hormone (LHRH) Antagonist From a LHRH Agonist to Treat Progressive Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the proportion of patients with castrate resistant Prostate Cancer who have a PSA decline of ≥50% from baseline PSA when switched from an LHRH agonist to an LHRH antagonist.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate currently receiving LHRH agonist Antiandrogen oral therapy is permitted but will be discontinued upon enrollment PSA &gt; 2 ng/ml rising PSA despite LHRH agonist patients may or may not have clinical evidence off metastases. If metastases are present, they must be asymptomatic and in bone or lymph node only Prior chemotherapy allowed ECOG performance status 01 Patients with a history of other active malignancies, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 3 years. Other serious illness, psychiatric or medical condition that would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol including: i)Significant cardiovascular condition including but not limited to: uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, significant congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or cerebrovascular attack within the last 6 months. ii) History of significant neurological disorder that would impair the ability to obtain consent</criteria>
