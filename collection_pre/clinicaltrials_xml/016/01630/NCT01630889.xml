	<brief_title>Open Label Extension Study for the Long-term Efficacy and Safety of FG-4592 in Dialysis and Non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, long-term maintenance study of FG-4592 anemia therapy in dialysis and non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease patients who have completed the Treatment Period of an FG-4592 FibroGen-sponsored anemia Study. Subjects assigned to FG-4592 in the previous study will continue to receive the same FG-4592 dose and dosing frequency, unless a dose adjustment is required. An optional treatment group may allow subjects assigned to placebo in the previous study to start active FG-4592 study treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Minimum age 18 years 2. Completed the Treatment Period of an ongoing FG4592 FibroGensponsored anemia study in the U.S. Exclusion Criteria 1. Subjects assigned to epoetin alfa in a previous ongoing FG4592 anemia study 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding females 3. Females of childbearing potential, unless using contraception as detailed in the protocol; male subjects with sexual partners of childbearing potential who are not on birth control unless the male subject agrees to use contraception 4. Subjects who received FG4592 in a previous study that did not demonstrate adequate hemoglobin response per the investigator's clinical judgment 5. Any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator may pose a safety risk to a subject in this study, or which may interfere with study participation</criteria>
