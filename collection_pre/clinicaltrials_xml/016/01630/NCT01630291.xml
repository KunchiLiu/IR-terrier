	<brief_title>The Effect of Electrical Stimulation on Tear Production</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-randomized, open-label study designed to investigate the feasibility of a novel treatment for severe Dry Eye Disease, which involves safe delivery of small electrical currents to the lacrimal nerve to induce tear production.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Schirmer test with topical anesthesia of â‰¤ 5 mm/5 min in at least one eye Sum of corneal and interpalpebral conjunctival staining of &gt; +5 in the same eye where corneal staining is &gt; +2 using the CLEK criteria. Individuals with the presence or history of any ocular disorder or condition (including ocular surgery, trauma, and disease) that could possibly interfere with the interpretation of the study results. Individuals who have had LASIK or other refractive surgeries are eligible. Excluded conditions include: History of orbital trauma History of orbital surgery Orbital cancer History of orbital cancer Within the 3 months before the Screening Visit, known history of ocular infection (viral, bacterial, fungal), inflammation not associated with dry eye, or active ocular herpes</criteria>
