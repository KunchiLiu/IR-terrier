	<brief_summary>The goals of the KNOW-CKD (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease) study are 1) to establish a CKD cohort representing Korean CKD population for up to 10-year follow-up, and 2) to investigate the renal progression, mortality, complications, risk factors, role of biochemical parameters and the genetic influence. KNOW-CKD Research Group comprises nephrologists, pediatric nephrologists, epidemiologists and statisticians from eleven centers in Korea. KNOW-CKD will enroll 2,850 individuals with CKD stage from 1 to 5 between 2011 and 2015 and follow them up to 10 years. Dialyzed patients or those with allograft kidney are excluded. At enrollment and at pre-specified intervals, laboratory tests will be conducted on the kidney function, biochemical profiles, anemia, cardiovascular complication (echocardiography, coronary CT, arterial stiffness), and mineral bone disorder. A biobank is also established for the DNA, serum and urine at regular interval. Information on the medical history, health questionnaires, QoL will also be collected. Web-based case-report forms (CRF) is developed for the systemic management of the patient data.</brief_summary>
