	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to study the effect of Denosumab on Bone Mineral Density, Standardised Uptake Value and bone metabolism in patients with total hip arthroplasty. The primary hypothesis is to demonstrate that Denosumab is superior to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Denosumab on Periprosthetic Bone After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical study with 64 patients, age 35-65 years, with unilateral osteoarthritis of the hip, randomised to two groups of patients, either receiving Denosumab or placebo The patients will operated with an uncemented total hip arthroplasty with a Continuum acetabular cup with trabecular surface (Tantalum) and longevity Highly Cross-linked Polyethylene liner, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA, and a CFP femoral stem with Titanium surface and a chrome cobalt 28 mm head, Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany. Clinical outcome evaluated by Harris Hip Score and EQ-5D, Bone Mineral Density by DXA, Standardised Uptake Value of Fluoride tracer, by PET/CT and biochemical markers for bone formation and bone resorption will be analyzed together with conventional radiology for implant position and fixation.</detailed_description>
