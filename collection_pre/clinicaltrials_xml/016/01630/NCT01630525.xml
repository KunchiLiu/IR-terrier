	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a prolonged prodromal phase before the stage of dementia. Subtle executive cognitive function deficits can be detected at this early pre-dementia phase, more than 10 years before dementia. Among them, the digit symbol substitution task (DSST) has been shown to be altered very early, up to 13 years before dementia. This test, as many others executive function tests, requires a fine control of visuomotor coordination. Like executive functions, eye movements, particularly voluntary-guided saccades, are under the control of the frontal lobe and fronto-parietal networks. Previous studies have shown a deterioration of voluntary saccades in AD using various paradigms. There are no data in prodromal AD, although the pathological process of the disease affects very early brain structures implicated in saccades execution (eg. caudate nucleus and pre-cuneus).</brief_summary>
