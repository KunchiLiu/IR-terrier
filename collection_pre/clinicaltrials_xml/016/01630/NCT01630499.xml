	<brief_summary>Breast cancer risk, and risk of related health problems (e.g., heart disease), is highest among women with a history of breast cancer (stages 1-3) who are also overweight or obese. The purpose of this study is to compare a tailored nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral weight management program for breast cancer survivors against a widely available commercial weight management program. We hypothesize that an intervention tailored to the unique psychological, nutritional and physical needs of breast cancer survivors will provide superior physiological and psychological benefits compared to an existing commercial program.</brief_summary>
