	<brief_summary>Background: In recent years, probiotics have shown promise in treating a variety of diseases. Previously, the investigators have reported on the clinical efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242 in improving the lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic adults. Objective: The purpose of the study is to determine the lipid lowering efficacy of a One-a-Day probiotic supplement capsule containing Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242 over 12 weeks in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Design: The study design is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm, multi-centre study. The study will last a total of 14 weeks, including a 2-week run-in period and a 12-week intervention period.</brief_summary>
