	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Therapy for Refractory Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR) in Kidney Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of de novo donor specific antibody-mediated rejection. Optimizing baseline immunosuppression (calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), anti-proliferative agent, and anti-inflammatory) is considered foundational but is insufficient. Pulse steroids are routinely used. A number of immunosuppressive approaches have been tried in uncontrolled trials. The strongest evidence, at least for early antibody-mediated rejection (&lt; 6 months from transplant), exists for plasmapheresis, with or without low dose IVIg, or high dose IVIg alone. However, as noted in a recent FDA workshop, "while the literature suggests that [these agents] have evidence of efficacy for the management of acute antibody-mediated rejection, and could be considered as standard of care, treatment regimes have not been standardized or optimized." Moreover the evidence supporting efficacy of this approach in late, as opposed to early antibody-mediated rejection is distinctly lacking.</detailed_description>
