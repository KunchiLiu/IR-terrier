	<brief_title>Study of Human Central Nervous System Stem Cells (HuCNS-SC) in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label dose-escalation investigation of the safety and preliminary efficacy of unilateral subretinal transplantation of HuCNS-SC cells in subjects with Geographic Atrophy secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Subjects will be enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated at regular post transplant intervals. The investigation will be divided into two sequential cohorts. Subjects will be enrolled into each cohort based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) visual acuity as determined by the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) acuity test. BCVA of less than or equal to 20/400 in the Study Eye will be enrolled in Cohort I. Subjects with BCVA of 20/320 to 20/100 in the Study Eye will be enrolled in Cohort II. Cohort I will consist of four subjects who will undergo transplant with 200,000 cells followed by four subjects who will undergo transplant with 1 million cells. Cohort II will consist of 7 subjects who will undergo transplant with 1 million cells. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review accruing safety data for all subjects. HuCNS-SC cells will be transplanted by a board-certified vitreoretinal surgeon. The transplantation will be conducted in the eye with the inferior best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (i.e., the Study Eye). Only the Study Eye will undergo transplantation. The HuCNS-SC cells will be administered into the subretinal space through a standard surgical approach. Immunosuppressive agents will be administered orally to all subjects for a period of three months after surgery. Subjects will be monitored frequently for a total of one year after HuCNS-SC cell transplantation. An additional four years of monitoring will be conducted in a separate follow-up study that will commence with the termination visit of the Phase I/II investigation. The follow-up study will be conducted as a separate investigation.</detailed_description>
