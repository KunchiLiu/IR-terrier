	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to improve magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans by reducing the time required for imaging. Experience has shown that unpleasant side-effects from magnetic pulses used in MRI (for example, tingling or tapping sensations) can be reduced when the magnetic pulses are shortened. In this study, we will explore whether this effect holds true when very short magnetic pulses are applied.</brief_summary>
