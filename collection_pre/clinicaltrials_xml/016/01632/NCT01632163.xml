	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To assess the effects on glycemic control of lixisenatide in comparison to placebo as an add-on treatment to basal insulin with or without metformin in terms of HbA1c reduction over a period of 24 weeks in insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetic patients. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the effects of lixisenatide over 24 weeks on : - percentage of patients reaching HbA1c&lt;7% or ≤6.5%, - 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) and plasma glucose (PG) excursions during standardized meal challenge test, - fasting plasma glucose (FPG), - change in 7-point self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) profile), - body weight, - change in daily basal insulin dose. - To assess lixisenatide safety and tolerability. - To assess anti-lixisenatide antibody development.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosed for at least 1 year at the time of the screening visit insufficiently controlled with basal insulin± metformin. Exclusion criteria: At screening: Age &lt; legal age of adulthood. HbA1c&lt;7% or &gt;10.5%. Basal insulin treatment has not been at a stable regimen for at least 3 months and at a stable dose (± 20%) of at least 15 U/day for at least 2 months prior to screening visit. If metformin is given, metformin treatment has not been at a stable dose of at least 1.0 g/day for at least 3 months prior to screening visit. History of hypoglycemia unawareness. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤20 kg/m². Use of other oral or injectable glucoselowering agents other than basal insulin or metformin within 3 months prior to the time of screening. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
