	<brief_summary>This study will assess the uptake, acceptability, safety, and feasibility of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), consisting of a once-daily fixed-dose combination tablet of emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), administered at sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics and a community health center in the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Administered at Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A previous study (iPrEx) showed that daily PrEP with FTC/TDF provided with a comprehensive package of prevention services is effective in preventing HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). The PrEP administered in that study was given in the context of a research setting/controlled trial, but it is important to evaluate the acceptability, sustainability, and safety of PrEP in a "real world" setting. This study will evaluate PrEP administered to HIV-uninfected MSM and transgender females at two STD clinics and one community health center in the United States. Each participant will receive PrEP for up to 1 year and will have up to 8 study visits. PrEP will consist of one fixed-dose FTC/TDF combination tablet orally each day. All participants will have study visits at screening, enrollment, and 4 weeks after enrollment; participants will continue to have visits at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52 if they do not seroconvert. Participants who seroconvert will discontinue PrEP and will have a post-drug discontinuation visit 4 weeks after discontinuing PrEP. At most visits, participants will undergo blood, urine, and hair sample collection; give a medical history; undergo a physical exam; receive risk-reduction counseling and condoms; undergo testing for HIV and other STDs; receive study drugs; and undergo a pill count and adherence assessment (follow-up visits only). For participants who stop taking the study drug but remain in the study, urine, blood, and hair samples will not be collected at 12-week follow-up visits if all stop procedures have been completed and if there are no lab abnormalities that require additional follow-up. Participants will also answer questionnaires at screening, 12-week visits, and at study exit.</detailed_description>
