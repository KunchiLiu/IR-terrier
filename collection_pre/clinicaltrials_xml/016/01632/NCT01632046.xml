	<brief_summary>Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is the preferred treatment modality in children with end-stage renal disease. Unfortunately progressive alterations of the peritoneal membrane occur with time on PD, leading to a continuous loss of peritoneal transport function. Recently, double-chambered PD solutions with less Glucose Degradation Products (GDPs) and neutral pH have been approved for the European market. Short term administration suggests comparable clearance rates compared with conventional solutions. In vitro studies demonstrate an improved local immune defense system. To compensate for metabolic acidosis, the available solutions either contain lactate or bicarbonate, the impact of either buffer on long term acidosis control and peritoneal membrane integrity, however, is unknown. The prospective, European multi-center study will provide the first long term administration of pH neutral, low GDP solutions in children. 60 children will randomly be treated with a bicarbonate (BicaVera) and a lactate based solution (Balance), respectively. The primary end point will be the effect of either PD-solution on peritoneal transport characteristics (D/P Creatinine). Secondary end-points will be the effects on ultrafiltration capacity, acid-base balance, peritoneal morphology, incidence and severity of peritonitis, and on surrogate parameters of biocompatibility and carbonyl stress. Moreover, potential genetic determinants of the peritoneal transporter status and of the continued morphological transformation of the peritoneum will be assessed. After a 2 month run-in period, using a conventional, acidic, single-chambered PD-solution, the patients will be randomized to a 10 month study period using BicaVera and Balance, respectively. Dialysis regime and follow up in the out-patient clinic will be performed according to clinical needs (every 4 weeks); episodes of peritonitis will be treated according to international guidelines. Bicarbonate supplements will be prescribed at a dose of 0.5 mmol/kg *d, if blood bicarbonate levels fall below 17 mmol/l. PD adequacy will be verified by routine, monthly venous blood sampling and a capillary blood gas analysis. 2-5 ml of blood will be drawn for analysis of relevant gene polymorphisms. At study entry, after 3, 6 and 10 months, a 24h dialysate- and urine collection, a peritoneal equilibration test an intraperitoneal pressure measurement will be performed. Peritoneal biopsies will be obtained at any time of abdominal surgery. Adverse events will be screened meticulously. The trial will be carried out in accordance with the German medicines act (AMG) and other local requirements, with particular reference to the ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the declaration of Helsinki. At study end, the patients will decide together with the responsible physician which PD-fluid should be used further one.</brief_summary>
