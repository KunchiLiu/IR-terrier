	<brief_title>Intracoronary Stenting and Angiographic Results: Optimizing Treatment of Drug Eluting Stent In-Stent Restenosis 4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal treatment of in-BMS-restenosis seems to be implantation of a DES which is supported by a large body of evidence. Nevertheless, several recent published studies have shown a substantial reduction in late lumen loss and angiographic restenosis using paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) for restenotic lesions. Given the increased world-wide use of DES and the use of DES in increasingly complex coronary disease patterns, the number of patients presenting with restenosis after DES implantation will further increase in the coming decade. Data regarding the optimal treatment of in-DES-restenosis are very limited: Implanting a new DES for in-DES-restenosis has been reported to associate with repeat restenosis rates as high as 20%. In addition, an increased risk of stent thrombosis has been associated with complex stenting and with additional DES implantation. Thus, for lesions which develop restenosis after LES implantation, the optimal treatment strategy remains unknown. Few results on small sample-size populations have been reported in patients treated with scoring or cutting balloon (SCB) technology for treatment of BMS restenosis as compared to plain balloon angioplasty. Moreover, the efficacy of SCB angioplasty in DES restenosis has not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, the potential additive benefit of SCB angioplasty in patients undergoing PCB therapy remains to be elucidated. The hypothesis behind this concept is that the application of SCB prior to deployment of PCB may increase the bioavailability of paclitaxel within the restenotic tissue, and therefore may increase the efficacy of PCB. There are numerous preclinical studies to support this hypothesis, which show that lesion preparation is an important pre-requisite for the effectiveness of PCB.</detailed_description>
