	<brief_summary>Patients with unruptured brain aneurysms and pain syndromes like trigeminal neuralgias often undergo minimally invasive brain surgery with a smaller incision,shorter duration of procedure and in some patients the possibility of going home on same day. Postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting are sometimes difficult to manage with conventional medications. This affects recovery from surgery and often delays discharge from the hospital. This study looks at the use of a medication called sumatriptan which is a drug that has been used in the treatment of migraine headaches for a very long time. This drug works on the receptors in the lining of the brain and around the nerves which maybe associated with pain. The purpose of this study is to determine if this pain medication sumatriptan given at the end of the surgery improves the postoperative course in terms of less pain, less nausea and vomiting and generally having a better postoperative quality of recovery. Our main hypothesis is that subcutaneous sumatriptan (6mg) administered at the end of surgery will improve the postoperative quality of recovery at 24 hours after elective minimally invasive craniotomies.</brief_summary>
