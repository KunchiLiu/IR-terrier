	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if antiretroviral therapy (ART) is safe and works at getting rid of malaria in blood and to see whether one type of ART is better than another. This study may offer information for further research in looking at whether ART plays a role in the prevention and treatment of malaria.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection CD4+ count &gt; 200 and &lt; 350 cells/mm3 obtained within 30 days prior to study entry at a DAIDSapproved laboratory. Pf SCP confirmed in a laboratory approved to conduct parasitemia microscopy. Note: Pf SCP will be defined as meeting all three of the following criteria within 72 hours prior to study entry: Microscopy confirmed parasitemia (see section 6.3.6 and the A5297 Manual of Procedures [MOPS]) An oral temperature &lt; 37.5Â°C temperature The absence of Grade 2 or greater signs or symptoms thought to be related to clinical malaria including: 1. headache 2. malaise or fatigue 3. abdominal discomfort 4. muscle or joint pain 5. fever 6. chills 7. perspiration 8. anorexia 9. vomiting 10. other signs or symptoms thought to be related to clinical malaria Certain laboratory values obtained within 14 days prior to study entry, as detailed in section 4.1.4 of the protocol. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative within 30 days prior to entry. Female study volunteers of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to entry. NOTE: Female study volunteers of reproductive potential are defined as women who have reached menarche or who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months {i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months and have not undergone a sterilization procedure (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingectomy)}. Female study volunteers of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to entry. NOTE: Female study volunteers of reproductive potential are defined as women who have reached menarche or who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months {i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months and have not undergone a sterilization procedure (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingectomy)}. All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) for study duration. If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all study volunteers must agree to use two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while receiving protocolspecified medications. One form of contraceptive must be a barrier method if a participant receives EFV. Participants must agree to continue the use of two contraceptives for 6 months after stopping EFV and 6 weeks after stopping all other protocolspecified medications. Note: Female participants who are unable to meet the contraception requirements for EFV should be encouraged to consider NVP. Study volunteers who are not of reproductive potential (girls who have not reached menarche, or women who have been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, or women who have undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy, or men who have documented azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive. Acceptable documentation of sterilization, other contraceptive methods, and menopause are written documentation or oral communication from a clinician or clinician's staff documented in source documents of one of the following: Physician report/letter Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record Discharge summary Laboratory report of azoospermia (is required to document successful vasectomy) FSH measurement elevated into the menopausal range as established by the reporting laboratory for EFV and per participant's history for all other drugs. Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Willing and able to return to the clinic twice to three times a day for study visits. Step 1: Exclusion Criteria Previous history or current use of ART. Single dose NVP or dual therapies used for PMTCT within 2 years prior to entry. Use of any medication with antimalarial activity, including TMP/SMX (see list of prohibited medications in the A5297 MOPS), within 14 days prior to study entry. Confirmed or clinically suspected OIs (including but not limited to tuberculosis, clinical malaria, PCP), or other pulmonary or gastrointestinal infections for which potential participants did not complete treatment more than 30 days prior to enrollment or have signs and symptoms during screening. Breastfeeding. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or their formulation. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days prior to entry. Results suggestive of active pulmonary disease from a chest xray performed within 30 days prior to study entry. Step 2: Exclusion Criteria There are no exclusion criteria for Step 2</criteria>
