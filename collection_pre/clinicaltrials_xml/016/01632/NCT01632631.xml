	<brief_summary>Ongoing technological advances, especially in the field of image processing, have refined medical simulations to offer life-like replications of medical and surgical procedures in a variety of specialties. Patient-specific image data are incorporated into these simulations, and transformed into a 3D model. This enables the practitioner and his/her team to perform and practice 'real' cases on a virtual patient prior to performing the real procedure on the actual patient. This new technology has been referred to as 'patient-specific' rehearsal, also 'mission' or 'procedure' rehearsal. Research has already proven that simulated patient-specific rehearsal of a carotid artery stenting procedure may enhance surgical and team performance. The PROcedure rehearsal software can now also be used to practice patient-specific endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms (EVAR). The ability to rehearse a challenging and complex procedure like EVAR may not only influence device selection based on preoperative planning, but also improve the technical performance of the surgeon/radiologist and the awareness and communication within the entire endovascular team. However, further research is needed to evaluate if this new technology may enhance clinical safety and efficiency, i.e. if patients actually benefit from physicians and team members conducting patient-specific rehearsals of EVAR interventions.</brief_summary>
