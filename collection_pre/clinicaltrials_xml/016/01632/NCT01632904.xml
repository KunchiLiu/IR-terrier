	<brief_summary>The purpose of the RELIEF study is to compare symptoms in polycythemia vera (PV) subjects treated with ruxolitinib versus subjects treated with hydroxyurea (HU) as measured by the percent of subjects who achieve a clinically meaningful symptom improvement (ie, total symptom score reduction of â‰¥ 50% reduction) at Week 16 compared to Baseline. The study is also designed to demonstrate that these responses are durable with continued treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Switch Study From Hydroxyurea to Ruxolitinib for RELIEF of Polycythemia Vera Symptoms: The Relief Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study. Only subjects with PV who have received HU for at least 12 weeks, have been receiving a stable dose before screening, and still have symptoms related to PV will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment arms: A: ruxolitinib and HU-placebo B: HU and ruxolitinib-placebo Subjects randomized to either arm may be eligible to transition to open-label ruxolitinib after Week 16.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must currently be reporting symptoms while on a stable dose of HU monotherapy and be eligible to continue HU on study after randomization. Before screening, the subject must have been receiving HU for at least 12 weeks AND be receiving a stable dose. Subjects must meet baseline symptom criteria Subjects should meet at least 1 of the following criteria: No more than 2 phlebotomies within the 6 months before screening OR No palpable splenomegaly. Subjects must have a hematocrit that can be controlled within 35% to 48% (inclusive) before randomization. Subjects with inadequate liver or renal function at screening. Subjects with clinically significant infection that requires therapy Subjects with known active hepatitis A, B, or C at screening or with known HIV positivity. Subjects with an active malignancy over the previous 2 years Subjects with clinically significant cardiac disease (Class III or IV).</criteria>
