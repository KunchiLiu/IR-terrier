	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of music therapy before, during, and after cardiac catheterization is associated on (a) change in reactive hyperemia index measured before and after catheterization using peripheral arterial tonometry and (b) patient stress and discomfort measured by a questionnaire, as compared to the standard of care (no music during cardiac catheterization). The hypothesis of the study is that music therapy during cardiac catheterization will be associated with more favorable change in reactive hyperemia and higher patient satisfaction compared to no music playback.</brief_summary>
