	<brief_summary>In this project the investigators aim to improve eating control and weight loss outcomes in patients undergoing LAGB with an innovative brain-based intervention. Specifically, the investigators will enhance the activity of the right inferior frontal gyrus, a core region of the brain circuit of inhibitory control, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancement of Brain Circuit of Inhibitory Control in Obese Patients Undergoing Gastric Banding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding (LAGB) is a minimally invasive and reversible procedure in bariatric surgery that has a good safety record. Despite these advantages, success rates following LAGB are quite variable across individuals. Recent data suggest that complementing LAGB with interventions targeting factors along the brain-behavior spectrum could enhance weight loss results following this procedure. The study will have the following three aims: Aim #1: To evaluate whether enhancement of the right inferior frontal gyrus with tDCS in patients undergoing LAGB can improve inhibitory control capacity. For this aim the investigators will evaluate participants' performance in a computerized test of inhibitory control. Results from this aim will provide evidence for target engagement, and thus confirm that the brain circuit of interest was affected as a result of the intervention. Aim #2: To examine whether enhancement of the right inferior frontal gyrus with tDCS in patients undergoing LAGB can lead to improvements in a self-reported measure of eating control (disinhibition subscale of the three-factor eating questionnaire). Results form this aim will provide evidence for an effect of the intervention on an intermediate, behavioral variable. Aim #3: To preliminary evaluate whether enhancement of the right inferior frontal gyrus with tDCS in patients undergoing LAGB can improve postoperative weight loss outcomes. This aim will provide preliminary evidence for the clinical efficacy of the intervention over a time window period of 12 months. Weight loss at 12 months will be the primary outcome of the study.</detailed_description>
