	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in patients with metastatic cancer and either moderate, severe, or no hepatic impairment who have failed other antineoplastic therapies or for whom there is no standard therapy. The study will be conducted in two stages. Using an existing pixantrone population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model, a model-based strategy will be used to evaluate the findings from the first stage of the study conducted in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and matched controls. The PPK evaluation will be completed prior to enrolling patients with severe hepatic impairment and additional matched controls during the second stage of the study. Patients with hepatic impairment will be paired with matched control patients with normal hepatic function, matched on gender, age, and body surface area (BSA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study of Pixantrone in Patients With Metastatic Cancer and Hepatic Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in patients with metastatic cancer and either moderate, severe or no hepatic impairment who have failed other antineoplastic therapies or for whom there is no standard therapy. The study will be conducted in two stages. Stage I will include patients with moderate hepatic impairment and Stage II will include patients with severe hepatic impairment. An analysis of data from the Stage I portion of the study will be performed to decide whether to enroll patients in the Stage II portion of the study. Patients with hepatic impairment (either moderate or severe) will be paired with matched control patients with normal hepatic function, matched on gender, age, and body surface are (BSA). Patients will receive a single dose of pixantrone on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Blood samples will be obtained at various time points during the first week of the first cycle for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. If any patient with hepatic impairment develops a dose limiting toxicity, subsequent patients will be administered a lower dose of pixantrone. If any patient with hepatic impairment who is receiving the reduced dose of pixantrone experiences a dose limiting toxicity, the study will be terminated. Patients who demonstrate any clinical, radiologic, or other evidence of response or stabilization after the initial dose of pixantrone and who wish to continue treatment may do so at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients receiving additional cycles will be treated with pixantrone every 21 days for up to 5 additional cycles and will be followed for safety only, until 30 days after the last dose.</detailed_description>
