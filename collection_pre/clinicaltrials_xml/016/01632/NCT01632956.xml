	<brief_summary>There are few breast cancer support groups that focus on the specific needs of Chinese women. The purpose of this study is to learn about two different ways of providing support groups to help women of Chinese descent cope with the difficulties of a diagnosis of breast cancer and its treatment. The investigators want to learn about how best to support Chinese women with breast cancer by providing two different types of groups: an in-person support group and a virtual (online/phone) support group.</brief_summary>
