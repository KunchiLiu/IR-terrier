	<brief_title>Therapy for Undergraduate College Students Who Binge Drink and Are Depressed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a screening visit (2 Â½ hrs) to confirm eligibility for the study, all participants will receive 8 weekly, 1-hour, individual sessions therapy with a counselor. Participants will be randomly assigned, by chance, like the flip of a coin, to the therapy course they will attend. In one of the therapy courses, students are asked questions about their drinking and receive personalized feedback about it, and are taught coping skills for their depressive symptoms. In the second course, students are also taught coping skills for their depressive symptoms but they may or may not talk about alcohol consumption depending on the students' preference. So, both courses teach the same coping skills for depressive symptoms but include different levels of focus on alcohol. Participants will also complete 2 follow-up visits, at the end of the 8 sessions and then again 4 weeks after completing treatment. These will involve filling out some questionnaires and completing a few neuropsychological tests (these questionnaires and neuropsychological tests will also be completed during the screening visit).</detailed_description>
