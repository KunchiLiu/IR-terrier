	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Black Race Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants receive stable standard therapy for lupus in addition to receiving either placebo (no active medicine) or belimumab. The controlled period of the study is 52 weeks. The random assignment in this study is "2 to 1" which means that for every 3 participants, 2 will receive belimumab and 1 will receive placebo. Participants who successfully complete the 52-week study may enter into a 6-month open-label extension. All participants in the open-label extension receive belimumab plus standard therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: At least 18 years of age. Selfidentified black race. Have a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria Have active SLE disease defined as a SELENA SLEDAI score &gt;= 8 at screening Have 2 unequivocally positive autoantibody test results defined as a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test [i.e., titer &gt;= 1:80 by human epithelial cell line 2 (HEp2) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA)] and/or a positive anti double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) (&gt;= 30 international units [IU]/milliliter [mL]) serum antibody test as follows: From 2 independent time points within the study screening period. Screening results must be based on the study's central laboratory results, OR One positive historical test result and 1 positive test result during the screening period. Historical documentation of a positive ANA test (e.g., HEp2 IFA or EIA) or antidsDNA (eg, antidsDNA by any validated commercial assay) must include the date and type of the test, the name of the testing laboratory, numerical reference range, and a key that explains values provided as positive versus negative OR negative, equivocal/borderline positive). Only unequivocally positive values as defined in the laboratory's reference range are acceptable; borderline values will not be accepted. On a stable SLE treatment regimen consisting of any of the following medications (alone or in combination) for a period of at least 30 days prior to Day 0 (i.e., day of 1st dose of study agent): Corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisone equivalent, up to 40 mg/day): For subjects on SLE combination therapy, their stable steroid dose must be fixed within the range of 0 to 40 mg/day (prednisone or prednisone equivalent). For subjects whose only SLE treatment is steroids, their stable steroid dose must be fixed within the range of 7.5 to 40 mg/day (prednisone or prednisone equivalent). For those subjects on alternating day doses of steroids, use the average of 2 daily doses to calculate the average daily steroid dose. Other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents including methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate (including mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride, and mycophenolate sodium), calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), sirolimus, oral cyclophosphamide, 6mercaptopurine, mizoribine, or thalidomide. Antimalarials (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, quinacrine). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Note: Preexisting SLE medications must be stable for at least 30 days prior to Day 0. Corticosteroids may be added as new medication or their doses adjusted only up to 30 days prior to Day 0. New SLE therapy other than corticosteroids must not be added within 60 days of Day 0. A female subject is eligible to enter the study if she is: Not pregnant or nursing; Of nonchildbearing potential defined as: premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy, documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, or documented bilateral oophorectomy, OR postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile [e.g., &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy or other cause for amenorrhea]; in questionable cases obtain a blood sample for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol simultaneously to confirm. Diagnostic levels for FSH and estradiol vary by specific laboratories/assays; OR is of childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening and urine hCG test prior to dosing AND agrees to use one of the contraception methods for 2 weeks prior to the day of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 16 weeks following the last dose of study agent. OR has only samesex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle. Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of researchrelated health information), and comply with the study protocol procedures (including required study visits). Exclusion criteria: Have received treatment with antiB lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) [belimumab] at any time.
