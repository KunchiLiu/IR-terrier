	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to look at safety, how well the study drug is tolerated, how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream, and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to healthy Japanese and non-Japanese participants as multiple doses. In addition, effects of 28-day oral dosing of LY3131207 on the amount of a cholesterol-lowering drug (simvastatin) that gets into the blood stream and how long the body takes to get rid of it will be determined. The effects of LY3131207 after single and 28-day dosing on blood pressure will also be studied. Information about any side effects that may occur will be collected.</brief_summary>
