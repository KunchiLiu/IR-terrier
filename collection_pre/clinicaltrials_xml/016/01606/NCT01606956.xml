	<brief_summary>Partial cuff inflation before insertion is generally used for laryngeal mask airway insertion in adult patients. However, it is not proven how much the cuff should be inflated. The aim of this study is to compare efficacy between the method using the resting volume and the method using half the maximum volume for partial cuff inflation.</brief_summary>
