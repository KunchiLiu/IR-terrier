	<brief_title>Impact of Infant Feeding on Newborn Metabolomic Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolomics is of particular interest in the field of nutrition, since nutrients interact with a number of targets, metabolic pathways and functions. A suitable biofluid to study nutrient intake is urine, which is the most commonly used biological sample for metabolomic analysis and can be collected with simple and non-invasive methods. Up to now, no studies have investigated healthy term infants metabolome and its modulation according to different dietary regimens such as formula-feeding or breastfeeding. The aim of this study is to evaluate, with untargeted modalities, the urine metabolomic profile of a group of infants fed with a standard formula, a group of infants fed with a formula supplemented with functional ingredients and a group of breast-fed infants. Formula-fed infants participate to PLA-LENI-09 study (NCT01197365). We have included also a control group of breast-fed infants, as, from a scientific point of view, they represent the "gold standard" and no data are available on their metabolomic profile.</detailed_description>
