	<brief_summary>In patients with an ovarian cancer, the treatment is currently based on surgery and chemotherapy. The impact of chemotherapy on the expansion and functional abilities of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells has never been evaluated. The long term goal is to give a rational to combine conventional treatment of ovarian cancer with immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Chemotherapy on Gamma-delta T Cells in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer is associated with a high mortality rate. Treatment of ovarian cancer is currently based on surgery and chemotherapy. The first surgery is a radical surgical procedure aiming to achieve no residual disease. Patients who could not benefit from the first surgery may be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a new surgical procedure after 3 or 6 chemotherapy cycles. Chemotherapy is currently based on Taxol and Carboplatin. Immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells could provide a promising therapeutic strategy, however, the impact of chemotherapy on the expansion and functional abilities of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells has never been evaluated. We want to study the effect of chemotherapy of ovarian cancer on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells rates in the peripheral blood of patients with ovarian cancer. Functional abilities of the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells will be studied: expansion after chemotherapy and their cytotoxic abilities in an autologous context before or after chemotherapy. The long term goal is to give a rational to combine conventional treatment of ovarian cancer with non-conventional treatment such as immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells.</detailed_description>
