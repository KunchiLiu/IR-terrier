	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of three interventions on weight loss at 12 months. The investigators propose to test the impact of integrating an effective automated Internet weight control program into primary care by recruiting patients and randomizing them to one of three conditions: A) Brief physician counseling plus usual care, B) Brief physician counseling plus referral and access to the Internet weight control program and, C) Brief physician counseling plus referral and access to the Internet weight control program plus brief follow-up email notes of support and accountability from Primary Care Physicians. The investigators hypothesize that an online program for weight control can be more effective by enhancing online follow-up with PCPs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Integrating an Internet Weight Control Program Into Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year, roughly 700 of the 750 million visits that overweight and obese patients make with primary care providers (PCPs) occur without any weight counseling. The main reasons for this are that PCPs are poorly trained to help their patients lose weight and that there are no consistently effective interventions for primary care settings. Though in-person and telephone-based weight control programs have been difficult to disseminate in primary care, online weight control programs are increasingly effective and may lend themselves to be used in these settings. Given the growing number of effective online programs, for obesity and for other conditions seen in primary care (e.g., depression, insomnia) it is important to understand whether these programs can be effective when integrated into primary care and whether they are enhanced by provider involvement. Research on the 5 A's model of primary care behavior change suggests that the most effective, yet least used feature of primary care interventions is arranging follow-up, where providers hold patients accountable to adhering to treatments and achieving specific outcomes. The 5 A's model provides a useful framework for integrating behavior change interventions into primary care. In this model, providers ASK about weight, ADVISE patients to lose weight, ASSESS readiness to change, ASSIST the patient in making changes and ARRANGE follow-up. Unfortunately, though PCPs are uniquely positioned to ARRANGE follow-up, given their long-term relationship with the patient, and studies show that ARRANGING follow-up may be the most effective of the 5 A's, it is the least often used. In a study of 481 encounters with overweight patients, Pollak (Consultant) and colleagues observed that PCPs ARRANGED follow-up in only 5% of visits, though it was the only one of the 5 A's associated with future weight loss. Kottke and colleagues similarly observed that primary care smoking cessation interventions that included more "reinforcing sessions" with PCPs were the most effective. This is consistent with conclusions by Whitlock and colleagues that "Simply notifying patients that follow-up will occur seems to be a powerful motivating factor". These findings have been extended to online interventions, where two meta-analyses concluded that the impact of online interventions for depression and anxiety is enhanced by follow-up that includes being accountable to and supported by a human being. The investigators have created a simple method for integrating an Internet weight control program into primary care settings, by allowing PCPs to monitor their patients' adherence and outcomes and email them pre-written, tailored follow-up messages. PCPs in the investigators' pilot work believed that this would help to overcome key barriers to helping their patients lose weight.</detailed_description>
