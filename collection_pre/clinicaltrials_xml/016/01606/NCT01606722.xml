	<brief_summary>To evaluate the relationship between plasma and intracellular darunavir (DRV) concentrations and virological efficacy in HIV-infected patients on DRV/rtv monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Darunavir Levels, Virological Efficacy, Proviral ADN and Resistances in Patients on Darunavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To be enrolled, subjects had a plasma HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 6 months based, virologic failure while on a PI-containing regimen was allowed if the genotypic resistance tests showed no major resistance mutation associated to reduced susceptibility to DRV/rtv according to the International AIDS Society. Patients with transitory episodes of detectable plasma HIV-RNA viral load ("blip") preceded and followed by a plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL without changes in antiretroviral treatment could also been included. The only exclusion criteria were pregnancy, hepatitis B coinfection and the concomitant use of drugs with potential major interactions with DRV/rtv pharmacokinetics.</detailed_description>
