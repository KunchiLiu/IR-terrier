	<brief_summary>In patients who undergo shoulder manipulation for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, a postoperative indwelling analgesic pain catheter will improve patient outcomes by decreasing shoulder pain and improving range of motion compared to a single-dose interscalene block.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indwelling Interscalene Nerve Catheters in Surgical Management of Idiopathic Adhesive Capsulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder manipulation under anesthesia to treat idiopathic adhesive capsulitis is performed only when conservative treatment fails to remedy the condition. It is common practice to use an interscalene nerve block as anesthesia for this surgical intervention. This randomized prospective study is designed to evaluate the effects of two different anesthesia methods on patient's post-surgical rehabilitation after manipulation. Forty patients scheduled for surgery will be entered into this study. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive a single-doseinterscalene block or a single-dose interscalene block and an indwelling nerve catheter which will provide a continuous infusion of local anesthetic. Patients with the continuous infusion of local anesthetic will receive the additional anesthesia for 24 hours. Patient's range of motion will be evaluated pre-op, intra-op and post-operatively at 10 days, 4,8,16 weeks and 6 months</detailed_description>
