	<brief_summary>The investigators perform a retrospective microarray gene expression profiling study of FFPE from a cohort of DLBCL patients with whole genome cDNA mediated Annealing Selection and Ligation (WG-DASL) assay. The investigators also study the pattern of microRNA from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The results of gene expression profiles and microRNA is correlated with clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
