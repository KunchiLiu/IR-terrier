	<brief_summary>The study drug LY2409021 is being evaluated as a possible treatment for diabetes. The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions, and not to provide treatment for diabetes : - The safety of LY2409021 and any side effects that might be associated with it following 4 weeks of doses - How long it takes the body to absorb and remove LY2409021 following dosing over 4 weeks - How daily dosing of LY2409021 affects blood levels of sugar (glucose), insulin and other naturally occurring substances before and after a meal - How LY2409021 works when given with metformin - How daily dosing of LY2409021 affects the cells that produce insulin</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must be either a male, or a female who cannot become pregnant, who has type 2 diabetes and is either controlling diabetes through diet and exercise, or taking metformin Have an hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value at screening of greater than or equal to 6.5% and less than or equal to 10.0% on a stable treatment regimen at the time of measurement Have a screening body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 40 kg/m^2 inclusive Have a blood pressure reading at screening of between 90 to 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) (systolic) and 40 to 95 mmHg (diastolic) Have used insulin for diabetic control within 1 year of study entry Have used thiazolidinediones within 3 months, or any other drugs for treatment of hyperglycemia (except metformin) within 1 month, prior to first planned dosing. Metformin is acceptable for this study.
