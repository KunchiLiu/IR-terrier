	<brief_summary>Scalp infiltration with Epinephrine- containing lidocaine solution is common method for craniotomy but it may result in transient but significant hypotension in patients undergoing neurosurgery. Dexmedetomidine, a potent alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist which dose-dependently reduces arterial blood pressure and heart rate, decreases the hemodynamic and catecholamine response, and dexmedetomidine has an effect of peripheral vasoconstriction thus it is thus theologically appropriate for reducing bleeding during scalp incision in craniotomy. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine-lidocaine solution on hemodynamic response, scalp bleeding to epinephrine-lidocaine solution.</brief_summary>
