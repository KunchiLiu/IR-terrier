	<brief_summary>This is a study to measure the effect that various doses of LY2409021 have on blood sugar levels and on the amount of glucose released by the liver, when glucagon is given to increase these. Each participant may receive up to 2 single doses of LY2409021 in 2 different study periods, with a minimum 13-day washout between dosing periods. This study is approximately 9 weeks long, not including screening. A screening appointment is required within 6 weeks prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
