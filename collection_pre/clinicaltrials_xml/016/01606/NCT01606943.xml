	<brief_title>Clinical Profiles and Outcomes of Acute Aortic Dissection in the Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1996, the Internation Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection(IRAD) was established to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment of acute aortic dissection. However, most patients from the IRAD are Caucasian. These data were not sufficient to reflect clinical profiles and outcomes of Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection. In China, little is known about clinical features, managements and outcomes of acute aortic dissection involving a large number of patients. The investigators established clinical multicenter registry of acute aortic dissection. Between January 2009 and February 2012, about 2000 were enrolled in the Chinese registry of acute aortic dissection(CRAD) database. The aim of this study is to analyze clinical profiles and outcomes of Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection.</detailed_description>
