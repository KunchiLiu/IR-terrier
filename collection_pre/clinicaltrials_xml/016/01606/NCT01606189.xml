	<brief_title>A Study to Compare Sublingual Cannabis Based Medicine Extracts With Placebo to Treat Brachial Plexus Injury Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study used a three way crossover study design. Eligible patients recorded their symptoms during a one to two week baseline period, then entered a three period, double blind, randomised crossover of GW-1000-02, GW-2000-02 and placebo. Each period lasted two weeks, with no washout between periods. There were six possible treatment sequences. The primary analysis was based on Box Scale-11 pain severity scores recorded throughout the study in patient daily diary booklets. Blood samples were taken from patient-volunteers at the beginning of each period, for measurement of plasma cannabinoid concentration.</detailed_description>
