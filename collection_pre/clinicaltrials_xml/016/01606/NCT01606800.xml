	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a short course of therapy (24 weeks) versus standard 48 week treatment in previously untreated adult participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4 infection who achieve rapid virologic response (RVR), defined as HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) negativity after 4 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants who achieved RVR after 4 weeks of PEG-INF alfa-2b plus RBV treatment were randomized to receive either 20 or 44 weeks of continued therapy, for a total of 24 or 48 weeks total of PEG-INF plus RBV therapy.</detailed_description>
