	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cannabis Based Medicine in Patients With Pain of Neurological Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Multiple Sclerosis or other defect of neurological function with a qualifying symptom of chronic refractory pain, entered a seven day baseline period, followed by a 21 day randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison of GW-1000-02 with placebo, self-titrated to symptom resolution or maximum tolerated dose. The ability of the cannabis based medicine extract to relieve chronic refractory pain was assessed by the change from baseline in pain score using Box Scale-11 (BS-11) scores recorded in the patients' daily diary.</detailed_description>
