	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of crizotinib giving together with combination chemotherapy in treating younger patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Crizotinib may stop the growth of tumor or cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, topotecan hydrochloride, dexrazoxane hydrochloride, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine sulfate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of crizotinib administered orally twice daily in combination with topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride) and cyclophosphamide in children with refractory/relapsed solid tumors or anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). II. To define and describe the toxicities of crizotinib in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide administered on this schedule. III. To estimate the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of crizotinib administered orally twice daily in combination with vincristine and doxorubicin/dexrazoxane in children with refractory/relapsed solid tumors or ALCL. IV. To define and describe the toxicities of crizotinib in combination with vincristine and doxorubicin/dexrazoxane administered on this schedule. V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib in children with refractory cancer when combined with either topotecan and cyclophosphamide or vincristine and doxorubicin/dexrazoxane. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of crizotinib in combination with either topotecan and cyclophosphamide or vincristine and doxorubicin/dexrazoxane within the confines of a Phase 1 study. II. To preliminarily examine the relationship between anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status in patients with neuroblastoma or ALCL and response to crizotinib in combination with either topotecan and cyclophosphamide or vincristine and doxorubicin/dexrazoxane. III. To preliminarily examine the relationship between minimal residual disease (MRD) status and clinical response to crizotinib in combination with either topotecan and cyclophosphamide or vincristine and doxorubicin/dexrazoxane in patients with ALCL. IV. To use a questionnaire to gather preliminary information on the palatability of the oral solution formulation of crizotinib. V.To examine ALK and c-Met expression, copy number and mutations status in archival tumor tissue from solid tumor and ALCL patients. VI. To use a questionnaire to gather information on the acceptability of the crizotinib capsule formulation. VII. To use a questionnaire to gather information on the acceptability of the crizotinib microsphere formulation. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of crizotinib. Patients are assigned to part A, part B, or part C based on the treating physician's choice and availability of a reservation. Part A: Patients receive crizotinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide IV once daily (QD) on days 1-5, topotecan hydrochloride IV QD on days 1-5, and filgrastim or pegfilgrastim beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood count recovers. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Part B: Patients receive crizotinib PO BID as in part A. Patients also receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV on day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1, and filgrastim or pegfilgrastim beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood count recovers. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Part C: Patients receive crizotinib as a capsule formulation orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide IV once daily (QD) on days 1-5, topotecan hydrochloride IV QD on days 1-5, and filgrastim or pegfilgrastim beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood count recovers. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Part D: Patients receive crizotinib as a microsphere formulation orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide IV once daily (QD) on days 1-5, topotecan hydrochloride IV QD on days 1-5, and filgrastim or pegfilgrastim beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood count recovers. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
