	<brief_title>A Study of Cannabis Based Medicine Extracts and Placebo in Patients With Pain Due to Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of GW-1000-02 in central neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury. Patients were screened to determine eligibility and completed a seven to 21 day baseline period. Patients then returned to the centre for assessment, randomisation and initial dosing. Visits occurred at the end of treatment week one and at the end of the study (treatment week three) or upon withdrawal. Throughout the study, patients were permitted to take paracetamol as escape analgesic to relieve breakthrough pain. Patients in this study could elect to be screened for an open label extension study of GW-1000-02.</detailed_description>
