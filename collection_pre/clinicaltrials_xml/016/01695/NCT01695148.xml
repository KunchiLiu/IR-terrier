	<brief_title>Efficacy of β-carotene Biofortified Maize in Reducing Vitamin A Deficiency Among Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in Zambia, affecting approximately 40% of young children. We aim to conduct a cluster-randomised controlled trial in the Mkushi region of rural Zambia to test whether feeding children two daily meals containing β-carotene biofortified maize flour compared to regular white maize flour-based meals for six months can reduce the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and improve the vitamin A status among 4-8 year old children. Five hundred children in each arm will receive 2 meals a day, 6 days a week for 6 months, after which changes in serum retinol concentrations will be compared. An additional arm of 250 children, enrolled from randomly sampled clusters, will not receive the maize flour intervention but concurrently followed in order to evaluate overall effects of the maize flour feeding scheme on measures of household food security.</detailed_description>
