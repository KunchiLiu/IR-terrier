	<brief_summary>216 Chemotherapy-naïve, female breast cancer patients about to begin chemotherapy and who expect to have nausea, will be entered. Participants will be randomized to one of three study arms: Arm 1: Version 1 handout; Arm 2: Version 1 handout + Version 1 relaxation MP3 + acupressure bands; Arm 3: Version 2 handout + Version 2 relaxation MP3 + acupressure bands. Hypothesis: Acupressure bands provided with the relaxation MP3 will be effective in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Approaches for Nausea Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier research has shown that the effectiveness of acupressure bands in reducing nausea could be enhanced by boosting patients' expectations of the bands' efficacy. The present study seeks to confirm and extend these findings in a multi-site, 3-arm, randomized, controlled study of 216 breast cancer patients beginning chemotherapy who expect to have nausea. All patients will receive a standardized antiemetic regimen. Arm 1: Version 1 of Handout; Arm 2: Version 1 of handout + Version 1 relaxation MP3 + acupressure bands; Arm 3: Version 2 of handout + Version 2 of relaxation MP3 + acupressure bands. The investigators hypothesize that acupressure bands provided with the relaxation MP3 will be effective in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea. The two versions of the handout and MP3 are being examined to determine what is the most effective way to deliver the intervention.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Nausea</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Be female. Have a diagnosis of breast cancer, any stage. Be chemotherapy naïve and about to begin her first course of chemotherapy. Be scheduled to receive one of the following four common chemotherapy regimens with the specified antiemetic regimen. They are: 1. Chemotherapy regimen: Doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide. Antiemetic regimen: Aprepitant + palonosetron + dexamethasone on Day 1 and aprepitant + dexamethasone on Days 2 &amp; 3. 2. Chemotherapy regimen: Doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel. Antiemetic regimen: Aprepitant + palonosetron + dexamethasone on Day 1 and aprepitant + dexamethasone on Days 2 &amp; 3. 3. Chemotherapy regimen: Docetaxel/carboplatin. Antiemetic regimen: Palonosetron on Day 1 + dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, &amp; 3. 4. Chemotherapy regimen: Docetaxel/cyclophosphamide. Antiemetic regimen: Palonosetron on Day 1 + dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, &amp; 3. Note: Fosaprepitant will be allowed in place of aprepitant, and either granisetron or ondansetron, on one or more days, will be allowed in place of palonosetron. Have a response of &gt; 3 or greater on a question assessing expected nausea as assessed on a 5point Likertscale anchored at one end by 1 = "I am certain I WILL NOT have this," and at the other end by 5 = "I am certain I WILL have this." Be able to read English (since the assessment materials are in printed format). Be 18 years of age or older and give written informed consent. Have clinical evidence of lymphedema, current bowel obstruction, or symptomatic brain metastases, as determined by their treating oncologist. Be receiving concurrent radiotherapy or interferon.</criteria>
