	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder in clinical practice. In the last two decades the number of hospitalizations for AF has increased two- to three-fold. More than 6 million people worldwide suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF), a cardiac disorder that results in systemic emboli. Patients with AF are 5 times more likely to have a stroke compared with those without AF. This registry will collection information on two devices that are used to treat AF. The WATCHMAN and LARIAT. The differences in techniques and subsequent effects of the two devices on outcomes related to AF has not been studied. This study will look to compare the two devices to see how the outcomes may vary.</brief_summary>
