	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies vorinostat before surgery in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving enzyme inhibitor therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the ability of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition using suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (vorinostat) to induce expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) genes in solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive vorinostat 400 mg daily orally (PO) on days 1-21 followed by surgery within 14 days.</detailed_description>
