	<brief_summary>In the current protocol, we propose the assessment of potential beneficial effects of the antibiotic Xifaxan on liver biochemistries, liver related symptoms and Mayo risk score in 15 adult and 5 pediatric patients with PSC. Adult patients will receive Xifaxan, 550 mg twice daily over a 12-week period. Pediatric patients with PSC whose weight is greater than or equal to 40 kg will receive Xifaxan, 550 mg twice daily.</brief_summary>
