	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to compare intraocular pressure (IOP) values assessed with Ocular Response Analyzer to the classical gold standard of IOP measurement, to Goldmann applanation tonometry by mucopolysacchyridosis-, Fabry-patients and healthy controls. We want to investigate biomechanical characteristics of the cornea and their influence on the IOP-measurements.</brief_summary>
