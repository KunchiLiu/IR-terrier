	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, study of BKM120 in patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer. Eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect prostate tissue for analysis. Two weeks after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University of California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be tken after the radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, prospective, pharmacodynamic study of BKM120 in high-risk, localized prostate cancer. After informed consent and central pathology review of the core prostate biopsy, eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect tissue for molecular analysis. Two weeks after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University of California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be administered after radical prostatectomy. Up to 24 patients, or 21 evaluable patients, will be enrolled through the Department of Urology or Genitourinary Medical Oncology at the University of California, San Francisco for this pharmacodynamic study. Toxicity will be assessed during BKM120 administration, and will involve a clinic visit on Day 14 ± 2 (i.e. before surgery). Follow-up with safety evaluations will be at 90 ± 7 days post-operatively and involve a toxicity questionnaire, blood tests, and clinic visit. Toxicity will be monitored and reported using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 guidelines. A patient symptom diary will be distributed to each patient at baseline for symptom self-recording and BKM120 dose self-administration. In addition, a patient identifier card (wallet-sized) will be distributed to each patient after informed consent and registration. This information will contain the patient's age, study name and number, investigator and study coordinator contact information, and expected adverse events that may be present as a result of BKM120 administration.</detailed_description>

Prostate cancer with the following pathological characteristics: 1) Gleason sum &gt; 8 AND at least 2 discrete core biopsies containing a minimum of 20% cancer OR 2) Gleason pattern 4 + 3 = 7 AND greater than 50% of biopsies positive for prostate cancer 4. Age ≥ 18 years 5. ECOG performance status £ 2 6. Ability to take oral medications (capsule must be swallowed with liquid) 7. Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L, Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL 8. Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) within normal limits (biphosphonate use for malignant hypercalcemia control is not allowed) 9. Magnesium ≥ the lower limit of normal 10. Potassium within normal limits for the institution 11. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) within normal range 12. Serum bilirubin within normal range (or total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert Syndrome) 13. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or 24hour clearance ≥ 50 mL/min 14. Serum amylase ≤ ULN 15. Serum lipase ≤ ULN 16. Fasting plasma glucose ≤ 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) 17. INR ≤ 2 18. Men of reproductive potential and their female partners must use highly effective contraception during treatment, for 5 halflives (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period The highly effective contraception is defined as either: 1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 2. Sterilization: Female partners have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. 3. Male participant sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). 4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b): 1. Female partner with prior placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Oral contraception use by female partners, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period. 19.
