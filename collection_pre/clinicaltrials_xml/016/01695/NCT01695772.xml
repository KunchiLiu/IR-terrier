	<brief_summary>This open-label, single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the resection rate in participants with colorectal cancer and previously untreated unresectable liver-only metastases after adding bevacizumab to 5-FU based doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. Participants will receive standard 5-FU based chemotherapy plus Avastin bevacizumab 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles combined pre- and postoperatively unless they experience progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
