	<brief_summary>PSMA ADC 2301 is a Phase 2, open-label, study to assess the anti-tumor activity and tolerability of Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Antibody Drug Conjugate (PSMA ADC) in two groups of subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). One group comprises subjects who must have received at least one taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen (e.g. docetaxel, cabazitaxel). The second group comprises subjects who are cytotoxic chemotherapy-naïve. Subjects who are cytotoxic chemotherapy-naïve must have received and progressed on-, be ineligible for, refused, have an intolerance to-, or not have access to Radium-223. Both groups of subjects must also have received and progressed on abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide. If a subject is unable to receive abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide, Sponsor approval is required for participation in the study. Subjects will receive up to eight doses of PSMA ADC approximately once every three weeks.</brief_summary>
