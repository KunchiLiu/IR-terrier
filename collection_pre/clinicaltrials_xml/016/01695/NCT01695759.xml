	<brief_summary>To evaluate the clinical efficacy and immunogenicity of the drug test Eritromax ® - (rHuEPO Blau) compared to drug Eprex ® (Janssen-Cilag rHuEPO) in the treatment of patients who have anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD), during the correction through assessing the change in hemoglobin levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy of Two Erythropoietin Drug in Participants With Secondary Anemia to Chronic Kidney Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data will be assessed secondary efficacy of the drug against the test drug comparison by evaluating: - Maintenance of hemoglobin levels (baseline vs. end of treatment) during maintenance phase; - Dose of EPO necessary during the repair and maintenance; - Need for transfusion; - Safety study drugs by type, frequency and intensity of adverse events during the 12 months of follow up. objectives exploratory - evaluate the immunogenicity of drugs through the quantification of anti-erythropoietin every six months.</detailed_description>

Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, with above average 180/100mmHg and requiring hospitalization in the last 6 months; 3. Presence of other causes of anemia than CRD, such as bleeding, hemolysis, pernicious anemia and hemoglobinopathies; 4. Patients who present changes or clinical abnormalities, qualified as interfering changes, such as severe hyperparathyroidism (iPTH&gt; 1000 pg / mL), severe congestive heart failure (NYHA Class IV), acute myocardial infarction within the last 3 months, or active neoplasia in followup, severe liver disease, active infection (leukocyte changes), history of aluminum toxicity or scheduled surgery, pregnancy or lactation; and. Patients who have a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation and to products derived from mammalian cells; f. Prior therapies with erythropoietin for less than 3 months; g. Realization transfusion for less than 3 months; h. Any situation at the discretion of the Principal Investigator interfere with study data.</criteria>
