	<brief_summary>The trial is primarily designed to investigate whether treatment with vitamin D may influence migraine in a placebo-controlled, blinded study. The hypothesis is that vitamin D may serve as a prophylactic treatment of migraine. The hypothesis is tested by examining the changes in the pain and symptom patterns associated with migraine by treatment with Vitamin D, by means of quantitative sensory testing, diaries and blood samples for measurement of vitamin D. Other pain biomarkers are also measured to evaluate whether the levels of these biomarkers in the blood is changed by the treatment with vitamin D. The hypothesis here is that levels of those biomarkers will change following the treatment.</brief_summary>
