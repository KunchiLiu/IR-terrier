	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to confirm and extend the Phase 1-2 KB001 findings of an airway anti-inflammatory effect in CF individuals with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) airway infection. It is hypothesized that steady-state levels of KB001-A in CF subjects with airway Pa infection will be safe and well-tolerated, and will increase the time-to-need for antibiotic treatment (IV, inhaled, or oral) for worsening of respiratory tract signs and symptoms compared with placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Individuals with CF who are older than 50 years of age may participate if treated with 2 or more courses of antibiotics (IV and/or oral) for respiratory sign and symptoms (CF exacerbation) in the 12 months before the Screening Visit Confirmed diagnosis of CF At least 2 respiratory tract cultures in the previous 12 months, with Pa present. The most recent positive Pa culture must be within 12 weeks before the Screening Visit (or obtain a positive culture at screening) FEV1 % levels within acceptable ranges (per the study protocol) Received inhaled ABX for equivalent of 8 weeks or greater in the 26 weeks before the Day 0 Visit Treatment with antibiotics for acute illness within the 4 weeks before the Day 0 Visit Use of systemic corticosteroids within the 4 weeks before the Day 0 Visit Any change in regimen of CF maintenance therapies within the 4 weeks before the Day 0 Visit History of sputum cultures positive for B. cepacia complex in the 2 years before the Screening Visit History of organ transplantation Current smoker (tobacco, marijuana, or any other material). Use of smokeless inhalers/vaporizers for these materials is also prohibited History of drug addiction or alcohol abuse in the 12 months before the Screening Visit History of hepatic disease (clinical cirrhosis or portal hypertension), renal dysfunction Breastfeeding or pregnancy as evidenced by a positive blood pregnancy test Receiving any investigational drug in the 16 weeks (or 5 half lives) before the Day 0 Visit, whichever is longer</criteria>
