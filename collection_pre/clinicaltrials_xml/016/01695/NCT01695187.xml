	<brief_summary>This is a study to test the hypothesis that time to healing of a cold sore will be lower in the active treatment arm of the study when compared to the vehicle (placebo). Subjects with a history of cold sores will be enrolled and administered active treatment or placebo in a blinded manner. Subjects will then be followed to assess time to healing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Be a healthy man or woman 18 years of age or older. Women who are pregnant, lactating or may become pregnant may (at the investigator's discretion) be included in the study; 2. Have recurrent herpes labialis as defined by a history of three (3) or more cold sore recurrences on the lips and/or skin surrounding the lips in the previous year. The majority of their cold sore recurrences proceeded by a welldefined history of prodromal symptoms including redness, pain, burning, tingling, itching, swelling or a tight sensation of the lip at the site of the outbreak; 3. Be willing to refrain from using systemic or topical antiviral agents or systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration and for the duration of the cold sore recurrence; 4. Be willing to refrain from using any topical pharmaceutical or cosmetic products other than the study medication in or around the nasal and perioral areas for the duration of the cold sore recurrence; 5. Be willing to refrain from participation in another clinical trial; 6. Be willing and able to use phone or internet to obtain the combination to unlock their study medication kit; 7. Be able to read and write in English and understand and comply with the protocol requirements; 8. Be able to give informed consent and have signed a written informed consent form. 1. Known hypersensitivity to one of the drug ingredients, including soybean oil, polysorbate (Tween), alcohol, EDTA, or cetylpyridinium chloride (found in some mouthwashes and lozenges); 2. Severe chronic illness including renal failure, severe respiratory or cardiac disease, chronic infections, immunodeficiency syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or untreated severe thyroid disease; 3. Received (within the last 6 months) or receiving chemotherapy; 4. Significant skin disease on the face (such as atopic dermatitis, cystic acne, severe rosacea, eczema, psoriasis or other chronic vesiculobullous disorders) or lesions, wounds, abrasions, piercings, tattoos, irritation or other skin conditions on or around the nasal and perioral areas that would interfere with the treatment or assessment of the primary lesion complex. Subjects with mild controlled psoriasis, eczema, acne or dermatitis or other conditions may be included if the condition does not interfere with the ability to evaluate a herpes labialis lesion or local skin irritation; 5. Previously received herpes vaccine; 6. Active alcohol or drug abuse; 7. Prior randomization into any NanoBio study; 8. Any condition that would potentially make them unable to participate for the entire trial period; 9. Known allergies to topical creams, ointments or other topical medications.</criteria>
