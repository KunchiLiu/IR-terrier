	<brief_summary>Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the most common corneal refractive surgery performed for correction of myopia. There are very few studies that have been performed to evaluate long-term outcomes after LASIK. In this study, we will assess long-term outcomes 5 - 10 years after LASIK to assess stability of visual outcomes and long-term effect on corneal morphology with in vivo confocal microscopy. Clinical and corneal morphology outcomes will also be compared between patients who had flaps created with the microkeratome and femtosecond laser.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term LASIK Follow up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers will be eligible for enrollment into the study if have had LASIK surgery for correction of myopia or myopic astigmatism at the Kellogg Eye Center with either the microkeratome or femtosecond laser for LASIK flap creation between 5 and 10 years prior. A complete ophthalmic examination and corneal confocal microscopy will be performed. The study visit will take approximately one hour.</detailed_description>
