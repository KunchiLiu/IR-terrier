	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is therefore to explore on the clinical significance of analyzing surrogate markers combined with conventional diagnostics in the ICU setting. BAL, blood and biopsy samples will be subjected to a combined analysis of GM, BDG, Aspergillus specific PCR assays in addition to conventional diagnostics (Microscopy, Culture,Histology) for ICU pts with pulmonary infiltrates. As GM and BDG are not species-specific, three established and repeatedly published species specific PCR-based assays (nested PCR, real time PCR assay, multifungal DNA Array)developed by our group will be investigated in combination with the serological tests in a multicenter prospective clinical diagnostic trial.</brief_summary>
