	<brief_summary>Comparison of the ability of a new automated ventilatory mode named Intellibrain to maintain capnia and oxgen partial pressure within predefined ranges in comparison to the control of capnia and oxgen partial pressure obtained by using standard controlled ventilation modes in brain injured patients. Comparison of the numbers of alarms and required settings modifications observed with each ventilatory mode.</brief_summary>
