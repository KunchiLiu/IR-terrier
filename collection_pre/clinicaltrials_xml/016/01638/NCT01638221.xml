	<brief_title>Comparison of Patient Perceived Pain and Satisfaction Between Lightweight and Heavyweight Mesh for Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a clinical trial comparing standard therapy in the use of either lightweight or heavy mesh for the repair of inguinal hernias. Both types of these meshes have been approved for surgical correction but subjective comparisons of patient overall satisfaction and perceived outcomes have not been measured. The investigators intend to measure certain subjective data in the form of a questionnaire will be issued to the patient preoperatively, one week, one month, six months, and one year after the surgery There is no recent literature comparing subjective data between two meshes called Ultra Pro and Surgi Pro. The biological effects of these meshes have identical properties as far as the healing process and inflammation as well as the low rate of infection. The main difference is the material that these meshes are composed of. The Ultra Pro is made of Prolene while the Surgi Pro is made of polypropylene. The risks are not increased anymore than that for normal surgical complications. They each have the same post operative risks including bleeding, infection and pain, but the investigators are investigating a possible subjective difference between these two separate meshes that are currently used.</detailed_description>
