	<brief_summary>The effects of two vitamin K-forms on carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent proteins osteocalcin and matrix-gla protein will be compared after supplementing these vitamins in a nutritional dose range. The investigators hypothesized that MK-7 is more effective than K1 at a dose comparable to the RDA of vitamin K.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin K is a group name for the naturally occurring phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinones (MK-n; K2). The latter can be subdivided into the short-chain (e.g. MK-4) and the long-chain (e.g. MK-7, MK-8, and MK-9) menaquinones. Earlier studies have shown that high vitamin K intake leads to improved bone and vascular health by increased carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins in these tissues. In the dietary range, MK-7 has been suggested to be the most effective cofactor for the carboxylation of Gla-proteins, such as osteocalcin (OC) and matrix-Gla protein (MGP).Until now, no randomized controlled trial has compared the efficacy of K1 versus MK-7 in a nutritional dose range. The investigators are therefore interested to compare the effects of K1 and MK-7 on OC and MGP carboxylation after supplementing these vitamins at a dose not exceeding the RDA.</detailed_description>
