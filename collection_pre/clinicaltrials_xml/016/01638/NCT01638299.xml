	<brief_title>Study Assessing an Insulin Pump-controlling Algorithm to Minimize Hypo and Hyper in Type 1 During CRC Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a non-randomized, uncontrolled feasibility study that looks to enroll people with type 1 diabetes who are currently using an insulin pump. During the subject's participation, the study staff will closely monitor the study subject in a clinical research center environment for approximately 30 hours, while controller algorithm determined insulin doses are delivered by an insulin pump, and utilizing continuous glucose monitoring results.</detailed_description>
