	<brief_title>BT062 in Combination With Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BT062 is an antibody-drug conjugate designed to bind and destroy Myeloma cells. The study drug is being given in multiple doses with standard Multiple Myeloma treatments, lenalidomide and dexamethasone, to test how well the treatments are tolerated and work together. This study is a dose escalation study with the purpose to find out the highest dose of BT062 that a subject can tolerate in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.</detailed_description>
