	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Carl Zeiss Meditec VisuMax™ Femtosecond Laser lenticule removal procedure for the reduction or elimination of myopia from ≥ -1.00 D to ≤ -8.00 D with ≤ -0.50 D cylinder and MRSE ≤ -8.25 D.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of the Visumax™ Femtosecond Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multi-center clinical trial in which a total of 360 eyes of consecutive subjects will be enrolled, treated with the VisuMax™ Femtosecond Laser, and followed for a 12-month period. The study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical sites. Enrollment will be phased such that 100 eyes will be initially enrolled and followed. When 50 of the initial eyes have reached the 3-month follow-up exam, an interim clinical study report will be submitted to FDA along with a request to continue enrollment up to 360 eyes. Subjects will be screened for eligibility, and informed consent will be obtained from those who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible subjects will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a baseline ocular condition. Baseline and postoperative measurements will include manifest refraction, cycloplegic refraction, distance visual acuity (best corrected and uncorrected), slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, corneal topography, central corneal pachymetry, mesopic pupil measurement, wavefront analysis, mesopic contrast sensitivity, and intraocular pressure (IOP).</detailed_description>
