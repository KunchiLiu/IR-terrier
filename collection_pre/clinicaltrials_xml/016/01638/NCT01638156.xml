	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the importance of arterial stiffness and wave reflections as determinants of persistent left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and fibrosis (assessed using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) after correction of severe stenosis of the aortic valve. The hypothesis will test whether stiff arteries and increased wave reflections impede pumping of blood by the LV after aortic valve replacement (AVR)and precent adequate regression (improvement) of hypertrophy and fibrosis of the myocardium despite correction of aortic valve stenosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 80 participants will be enrolled into the study from site with the protocol-required technology. The Pennsylvania Department of Health funding for this trial is limited to sites in Pennsylvania. Participants will undergo pre- and post-operative cardiac MRI, blood draws, a 6-minute walk test, arterial tonometry, medical history assessment, and quality-of-life questionnaires to characterize the pathophysiologic factors causing variability in regression after AVR. Researchers will evaluate the role of specific hemodynamic abnormalities as determinants of post-AVR LV remodeling (LV hypertrophy and LV myocardial fibrosis) as seen on contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI. The trial also will evaluate a non-contrast-enhanced MRI approach (T1rho) potentially effective in assessing LV myocardial fibrosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (estimated aortic valve area &lt;1 cm2) 1,2 as documented on a transthoracic echocardiogram (ECG) performed within 4 months prior to enrollment Planned for AVR within 8 weeks after enrollment Able to have a cardiac MRI within 3 weeks prior to the AVR surgery A preoperative coronary angiography demonstrating the absence of hemodynamicallysignificant CAD in need of revascularization during AVR surgery Able to tolerate cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast as required by protocol, to be performed at an ACRINqualified facility using an ACRINqualified MR scanner Willing and able to provide a written informed consent Not suitable to undergo cardiac MRI or use the contrast agent gadolinium because of: Claustrophobia Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body (i.e., implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, central nervous system aneurysm clips, implanted neural stimulators, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body [e.g., metal shavings], other implanted medical devices [e.g., drug infusion port], insulin pump, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants) Weight greater than that allowable by the MRI table Known LV ejection fraction &lt;50% Previous aortic valve surgery Planned additional valve repair/replacement Infective endocarditis Moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation Rhythm other than sinus rhythm (i.e., atrial fibrillation) that results in an irregular heartbeat, compromising the quality of MRI and tonometry data acquisition, as documented on an ECG performed within 8 weeks prior to enrollment Presence of hemodynamicallysignificant CAD that would require revascularization during the AVR surgery Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the previous month Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 of body surface area documented within 4 weeks prior to enrollment NOTE: This threshold has been deemed appropriate for this study, rather than &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2, since eGFR is likely to decrease for participants between the baseline and 6month examinations. The protocol calls for gadolinium administration in the 6month evaluation, and gadolinium administration is contraindicated in the presence of an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2. Therefore, initially excluding patients who have an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 will minimize the presence of an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2 at the time of the 6month evaluation. An eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 of body surface area or acute kidney injury will be a contraindication to gadolinium contrast administration, and participants with insufficient kidney function immediately before the 6month cardiac MRI will undergo an MRI without contrastenhancement and will continue onstudy. Presence of a bicuspid aortic valve, which is associated with an intrinsic aortopathy that may affect arterial load in its own right; Resting heart rate &gt;120 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant Conditions that would make the study measurements less accurate or unreliable (i.e., frequent premature beats that may affecting cardiac gating, anatomic neck characteristics impeding arterial tonometry, inability to perform an adequate breath hold for cardiac MRI acquisitions) or the reliable postoperative followup of patients (for at least 6 months postAVR) unlikely Known peripheral vascular disease, which may limit the ability to exercise independently of cardiac status due to claudication Unwillingness of the patient to undergo a cardiac MRI Unwillingness of the patient to sign the consent form Any condition limiting life expectancy to &lt;1 year</criteria>
