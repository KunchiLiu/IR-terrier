	<brief_title>Crossover Trial of the Effect of a High-Fat Meal on the PK of Oral CHR 2797 in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single center, open-label, 2-arm, 2-way, crossover trial to assess the effect of food on CHR-2797 PK following a single 120 mg dose. Approximately 18 normal, healthy male subjects will be enrolled with at least 12 subjects completing the study. Two 60 mg capsules will be administered for a 120 mg dose of CHR-2797 on Days 1 and 8 with a high-fat meal or in the fasted state according to the randomization schedule. Subjects will be confined at the clinical research unit (CRU) from the time of Period 1 Check-in until Clinic Discharge on Day 3, and will return to the CRU on Day 7 for Period 2 Check-in and remain in the CRU until Study Completion (on Day 10 of Period 2). Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected through 48 hours post dose.</detailed_description>

Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 30 days prior to Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1). 9. Use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1), unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator; 10. Use of any overthecounter (OTC), nonprescription preparations (including vitamins, minerals, and phytotherapeutic/herbal/plantderived preparations) within 7 days prior to Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1), unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator. 11.

Poor peripheral venous access. 13. Donation of blood from 30 days prior to Screening through Study Completion, inclusive, or of plasma from 2 weeks prior to Screening through Study Completion, inclusive. 14. Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Checkin (Day 1 of Period 1). 15. Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study.</criteria>
