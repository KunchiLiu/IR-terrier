	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Commercially Available Medtronic Resolute Integrity Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose and objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Resolute Integrity Stent for the treatment of de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter(RD) of 2.25mm to 4.2mm in two groups of patients, specifically those patients receiving stents less than or equal to 30mm in length.</detailed_description>
