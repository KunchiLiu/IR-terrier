	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether there is an increase in dopamine levels in the human striatum following an oral administration of alcohol, as has been evidenced in animal models. This will be a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study using the radiotracer, [11C]-(+)-PHNO (11C]-( + )-4-propyl- 3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b][1,4]oxazin-9-ol).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dopamine Release in the Human Brain Following Alcohol Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a within subjects study in 8 heavy drinkers ages 21-45. The within factors will be PET scans following an alcoholic beverage and following a non-alcoholic beverage. Participants will also have a baseline session prior to the scans where they will complete various cognitive tasks and questionnaires. During each PET scan, subjective drug effects as well as heart rate, blood pressure, blood alcohol content and cortisol levels will be collected. The change in PHNO binding potential between the two scan conditions will be the primary outcome measure.</detailed_description>
