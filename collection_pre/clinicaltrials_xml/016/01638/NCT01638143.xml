	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare absorption of vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) after intake of three different vitamin K2 supplements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bio-equivalence Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several manufacturers are producing vitamin K2 raw material in different forms, namely oil and powder. To ensure bioequivalence of different vitamin K2 sources, the investigators are interested to compare the bioavailability of three different vitamin K2 formulations that are already commercially available. Two different oils and one powder product will be compared in this randomized cross-over trial. The investigators hypothesize that different vitamin K2 sources give no differences in bioavailability of vitamin K2.</detailed_description>
