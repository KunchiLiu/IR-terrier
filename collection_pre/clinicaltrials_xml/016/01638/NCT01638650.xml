	<brief_summary>This open-label study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of a modified Invirase (saquinavir)/ritonavir regimen in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Patients will receive Invirase 500 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily orally for the first week, followed by Invirase 1000 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily orally for the second week. The study treatment will be given in combination with two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), in accordance with the current clinical HIV treatment guidelines. Anticipated time on study treatment is 14 days.</brief_summary>
