	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is the attempt to implement a new research method based on modern electrochemistry successes, in particular the development of the polarographic method of fructose and fructose diphosphate identification and its implementation to detect the viral infection in early stage. There will be 20 samples from the HIV-infected patients and 30 samples from the heath controls. The study will collect 10ml urine and examined fructose and fructose-diphosphate using the polarographic method.</brief_summary>
