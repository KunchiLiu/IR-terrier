	<brief_summary>In Australia, blood for transfusion has a "use by" date of 42 days after collection. The actual age of blood given to patients depends on what is available at the time and the rate of usage. During the last decade, it has been reported that blood transfusion in patients admitted to intensive care was associated with an independent increase of mortality. Some research suggests that transfusion of fresher blood might help patients in the intensive care unit to reach a better recovery. This project will test whether patients who receive 'fresher' blood do better than patients who receive 'standard issue' blood.</brief_summary>
