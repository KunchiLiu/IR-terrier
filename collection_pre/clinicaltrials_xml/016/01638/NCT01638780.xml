	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to investigate if resveratrol supplementation can improve overall and muscle-specific insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients. As a secondary objective the investigators want to investigate whether the improved insulin sensitivity can be attributed to improved muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and a reduced intrahepatic and cardiac lipid content.</brief_summary>
