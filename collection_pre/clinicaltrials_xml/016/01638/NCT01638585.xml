	<detailed_description>August-2 is a trial embedded in the August-1 registry study. All patients enrolled in August-2 are also part of August-1, but there will be patients who are documented in the register, but will not take part in August-2. The investigators want to find out to which extent the patients in the registry are representative to the overall population suffering from this condition and how the therapeutic success of other therapy regimes can be described.</detailed_description>
