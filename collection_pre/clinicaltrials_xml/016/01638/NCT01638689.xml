	<brief_summary>Healthy males were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand 11C-AZ10419369, before and after administration of a single dose escitalopram. A change in the binding potential of 11C-AZ10419369 between the baseline and the post-dose condition was hypothesized to reflect a change in serotonin concentration.</brief_summary>
