	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to accelerate the development of vaccine candidates against diarrheal diseases caused by Shigella and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). We plan to identify cases of laboratory-proven shigellosis and ETEC-associated diarrhea, to study humoral and cellular immune parameters following natural infections with Shigella and ETEC, and to compare the level of pre-existing local, humoral and cellular immune parameters in cases of shigellosis and ETEC-associated diarrhea and in matched controls.</brief_summary>
