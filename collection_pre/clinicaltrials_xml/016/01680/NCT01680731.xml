	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate of the differences in pelvic floor anatomy and function in women who have undergone a vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (VAVD) versus a forceps assisted vaginal delivery (FAVD) using three-dimensional ultrasound imaging. Women within 1-5 years after first delivery who did not have an internal delivery will be included. The total number of subjects is forty. This will include ten primiparous subjects who have undergone vacuum delivery, ten who have undergone forceps delivery, ten who had spontaneous vaginal delivery and ten who have undergone primary elective cesarean section.</brief_summary>
