	<brief_summary>Panic disorder with agoraphobia is a prevalent and one of the most handicapping anxiety disorders. Although the efficacy of psychological treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia has been the subject of a great deal of research, studies comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure in vivo have regularly been underpowered to detect small to moderate differences. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study is to investigate if the combination of cognitive techniques with exposure in vivo is superior to the effects of exposure alone for patients with moderate to severe agoraphobia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavior Therapy vs Exposure in Vivo in the Treatment of Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses, with lifetime prevalence estimates ranging between 10-30% (Kessler et al 2007). They are an economic burden on society and the sixth largest cause of disability globally (Baxter et al 2014; Fineberg et al 2013). Suffering from an anxiety disorder is distressing, with affected individuals reporting adverse effects on quality of life comparable to sufferers of major depressive disorder, and in excess of the population norm (Mendlowicz and Stein 2000). Panic disorder with agoraphobia is especially prevalent and one of the most handicapping anxiety disorders. Although the efficacy of psychological treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia has been the subject of a great deal of research (Sanchez-Meca, Rosa-Alcazar, Marin-Martinez &amp; Gomez-Conesa, 2010), studies comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure in vivo have regularly been underpowered to detect small to moderate differences. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study is to investigate if the combination of cognitive techniques with exposure in vivo is superior to the effects of exposure alone for patients with moderate to severe agoraphobia. Participants suffering from panic disorder, agoraphobia receive exposure-based treatment with elements of cognitive restructuring (CBT-group) or without such elements (Exposure-only group) delivered according to treatment manuals and in individual sessions with a maximum of 30 sessions รก 50 minutes. Both treatments cover psychoeducation on the nature of anxiety and panic, interoceptive and intensified situational exposure exercises. In the CBT group identification and correction of maladaptive thoughts about anxiety and its consequences is furthermore part of the treatment package.</detailed_description>
