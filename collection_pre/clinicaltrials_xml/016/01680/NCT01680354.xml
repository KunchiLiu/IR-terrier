	<brief_summary>Laser correction for myopia and astigmatism using an excimer laser has been performed with success for several years. During the last 2 years, a new method for correction of refractive errors has emerged. In the method (ReLex) a femtosecond laser is used to cut a lenticule in the corneal stroma that is subsequently removed. For simple myopia this method has proved effective and on par with excimer baser LASIK. However, it remains to be determined if ReLEx is as effective in the treatment of astigmatism. In the study, patients with high astigmatism are treated with conventional LASIK for astigmatism in one eye and with ReLEx for astigmatism in the other.</brief_summary>
