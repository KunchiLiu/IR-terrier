	<brief_title>Kinesiotaping in Treatment of Pes Anserinus Tendino-bursitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of pes anserinus tendino-bursitis includes refraining from aggravating activities, local modalities such as heat, ice, ultrasound (US), iontophoresis, phonophoresis, electrical stimulation (ES), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and injections with either corticosteroids or local anesthetics. Another treatment that seems to have a significant effect on the improvement of the disease is kinesiotaping. Kinesiotaping is a cotton strip with an acrylic adhesive that is used for treating athletic injuries and a variety of physical conditions. The therapeutic effects of the tape is to relax the overused muscles and in rehabilitation to facilitate the underused muscles. Advocates claim that the wave pattern found on the kinesiotaping has a lifting effect on the skin which can diminish swelling and inflammation via improving circulation and reduce pain by removing pressure from pain receptors.</detailed_description>
