	<brief_summary>Inadequate suppression of intramuscular and adipose tissue lipolysis, and consequent excessive delivery of fatty acids to ectopic tissues (e.g. muscle, pancreas and liver) could play an important role in the development and exacerbating of insulin resistance. Therefore, the investigators propose to study the regulation of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle lipolysis, as well as further characterize the intracellular lipolytic pathways within these tissues, in obese normoglycaemic versus long-term diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects.</brief_summary>
