	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to examine the effectiveness of the Computerized Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention (CASI) in adolescent patients in the Emergency Department at the UC Irvine Medical Center. This research study will evaluate the effectiveness of the brief intervention compared to standard of care (no intervention). Brief interventions have a high potential impact in ED. Computerized alcohol screening and brief intervention (CASI) is a fast and easy to use tool for patients and healthcare providers. CASI provides the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C)4, from the World Health Organization and CRAFFT3, followed by a brief intervention and customized alcohol intake recommendations for the patient. This study will also determine the effectiveness of the brief intervention in reducing alcohol use/abuse in adolescents between 12-17 years of age. The overall goal of this study is to identify at risk alcohol use/abuse in adolescents and provide an intervention at an early stage. The current data to support alcohol and screening and brief intervention in adolescents is limited. The researchers hope that this research study will add to the overall body of knowledge in support of using the emergency department as a tool in public health, as it relates to the individual patients morbidity and mortality (pancreatitis, cirrhosis) and to the societal costs of alcohol use (lost days of work, motor vehicle collisions).</brief_summary>
