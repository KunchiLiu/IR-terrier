	<mesh_term>Hyaluronic Acid</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female 18 years of age or older Have 2 fully visible, approximately symmetrical nasolabial folds and has severity scores of 2 or 3 on the 5point photographic nasolabial fold severity scale (range 04) for both nasolabial folds, as judged by the Investigator Have a reasonable expectation for correction by injection via deep dermis, as described in the protocol Agree to refrain from undergoing other antiwrinkle/volumizing treatments in the lower twothirds of the face (below the orbital rim) for the duration of the study Understand and be willing to follow all aspects of the study protocol and have signed and dated the Informed Consent prior to any studyrelated procedures being performed Be in good health as in the opinion of the Investigator Has undergone cosmetic facial procedures (e.g., face lift or other surgeries) which may alter the appearance of the nasolabial fold area Cosmetic injections in the lower twothirds of the face (below the orbital rim), within 6 months prior to entry in the study, or be planning to undergo any of these procedures at any time during the study. NOTE: Prior treatment with HA fillers and/or collagen is allowed, provided the treatment was administered more than 6 months prior to study entry Has undergone volumizing of the mid/lower face within 9 months prior to study entry Has ever received semipermanent fillers or permanent facial implants (e.g., calcium hydroxylapatite, polyLlactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, silicone, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) anywhere in the lower face (below the orbital rim), or be planning to be implanted with any of these products at any time during the study Have a history of anaphylaxis, multiple severe allergies, atopy, allergy to lidocaine (an any amidebased anesthetics), HA products, or Streptococcal protein, or be planning to undergo a desensitization therapy during the term of the study Be a pregnant female, lactating, or planning to become pregnant at any time during the study Be a female of childbearing potential not using a reliable means of contraception Have received any investigational product within 30 days prior to study enrollment or be planning to participate in another investigation during the course of this study Suffer from an uncontrolled personality disorder (e.g., body dysmorphia, depression) Have a history of or currently suffer from autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease) Have a history of streptococcal disease (e.g., strep throat or rheumatic fever with or without heart complications) Have a history of skin cancer Suffer from porphyria Have epilepsy, which is not controlled by antiepilepsy therapy Current cutaneous inflammatory and/or infectious processes (e.g., acne, herpes) Have a history of treatment with interferon Be on an ongoing regimen of anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin) or have taken nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) or other substances known to increase coagulation time (e.g., herbal supplements with garlic or ginkgo biloba) within 10 days of undergoing study device injection. NOTE: Study device injection may be delayed as necessary to accommodate this 10day period Be on a concurrent regimen of high doses of lidocaine (more than 400 mg) which may cause acute toxic reactions Be on a concurrent regimen of other local anesthetics structurally related to amidetype local anesthetics Have impaired cardiac conduction, severely impaired hepatic function, or severe renal dysfunction Have a condition or be in a situation that, in the Investigator's opinion, may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study</criteria>
