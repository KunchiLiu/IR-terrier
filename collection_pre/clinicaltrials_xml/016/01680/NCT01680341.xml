	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of two different titration algorithms for insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDeg/IAsp) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus previously treated with insulin glargine.</brief_summary>
