	<brief_summary>Overweight patients with type 2 diabetes are often being treated with an intensified insulin therapy. However, in many cases, even a high insulin dosage (&gt; 100 U per day) does not achieve satisfying metabolic control. A new therapy option is necessary that makes it possible to lower the daily insulin requirement and to improve metabolic control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a protein-rich meal replacement is suitable to lower the daily insulin requirement and to reduce HbA1c and body weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Activation With Almased for Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot study included patients with type 2 diabetes (n=22), that injected &gt;100 U insulin daily. During the first week, all three main meals were replaced with 50 g of a protein-rich meal replacement (Almased) (=1100 kcal per day). During weeks 2-4, only two meals were replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed. During weeks 5-12, only dinner was replaced. Clinical parameters were determined at the beginning of the study, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks as well as after 1.5 years of follow-up. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the intention-to-treat analysis and Mann-Whitney test for subgroup analyses.</detailed_description>
