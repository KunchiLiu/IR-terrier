	<brief_title>A Randomized, Open-label Study Comparing Two Different Rabies Vaccine Schedules in Chinese Children and Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Rabipur Zagreb (2-1-1) and Rabipur Essen (1-1-1-1-1) simulated post exposure vaccination schedules in Chinese children and older adults. Subjects randomized to Group 1 (Zagreb) will receive 4 doses of rabies vaccine Day 1 (2 doses), and on Day 8 and Day 22. Subjects randomized to Group 2 (Essen) will receive 5 doses of rabies vaccine on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 29. First vaccine will be administered on study Day 1. 240 children and 400 older adults, a total of 640, is planned to be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be divided further into age subsets of equal numbers within each age cohort (children: 6 to 11 years of age and 12 to 17 years of age; older adults: 51 to 60 years of age and 61 years of age and older. Within each age subset, subjects will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective is to establish the non-inferiority of the Rabipur Zagreb (2-1-1) schedule relative to the conventional Rabipur Essen (1-1-1-1-1) schedule based on geometric mean titers (GMC), and the secondary objective is to assess the percent of subjects with rabies virus neutralizing titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL 14 days after the first vaccinations (study Day 15) for each schedule and age cohort</detailed_description>
