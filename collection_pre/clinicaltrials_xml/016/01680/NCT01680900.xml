A secondary aim is to evaluate improvement in menopause-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vilazodone for Menopausal Hot Flashes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a proposal to conduct a small clinical trial for proof in principle that vilazodone reduces the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes. An additional exploratory aim is to identify improvement in menopause-related quality of life. Healthy, perimenopausal women ages 45-60 with an average of 4 or more moderate or severe hot flashes/night sweats per day for 3 screening weeks will be randomized to 8 weeks of treatment in a 2:1 ratio of vilazodone or matching placebo pills. Flexible dosing of vilazodone will start at 10 mg once/day for 7 days, increase to 20 mg/day for 1 more week and increase to 40 mg once/day at week 3 if unimproved. The primary outcome assessments are the frequency and severity of hot flashes at week 4 and week 8 as assessed by prospective daily diaries (using 7-day mean scores from the daily diaries). The secondary outcome is clinical improvement, defined as hot flash frequency &gt;=50% decrease from baseline. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and patient ratings of tolerability will be obtained.</detailed_description>
