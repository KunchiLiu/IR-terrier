	<brief_summary>Macular hole is a hole formation which takes place in the center of the retina. Such a hole needs surgical steps in order to close. Closure of the macular hole will lead to a substantially improvement of vision in most cases. Following macular hole surgery a tamponade of intraocular gas is normally injected in order to keep the macula dry for the postoperative period. Postoperative face down position for a week was earlier standard. Several authors report of good closure rates with both air tamponade or lack of face down positioning. In this study standard pars plana vitrectomy with peeling of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) will be performed. The gas tamponade will be replaced by air. Postoperative face down positioning will not be used.</brief_summary>
