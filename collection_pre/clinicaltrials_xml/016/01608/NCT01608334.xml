	<brief_summary>Adequate sensory block for surgical procedure without side effects and immediate mobilization after surgery are desirable anesthetic technique in various surgeries. Considering the sensory innervations to the prostate, a sensory block up to L1 - T12 is adequate to the TURP. Low-dose intrathecal local anesthetics may meet these criteria, but occasional lack of sufficient sensory block could be troublesome. In this randomized study, the investigators evaluated the spinal anesthetic characteristics following intrathecal administration of bupivacaine 1 mg with fentanyl or sufentanil in elderly patients undergoing TURP.</brief_summary>
