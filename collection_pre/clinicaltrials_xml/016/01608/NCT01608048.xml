	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation to Improve Pregnancy Rates for Women Undergoing in Vitro Fertilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>(1) infertile women &lt; 40 years of age, undergoing a fresh IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle; (2) be an appropriate candidate with the potential for a lower success rate which defined as two or more previous unsuccessful ETs (fresh or frozen); (3) are willing to sign an informed consent form, indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study that is in keeping with the policies of the institution; (4) willing to return to the study site for their study visits. The reason for our inclusion criteria is that women experienced several unsuccessful OAs or ETs may easily accept randomization to this study, and for whom adding TEAS or EA may significantly improve their clinical outcomes. (1) major medical illnesses (like stage III heart disease, severe hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, HIV positivity, severe bleeding dyscrasias, etc.) possibly precluding IVF or pregnancy; (2) FSH more than 20 IU/L; (3) receiving donor eggs; (4) cutaneous lesion of certain acupoint area; (5) having been previously participated in this study or having undertaken acupuncture (in whatever modality) treatment for infertility.</criteria>
