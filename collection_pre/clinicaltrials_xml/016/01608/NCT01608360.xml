	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine injection on the relief of pain in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. A total 56 patients will be randomized into one of two groups(group C or group I) based on Excel number generation. Patients in group C will receive normal saline intravenous injection, and patients in group I will receive an intravenous bolus injection of 1.5mg/kg lidocaine followed by a continuous lidocaine infusion of 2mg/kg/hr. Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption, the frequency at which patients pushed the button(FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system, and presence or absence of nausea and vomiting will be recorded at 2,4,8,12,24,48 hours postoperatively.</brief_summary>
