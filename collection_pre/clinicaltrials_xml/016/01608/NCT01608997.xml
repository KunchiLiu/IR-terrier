	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tears are common amongst 50-60 year olds with no connection to their physical activity. When symptomatic, the injury affects all aspects of general health, quality of life and function. Surgical intervention is recommended only if conservative treatment fails. The purpose of the surgical intervention is to reduce pain, and improve function while improving range of motion and muscle strength around the shoulder. The purpose of the current study is to measure physical, functional, expectation, satisfaction and quality of life outcomes after rotator cuff repair surgery. Another purpose is to learn the reproducibility components of the above outcomes.</brief_summary>
