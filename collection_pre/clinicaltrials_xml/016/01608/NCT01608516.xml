	<brief_summary>The present study aims at assessing the ability of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT for the detection of inflammatory atheromatous plaques in the carotid arteries, compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT, MRI and US and to determine the contribution of each imaging technique. Current gold standard for inflammation is histopathology. Hypothesis : 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD might give a better initial evaluation of patients with atheromatous plaques in the carotid artery eligible for endarterectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with indication for endarterectomy will be presented the present protocol. If inclusion criteria are fulfilled, patients will have a 18F-FDG PET/CT + carotid US performed 6 to 2 days before endarterectomy and 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT + MRI performed the day before endarterectomy. Histopathological sample will be analyzed to measure plaque inflammation. All imaging results and histopathology results will be pooled and compared.</detailed_description>
