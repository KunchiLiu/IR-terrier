	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Diagnosis of relapsed ovarian cancer Responded to at least on one line of prior platinum based therapy Relapsed within platinum resistant interval (≤6months) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;2 Measurable disease defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter ≥25mm using conventional techniques Satisfactory baseline haematologic and organ function: Haematologic: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; or = 1.5 X 10^9/L; Platelets &gt; or = 100 X 10^9/L; Haemoglobin &gt; or = 9g/dL; PT or INR &lt; or = 1.2 x ULN; PTT &lt; or = 1.2 x ULN Hepatic: Bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5 X ULN; AST or ALT &lt; or = 2.5 X ULN Renal: Serum creatinine &lt; or = 1.5 mg/dL; Or if &gt;1.5 mg/dL, calculated creatinine clearance &gt; or = 50mL/min; UPC &lt;1 Poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 90mmHg]. Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. BP must be reassessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 1 hour; on each of these occasions, the mean (of 3 readings) SBP / DBP values from each BP assessment must be &lt;140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study. Treatment with any of the following anticancer therapies: radiation therapy 28 days prior to the first dose of pazopanib OR surgery or tumor embolization within 14 days prior to the first dose of pazopanib OR chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy or hormonal therapy within 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of pazopanib Treatment with antiangiogenic therapy Presence of gross ascites Clinically significant peripheral neuropathy Females of childbearing potential who are unwilling to avoid pregnancy, for the duration of the study</criteria>
