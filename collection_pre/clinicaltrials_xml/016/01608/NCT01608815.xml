	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine in Japanese participants to support registration of the product in Japan. Primary Objective: To describe the seroconversion rate (percentage of subjects with at least a 4-fold increase of their Vi antibody titer) between Day 0 before vaccination and Day 28 after vaccination with typhoid Vi polysaccharide (SP093) vaccine in subjects aged 2 years and above. Secondary Objectives: - To describe the safety profile of a single dose of typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine up to 28 days after vaccination, in subjects aged 2 years and above. - To describe the immune response following a single dose of typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine in subjects aged 2 years and above.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Single Dose of SP093 Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine in Japanese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive a single dose of typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine on Day 0 and be assessed for immunogenicity on Day 0 before vaccination and on Day 28 post-vaccination.
