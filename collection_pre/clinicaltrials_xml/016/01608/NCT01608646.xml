	<brief_title>Study of DPD for Predicting Efficacy and Safety to S-1 Plus Oxaliplatin in Gastrointestinal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new oral DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine (DIF), S-1, is reportedly effective against gastrointestinal carcinoma. In this study, the relationship between activity of DPD in peripheral blood and the effects of chemotherapy were investigated in 200 patients treated with first-line S-1 combined with platinum chemotherapy for gastrointestinal carcinoma.</detailed_description>
