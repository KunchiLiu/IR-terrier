	<brief_summary>Some BRCA-mutated women are reluctant to undergo laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The goal of the bilateral laparoscopic radical fimbriectomy the investigators suggest, is to suppress the tubal source of possible dysplastic cells from which can stem this high grade tumor, while preserving a natural ovarian hormonal secretion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radical Fimbriectomy for Young BRCA Mutation Carriers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of ovarian carcinomas related to BRCA 1 or 2 mutations are of fallopian tube origin and especially from its distant part called the fimbria. These tubal, ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinomas are quite always of high grade serous type. They cannot be effectively screened due to the quickness of their evolution. In this context, a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is the recommended prophylactic procedure. Some BRCA-mutated women are reluctant to undergo this procedure considering the numerous adverse effects on body and quality of life, especially when hormonal replacement is forbidden. This refusal makes them at risk of developing a serous pelvic carcinoma. The goal of the bilateral laparoscopic radical fimbriectomy the investigators suggest, is to suppress the tubal source of possible dysplastic cells from which can stem this high grade tumor, while preserving a natural ovarian hormonal secretion</detailed_description>
