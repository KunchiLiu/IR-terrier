	<brief_summary>Objectives: Aim 1. Develop a prototype intervention electronic game that implements a baseline testable feature set, including features for social networking within a virtual game space, managing an intermittent mediated reward cycle, goal setting and tracking, and collaborative problem solving. Aim 2. Evaluate the technical merit, feasibility, user perception and acceptance of the prototype system with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCTs) patients in recovery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Feasibility Evaluation Phase: If you agree to take part in this study, you will meet with the study staff during a clinic visit. You will receive instructions on using the video game through the internet. During the game, you will complete many different "real world" tasks that relate to things you should do to help with your recovery from HSCT. You will also be able to communicate with and compete against other participants in the study. You can use your own computer to play the game or one will be loaned to you for use during the study. You will be asked to play the game at home for 3 weeks. The number of times you will play during the 3 weeks will depend on your treatment schedule. You will be given contact information to report any problems or questions you may have to the study staff. You will also be called by phone after your appointment with your doctor or asked at a clinic visit if you have any problems or questions. Within 1 week after the 3-week period ends, you will have an interview over the phone or at a clinic visit. You will be asked about what you liked or did not like about the game. If you have been loaned a computer, you will return it at the end of the study. This is an investigational study. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 32 will take part in this phase of the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Needs Analysis Phase: If you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in a focus group discussion. During the discussion, you will be asked questions about your likes and dislikes about a video game being designed by researchers. The game will be designed around tasks you should do to help with your recovery from HSCT. You will be asked questions about what features you might like to see in the game and what you think it should look like. The focus group session may last up to 1Â½ hours. The session may be audiotaped and researchers may take notes during the session. Several weeks after the focus group session, you will be asked to return and provide your opinions on documents and drawings researchers created about the game. This may be done one-on-one or in a small group session. This is an investigational study. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 8 will take part in this phase of the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
