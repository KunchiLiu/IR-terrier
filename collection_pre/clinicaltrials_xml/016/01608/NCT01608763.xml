	<brief_summary>The major objective of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of the normative feedback and other personalized feedback components of the Check Your Drinking (CYD) Internet-based intervention in the general population. Eligible problem drinking participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 by 2 design - to receive just the normative feedback component of the CYD intervention, just the other personalized feedback information, to a no intervention control condition, or to receive the full CYD intervention. The no intervention control condition will not be sent any intervention materials but will instead be sent a list of the different components of the CYD feedback and will be asked to think about how useful they would find each of them. All participants will be followed-up at 3 months.</brief_summary>
