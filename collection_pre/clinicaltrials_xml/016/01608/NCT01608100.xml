	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance and intended use of a new cardiac biomarker test, Troponin I, in an intended use population. Blood specimens will be tested using the new investigational test that detects the level of Troponin I. Results will be compared to the diagnosis of whether or not an acute myocardial infarction (MI) occurred.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a New Cardiac Biomarker Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the cardiac biomarker Troponin I is to aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.The assay is also intended to assist in the prognosis relative risk to all cause mortality (ACM) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) consisting of myocardial infarction, revascularization, and cardiac death in patients who present with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. All specimens were collected under a separate specimen collection protocol (Protocol No, 7B5-02-09A01-01: Clinical Specimen Procurement for Biomarker Evaluation of Suspected ACS). The specimens that will be tested include approximately 8300 specimens collected from 1101 subjects presenting to Emergency Departments with signs and symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome and will be provided to the clinical sites performing investigational Troponin I testing.</detailed_description>
