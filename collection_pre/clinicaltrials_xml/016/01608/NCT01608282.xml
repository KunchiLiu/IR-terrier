	<brief_summary>OPEN (Osteoarthritis Physical Activity and Exercise Net) is a website created based on a well developed behavioural theory. This intervention is developed for people with early knee osteoarthritis (OA) who have been sedentary. The investigators aim to engage these individuals to become physically active at a time when their joint symptoms tend to be mild. The primary goal of this proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial is to determine if the OPEN website plus an information pamphlet about OA will improve participation in physical activity in persons with early knee OA, compared to those who receive only the pamphlet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet Intervention to Improve Physical Activity in Early Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Being physically active has been shown to reduce pain, improve quality of life and potentially reduce joint damage. However, our recent survey in British Columbia found only 1 in 4 people with mild osteoarthritis symptoms (pain; stiffness) met the recommended level of physical activity. Research in people without arthritis shows that web-based tools can increase walking behaviour, but none of these tools are designed with the needs of people with arthritis in mind. Research in other chronic diseases has found that people are more likely to quit smoking shortly after the diagnosis of a smoking-related disease. Thus, the diagnosis of osteoarthritis presents an ideal 'teachable moment' to engage those who have been sedentary to become physically active. This project will address the Research Question: Can an interactive website increase physical activity in people with previously undiagnosed knee osteoarthritis? We have created a website, called OPEN (Osteoarthritis Physical Activity &amp; Exercise Net), based on a well developed behavioural theory. A total of 252 sedentary people with early knee osteoarthritis will be recruited in British Columbia to test the website. Half of them will be assigned to use the OPEN website for 3 months and will receive an education pamphlet produced by The Arthritis Society; the other half will only receive the pamphlet. During the test period, participants will complete an online questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6 months to allow us to follow changes in physical activity, knee symptoms and outcomes related to their motivation to become physically active. In addition, participants from Metro Vancouver will complete an aerobic fitness test administered by a blind assessor. Changes between the two groups will be compared. Our project directly targets physical inactivity at a time when the joint damage tends to be mild, and when people are more motivated to adopt a healthy behaviour. If the OPEN is found to be effective in improving physical activity, it opens further opportunities to promote early diagnosis and to implement lifestyle interventions.</detailed_description>
