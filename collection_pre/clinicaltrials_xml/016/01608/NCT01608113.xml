	<brief_summary>Treatment naive patients with subfoveal nAMD initially treated monthly with intravitreal anti-VEGF and subsequently PRN, will be included in this study. Patients will be investigated for the first 2 years monthly and subsequently according to disease activity but at least every two months. Patients will be examined with 4m BCVA ETDRS distance visual acuity, reading acuity measured by Radner-Reading-Charts, contrast sensitivity by Pelli-Robson score, microperimetry and HD-OCT.</brief_summary>
