	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety of DBS-f in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease by assessing all device and/or therapy related adverse events. The secondary objective is to preliminarily estimate the treatment effect size on the outcomes of interest at 12 months post-randomization. The objectives do not involve formal tests of hypotheses.</brief_summary>
