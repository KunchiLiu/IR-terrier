	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Recreational Activity for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to compare two group interventions for psychiatric patients with Autism spectrum disorder and normal intelligence: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy developed to suit adults with Autism spectrum disorder, and recreational activity, enabling social interaction. The recreational activity intervention served as a low-impact option, easily organised within the community. It is not a placebo; rather it controls for the positive effects that come out of a structured social environment and group setting. The investigators hypothesized that both interventions would lead to improvement in quality of life, well-being and relief in psychiatric symptoms, with a greater effect in the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy intervention compared to recreational activity. A cumulative follow-up was made, within 5 1/2 years after the start of the treatments. Additional questions adapted to the patient group were added at this 5 1/2 year time point.</detailed_description>
