	<brief_summary>This study will look at the safety of treating patients with heart attack with mild hypothermia induced using a system of automated peritoneal lavage. The hypothesis is that the Velomedix Automated Peritoneal Lavage System can treat patients with heart attack safely and with adequate performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Ultrafast Hypothermia Before Reperfusion in STEMI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aims to determine the safety and feasibility of using the Velomedix Automated Peritoneal Lavage System to treat patients with STEMI using therapeutic hypothermia. Patients will undergo cooling, maintenance and rewarming and applicable data will be gathered on device performance and patient safety. Patient temperature and vital signs will be monitored in addition to various laboratory values. Adverse event reporting will take place at multiple time intervals and follow-up will continue out to 6-months.</detailed_description>
