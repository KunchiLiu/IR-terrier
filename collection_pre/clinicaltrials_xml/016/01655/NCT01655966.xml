	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis C is endemic in Egypt with a high prevalence of the resistant genotype 4. Conventional standard of care treatment has modest response with only 50% sustained virologic response. Recent reports have suggested an augmented response with the addition of vitamin D. This is a prospective randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of adding vitamin D to standard of care for chronic hepatitis C genotype 4.</brief_summary>
