	<brief_summary>The purpose of the research is to test the effectiveness of the social story intervention delivered using the iPAD application "Going to Imaging" on the anxiety, challenging child behaviors, child injuries and completion rates among children with ASD undergoing medical imaging procedures. A secondary purpose is to test the effect of this intervention on the anxiety levels of the parents of ASD children undergoing medical imaging procedures. Hypotheses: H1: Children with ASD who are exposed to a story book "Here the investigators go to medical imaging (x-ray)" to prepare for medical imaging compared with children with ASD exposed to treatment as usual (TAU) will have: 1. Lower anxiety as measured by heart rate respiratory rate, and blood pressure (baseline compared to up to two hours later). 2. Exhibit fewer challenging behaviors as measured by a behavior observation scale (developed for the study (up to 2 hours after baseline) 3. Higher procedure completion rate. 4. Shorter time to complete a procedure. 5. Less child injuries. H2: Compared to parents of ASD children exposed to treatment as usual (TAU), parents of children with ASD who are exposed to a story book "Here the investigators go to medical imaging (x-ray)" to prepare for medical imaging will have: 6. Lower state anxiety as measured by the State Anxiety Inventory ( baseline ).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parent state anxiety is measured at baseline with the 20-item State anxiety measure from www.mindgarden.com. Child anxiety is measured at baseline with vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate). Behaviors will be observed and recorded on the behavior observation tool up to 2 hours after the baseline measure (during the imaging).</detailed_description>
