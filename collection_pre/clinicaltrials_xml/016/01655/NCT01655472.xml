	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a lifetime prevalence of about 1%.Genetic studies strongly suggest a genetic component to the inheritance of schizophrenia. Structural neuroimaging studies have provided consistent evidence for brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. The timing of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia has not been determined yet. The investigators hypothesize that brain structural changes can be detected in neonatal life. The investigators hypothesize that offspring of schizophrenic patients will have higher rates of brain structural changes in the neonatal period. The investigators propose to study early development of fetuses in offspring of patients with schizophrenia. The study is a multi-center prospective trial.</brief_summary>
