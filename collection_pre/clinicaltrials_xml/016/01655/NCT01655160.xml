	<brief_title>Effects and Mechanisms of Treatment Intensity of Mirror Therapy in Patients With Subacute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is to examine whether (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in MT would occur on sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in MT on functionality can persist for six months after treatment finished; and (3) the MT could result in cortical/movement reorganization as well as the changes in physiological markers.</detailed_description>
