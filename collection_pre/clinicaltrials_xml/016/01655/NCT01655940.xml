	<brief_summary>In this prospective study to try to standardize the care for patients, the investigators are planning to compare two cerebral oximeters currently in use at NCH in terms of their accuracy in determining the cerebral oxygen saturation as determined by jugular bulb oxygen saturation. Also, the investigators will compare these devices in terms of their response to changes in hemodynamics that occur during cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
