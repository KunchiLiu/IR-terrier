	<brief_summary>This is a 40-week study to investigate how safe and effective solifenacin solution is in treating children/adolescents with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) who completed study 905-CL-076. To measure the efficacy of the treatment the patient will complete a 7-day patient diary prior to every visit, starting at Visit 9. The patient will attend the study clinic on 7 separate occasions. The first visit of this study (905-CL-077) will be combined with the last visit of the 4-month study 905-CL-076. At each visit, the patient will be required to undertake a number of assessments or examinations to determine whether it is safe for him/her to take part or to continue to take part in the study. During the first 3 visits the dosage of the study drug will be adjusted if needed in order to optimize the most effective and safe dose for each patient.</brief_summary>
