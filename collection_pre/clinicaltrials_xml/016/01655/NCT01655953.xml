	<brief_summary>The study aimed to examine the effects of an alkalinisation of a NaCl (sodium chloride, salt)-rich diet on acid base status, bone metabolism, protein turnover and other influenced physiological systems. Due to increased urinary calcium excretion and bone resorption a high NaCl-intake is considered as a risk factor for osteoporosis. On the contrary an alkaline diet is known to have a beneficial influence on bone metabolism. Therefore the investigators hypothesized that an alkaline diet can reduce NaCl-induced bone resorption. 8 healthy male volunteers took part in a stationary study carried out in the metabolic ward of the German Aerospace Center. The study consisted of 2 campaigns, each lasting 16 days. Both campaigns were divided into 5 days of adaptation, 10 days of intervention and 1.5 days of stationary recovery. During the intervention period the volunteers diet was NaCl-rich (7.7 mmol Na/kg body weight/day) and supplemented in one campaign by 90 mmol potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) in a randomized cross-over design. The other campaign served as control. Bone metabolism was studied by bone formation markers in the fasting morning blood and 24h-urinary bone resorption markers. Acid base status was assessed by blood gas analyses in the fasted and the postprandial state as well as urinary markers. Protein turnover was studied with stable isotopes. Further physiological systems like energy metabolism and the cardiovascular system are also under investigation.</brief_summary>
