	<brief_title>Video Discharge Instructions for Fever and ED Recidivism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized prospective convenience study of children presenting to the ED. Children greater than 8 weeks and up to and including their 18th birthday are enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: video + written fever specific discharge instructions and only written fever specific discharge instructions. Parents assigned to the video group watched the DVD in the emergency department (ED) and take it home along with the written instructions. At 72 hours both groups received a phone call asking whether they returned to the ED and the usefulness of discharge instructions (DVD and/or written). Critically ill children and those with chronic medical conditions were excluded. The primary outcome is a return ED visit for fever confirmed in our electronic medical record and questionnaire response. The secondary outcome is reported parental usefulness of the discharge instructions.</detailed_description>
