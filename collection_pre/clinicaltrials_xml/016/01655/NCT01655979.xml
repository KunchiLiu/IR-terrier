	<brief_summary>The human being has shown that he can live and work in the space environment, but due to the lack of essential mechanical load on muscle and bone, the fluid-shift as well as alterations in the acid-base balance (mainly on account of nutritional factors), the exposure to microgravity results in a gradual degradation of muscle, bone and cartilage, deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and metabolic changes. Countermeasures to prevent all the deconditioning of the physiological systems are not yet fully effective and require further investigation. A commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the human organism on ground is the 6Â° head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning. One of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context: supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting. Drawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation. Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the acidogenic properties need to be compensated. As previous works suggest, a shift of acid base balance into the acid direction and the resulting changes in bone and protein turnover may be hindered by supplementing alkaline mineral salts. In this regard, a mid-term bed rest study was performed in order to investigate the effect of a combined whey protein (0.6 g/kg body weight/day) and potassium bicarbonate (90 mmol/day) supplementation as a potential countermeasure to multiple physiological and metabolic alterations on the human body resulting from real and simulated microgravity.</brief_summary>
