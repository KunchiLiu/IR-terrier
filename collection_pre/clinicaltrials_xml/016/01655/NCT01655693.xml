	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase III study is to determine whether Doxorubicin Transdrug (DT) is effective in the treatment of patients suffering from advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) after failure or intolerance to Sorafenib. Patients with HCC with or without cirrhosis and with good liver functions are eligible. Only those who can not benefit from treatment for which efficacy is demonstrated are eligible. These patients are usually proposed either best standard of care (BSC) or participation to clinical trials. Patients eligible for the RELIVE study will receive either DT at 20 mg/m2 or DT at 30 mg/m2 or the BSC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Doxorubicin Transdrug Study in Patients Suffering From Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doxorubicin-Transdrug™ (DT) is a nanoparticle formulation of doxorubicin.In in vitro and in vivo models, DT was shown to overcome the multidrug resistance (MDR) and to be more effective than doxorubicin on both sensitive and resistant tumour models and in particular in the X/myc bi-transgenic MDR murine model of HCC.</detailed_description>
