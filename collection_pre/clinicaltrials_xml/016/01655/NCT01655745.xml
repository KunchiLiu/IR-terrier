	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study will enroll 30 patients with cT2/T3-N0-M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder for whom radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection is planned. This pilot study is designed to provide preliminary information on the accuracy of [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography MRI (FDG-PET-MRI) in the staging of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. All patients will undergo baseline FDG-PET-MRI and routine (standard of care) contrast enhanced abdominal/pelvic multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). The imaging results will ultimately be compared to final pathology as the gold standard. If the accuracy of FDG-PET-MRI is improved as compared to standard MDCT, the investigators plan to conduct a larger follow-up study to confirm the results of this pilot study. In addition, this pilot study will set the stage for the evaluation of novel PET tracers in the imaging of bladder cancer.</detailed_description>
