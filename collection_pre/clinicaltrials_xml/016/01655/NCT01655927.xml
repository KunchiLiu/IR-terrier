	<brief_title>Efficacy of Tranexamic Acid in Brain Tumor Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain tumor resection has been associated with increased blood loss and a significant increase in the incidence of Intravascular disseminated coagulopathy. The development of coagulopathy in the context of tumor resection is associated with poor results. Transfusion decision during the course of neurosurgical surgery offers benefits such as increased oxygen carrying capacity but may increase the risk associated with transfusions such as blood infections, hemolysis, lung injury and immunosuppression. The information available on tranexamic acid used in neurosurgery is little, therefore this opens up new alternatives in the techniques of reducing intraoperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that blocks the binding of plasminogen to the fibrin surface. It has been used to reduce blood loss during coronary revascularization, liver resection, obstetrics and orthopedic procedures. Tranexamic acid intraoperatively has been shown to reduce blood loss up to 45%. The primary concern when administering an antifibrinolytic drug is the potential increased incidence of thromboembolic events. There is no actual data on the utility of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss in brain tumors resection surgery. We want to compare Tranexamic Acid to Saline solution(Placebo) to see whether Tranexamic ACid Administration will reduce blood loss during brain tumor resection. Reduction in transfusion requirements will lead to reduced costs and possible reduction in complications of blood transfusion and perioperative incidents.</detailed_description>
