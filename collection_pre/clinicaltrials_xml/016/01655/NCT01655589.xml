	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the association between VEGF gene polymorphism and the response to intravitreal drugs in neovascular age-related macular degeneration. This is a retrospective review of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 at the Institute of Vision, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.</brief_summary>
