	<brief_summary>RATIONAL: Preliminary results fron the Study MESOT-TREM-2012 indicate a promising activity of tremelimumab in malignant mesothelioma (MM) patients. PURPOSE: The proposed study MESOT-TREM-2012 aims to explore the efficacy of a more intensive schedule of treatment with tremelimumab in 29 MM patients. Subjects will receive investigational product every 4 weeks (wks) for 6 doses, followed by doses every 12 wks until confirmed disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody Tremelimumab in Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint: 1) To assess the rate of objective clinical complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) Secondary endpoints: 1. To define toxicity profile according to NCI CT-CAE V. 3 2. To assess the overall survival (OS) 3. To estimate disease control rate (DCR) (proportion of patients with best response of CR+PR+SD) according to the modified Recist criteria 4. To assess the progression-free survival in treated patients according to modified Recist criteria 5. To evaluate qualitative and quantitative changes in cellular and humoral immune responses</detailed_description>
