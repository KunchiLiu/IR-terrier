	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine whether or not a new type of software is, or is not, of benefit. The software, ClearRead Confirm, is designed to enhance the ability of radiologists to detect tubes, lines and wires that may be placed within a patients chest. These types of devices are commonly used for very sick patients in intensive care units and are also used following surgery and in the treatment of cancer. This study will test radiologist's detection of the tips of these devices comparing the results with standard chest radiographs and the the modified chest radiographs. The primary interest is in the time used to interpret the radiograph. We will determine if there is any change in accuracy of detection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reader Study to Demonstrate That Use of ClearRead Confirm is Superior to the Use Standard AP/PA X-ray Image</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary hypothesis: the amount of time used for the interpretation of these radiographs will not change. (null hypothesis) Secondary hypothesis: there will be no change in the accuracy of the detection of the tips of venous catheters and tubes transiting the esophagus. (null hypothesis)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>For the radiologists, they must in in active practice of community radiology (nonuniversity sites). For the cases, they must be patients who have a tube, line, or wire in their chest. A small number of completely normal bedside chest radiographs will be included. For radiologists: Not in active practice. Working in a university hospital. For cases: children. Do not meet image quality criteria.</criteria>
