	<brief_summary>PSVT is a common rhythm disorder in emergency department which can be recurrent in some cases. Intravenous Adenosine is the drug of choice in PSVT control in acute settings but is a very short acting agent. Providing a complementary medication to decrease the rate of recurrence of PSVT after its initial control will be promising. This study evaluates the role of the oral Verapamil in recurrence control of PSVT in emergency situations.</brief_summary>
