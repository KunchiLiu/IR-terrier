	<brief_summary>Rate control in atrial fibrillation is a usual battle in emergency departments. Oral medications have a natural superiority to intravenous ones because they are easy-to-use and decrease the workload in busy emergency departments. This study wants to find an effective oral medication for rate control in rapid ventricular response atrial fibrillation. Propranolol and Metoprolol, Diltiazem and Verapamil are compared in patients with a stable hemodynamic status.</brief_summary>
