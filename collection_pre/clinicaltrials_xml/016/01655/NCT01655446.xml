	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposal is 1) to compare the relative effects of the robotic rehabilitation (RR), mirror therapy (MT), and conventional intervention (CI), 2) to compare the effects of the combined therapy of the RR-Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and the RR-Placebo Intervention (PI), and 3) to identify the clinical predictors that will potentially influence the functional outcomes after interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of RR and MT on Patient With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor deficit of upper extremity is one of the prominent problems in patients with stroke. Looking for effective and efficient treatments to improve affected UE function is of great importance in the field of rehabilitation. Two emerging movement therapies in stroke rehabilitation are robotic rehabilitation (RR) and mirror therapy (MT). Scientific evidence for comparative effectiveness research of RR versus MT versus CI on functional outcomes (e.g., motor, muscle, sensory, and daily functions) in stroke patients is limited. In addition, studies showed FES induced some improvements in individual movements at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers or in muscle strength in patients with moderate-to-severe paresis. The combination therapy of the FES and training protocols may increase the benefits of standard rehabilitative treatments and may also facilitate motor learning. However, the combined training effects of the RR and FES on stroke patients have not been well studies in a larger sample yet. Specific objectives of this proposed research are as follows: First, The investigators will compare the efficacy of the RR, MT, and conventional rehabilitation. Secondly, the investigators will compare the efficacy of the RR-FES versus RR-PI on outcome measures. Thirdly, the investigators will identify the clinical predictors that will potentially influence the functional outcomes after interventions.</detailed_description>
