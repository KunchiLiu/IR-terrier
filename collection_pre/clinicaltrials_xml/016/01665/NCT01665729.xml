	<brief_summary>Negligence or contempt of the etiology and pathogenesis of minor ischaemic stroke in the early diagnosis and effective treatment leads to more than 40-50% of patient with recurrent episodes, and 10% patient died. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of minor ischaemic stroke according to the etiology and pathogenesis is important. The 2007 Korean modified TOAST type got some progress, but there exists two major disadvantages: imperfect diagnosis and pathogenesis of perforator artery infarction etiology; lack of typing according to the pathogenesis of large atherosclerotic infarction and taking measures of treatment according to the new types. Recently, domestic professor Gaoshan proposes new approach to diagnose and treat minor ischaemic stroke according to the etiology and pathogenesis of CISS typing, but the pathogenesis of hypoperfusion infarction with severe stenosis of large artery is unclear. Is it low perfusion? Or artery-artery embolization? Or both? How to distinguish the pathogenesis of branch artery disease: by atherosclerosis? Or hyalinosis? Or both? How to check the validity of clinical types? This study take different interventions according to different types and observation of the long term clinical results of intervention( mortality, recurrence rate, disability rate and rate of cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage), in order to clarify the new types can indeed solve the current problem of minor ischaemic stroke with high mortality, recurrence rate, disability rate and rate of cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
