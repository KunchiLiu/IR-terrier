	<detailed_description>To our knowledge, all previous studies evaluated the energy intake in a dietary meal after consuming a low-energy-dense preload while none assessed the sustainability of lower amount of energy intake and body weight changes in a long-term. On the other hand, the sustainability of lower energy intake in a long term might be affected by higher dietary diversity score due to considering preload in diets. Notably, increased diet variety is associated with higher overall dietary energy intake and weight gain.</detailed_description>
