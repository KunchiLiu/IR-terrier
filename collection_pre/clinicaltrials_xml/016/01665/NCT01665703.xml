	<brief_summary>This pilot study is designed to evaluate imaging parameters indicative of underlying tumor biology. Patients with large renal masses (&gt;3 cm, or at the discretion of the investigator) who are planning to undergo nephrectomy will be identified, and recruited to undergo a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (MR-FDG-PET) scan.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study is designed to evaluate imaging parameters indicative of underlying tumor biology. Patients with large renal masses (&gt;3 cm, or at the discretion of the investigator) who are planning to undergo nephrectomy will be identified, and recruited to undergo a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (MR-FDG-PET) scan. Samples collected from their tumor after it is removed will undergo a variety of laboratory tests, including biomarker assessments and genotyping. By examining primary renal masses via a combination of MR and FDG-PET functional imaging in concert with tissue based tests, areas of hypermetabolism and hypervascularization will be evaluated as features of HIF activation or tumor subtype.</detailed_description>
