	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the safety and the best dose of carfilzomib and to see how well it works when given together with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pomalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving carfilzomib together with pomalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib, Pomalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib when administered in combination with fixed dosing pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. II. To determine the efficacy of the combination regimen at the MTD as measured by partial response (PR) response rate defined as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMW) criteria. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the best stringent complete response (sCR)/CR/nodular complete response (nCR) and &gt;= very good partial response (VGPR) rates. II. To estimate the time on study (TOS), duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) distributions. III. To further define the toxicity at the MTD. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To perform an analysis of a subset of patients who are refractory to either pomalidomide or carfilzomib or lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) combination. II. To evaluate the status of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patient who achieve sCR, CR or nCR. III. To evaluate prognostic markers and markers of response to pomalidomide, dexamethasone, and carfilzomib (PdC) in patients refractory to lenalidomide by analyzing pre-treatment clinical covariates and pre-treatment plasma cell profiles by proteomics and gene expression profiling (GEP). OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by phase II. Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16, pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease may continue to receive treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
