	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that people working in an acute care hospital setting will be able to successfully self-administer the intradermal vaccine (Intanza) in less time than nurse-administration of the regular intramuscular influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip). The investigators also hypothesize that people administering the intradermal vaccine for the second time will take less time to successfully administer than people administering it for the first time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Time-motion Study Comparing Self- to Nurse-vaccination With Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccination of healthcare workers has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in the patients they care for, as well as reducing illness and absenteeism in the healthcare workers themselves, and healthcare worker vaccination programs have been shown to be cost-effective for hospitals because of the reduced absenteeism. Although influenza vaccination programs based on nurse-administered intramuscular vaccination are effective, easy access to vaccination for hospital staff remains a challenge, in part because of large numbers of staff working evening, night and weekend shifts. In addition, in the Canadian setting, increasing the efficiency of all hospital programs is a priority. If regular recipients of seasonal vaccine became accustomed to the practice, self-administration may significantly improve the efficiency of pandemic mass vaccination campaigns.</detailed_description>
