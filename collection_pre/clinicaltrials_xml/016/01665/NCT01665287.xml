	<brief_summary>Regional tissue oxygenation (rStO2) can be monitored by near infrared spectroscopy. The commercial devices FORE-SIGHT (CASMED) and INVOS (COVIDIEN) will be used simultaneously to test for their relative sensitivity for low oxygen levels just after birth on term infants born by elective cesarean section. Reproducibility will be examined by replacements of the sensors six times the next day when the infant is stable and quiet. Neonatal sensors will be used.</brief_summary>
