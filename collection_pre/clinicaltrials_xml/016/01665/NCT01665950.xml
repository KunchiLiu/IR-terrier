	<brief_summary>Primary Aim: To estimate the antidepressant efficacy of simvastatin versus placebo as an adjunct to lithium, valproate, and/or other atypical antipsychotic therapy among individuals with bipolar I disorder in a nonpsychotic major depressive episode. Hypothesis: Simvastatin will be superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).</brief_summary>
