	<brief_summary>Underfeeding in the critically ill patient is a common observable fact throughout intensive care units. Patients who develop caloric deficit during their stay in the ICU have been shown in previous reports to be associated with increased complications such as increased rate of infections, and nosocomial blood stream infections. Yet, other studies have shown that patients with moderate caloric deficit may be associated with better outcome than patients who receive higher levels of caloric intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypocaloric vs. Full Energy Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therefore, the aim of our study is to establish the exact amount of calories to be delivered by indirect calorimetry individually for each patient. Thereafter, each patient will be randomized to the trophic group (hypocaloric feeding), or to the full energy delivery group.</detailed_description>
