	<brief_summary>Trastuzumab prolongs survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-positive breast cancer. Sequential left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) assessment has been mandated to detect myocardial dysfunction because of the risk of heart failure with this treatment. Myocardial deformation imaging is a sensitive means of detecting LV dysfunction, but this technique has not been evaluated in patients treated with trastuzumab. The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in tissue deformation, assessed by myocardial strain and strain rate (SR), are able to identify LV dysfunction earlier than conventional echocardiographic measures in patients treated with trastuzumab.</brief_summary>
