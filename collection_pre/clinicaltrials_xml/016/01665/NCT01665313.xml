	<brief_title>Comparison of Attention of Physician After Outpatient Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large body of data shows that fatigue impairs human performance. Additionally, many studies have provided evidence that fatigue can worsen mood, as indicated by increased scores on measures of depression, anxiety, confusion, and anger. In this context, we examined attentional and emotional changes in physicians after they completed an overwhelming outpatient clinic in a university-affiliated tertiary referral hospital in South Korea.</detailed_description>
