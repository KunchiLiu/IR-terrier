	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the amount of compound present in the blood (pharmacokinetics) after single and of multiple doses of GLPG0634 in elderly healthy subjects. During the course of the study, the effect of aging on the pharmacokinetics as well as the effects of GLPG0634 on mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood (pharmacodynamics) will be assessed and the safety of multiple oral doses of GLPG0634 in elderly healthy subjects will be characterized.</brief_summary>
