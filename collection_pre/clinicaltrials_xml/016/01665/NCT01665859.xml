	<brief_summary>Umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs are common and performed by numerous surgical techniques. Considering that the hernia repairs in general are relatively small and simple procedures there are disproportionate poor results. The aim of present study is to determine surgical risk factors for readmission after umbilical and epigastric hernia repair and to report risk factors for later reoperation for recurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors for Poor Outcome After Epigastric and Umbilical Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All elective umbilical or epigastric hernias registered in the Danish Ventral Hernia Database are included in the study. The included patients will be followed in up to 4 years in order to identify correlation between technical aspects of the hernia repair and postoperative morbidity.</detailed_description>
