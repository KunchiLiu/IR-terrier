	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether treatment with a single oral 300 mg dose of canagliflozin alters the kinetics (ie, clearance/removal from body) of serum C-peptide (a protein released from the pancreas during insulin secretion) in healthy adult volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Canagliflozin on C-peptide Clearance in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither the volunteer nor the study doctor/staff will know the identity of the assigned treatments) study to assess the effect of single oral (taken by mouth) dose of canagliflozin on clearance (removal from the body) of C-peptide in healthy adult volunteers. Healthy volunteers will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive a single oral dose of canagliflozin followed by a single oral dose of placebo (inactive substance) or a single dose of placebo followed by a single dose of canagliflozin with a period of 7-10 days between treatments. Healthy volunteers will also receive intravenous (i.v.) infusion (injection in the vein) of somatostatin for 4 hours and a single dose i.v. injection of synthetic human C-peptide following administration of canagliflozin or placebo during each treatment period. Somatostatin will suppress the normal secretion of C-peptide, a protein that is released from the pancreas during insulin secretion, so that the human C-peptide administered to volunteers can be accurately measured. The total study duration for each volunteer will be approximately 44 days. During the study, blood and urine samples will be drawn (collected) for clinical laboratory evaluations.</detailed_description>
