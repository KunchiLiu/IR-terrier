	<brief_summary>Consumption of a high-fat meal results in a postprandial (fed-state) response characterized by hypertriglyceridemia. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia increases the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increases blood concentrations of several biomarkers of inﬂammation. This postprandial lipemia-induced oxidative stress mediated response to a high-fat meal has been suggested as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis along with other chronic disease states of diabetes and obesity. Consumption of foods rich in antioxidant compounds provides a defence source to compliment endogenous defence systems to protect against oxidative damage during pro-oxidant conditions. The hypothesis of the study is that tomato extracted lycopene will be able to decrease postprandial oxidation and inﬂammation in healthy weight men and women when compared to Placebo.</brief_summary>

Subjects that has highsensitivity Creactive protein 16. Woman subjects with positive pregnancy test 17. Woman subjects that are breast feeding, pregnant, or planning on becoming pregnant during the duration of the study 18. Subjects with known cardiovascular disease or stroke, except for conditions that are deemed clinically insignificant by Principle Investigator or Subinvestigator, or study site physician (e.g. clinically insignificant atherosclerotic lesions observed by imaging studies). 19. Subject with history of significant gastrointestinal disease such as severe constipation, diarrhea, malabsorptive disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) 20. Subject with history of severe psychiatric illness which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the optimal participation in the study 21.
