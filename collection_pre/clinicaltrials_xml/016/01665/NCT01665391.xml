	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this trial are as follows: - to compare the achievement of a partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) in urinary protein: creatinine ratio (Up/c ratio) in patients treated with fresolimumab versus placebo - to compare the safety profile of patients treated with fresolimumab versus placebo The secondary objectives are as follows: - To compare the reduction in proteinuria in patients treated with fresolimumab versus placebo - To evaluate fresolimumab dose-dependent reduction in proteinuria - To compare the change in renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients treated with fresolimumab versus placebo - To evaluate the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of fresolimumab</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient's renal biopsy is consistent with the diagnosis of primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) including all histological subtypes. The patient has an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 The patient has a urinary total protein:creatinine ratio ≥ 3 mg protein/mg creatinine In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient has steroidresistant FSGS. The patient must have been treated for FSGS with a course of highdose steroid therapy for a minimum of 4 weeks The patient has been treated with an ACEi (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) and/or ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) at a stable dose for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 (treatment start) The patient has FSGS which in the Investigator's opinion is secondary to another condition The patient has been taking prednisone at a dose &gt; 10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of an alternative glucocorticoid) within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening Visit). The patient has received any other systemically administered immunosuppressive drugs (other than glucocorticoids) within 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. The patient has received rituximab within 6 months prior to Visit 1. The patient has a history of organ transplantation.</criteria>
