	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Variability and the Prognosis of Ischemic Stroke With Intracranial Artery Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is the main reason for the European and American white ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack,while Atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis is an important reason for Asian patients with stroke ,accounting for the 33% to 51% of a etiology ratio.The latest research suggests that varying degrees of blood pressure variability can affect the risk of stroke.This study observe the relationship between blood pressure variability and prognosis of ischemic stroke patients with intracranial arterial stenosis,with cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI + DWI),magnetic resonance angiography and Trans-cranial Doppler(TCD) .</detailed_description>
