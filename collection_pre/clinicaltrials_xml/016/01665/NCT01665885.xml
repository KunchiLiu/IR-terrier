	<brief_title>Hypothermia in Acute Ischemic Stroke - Surface Versus Endovascular Cooling (HAIS-SE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild hypothermia improves outcome in patients with global cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest. Via animal models hypothermia has been identified as the most promising neuroprotective therapy in focal cerebral ischemia as well. But the prove of clinical benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke is still missing: Most likely due to the prolonged time window until hypothermia-induction (14 h) in previous studies. In addition, feasibility of the method through which hypothermia is applied is crucial for a broad implementation of hypothermia in stroke therapy. Surface versus endovascular cooling have never been compared in a prospective trial in awake stroke patients. HAIS-SE is evaluating for the first time ever in a randomized controlled trial efficacy, tolerability, practicability and safety of endovascular versus surface cooling in awake stroke patients.</detailed_description>
