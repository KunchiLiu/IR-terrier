	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the project is to gain insight in sensory deficits and recovery patterns in the upper limb post stroke and its association with brain lesion localisation. Furthermore, the investigators will identify associations of deficits in sensory modalities with upper limb impairments, activities and participation at different time points after stroke. Identification of the sensory deficits, along with further insights in their relation with objective neurophysiological and neuroanatomical measures will contribute to the amelioration of goal-setting for the rehabilitation of upper extremity function after stroke. These functions are indispensable during several daily activities as well in different sports and leisure activities. This project is an important step towards a better delineating of treatment interventions for the upper limb and to a better guiding of individual needs for post-stroke treatment in the future.</brief_summary>
