	<brief_summary>Forces applied on soft upper tissues by different laryngoscope blades during direct laryngoscopy and intubation are considered to be major stimuli to cause serious damages to the patients. The aim of this study is to compare the force and pressure applied to soft tissue in order to achieve the same glottis view comparing direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy in vivo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Force and Pressure Distribution Using Macintosh and GlideScope Laryngoscopes in Normal Airway: an in Vivo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forces applied on soft upper tissues by different laryngoscope blades during direct laryngoscopy and intubation are considered to be major stimuli to cause serious damages to the patients, such as local injures to incisors, larynx and spinal column, or hemodynamic changes in heart rate and/or blood pressure due to autonomic nervous system stimulation. In order to reduce risk of such injures, indirect videolaryngoscopy provides the advantage of an easier laryngeal visualization with less need for the mouth-pharyngeal-laryngeal axes alignment, thereby reducing the detrimental effects above mentioned. The aim of this study is to measure the minimal force exertion to achieve not only glottis view but also a successful intubation, comparing GlideScope and Macintosh laryngoscope, in patients with normal airway conditions. Furthermore, The investigators measured the following parameters: pressure distribution upon the blade; time required to visualize the glottis; time required to complete oro-tracheal intubation.</detailed_description>
