	<brief_summary>Surgical treatment is the standard treatment for localized forms of lung cancer non-small cell. It allows a 5-year survival exceeding 50% for complete resection of the tumor. This is a heavy treatment, resulting in a mortality of 4 to 8% and a morbidity of 20-60%. Securing this procedure is a major public health issue. The non-invasive ventilation is a technique commonly used postoperatively in acute respiratory distress and in the treatment of sleep apnea syndromes. Through its effect on oxygenation and pulmonary function parameters, the non-invasive ventilation achieved during 7 days minimum before the intervention could significantly reduce postoperative complications in patients with an obstructive or restrictive disorder, obesity or chronic heart failure. The aim of the study is to demonstrate that the non-invasive ventilation in two pressure levels achieved during at least 7 days before surgery lung resection (lobectomy or segmentectomy) halved the pulmonary and cardiovascular postoperative patients with obstructive ventilatory disorder or restrictive, obesity or chronic heart failure.</brief_summary>
