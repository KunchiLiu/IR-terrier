	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Study of CKD-11101 and NESP After SC Administration in Health Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers are administrated CKD-11101 60μg and NESP 60μg once subcutaneously. (crossover) Every time before and after taking each medication, PK parameters and safety of CKD-11101 60μg and NESP 60μg are performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests(Laboratory test, V/S and Physical Examination, etc) respectively.</detailed_description>
