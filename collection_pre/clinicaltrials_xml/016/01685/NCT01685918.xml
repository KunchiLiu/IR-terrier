	<detailed_description>1. Retrospective study: We will collect data of Korean patients with RA retrospectively. Subjects will be extracted from medical records of RA patients who had treated with TNF inhibitor or are currently using TNF inhibitor. Patients who have received or are receiving biologic agents including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab from Dec.2000 to Dec.2010 will be enrolled. Data for this study which are sex, date of birth, previous and current medication, the results of laboratory test, disease activity of RA (DAS28ESR), comorbidity will be collected. Information of treatment, DAS28ESR, laboratory data and SAEs will be collected at baseline and predefined time points of follow-up (0, 3 month and recent follow-up data). During the first year of starting our study, we will focus to evaluate tolerability, the reason of discontinuation in elderly RA patients through this retrospective study. Tolerance could be analyzed by examining drug persistency of biologic DMARDs with the reason that led to drug interruption, and the drug persistency curves will be compared in the two groups. The length of time that patients remain on the drug therapy represents a useful measure of the treatment effectiveness and tolerability. The reason of discontinuation will be evaluate as descriptive analysis. And factors influenced on drug discontinuation in elderly RA patients and young RA patients using Cox-proportional analysis. 2. Prospectively study: We will use the data of patients of Hanyang University Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in web-based registry of RA patients with biologic DMARDs. Patients who start on receiving biologic agents including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab, abatacept will be enrolled. At registration, sex, date of birth, previous and current medication, the results of laboratory test, disease activity of RA (DAS28ESR), HAQ, comorbidity, socioeconomic status, etc. will be collected. Information of treatment, DAS28ESR, HAQ, laboratory data and SAEs, etc. will be collected at baseline and predefined time points of follow-up (0, 3 month and every 6 month). This prospective study will be progressed during three years. We will focus the response of biologic DMARDs and the occurrence of adverse event in elderly RA patients in this prospective study. The response could be evaluated with the change of DAS28ESR and functional disability (HAQ). We will compare the response in elderly RA patients versus young RA patients, and evaluate the impact of old age on the response using multiple logistic regression model with adjust various confounding factors. The occurrence of adverse events during three years will be described in two groups</detailed_description>
