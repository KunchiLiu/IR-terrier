	<brief_summary>This multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax (GDC-0199; ABT-199) administered in combination with obinutuzumab to participants with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All participants (relapsed/refractory and previously untreated) will receive 6 cycles of obinutuzumab and venetoclax. After completing combination treatment, previously untreated participants will receive single agent venetoclax for at least 6 additional months (the anticipated time on treatment for previously untreated participants is at least 12 months). After completing combination treatment, relapsed/refractory participants will continue single agent venetoclax until disease progression.</brief_summary>
