	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-administration of ABT-450 (also known as paritaprevir) with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir) in adults with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effect of Co-administration of ABT-450 With Ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 in Adults With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 2, randomized, open-label, combination treatment study of the 2-DAA regimen (ABT-450 150 mg QD + ritonavir 100 mg QD + ABT-267 25 mg QD) in adult HCV GT1b-infected treatment-naïve and Pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) treatment-experienced participants without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis, and in adult GT4-infected treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced participants without cirrhosis. Treatment Group 5 was not open to enrollment, based on a protocol-specified interim review of results from the treatment-naïve GT4 Groups 1 and 4 that indicated higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates among participants receiving the 2-DAA regimen with RBV. All other groups completed the study.</detailed_description>
