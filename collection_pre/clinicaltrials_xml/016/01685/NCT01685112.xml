	<brief_summary>Although few cases reported successful treatment of septic shock using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults, no studies compared ECMO to conventional treatment (without ECMO) as treatment for adults with septic shock. Since it is difficult to conduct a randomized study to allocate patients in such critical condition, we aimed to conduct a retrospective observational study using propensity score matched analysis to compare the survival of adults with septic shock treated by ECMO or conventional treatment.</brief_summary>
