	<criteria>Patients with previously treated Philadelphiachromosomenegative BALL, with progression after at least one prior therapy. Patients with Philadelphiachromosomepositive BALL can only be included if they are refractory or intolerant to at least one tyrosinekinaseinhibitor. Male or female patients at least 16 years of age; if the patient is less than 18 years of age, the patient must have the ability to understand and give written assent in addition to the parent's/guardian's written informed consent. Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of BALL Mixed phenotype acute leukemia patients who have B cell immunophenotype. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of less than or equal to 2 Patients with a total bilirubin of less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL Patients with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal Patients with a creatinine level of less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL If a female of childbearing potential, confirmation of a negative pregnancy test before enrollment and use of doublebarrier contraception, confirmation of a negative pregnancy test before enrollment and use of oral contraceptive plus barrier contraceptive, or confirmation of having undergone clinically documented total hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation If a male, use of an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months after the last dose if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential Patients with the ability to understand and give written informed consent and to comply with the study protocol Patients who received previous treatment with an antiCD19 antibody or fragments Receipt of antiCD20 therapy no greater than 4 weeks before the first study dose Patients having undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation within 3 months or having active graft versus host disease Patients with known hypersensitivity to any excipient contained in the drug formulation Patients with a New York Heart Association Class III or IV History of stroke or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Patients with a history of positive human immunodeficiency virus test result (ELISA or western blot) Patients with positive hepatitis serology. Hepatitis B (HBV): Patients with positive serology for hepatitis B, defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or total antihepatitis B core antibody (antiHbc). Patients positive for anti Hbc may be included if hepatitis B viral DNA is not detectable. Hepatitis C (HCV): Patients with positive hepatitis C serology (defined as positive for antihepatitis C virus antibody (antiHCV) unless HCVRNA is confirmed negative. Patients with active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection requiring active parenteral treatment Patients who are receiving active treatment/chemotherapy for another primary malignancy or have received any treatment, including surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, within the past 5 years (except ductal breast cancer in situ, for nonmelanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer not requiring treatment, and cervical carcinoma in situ) Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding Patients with major surgery or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to first study dose</criteria>
