	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a common disorder in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the rest of the body. Common symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath, swelling, and fatigue. Standard treatment for heart failure include diuretics to control fluid, as well as drugs called "neurohormonal antagonists" (such as beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors) that help the heart work more efficiently and prevent worsening of heart function. Typically, doctors adjust these medicines based on their clinical judgment about what doses and combination will work best for you. We are testing whether the use of a blood test called NT-proBNP (which measures a hormone released by the heart) can help doctors do a better job of adjusting these heart failure medicines over time than clinical judgment alone.</detailed_description>
