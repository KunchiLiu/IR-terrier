	<brief_summary>The investigators propose this study utilizing Lenalidomide, Adriamycin, Dexamethasone (RAD) as comparator arm for Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone (VRD) with the latter being considered a novel "standard" as an induction protocol, since response in general occurs early after starting treatment we decided to choose three cycles of either induction regimen. Together with the "novel compounds", tandem high-dose melphalan is still the standard of care; it seems desirable to re-address the question of the number of transplant (single vs. double high-dose melphalan) procedures required in the context of triplet-induction protocols utilizing at least one of the novel compounds. Thus, the question to be asked in the current protocol is whether immediate lenalidomide maintenance (i.e. following one cycle of high-dose therapy) as an investigational agent will result in identical progression free survival (PFS) when compared to tandem high-dose melphalan with deferred maintenance therapy. Despite induction with novel compounds, approximately 25 - 40% of patients will be in less than very good partial response. Very recently, achievement of less than VGPR was confirmed to negatively impact on both PFS as well as overall survival (OS). Therefore, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is considered the standard of care in patients with suboptimal response to a first autograft. In the current protocol, the standard for favourable responders (tandem-autologous transplant) is combined with 3 years of lenalidomide maintenance. This approach will be investigated for patients with less than VGPR following a first autotransplant and compared to the current standard of intensification in poor responders (allogeneic transplantation).</brief_summary>
