	<detailed_description>VA-HELPS will include flexibility in both content and delivery to meet the needs of Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) Veterans. Content will be modular to meet the needs of both anxious and depressed participants. Modular skills-based treatment has been used successfully with a range of clinical problems (Chorpita et al., 2004; Henin et al., 2001; Wetherell et al., 2009, 2011), including our own group's work treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in primary care (Calleo et al., in press) and anxiety-depression in patients with chronic illness (Cully et al., 2010). To further support a patient-centered treatment approach, patients will have the opportunity to include R/S. Research points to the importance of R/S in coping with illness, with 50-90% of patients reporting using their belief systems to enhance coping skills (Koenig &amp; Adams, 2008). Along with content modifications, delivery of treatment should complement the needs of HBPC Veterans. Providing one initial in-home session, followed by telephone contact for subsequent sessions, allows cost effectiveness to be taken into consideration; and greater numbers of rural HBPC patients will have access to the intervention. Treatment will involve approximately 6 to 8 weekly sessions lasting approximately 30-40 minutes each. After the first in-person session, all sessions will be delivered via telephone. At least one booster call (15-20 minutes) will occur during the month following completion of active treatment. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
