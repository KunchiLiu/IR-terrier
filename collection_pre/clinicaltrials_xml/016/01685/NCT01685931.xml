	<brief_title>A Study of Paliperidone Palmitate in Patients With Schizophrenia Previously Unsuccessfully Treated by Oral Antipsychotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 13-week, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm (one group of patients), multicenter, prospective, interventional study in Chinese patients. In a prospective, interventional study, the patients identified receive a treatment during the course of the research study and are followed forward in time for the outcome of the study. In China, there is still insufficient information about effectiveness, tolerability, and dosage strategy for directly switching from previous oral antipsychotics (drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders) in patients with acute symptoms. Acute symptoms are quick and severe form of illness in its early stage. In addition, there is also lack of information about bridging acute phase to long-term treatment. In this study, patients with multiple types of acute schizophrenia will be recruited and will receive Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) treatments for 13 weeks. After the acute treatment, the patients will continue to receive the prescribed medication and will be followed up for an additional 52 weeks to assess the outcomes related to long-term treatment.</detailed_description>
