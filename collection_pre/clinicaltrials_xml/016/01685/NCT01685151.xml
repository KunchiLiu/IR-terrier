	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Ramelteon Tablets for Sublingual Administration (TAK-375SL) in the Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Ramelteon. Ramelteon is being tested to treat people who have Bipolar 1 Disorder. This study will look at the symptoms of bipolar disorder in people who take Ramelteon. The study will enroll approximately 495 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Ramelteon (Dose 1) - Ramelteon (Dose 2) - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one tablet every night at bedtime throughout the study. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is 13 months. Participants will make 17 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. This 12-month study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-375SL in the maintenance treatment of bipolar 1 disorder. At this time, Takeda has decided to withdraw the study for business reasons. No participants were enrolled in this study.</detailed_description>

The subject has a MADRS total score ≤12 at the Screening and Baseline visits. 9. The subject has a YMRS score of ≤10 both at the Screening and Baseline visits. 10. The subject has a CGIS score of ≤2 at the Screening and Baseline visits. 11. HAMA score is ≤21 at Screening and Baseline visits. 12. The subject's medications for bipolar 1 disorder are stable ie, no change in psychotropic medications and no dose adjustment of psychotropic medications for bipolar 1 disorder has been made for at least 8 weeks prior to the randomization. 13. A male subject who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose. 14. A female subject of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose. 1. The subject has received any investigational compound &lt;30 days before Screening or 5 halflives prior to Screening, whichever is longer. 2. The subject has ever received TAK375 or TAK375 SL in a previous clinical study or has ever used ramelteon. 3. The subject is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependent relationship with a study site employee who is involved in conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. The subject has one or more of the following: 1. Any current psychiatric disorder which is the primary focus of treatment other than bipolar 1 disorder as defined in the DSMIVTR, as assessed by the SCID. 2.

Current diagnosis or history of alcohol or other substance abuse (excluding nicotine or caffeine) as defined in the DSMIVTR that has not been in full and sustained remission for at least three months from the day of screening (Subject must also have negative urine drug screen at Screening and Baseline; only exception is for benzodiazepines and opiates provided the subject has a valid prescription). 4. Current diagnosis or history of alcohol or other substance dependence (excluding nicotine or caffeine) as defined in the DSMIVTR that has not been in full and sustained remission for at least three months from the day of screening.(Subject must also have negative urine drug screen at Screening and Baseline; only exception is for benzodiazepines and opiates provided the subject has a valid prescription). 5.

Neurodegenerative disorder (Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, etc). 7. Any Axis II disorder that might compromise the study. 8. History of Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder: Subjects who have more than 8 episodes of mood disorder per year. The episodes must meet both the duration and symptom criteria for a Major Depressive, Manic, Mixed, or Hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or by a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity. Manic, Hypomanic, and Mixed Episodes are counted as being on the same pole. Each mood episode must be confirmed by appropriate patient history or formal diagnosis by medical practitioner. 5. The subject experienced the first episode of mood disorder after the age of 55 years. 6.
