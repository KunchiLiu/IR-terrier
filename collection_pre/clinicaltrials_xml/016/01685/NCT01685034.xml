	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a disease that has increased in incidence over the past decade that affects males predominantly, and in adults, is characterized by heartburn, dysphagia, strictures and food impactions. These symptoms may require emergent endoscopic removal of foods and esophageal dilations due to remodeling causing significant impairment in quality of life. Treatment options are limited and often not well tolerated or effective. There is poor understanding of the natural history and long term prognosis. It has been associated with allergic sensitization; a high percentage of affected individuals having associated atopy and current literature demonstrates a seasonal distribution of incidence and severity of symptoms. Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a well established and effective treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma which can induce tolerance to environmental allergens. Given the efficacy of AIT and the association of aeroallergen sensitization and even seasonal variation of EoE symptoms, we hypothesized that AIT may be a treatment option for patients with EoE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allergy Immunotherapy in the Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To evaluate the role of allergy AIT in the management of EoE. Research design: Patients with EoE and aeroallergen sensitization will be offered AIT as a treatment modality for EoE. They will be evaluated by questionnaire, laboratory tests, endoscopy and biopsy before and after treatment to determine if there is clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histologic changes in their EoE.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible for care at Naval Medical Center San Diego Diagnosis of EoE (with or without GERD) Positive skin test to aeroallergen(s) Able to provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study related procedure All excluding conditions for Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) pregnancy, severe asthma, uncontrolled asthma, taking a beta blocker, history of coronary artery disease. (Note: age is not typically an exclusion criteria for AIT, however this will be an adult only study). History of significant esophageal disease other than EoE (such as esophageal cancer, surgeries…) History of other systemic eosinophilic conditions (such as …) Subjects with controlled asthma on inhaled steroids at the time of diagnosis of EoE may be included , however if a subject develops new asthma or worsening asthma during the study requiring new initiation of inhaled steroids, they may be discontinued to avoid possible swallowing of the medication and "treatment" of their EoE. If subject is judged by the investigator as unlikely to understand the scope of the study and/or is unlikely to comply with the study procedures and visits. Is currently or has recently been on AIT (within the past year)</criteria>
