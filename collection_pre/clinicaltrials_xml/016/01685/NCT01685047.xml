	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to determine the prevalence of device-recorded ST segment changes occurring before appropriate ICD therapies (ATP or Shock) and to define their temporal relationship to ventricular arrhythmias.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient is implanted with an SJM ICD with ST Monitoring and ShockGuard™ features (and remote care feature in case Merlin.net will be used) The patient, in the opinion of the investigator, will not require ventricular pacing for more than 20% of the time. The patient, in the opinion of the investigator, has or is at high risk of CAD. The patient is ≥ 18 years of age. The patient is able to provide written Informed Consent prior to any investigational related procedure. The patient has longstanding persistent AF/AFl or permanent AF/AFl The patient has documented complete heart block. The patient is known to have uncontrolled ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy (PVCs on regular basis). The patient has severe Left Ventricular Hypertrophy resulting in interventricular conduction defect (IVCD). The patient has intermittent bundle branch blocks (BBB). The patient is unable to comply with the follow up schedule. The patient is participating in another investigational device or drug investigation. The patient is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant during the duration of the investigation.</criteria>
