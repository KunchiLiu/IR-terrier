	<brief_summary>Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with a 250 cm common/alimentary loop is a modification of standard duodenal switch in which a Roux-en-Y duodeno-ileal anastomosis is performed at 250 cm from the cecum and a 60 cm to 100 cm common channel is build up. Hypothesis of the study is that Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass behaves at least equally to standard duodenal switch as a second step after sleeve gastrectomy in the super-morbid patient. Secondary aims are to demonstrate that single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass is simpler to perform, quicker and has less postoperative short, mid and long-term complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal Bypass vs Standard Duodenal Switch as a Second Step After Sleeve Gastrectomy in the Super-Morbid Obese Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive operation for morbid obesity which has a 60% success rate in solving both morbid obesity and related co-morbidities, mainly diabetes mellitus. When the sleeve is not enough for the patient, due to alimentary habits or to an excessive initial BMI before surgery (usually over 50 - 55), a second-step operation should be performed to increase effectiveness. Some patients are submitted to a second restrictive operation, i.e.: a re-sleeve, a gastric plication or sleeve banding. Other group are offered a gastric bypass. And, finally, a subset of patients, generally those with higher initial BMI, are offered a malabsorptive operation. While re-sleeve is adequate for many patients, gastric bypass is not offering a greater weight loss rate, and it is a complex operation requiring sectioning of the sleeve and two anastomoses. We support the performance of malabsorptive operations which warrant a better weight loss result for "resistant" patients needing a second-step. As Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with Sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) has behaved as a good primary operation for morbid obesity, we decided to test this one-loop reconstruction as a second step operation. Results will be compared to those obtained with a Roux-en-Y duodenal switch performed as a second step after a "failed" sleeve.</detailed_description>
