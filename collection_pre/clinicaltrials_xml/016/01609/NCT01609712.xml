	<brief_summary>Patients with vertebral fractures often have problems to straighten and as a consequence of impaired lung ventilation that leads to a impaired lung function. Furthermore, it comes to the sintering of the vertebra and a so-called hunchback. This also contributes to the poorer expansion of the lung. Pain is also caused by respiratory excursions of the chest which hinder the patients to use their entire lung volume. Kyphoplasty is designed to counter all these consequences of vertebral fractures by bringing stability to the fracture. In order to prove the thesis the results of lung function test (FEV1, PEF) are assessed.</brief_summary>
