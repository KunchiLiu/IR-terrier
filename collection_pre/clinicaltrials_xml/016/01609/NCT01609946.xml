	<brief_summary>The study is an open, prospective multicenter study. According to the statistical sample size calculation 593 patients with thyroid nodules ≥ 5mm in size will be included in the study. Reference methods are cytology obtained by Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) or histology obtained by surgery. All patients will receive an B-mode and Duplex ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, as well as Realtime Elastography of thyroid nodules. Results of B-mode and Duplex ultrasound are compared to Realtime Elastography to evaluate the additional value of Realtime Elastography in the diagnostic work up of thyroid nodules.</brief_summary>
