The use of any other medications should be discussed with the Sponsor and/or Central Safety Monitor (CSM). 9. History of any of the following medical illnesses: Immunosuppression (disease or treatments that may affect immune system function) Diabetes (including gestational diabetes during the pregnancy that required treatment other than dietary).

Neuroinflammatory disease Autoimmune disease Eating disorder Chronic headaches associated with vomiting Chronic vomiting syndrome 10. Any current illness requiring daily medication other than vitamins, minerals, birth control, antihypertensives or antidepressants. The use of any other medications should be discussed with the Sponsor and/or CSM. 11. Allergies or hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or challenge virus. 12. Any clinically significant abnormality detected on physical examination, including: Murmur (other than a functional, ie normal, murmur) Focal neurological abnormality Hepatosplenomegaly Lymphadenopathy Jaundice 13.
