	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect safety and efficacy data on the IN.PACT Admiral™ Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) in treatment of atherosclerotic disease in the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries in a "real world" patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IN.PACT Global Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) commonly results from progressive narrowing of the arteries in the lower extremities, usually due to atherosclerosis. Progression of PAD can result in critical limb ischemia(CLI), manifested by ischemic pain at rest or in the breakdown of the skin, resulting in ulcers or gangrene which ultimately may lead to amputation and death. The IN.PACT Global Clinical Study aims to expand and understand the safety and efficacy data on the IN.PACT Admiral™ DEB in a real world population of subjects with intermittent claudication and/or rest pain (Rutherford class 2-3-4) due to obstructive disease of the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General inclusion Criteria: Age ≥ 18 years or minimum age as required by local regulations. Subject with documented diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or popliteal artery (PA) (including P1, P2, P3) classified as Rutherford class 234. Angiographically documented single or multiple lesions/occlusions (de novo or restenotic lesion(s) or instent restenosis) within the target vessels with a minimum lesion length of 2 cm including bilateral disease if both limbs are treated within 35 days. General exclusion Criteria: High probability of nonadherence to Clinical Investigation Protocol followup requirements. Failure to successfully cross the target lesion with a guide wire (successful crossing means tip of the guide wire distal to the target lesion in the absence of flow limiting dissections or perforations). Lesion within or adjacent to an aneurysm or presence of a popliteal aneurysm.</criteria>
