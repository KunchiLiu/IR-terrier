	<brief_summary>The UltraShape® Contour I- Y system uses focused ultrasound to produce localized mechanical motion within fat tissues and cells for the purpose of producing mechanical cellular membrane disruption. It is intended for reduction in body circumference. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Contour I - Y System on abdominal circumference reduction relative to baseline pretreatment values using different treatment methods. The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial is Statistical Difference of Circumference reduction between Baseline measurement and at follow-up measurement.</brief_summary>
