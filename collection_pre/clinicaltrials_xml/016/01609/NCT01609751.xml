	<brief_summary>There is evidence to show that daily probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) in the form of Yakult fermented milk supports a healthy balanced population of "friendly" gut bacteria. This, coupled with evidence from four European trials showing probiotic benefit for recurrent diverticulitis and an understanding of how the disease develops, indicates that LcS may also be beneficial. The investigators plan to undertake a pilot study investigating whether consumption of once daily probiotic LcS as Yakult fermented milk would help either prevent attacks of diverticulitis completely or significantly reduce frequency of attacks. Subjects will be recruited from Surrey primary care units and will be closely monitored for 12 months whilst being supplied with a daily dose of for the full 12 months to see if this improves gut health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because dietary fibre, obesity and diabetes are all confounding factors that influence the frequency and severity of attacks of diverticulitis, the research project will take account of this by: 1. Monitoring dietary fibre using a diet diary 2. Measurement of height and weight to determine BMI 3. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes As well as keeping a diet diary, subjects will be asked to keep a general health diary, and to complete gut health questionnaires at start, 6 months and 12 months.</detailed_description>
