	<brief_summary>This research trial studies protein expression in tissue samples from younger patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Protein Expression in Tissue Samples From Younger Patients With Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate (in two stages) which proteins are overexpressed in association with 12q13-q14 amplification by applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays to a panel of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS) cases organized into tissue microarrays. OUTLINE: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for 12q13-q14 frequency and protein overexpression by FISH and IHC.</detailed_description>
