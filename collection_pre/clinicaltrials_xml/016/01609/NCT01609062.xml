	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of a 2.0 mg/kg/week and a 4.0 mg/kg/week of BMN 110 in patients with Morquio A syndrome for up to 196 weeks. Secondary objectives were to investigate the effect of the two doses on exercise capacity for up to 196 weeks. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of both doses of BMN 110 was assessed.</brief_summary>
