	<brief_summary>Ageing is associated with a reduction of physical activity, movement efficiency, and quality of sleep. This leads to reduced health and well being in elderly subjects. Exercise training can increase movement efficiency and quality of sleep. Objectives: 1. Laboratory validation test of body acceleration based indexes for movement efficiency and quality of sleep; 2. Cross-sectional analysis to assess relations between these indexes and age; 3. Intervention study to assess the effect of exercise training on daily life movement efficiency and quality of sleep in ageing subjects 45 healthy human volunteers, age 50-83 yr, BMI 20-30 kg/m2 are divided in control or intervention group. Subjects that will have practiced fitness activities in the previous year, as well as pregnant or lactating women, will be excluded.</brief_summary>
