	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial with a safety run-in component studies the side effects and how well bevacizumab given with or without trebananib works in treating patients with brain tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Trebananib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab together with trebananib is more effective than bevacizumab alone in treating brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With or Without Trebananib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of AMG 386 (trebananib) 15 mg/kg weekly in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Cohort 1). (closed to accrual 10/2/12) II. To assess the efficacy of AMG 386 in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks compared to bevacizumab monotherapy in bevacizumab-naïve patients, as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) (Cohort 2). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To further assess the toxicity profile (Cohorts 1 and 2). II. To assess feasibility of AMG 386 15 mg/kg weekly in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Cohort 1 [closed to accrual 10/2/12]), as measured by the percentage of patients requiring dose reduction/interruption or discontinuation in the first 2 and subsequent cycles. III. To determine the radiographic response rate (RR), median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in bevacizumab-naïve patients (Cohort 2). IV. To assess the efficacy of AMG 386 15 mg/kg weekly in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in patients who have progressed while on bevacizumab, as measured by overall survival (OS) (cross-over from placebo arm of Cohort 2). V. To correlate outcome to treatment with tumor genotype, expression profile, and circulating angiogenesis biomarkers in tumor specimens (Cohort 2). VI. To determine the RR, PFS6, and PFS in patients who have progressed while on bevacizumab therapy and receive AMG 386 in combination with bevacizumab (cross-over from placebo arm of Cohort 2). VII. To determine the serum pharmacokinetics of AMG 386 in patients receiving bevacizumab (Cohort 1 and cross-over from placebo arm of Cohort 2). OUTLINE: This is a safety study (cohort 1 [closed to accrual 10/2/12]) followed by a randomized study (cohort 2). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants (gliosarcoma, glioblastoma with oligodendroglial features, giant cell glioblastoma); patients will be eligible if the original histology was a lower grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants is made The tumor must be supratentorial; patients with infratentorial disease, spinal cord disease, and/or leptomeningeal disease are excluded Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression on the previous treatment regimen (prior to enrollment on this study) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain with and without contrast within 14 days prior to registration; the dose of steroids must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan; patients with tumor progression who then undergo surgical resection prior to enrollment on study may be eligible as long as pathology confirms progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (or variants); for patients who undergo surgical resection, registration on study may not occur any sooner than 28 days from surgery; an MRI scan of the brain with and without contrast is still required within 14 days prior to registration on study but is not required to demonstrate measurable disease or tumor progression after surgery Patients unable to undergo MRI because of noncompatible devices can be enrolled, provided computed tomography (CT) scans are obtained and are of sufficient quality; patients without noncompatible devices may not have CT scans performed to meet this requirement History/physical examination within 14 days prior to registration Karnofsky performance scale &gt;= 70 Patients who have received prior treatment with interstitial brachytherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, or implanted chemotherapy sources, such as wafers of polifeprosan 20 with carmustine, must have confirmation of progressive disease within 14 days prior to registration based upon nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, perfusion imaging, or histopathology Leukocytes &gt;
