	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine the diagnostic performance of gadofosveset enhanced magnetic resonance imaging lymphography (MRL). The diagnostic performance of MRL will be determined on the basis of a node-to-node matching of imaged nodes to the definitive histopathology. The pathologic examination of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) will be regarded as the golden standard for nodal involvement.</brief_summary>
