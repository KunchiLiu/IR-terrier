	<brief_summary>- Laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection as minimally invasive surgery has gained popularity for the treatment of early gastric cancer in East Asian countries, even though the long-term follow-up outcome based on multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) is still awaited. - For the patient with locally advanced gastric cancer, several studies indicated that laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is a technically feasible and safe procedure by experienced surgeons in high-volume specialized hospitals. However, the application of it is controversial mainly due to lack of solid evidence on the oncologic efficacy. Therefore, conventional open approach is still the current standard for advanced gastric cancer. - Nowadays, the proportion of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is estimated up to 80 per cent of all gastric cancer cases in China. Before the clinical application of laparoscopic procedure for the treatment with curative intent to advanced gastric cancer located at the middle- or lower-third of the stomach, the oncologic efficacy must be verified. - Accordingly,the comparison of intraoperative and postoperative complications between laparoscopic and open distal subtotal gastrectomy for over 65 years old patients with gastric cancer based on a randomized controlled trial is needed.</brief_summary>
