	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine on preliminary basis weather an elevated pro-calcitonin level can be used to assess ischemia as a result of coronary artery complications during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pro-calcitonin Marker as Indicator of Ischemia in Patients With Complicated Coronary Intervention.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pro-calcitonin is a type of protein found in the blood. This protein has recently be found to be elevated in patients with diseases of the arteries of the heart such as heart attack. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is widely used in the treatment of many patients with blockage in the arteries of the heart. the investigators normally used a marker called troponin after cardiac catheterization. However, this marker may not be specific. Pro-calcitonin has been found to be a useful marker for the detection of myocardial injury. the value of Pro-calcitonin as a marker for the identification of myocardial damage undergoing PCI has not yet been studied.</detailed_description>
