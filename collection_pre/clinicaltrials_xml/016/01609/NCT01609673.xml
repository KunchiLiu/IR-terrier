	<brief_summary>In the present study, the investigators propose a conversion scheme with 50% reduction in CNI dosage until adjustment of everolimus dosage, in order to reach a trough blood level of 6-10 ng/mL, thus avoiding overimmunosuppression or alternatively breakthrough rejection episodes. The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate that the therapeutic regimen with Myfortic® and Certican® significantly improves renal function compared with the standard regimen of CNI.</brief_summary>
