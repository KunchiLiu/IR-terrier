	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label study will compare the efficacy and safety of MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) alone, and in combination with Roferon-A (interferon alfa-2a) in patients with follicular or other CD20+ low-grade lymphoma. Patients will be randomized to receive either MabThera/Rituxan 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 4 weeks or Roferon-A 3 MIU/day subcutaneously in Week 1 followed by 4.5 MIU/day sc in Weeks 2-5 plus MabThera/Rituxan 375 mg/m2 weekly iv in Weeks 3-6. Patients who have a response will receive an additional cycle of treatment. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 6 months.</brief_summary>
