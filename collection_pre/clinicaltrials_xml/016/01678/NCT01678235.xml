	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether insulin glulisine is more effective in postprandial glycemic control than insulin aspart after the H-GI meal in children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) treated with insulin pump (CSII).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Glulisine and Aspart in Postprandial Glycemic Control After High-GI Meal in Children With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some studies have suggested that insulin glulisine (GLU) has a slightly faster onset of action compared with insulin aspart (ASP). Meals of high glycemic index (H-GI) have distinct effect on postprandial glycaemia (PPG).</detailed_description>
