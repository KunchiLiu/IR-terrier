	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin/simvastatin fixed-dose combination (FDC) in participants with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control while on metformin monotherapy. The primary hypothesis of this study is that after 16 weeks of therapy, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) in participants treated with sitagliptin/simvastatin FDC is non-inferior compared to sitagliptin alone.</brief_summary>
