	<brief_summary>This community-partnered participatory study will work within high school health centers (SHCs) to test, via a 2-armed cluster randomized controlled trial, a multi-level intervention to reduce adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) among adolescents ages 14-19. The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the School Health Center Healthy Adolescent Relationships Program (SHARP) intervention in SHCs on individual SHC clients, the SHC clinic environment, and the schools in which the SHCs are located. Evaluation of the intervention will involve random assignment of eight comparable SHCs in the Greater Bay Area of California that provide comprehensive health services, to either intervention or control sites. Adolescent females and males ages 14-19 seeking care at any of these SHCs (N=1200) will be assessed via audio computer-assisted survey instrument (ACASI) at baseline and 16-20 weeks follow-up to examine intervention effects on knowledge and self-efficacy regarding ARA, harm reduction and ARA-related resources as well as intentions to intervene with peers. For youth reporting recent ARA victimization, the investigators will assess for increases in ARA disclosure, resource utilization, as well as reduction in ARA victimization.</brief_summary>
