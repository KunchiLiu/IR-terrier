	<brief_summary>Determine wether 24 months treatment with everolimus prolongs progression free survival rate (based on a central assessment) after embolisation ou chemoembolisation for liver metastases. - H0 a 24 months progression free survival rate less than 35% is unacceptable - H1 a 24 months progression free survival rate greater than 35% would show that everolimus treatment is beneficial, the expected 24 months progression free survival rate being 50%</brief_summary>
