	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer in epidemiological studies. However, it is still unknown whether H. pylori eradication is useful and required to prevent gastric cancer. Gastric cancer risk is increased in family members of gastric cancer patient. Though there is no direct evidence that H. pylori infection is a risk factor for gastric cancer in family members of gastric cancer, current European guideline recommends H. pylori eradication in first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether H. pylori eradication can reduce gastric cancer risk in the first-degree family members of gastric cancer patients.</brief_summary>
