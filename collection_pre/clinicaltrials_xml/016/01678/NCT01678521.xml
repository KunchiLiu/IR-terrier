	<brief_summary>Inflammation plays a major role in atherosclerosis. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) a multifunctional pattern-recognition protein, is expressed in many tissues/cells, including innate immunity cells, endothelium and atherosclerotic plaques. Its role is controversial: it may exert protective cardiovascular effects and/or it may be an indicator of plaque vulnerability and future cardiovascular risk. LDL-Apheresis removes apoB100-containing lipoproteins and it can prevent progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). LDL-Apheresis exerts non-lipidic beneficial effects on the procoagulatory state and on hemorheology. No data exist about the effects of LDL-Apheresis on plasma PTX3 levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of LDL-apheresis on PTX3 Plasma Levels in Hypercholesterolemic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemic patients with documented CAD, on chronic fortnightly LDL-apheresis treatment will be enrolled in this study. Blood samples will be collected before and after a single LDL-Apheresis treatment to asses PTX3, HsCRP, IL6, IL10, Fibrinogen and lipid plasma levels.</detailed_description>
