	<brief_summary>Different kinetics markers have been proposed to select embryos with higher implantation rates. The effect of external factors on these markers, such as the stimulation protocol should be analyzed. There are two different types of FSH that are commonly used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in egg donation cycles, recombinant FSH and human FSH. The effect of each kind of hormone on embryo kinetcis is still unknown. The aim of this study is to observe if there is a difference in embryo kinetics and morphology as well as oocyte morphological parameters between the two types of FSH and therefore to analyze if such markers can be used despite of the stimulation protocols chosen.</brief_summary>
