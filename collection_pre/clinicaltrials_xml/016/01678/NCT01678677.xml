Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last dose of vaccine, with the exception of any influenza vaccine which may be administered â‰¥ 15 days preceding or following any study vaccine dose. Previous vaccination with any vaccine containing NTHiantigens. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Topical steroids are allowed. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of or current autoimmune disease.
