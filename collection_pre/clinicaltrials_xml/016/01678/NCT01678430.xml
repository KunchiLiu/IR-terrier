	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare ofatumumab &amp; chlorambucil (O-Chl) versus ofatumumab &amp; bendamustine (O-B) in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia who are considered not fit enough for rituximab, fludarabine &amp; cyclophosphamide (R-FC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Looking at Ofatumumab for People With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Who Cannot Have More Intensive Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chlorambucil (Chl) has been the mainstay of CLL treatment for half a century. However, frontline treatment has improved considerably over the last decade, first by the advent of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC), and more recently by the addition of the anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, to FC. Although FC-based regimens are considerably more effective than Chl, they are also associated with greater toxicity which makes them inappropriate for less fit patients. This is an important consideration, given that CLL predominantly affects older people who tend to have more co-morbidity. Although a single-arm phase II study (Roche MO20927; NCRI CLL208) has shown that R-Chl is safe and effective, there are no phase III data proving the benefit of adding an anti-CD20 antibody to Chl. This question is currently being addressed by a phase III RCT of Chl with or without ofatumumab (GSK OMB110911 / COMPLEMENT-1 / NCRI CLL7). Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 antibody that binds to an epitope distinct from that of rituximab and produces more complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The RIAltO trial is a direct follow-on to the NCRI CLL7 phase III RCT trial in less fit patients and therefore the Ofatumumab dose has been selected to mirror the regimen used in that trial.</detailed_description>

Progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia. 2. Massive (i.e. 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly. 3. Massive (i.e. 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy. 4. Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2month period or lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of less than 6 months. 2. No prior cytotoxic or targeted therapy for CLL 3.

Respiratory impairment (bronchiectasis or moderate COPD) 5. Renal impairment (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) 1030 ml/min) 6. Any other significant comorbidity or factor that makes RFC inappropriate 4. Considered able to tolerate Chl at the dose used in the LRF CLL4 trial (10mg/m2 d17) 5. Written informed consent 1. Neutrophil count less than 1.0 x 109/l or platelet count less than 50 x 109/l unless due to CLL 2. Uncontrolled autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia 3. Active infection 4. Seropositivity for HIV, HCV or HBV (surface antigen or and core antibody) 5. Severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 10ml/min) 6. Severe hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin more than twice the upper limit of normal) unless due to CLL or Gilbert's syndrome. 7. Concurrent treatment with glucocorticoids equivalent to more than prednisolone 20mg od 8. Prior treatment with monoclonal antibody therapy within the last 3 months. 9. Yellow fever vaccination within 4 weeks prior to treatment start 10. Known hypersensitivity to ofatumumab, bendamustine or chlorambucil or any of their excipients 11. CNS involvement with CLL 12. History of Richter transformation 13. Concomitant malignancies within the last 3 years except successfully treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ. 14. Major surgery within 28 days prior to randomisation 15. WHO performance status 4 16. Severe cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction within six months prior to randomization, congestive heart failure (NYHA IIIIV), and arrhythmia (excluding extra systoles or minor conduction abnormalities) unless controlled by therapy. 17. Any serious underlying medical or psychological conditions, which could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial or compromise ability to give informed consent 18. Treatment within a clinical trial within 30 days prior to trial entry. 19. Adult patient under tutelage (not competent to sign informed consent). 20. Pregnant or lactating women. 21. Women of childbearing potential, including women whose last menstrual period was less than one year prior to screening, unable or unwilling to use adequate contraception from study start to one year after the last dose of protocol therapy. Adequate contraception is defined as hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, double barrier method or total abstinence. 22. Male subjects unable or unwilling to use adequate contraception methods from study start to one year after the last dose of protocol therapy.</criteria>
