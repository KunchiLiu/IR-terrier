	<brief_summary>Vocal process granulomas are inflammatory masses caused in part by vocal trauma that arise in the posterior aspect of the vocal folds and result in throat pain, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and globus sensation. Antireflux therapy treats most granulomas, but many are recalcitrant to this therapy or take months to years to resolve. Botulinum toxin injection into the thyroarytenoid muscle has been effectively employed for recalcitrant granuloma, but causes significant voice loss, occasional difficulty swallowing and, in our clinical experience, is associated with significant recurrence. The investigators propose injecting another muscle in the larynx called the interarytenoid muscle with botulinum toxin type A to maintain the benefit of injection with less loss of voice. The investigators have shown the effectiveness of this treatment in a small, retrospective analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Botulinum Toxin (BOTOX) Injections to Treat Vocal Fold Granulomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vocal fold granulomas may be due to reflux, voice trauma, intubation, multiple or unknown etiologies. Regimens of voice therapy and anti-reflux medications have show resolution rates varying from 38% to 100%, with recurrence rates of 15-20%, and up to 50-92% in surgical-operated on recalcitrant granulomas. Nasri and colleagues first proposed thyroarytenoid botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX) injections for vocal fold granulomas with success. They posited that the chemically paralyzed muscle would result in limited contact at the site of the granuloma, allowing for healing. Damrose and Damrose further showed that thyroarytenoid BOTOX injections were effective in treating recalcitrant vocal fold granulomas. Both of the above groups noted hoarseness as an expected side effect. Pham and colleagues showed complete resolution of granulomas in 2-8 weeks after treatment with thyroarytenoid BOTOX injections. This was compared to mean granuloma resolution of 5.7 months proton pump inhibitor therapy alone. The investigators reviewed eight patients treated for recalcitrant vocal fold granuloma at Mass Eye and Ear with interarytenoid BOTOX injections and found no serious adverse effects and complete response in seven cases. The investigators now seek to compare interarytenoid BOTOX injections to standard anti-reflux therapy alone to see if the addition of IA Botox injections improves response rates at 3 months. The investigators chose this timeframe since 86% of granulomas treated in our retrospective study had resolved 3 months after initiation of treatment compared to 25% of granulomas treated with medical management. The investigators will not include a Thyroarytenoid injection arm in this study as this technique has not been useful in our clinical experience. For those who consent, a Voice Handicap Index survey (6 - see attached) will be completed. Participants will then be randomized to undergo only medical therapy with omeprazole (40mg by mouth twice daily ) or an interarytenoid BOTOX injection followed by the same reflux regimen. Randomization will be performed by the Tufts online randomization plan, which may be found at: http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/PLANDOC.HTM. This program generates a random order in which participants will be enrolled in either of the two arms of the study. The injection will consist of 10 units of botulinum toxin injected into the interarytenoid muscle under fiberoptic visualization. All participants will remain on the PPI therapy for the duration of the study. Participants will receive prescriptions for PPI medication from the attending Laryngologist and participants will then be responsible for acquiring and taking their medications. Injections will be performed per standard MEEI Laryngology protocol for interarytenoid BOTOX injection. Participants will then be evaluated at 1.5 months, 3 months and 6 months with fiberoptic examination as well as Voice Handicap Index &amp; Reflux Symptom Index. Participants in the medication only arm who continue to have a granuloma at 3 months will receive a BOTOX injection. They will be re-evaluated 3 months after the injection. Examinations will be recorded and reviewed by blinded reviewers.</detailed_description>
