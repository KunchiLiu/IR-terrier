	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among Veterans is a condition that imparts a great burden to the patient in terms of serious co-morbidities and results in a great cost to the VA Health Care System to treat the co-morbidities, which include heart disease, stroke and neuropsychiatric disorders. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is used to treat sleep apnea and studies have shown a poor adherence to treatment. The investigators hypothesize that using wireless technology will lead to early detection of problems of treatment use and will translate into early remedial action which will improve the use and effectiveness of treatment. The investigators will compare two methods. Usual care involves downloading data from PAP machines at designated 3-month intervals, requiring a face-to-face clinician visit. Wireless care involved more frequent monitoring and intervention in the event of anomalies in treatment use or effectiveness.</brief_summary>
