	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the technical feasibility of using fine needle aspiration (FNA) of liver tissue to obtain vaniprevir (MK-7009) liver pharmacokinetic (PK) data, working towards identifying a minimally invasive, reproducible platform to measure liver PK. The study will be done in 2 parts. In Part 1, participants will be randomized to one of five FNA/core needle biopsy (CNB) time-point collection sequences. In Part 2, participants will be randomized to one of two possible doses of vaniprevir and will be assigned to one of five FNA/CNB time-point collection sequences; participants in Part 2 will also receive background therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (Peg-IFN alpha-2b) and ribavirin (RBV). The primary hypothesis is that there is a greater than 80% posterior probability that vaniprevir concentrations are successfully obtained at least 60% of the time from FNA liver samples collected at 2 of 3 specified timepoints.</brief_summary>
