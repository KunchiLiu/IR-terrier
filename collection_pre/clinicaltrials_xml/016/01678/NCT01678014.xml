Deep brain stimulation and capsulotomy are the most used methods which has been proved effective in obsessive and compulsive disorders, depression and other psychiatric disorders. Many case reports indicate that deep brain stimulation or capsulotomy may be effective in the treatment of AN. As there are some common pathways between AN and other psychiatric disorder.
