	<brief_summary>This study compares the effectiveness of cervical preparation before second trimester abortion using laminaria versus vaginal Misoprostol. The investigators hypothesize that medical preparation of the cervix with vaginal Misoprostol is superior to mechanical preparation using laminaria. The investigators believe that medical preparation makes the procedure easier to perform, equally safe, without addition of pain or discomfort.</brief_summary>
