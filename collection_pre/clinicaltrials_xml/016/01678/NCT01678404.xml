	<brief_summary>Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL) is a lymphoma originated from B-cell in lymph node with variable differentiation status, which is distributed to a variety of organs. A high response rate and long term survival is possible through surgery or radiation therapy alone in the case of limited disease. However frequent relapse and progression is observed despite of long term survival. The treatment after relapse has not been established yet. So we investigate the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using 131I-rituximab in refractory or relapsed patients with MZL.</brief_summary>
