	<brief_title>Use of Strattice Mesh in Paraesophageal Hernia Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prosthetic reinforcements reduce recurrence rates; the choice of optimal prosthetic, either synthetic or biosynthetic, for crural reinforcement is controversial. The objective of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of porcine acellular dermal matrix mesh (Strattice; LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) in crural reinforcement of laparoscopic large paraesophageal hernia repair. Strattice is a commonly used mesh in hernia repair. 35 adult (&gt;19 years of age) patients will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients who meet the criteria will be enrolled in the study. Information related to recurrence rates based on follow-up visits will be analyzed to determine the efficacy of Strattice in the prevention of large hernia recurrence.</detailed_description>
