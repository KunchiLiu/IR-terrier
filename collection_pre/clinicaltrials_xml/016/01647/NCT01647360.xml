	<brief_summary>Dydrogesterone is a retroprogesterone with a molecular structure similar to natural progesterone. As a C-21 steroid, it has a high affinity for progesterone receptors, a low antigonadotropic activity and antiestrogenic activity, but almost no estrogenic or androgenic activity. Dydrogesterone (DuphastonÂ©) is indicated for dysfunctional bleeding. In this study, women suffering from menorrhagia and who are treated with dydrogesterone will be observed for impact on QoL with the reduction in severity of bleeding.</brief_summary>
