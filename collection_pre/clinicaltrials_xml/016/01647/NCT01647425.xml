	<brief_title>Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption in Patients With Head and Neck or Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuing the chronic intoxication by either tobacco or alcohol after the initial diagnosis of a first lung or head and neck cancer significantly improves the risk of experiencing a second cancer, and largely affects the long term survival. Addiction intervention programs should be personalized according to the patient's profile, with the aim to develop more sustained intervention and monitoring in patients identified at higher risk of not spontaneously stopping harmful substance use. As of today, the trajectories of smoking and drinking habits and the risk factors for persisting smoking or drinking habits have been insufficiently explored among patients with a first lung or head and neck cancer. The ALTAK study aims to depict the rate of tobacco smokers 12 months after the initial diagnosis of a first lung or head and neck cancer. The secondary objectives of the study are: - to depict the rate of alcohol users 12 months after the initial diagnosis of a H&amp;N cancer - to depict the rate of tobacco smokers at cancer diagnosis - to depict the rate of alcohol users at cancer diagnosis - to determine the social, motivational, psychiatric, tobacco-related, alcohol-related, and cannabis-related features associated with stopping tobacco in the year following the diagnosis of a first TARC. - to determine the social, psychiatric, tobacco-related, alcohol-related, and cannabis-related features associated with stopping alcohol drinking in the year following the diagnosis of a first H&amp;N cancer</detailed_description>
