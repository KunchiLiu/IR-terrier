	<brief_summary>The study investigates the effect of supra- and subgingival rinsing of 10% PVP prior to ultrasonic debridement in patients with periodontitis (as compared to rinsing with water) in terms of post treatment bacteraemia. Study design: Randomized split-mouth (cross-over) study on 20 generally healthy subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Process: Test treatment: - 1 min mouthwash with 10% PVP-iodine - 1 min subgingival rinsing with 10% PVP-iodine - 1 min ultrasonic debridement with 10% PVP-iodine as cooling liquid - blood sampling from the V.mediana cupidi Control: - 1 min mouthwash with water - 1 min subgingival rinsing with water - 1 min ultrasonic debridement with water as cooling liquid - blood sampling from the V.mediana cupidi lysis, culturing and analysis of bacteria in the samples</detailed_description>
