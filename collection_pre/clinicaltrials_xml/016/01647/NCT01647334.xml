	<brief_summary>This study aims to use a type of radiation (adaptive radiotherapy) to deliver curative-intent treatment to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors would otherwise be too large for standard curative treatment. The study will use adaptive radiotherapy to achieve these goals. Adaptive radiotherapy is a process whereby treatment plans are modified during the course of treatment due to patient and tumor variations (ie. weight loss or tumor shrinkage). This may allow for dose escalation, while limiting the side effects.</brief_summary>

In such cases, the patient may be enrolled onto this study at the discretion of the local principle investigator once the metastasis has been treated. inability to attend full course of radiotherapy of followup visits Pregnant or lactating women</criteria>
