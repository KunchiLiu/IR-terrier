	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) performed with EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for the treatment of chronic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) patients with refractory symptoms on Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of TIF performed with EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for the treatment of chronic GERD patients with medically refractory GERD symptoms other than heartburn. Primary hypothesis: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly improving daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at 6-month follow-up. Secondary hypotheses: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly improving daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at 12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will have normalized or 50% improved esophageal acid exposure compared to baseline at 6-month follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will be completely off PPIs at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up compared to baseline. The majority of crossover patients will be completely off PPIs at 6-, 18-, 30-, 42- and 54-month follow-up compared to baseline. A statistically greater proportion of crossover patients treated with TIF will be free of daily bothersome symptom(s) or will experience clinically significant improvement at 6-, 18-, 30-, 42- and 54-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
