	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how differences in the nutritional status and concentration of hormones and cytokines associated with cachexia in HIV+ and HIV- pregnant women living in a semi-rural and rural region of northern Tanzania affect fetal growth, pregnancy outcomes and early infant health and development. The study hypothesis is that HIV+ women will have worse nutritional status and a greater degree of cachexia which will negatively impact fetal growth, pregnancy outcomes and early infancy health and development.</brief_summary>
