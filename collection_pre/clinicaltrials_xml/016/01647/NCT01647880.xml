	<brief_summary>In the MOVING study should be examined, whether early therapeutic intervention with fingolimod (Gilenya ®) after optic neuritis(ON) has a favorable visual outcome as a comparative therapie with Interferon beta-1b (Extavia®), as measured by multifocal visual evoked potentials (mVEP) after 6 month compared to baseline.</brief_summary>
