	<brief_summary>At our VA hospital, in general, it is the policy of our GI lab to not stop our patients anti-platelet therapy whenever they see us for a routine colonoscopy. We do this because we believe the risk of stopping these sort of medications outweigh the risks of a complication from a colonoscopy. Therefore, we are enrolling patients who are either on clopidogrel or prasugrel or not on any anti-platelet/anti-coagulant therapy that come to our GI lab routine colonoscopies. We perform the procedure just like we normally would and then follow-up with the patient 7 and 30 days after their procedure.</brief_summary>
