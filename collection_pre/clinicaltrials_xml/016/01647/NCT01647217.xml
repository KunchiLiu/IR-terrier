	<brief_summary>This is a randomized clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of terpinen-4-ol (T4O), the most active ingredient of tea tree oil (TTO), in eradicating ocular demodicosis (reducing ocular demodex counts and achieving the clinical improvement with minimal or no irritation).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Demodex Blepharitis Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Demodex blepharitis is one of the most common causes of chronic blepharitis. The investigators preliminary clinical study showed that lid scrub with TTO was effective in resolving chronic blepharoconjunctivitis; however, it was not convenient for self-administration and caused irritation in some patients. Preclinical safety studies have verified that T4O is less irritant. In this study, the investigators will determine the optimal regimen of T4O Pads.</detailed_description>
