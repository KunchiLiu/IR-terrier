	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is the demonstration of an increase of over 50% of the surface visible on ultrasound (mm2) of the axillary vein and subclavian vein in arm abduction (90 °) and external rotation (90 °) with respect to the surface of the subclavian vein along the arm body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Comparison of the Surface of the Subclavian and the Axillary Vein Versus the Surface of the Subclavian Vein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the anatomical relationships of these veins with the subclavian artery, the brachial plexus and the pleura, and assess the depth of the vein to the skin. Specifically, the following will be assessed: - the depth of the vein (mm) - the length of the minor axis (mm) - the length of the major axis (mm) - artery-vein distance (mm) - vein-pleural distance (mm) - the distance of the brachial plexus (mm)</detailed_description>
