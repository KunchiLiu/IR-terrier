	<criteria>Male and female subjects age 18 to 70 years of age inclusive. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using two acceptable methods of contraception, (e.g., intrauterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom, diaphragm plus condom, etc.), from the time of screening and for the duration of the study, through study completion. Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 17 to 35 kg/m2. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Understand and sign the written informed consent For renal insufficient subjects only Subjects must have stable renal disease without evidence of renal progressive disease (for the purpose of this study stable renal disease will be defined as no significant change for 12 weeks). For health subjects only A serum creatinine within the normal range and an eGFR &gt;80 mL/min/1.73 m2. For health subjects only Matched to at least one renal impaired subjects undergoing study by age (±5 years), sex and weight (±10% BMI). Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Smokers will be defined as any subject who reports tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL. If nonsmoking subject are too difficult to recruit, smokers may be allowed to participate in the study provided they commit to smoke no more than 10 cigarettes/day during the days of PKassessment For healthy subjects, use of any prescription drugs, herbal and fitness/bodybuilding/athletic performanceenhancing supplements, within four (4) weeks prior to initial dosing, and/or overthecounter (OTC) medication, dietary supplements (vitamins included) within two (2) weeks prior to initial dosing Recent (within the last three [3] years) and/or recurrent history of autonomic dysfunction (e.g., recurrent episodes of fainting (unless related to water withdrawal during dialysis), palpitations, etc). Recent (within the last three [3] years) and/or recurrent history of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treated or not treated). History of multiple and recurring allergies or allergy to the investigational compound/compound class being used in this study. Total WBC count which falls outside the range of 300012,000/μL, or platelets &lt;100,000/μl at screening. History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test result. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
