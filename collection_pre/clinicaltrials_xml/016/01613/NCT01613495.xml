	<detailed_description>After baseline tests, a nurse will administer monthly injections of Sandostatin LAR® or placebo for 6 months. At the end of this initial 6-month treatment period and a 4-month washout period, study subjects will then crossover to receive the alternative therapy (placebo or octreotide) for an additional 6 months. Subjects will be followed for 16 months total at scheduled visits: 0, 2, 6, 10, 12, and 16 months (Table 2).</detailed_description>
