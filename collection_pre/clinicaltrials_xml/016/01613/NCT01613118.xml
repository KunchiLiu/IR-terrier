	<brief_title>Randomized, Double-Blind, Safety and Efficacy Study of RE-021 (Sparsentan) in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a rare glomerular disorder which results in frank proteinuria and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) over 5-10 years. Proteinuria reduction is widely regarded to be beneficial, and is considered the primary goal of treatment in FSGS and slowing its progressive course (D'Agati, et. al, 2011). Patients are currently treated with steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACE) to lower proteinuria (Cameron, 2003). Despite these therapies, many patients have nephrotic range proteinuria and new therapeutic agents are needed (Kiffel, et. al, 2011). Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) have been shown to lower proteinuria in clinical trials of diabetic nephropathy (Kohan, et. al, 2011) (Mann, et. al 2010) and have been speculated to be effective in FSGS (Barton, 2010).</detailed_description>

If a patient is taking immunosuppressive medications (except for Rituximab or cyclophosphamide), the dose and/or levels must be stable for 1 month prior to randomization and the Investigator should not have plans to alter the regimen during the first 8 weeks of treatment, except to stabilize levels. Patients on Rituximab or cyclophosphamide will be eligible provided they have not been taking these medications for 3 months prior to randomization. 6. US Sites: Males or females 8 to 75 years of age willing and able to provide written informed consent and/or assent, with informed consent signed by patient or parent/legal guardian. 7. EU Sites: Males or females 18 to 75 years of age willing and able to provide written informed consent, with informed consent, signed by patient or legal guardian. Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients with FSGS secondary to another condition. 2. Patients with history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HBA1c&gt;8%), or nonfasting blood glucose &gt;180 mg/dL at screening. 3. Patients who have had any organ transplant. 4. Patients with a requirement for any of the medications indicated on the list of Excluded Medications, with the exception of ACE and ARBs. 5. Patients with a documented history of heart failure (NYHA Class IIIV), and / or previous hospitalization for heart failure or unexplained dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ascites and peripheral edema. Patients with clinically significant cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attack or stroke) and/or coronary artery disease (hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina, new onset of angina with positive functional tests or coronary angiogram revealing stenosis, coronary revascularization procedure) within 6 months before screening. 6. Patients with clinically significant cardiac conduction defects, including second or third degree atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, an accessory bypass tract, or any arrhythmia requiring medication. 7. Patients with jaundice, hepatitis, or known hepatobiliary disease (includes asymptomatic cholelithiasis); alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal at Screening. 8. Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and markers indicating acute (positivity of at least one of the following: Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], Hepatitis B "e" antigen [HBeAg], Hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA in blood or liver, Immunoglobulin M Hepatitis B core antibody) or chronic (HBsAg and/or HBeAg and/or Hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA positivity) HBV infection, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (reactive antiHCV antibody and/or HCV RNA). Testing at screening is only required for patients &gt;/= 18 years of age. 9. History of malignancy other than adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer within the past 5 years. 10. Patients with hemodynamically significant valvular disease. 11. Hematocrit (HCT) &lt;27 or hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9. 12. Potassium &gt;5.5 mEq/L. 13. Patients &gt;18 years of age with Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) ≥60 ml mL/min who have Nterminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) ≥200 pg/mL (57.8 pmol/L). For patients &gt;18 years of age with eGFR &lt;60 mL/min, the following parameters requiring echocardiography (ECHO) at screening should be used for exclusion: 1. NTproBNP ≥300 pg/mL in patients &gt;18 years of age with eGFR 45 59.9 mL/min 2. NTproBNP = 200299 pg/mL in patients &gt;18 years of age with eGFR 45 59.9 mL/min, and abnormal ejection fraction (EF &lt;55) and/or diastolic dysfunction on ECHO 3. NTproBNP ≥400 pg/mL in patients &gt;18 years of age with eGFR 30.0 44.9 mL/min 4.

WOCBP, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, includes any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral ovariectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt;12 consecutive months and for women on hormone replacement therapy, only with documented plasma follicle stimulating hormone level greater than 35 mIU/mL). Women using oral, implanted or injected contraceptive hormones, an intrauterine device, barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicidal) to prevent pregnancy, practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy) As well as postmenopausal women who have fertilized eggs implanted are also considered WOCBP. 20. Male patients and female spouse/partners who are of childbearing potential must use two reliable methods of contraception, with at least one being highly reliable (e.g. including oral, implanted or injected contraceptive hormones or an intrauterine device) and one being a barrier method, e.g. condom, to avoid pregnancy, for the entire study period and for 90 days post study participation. 21.
