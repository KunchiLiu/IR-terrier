	<brief_summary>Ketamine infusions resulted in an acute reduction in global depression scores and in severity of suicidal ideation. Scopolamine infusions produced also a significant improvement in depression that was sustained over time. We therefore plan to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of open-label repeated intravenous administration of ketamine and scopolamine combined in this population of severely depressed, treatment-resistant patients. The results from this study could lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of patients with TRD.</brief_summary>
