	<brief_summary>This study will assess the complete clinical response (no clinical evidence of remaining disease or recurrence of disease)in rectal cancer that arises within 3 inches of the anal opening after radiation therapy given at the same time as chemotherapy over a 6 week period, followed by chemotherapy alone given three times over an additional 9 weeks. Follow-up begins with an examination at the end of treatment (at 15 weeks), with ongoing follow-up every 4-6 weeks for one year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintenance Chemotherapy After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy for Distal Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown that low rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (54Gy concurrent with 3 cycles of 5-FU/Leucovorin) followed by 3 additional cycles of 5FU/Leucovorin, followed by close follow-up (every 4-6 weeks for one year)has had good success in achieving complete clinical response, avoiding surgical intervention. If at follow-up remaining disease is found or if there is recurrent disease, surgery can be performed.</detailed_description>
