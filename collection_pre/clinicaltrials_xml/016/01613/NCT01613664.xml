	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy has emerged over the last 20 years as a treatment of choice in the surgical management of patients with morbid obesity. However, this restrictive procedure is accompanied by outcomes such as gastric fistula (5%), postoperative hemorrhage (1%) and intra-abdominal loco regional collections (1%). At present, there is no sufficiently reliable technique to prevent these complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency of TISSEEL for Sleeve Gastrectomy Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is the following : the use of fibrin glue (Tissucol ®) during Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy would reduce the incidence of complications (gastric fistula, intra-abdominal hemorrhage and intra-abdominal locoregional collection). The aim is to investigate whether the use of fibrin glue (Tissucol®) during Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy reduces the incidence of postoperative complications (gastric fistula, intra-abdominal hemorrhage and intra-abdominal locoregional collection)</detailed_description>
