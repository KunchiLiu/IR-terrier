	<brief_title>Causes of Visual Loss in Retinal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of visual outcomes in retinal disease. It is an observational study of patients who have been seen in the retinal clinic, and involves a retrospective casenotes analysis to identify patients who have suffered visual loss and the reason for that visual loss. These data will be analysed to enable the identification of factors that predict visual loss in patients who present earlier in the course of their disease.</detailed_description>
