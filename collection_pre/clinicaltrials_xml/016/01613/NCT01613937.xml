	<brief_summary>Objective: The current study examined the effectiveness of a culturally-appropriate adaptation of the diabetes prevention program (DPP) curriculum in reducing type 2 diabetes risk in Latinas with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Research Design and Methods: Seventy-six Latinas aged 18-45 years with GDM in the past 3 years participated in an 8-week group-based, peer-educator led lifestyle intervention based on the DPP, with adaptations appropriate to Latino culture and recent mothers. Clinical and self-report indicators were assessed at baseline, post-intervention (month-3), and follow-up (month-6). Hypothesis-The modified culturally tailored DPP will improve risk factors associated with the development of type 2 DM.</brief_summary>
