	<brief_summary>This clinical investigation is a medical device trial to examine the safety and efficacy of TheraSorb® Ig flex adsorber treatment (as an add-on to conventional treatment) used exclusively with the LIFE 18® apheresis system for extracorporeal application for IA therapy (5 treatments) performed over 5 to 8 consecutive days in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and WHO functional classification III.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Able to understand and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form age &gt; 18 and &lt; 80 years at time of informed consent Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension diagnosed by right heart catheter WHO functional classification III Application of conventional IPAH therapy, which has been stable for the prior 8 weeks Able to perform a 6minutewalk test (MWT) Negative pregnancy test (βHCG) at the start of the trial and appropriate contraception throughout the trial for women with childbearing potential. Pregnancy and/or lactation PAH of any cause other than permitted in the inclusion criteria, e.g. concomitantly to portal hypertension, complex congenital heart disease, reversed shunt, HIV infection, suspected pulmonary venoocclusive disease Contraindication for right heart catheterization Any change in diseasetargeted therapy within 8 weeks prior to inclusion Walking impairment due to causes other than IPAH that would preclude performance of a 6MWT Any patient who has received any investigational medication within 8 weeks prior to the start of this trial or who is scheduled to receive another investigational drug during the course of the trial between visits V1 and V9 Known intolerance to immunoadsorption in general or to one of the excipients (e.g. sheep antibodies or agarose) or other supporting agents Hemoglobin concentration of &lt; 75% below the lower limit of normal Systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg Lack of compliance or other similar reason that, in the judgment of the Investigator, precludes satisfactory participation in the trial Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e. uncontrolled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the study, unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled generalized viral, bacterial and/ or mycotic infection) which by assessment of the treating Investigator could compromise patients safety or participation in the study Drug or alcohol abuse within the last 5 years Hypercoagulability Known severe immunodeficiency (e.g. AIDS) Severe lung disease: FEV1/FVC &lt; 50%, total capacity &lt; 60% of normal value Indications that prohibit transient anticoagulation using Heparin and/or ACDAsolutions</criteria>
