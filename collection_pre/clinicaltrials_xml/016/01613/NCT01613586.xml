	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Comparing Placebo and ASP3652 in the Treatment of Women With Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial Cystitis (BPS/IC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of a screening phase, an initial 3 weeks Run-in period, a 12 weeks Treatment period and a 2 weeks Follow-up (FU) period. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a 12 week treatment with ASP3652 in female patients with Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial Cystitis (BPS/IC). Different dose levels of ASP3652 will be compared with placebo. ASP3652 is administered as oral tablets. The objectives of the study are to investigate efficacy of ASP3652 in patients with BPS/IC, to assess the optimal dose of ASP3652, to investigate safety and tolerability and to investigate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASP3652 in patients with BPS/IC in an out-patient setting.</detailed_description>
