	<detailed_description>Hip navigation based on preoperative EOS(TM) imaging could help to improve the accuracy of cup positioning like other computer assisted hip surgery, but it would also simplify the procedure in lateral decubitus. Indeed, the registration of the controlateral antero superior iliac spine and the pubis is not necessary with this technique. The target population of the study is the one affected with primitive hip osteoarthritis for which an indication of prosthesis of total hip has been chosen Expected Result: Simplification of the procedure of navigation of the cup. Decrease in the number of cups positioned out of the "security zone" compared to the standard manual technique of cup positioning. A result of 50% of good positioning is expected with the manual technique versus 80% with the technique of navigation based on EOS(TM). MAIN OBJECTIVE: Compare the surgical treatment of total hip prosthesis without assistance by computer and total hip prosthesis with navigation based on imaging EOSTM pre-operative Comparative clinical trial of superiority, randomized in single blind, in 2 parallel groups: -Group 1: Installation of hip prosthesis without assistance by computer -Group 2: Installation of hip prosthesis with assistance by computer based on imaging EOS(TM)</detailed_description>
