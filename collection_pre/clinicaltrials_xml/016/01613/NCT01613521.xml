	<criteria>Biopsydocumented, newlydiagnosed primary cervical cancer of all histopathology types. Clinically visible gross lesion (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB1 and above). Treatment (chemoradiation), DCEMRI and 18FFMISO PET studies will be at MSKCC. Patients must be an adult female 18 years of age or older. Patients who because of general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic status cannot give an informed consent. Patients who received prior radiation treatment to pelvis. Patients with contraindications to DCEMRI (noncompatible cardiac pacemakers or intracranial vascular clips, allergy to Gadolinium, endstage renal disease) and/or 18FFMISO PET. Patients who do not fulfill the screening criteria for safe DCEMRI or 18FFMISO PET as per the Department of Radiology guidelines. Pregnant patients; and or patients who are breastfeeding their babies.</criteria>
