	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies have shown a 2-3 fold increased long-term risk of arterial cardiovascular disease after venous thrombosis, most predominant in the first year following initial venous thrombosis. The results of recent observational studies that showed 40-50% risk reductions for first venous thrombosis occurrence when using a statin are in this aspect promising. The results are also somewhat surprising, because the mechanism behind this effect is unclear. Dyslipidemia may be the most plausible explanation to be considered. However, as dyslipidemia is not related to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, it is unlikely that statins decrease venous thrombosis risk by lipid lowering activities. Recent observations indicate that coagulation can activate the initial formation of atherosclerosis. Our hypothesis is therefore that the coagulation profile in persons with venous thrombosis is improved when using a statin, ultimately leading to less atherosclerosis: another well known property of statin use.</brief_summary>
