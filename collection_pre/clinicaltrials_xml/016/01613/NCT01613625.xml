	<brief_summary>Elastography is a emerging imaging technique that has demonstrated high reliability in the assessment of tissues stiffness and quantification of fibrosis particularly in adult's livers. This ultrasound exploration has no secondary effects. There is no study published in the pediatric population concerning the role of ultrasound elastrography in kidney. The aim of this study is to look for a correlation between the elastography's results and the kidney fibrosis on children who have to undergo a renal biopsy. Elastography may play a potential diagnostic and/or prognostic role in the management of these patients which would limit invasive biopsy procedures.</brief_summary>
