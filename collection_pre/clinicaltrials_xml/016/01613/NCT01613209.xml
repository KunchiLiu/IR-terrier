	<brief_summary>The investigators want to find out whether a recently introduced combination of two blood pressure lowering agents (olmesartan and amlodipine) has a different blood pressure lowering effect than a single active substance. In addition the investigators want to find out whether there is a difference in the changes in blood pressure over the course of a day depending on the time when the medications are taken (in the morning or at night). Male and female patients over 18 years of age may participate.</brief_summary>
