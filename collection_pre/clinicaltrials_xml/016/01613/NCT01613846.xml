	<brief_summary>Sorafenib and pazopanib are both effective and promising treatments for advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). Both drugs are registered for this indication. No prospective comparative data in advanced RCC (or other indications) have been published. A search in the clinicaltrials.gov database did not reveal any planned or ongoing studies. As sequential therapy is now the standard of treatment for advanced RCC it is important to evaluate in clinical trials what the value of different sequential strategies is. This needs to be done every time new agents are introduced into the treatment armamentarium. As there are no data yet on the sequential use of sorafenib followed by pazopanib or vice versa, this sequence, however, will most certainly be used in daily practice, it is required to examine efficacy and safety of this sequential approach in a clinical trial in a randomized setting. Therefore, the investigators have designed an open randomized study in patients not previously treated for advanced RCC. Suitable patients will be randomized (1:1) in 2 groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with metastatic / advanced RCC (all histologies), who are not suitable for cytokine therapy and for whom study medication constitutes firstline treatment. For cytokine unsuitability at least one of the following criteria must be fulfilled*: Age 66 to 88 years Nonclear cell histology RCC Intermediate risk according to MSKCC score ECOG ≥ 1 and&gt; 1 organ metastasis + &lt; 24 months between diagnosis and establishing indication for interleukin2therapy ECOG ≥ 1 and "unable to carry on normal activity or do active work" (Karnofsky Index 70%) Creatinine ≥ 1x ULN and &lt; 2x ULN Total bilirubin ≥ 1x ULN and &lt; 1.5x ULN Present autoimmune disease Patients who might require steroids Hypersensitivity against cytokines Severe organic disease, not interfering with other in/exclusion criteria of the Switch2 study Nonsymptomatic brain metastases Severe lung disease (e.g. PAH, COPD) with Pa O2 &lt; 60 mmHg on rest 2. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 85 years 3. Karnofsky Index ≥ 70% (see appendix 15.1) 4. MSKCC prognostic score (2004), low or intermediate (see appendix 15.2) 5. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks 6. Subjects with at least one unidimensional (for RECIST 1.1) measurable lesion. Lesions must be measured by CT/MRI scan 7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to start of therapy: hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dl absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,500 µl Platelet count ≥ 100,000 / µl total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x the upper limit of normal (Note: Subjects with Gilbert' Syndrome are eligible if their total bilirubin is &lt; 3.0 X ULN and direct bilirubin ≤ 35 %).

Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg systolic and/or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic on medication). 3. History of HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C 4. 4. Active clinically serious infections (&gt; grade 2 NCICTC version 4.03) 5.
