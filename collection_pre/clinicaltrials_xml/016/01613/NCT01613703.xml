	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the brain TSPO occupancy of ONO-2952 in healthy adult subjects after a single dose using [11C]PBR28 as a specific PET ligand for TSPO. The secondary objective is to evaluate the relationship between TSPO occupancy and the plasma concentration of ONO-2952 and to investigate the safety and tolerability of ONO-2952 in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
