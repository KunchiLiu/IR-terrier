	<brief_summary>This study aims at a direct comparison between ProHance (0.1 mmol/kg) and a validated comparator Gadovist/Gadavist (0.1 mmol/kg) in a crossover intra-individual design in subjects with brain tumors to confirm the identical overall technical and diagnostic performance of the two MR contrast agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Prohance® With Gadovist®/Gadavist™ in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult patients were given two MRI exams, one after injection of ProHance (0.1 mmol/kg) and one after injection of Gadovist/Gadavist (0.1 mmol/kg). The exams were performed with identical equipment and imaging parameters with the order of the two exams randomized and 2-14 days between the first and the second MRI exam. Image data was evaluated by 3 expert neuroradiologist blinded to the agent administered and patient clinical data.</detailed_description>
