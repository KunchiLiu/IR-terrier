	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. All patients' parents (or legal guardians) must sign and date an informed consent consistent with ICHGCP guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in the trial. Where appropriate, participants should assent to enroll in the study. 2. Male or female patients between 1 and 5 years of age. 3. By a physician documented (at least 6 month) history of persistent asthma symptoms, including (but not limited to) wheezing, cough, and/or shortness of breath. (persistent = need for inhalation corticosteroid maintenance therapy to control asthma symptoms) 4. For patients aged 5 years and capable of performing technically acceptable Pulmonary Function tests (PFTs): documented impaired lung function (i.e. prebronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is smaller or equal to 90% of predicted normal). 5. All patients must have been on maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid at stable dose, either as mono treatment or in combination with another controller medication, for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1. 6. All patients must be symptomatic (partly controlled) as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline for children aged 5 years and younger in the week prior to Visit 1 (screening) and in the week prior to randomisation (Visit 2). Further inclusion criteria apply. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with a significant disease other than asthma. 2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal screening haematology or blood chemistry will be excluded if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion criterion 1. 3. Patients with a history of congenital or acquired heart disease, or patients who have been hospitalised for cardiac syncope or failure during the past year. 4. Patients with any unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia, including cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention (e.g. pacemaker implantation) or a change in drug therapy within the past year. 5. Patients with a malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. 6. Patients with clinically significant lung diseases other than asthma. 7. Alternative causes (other causes than asthma) that can lead to respiratory symptoms of wheeze, cough and shortness of breath. 8. Patients with known active tuberculosis. 9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. 10. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the 6 weeks prior to the screening visit (Visit 1). Further exclusion criteria apply.</criteria>
