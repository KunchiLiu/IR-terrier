	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Vaginal Misoprostol and Intravenous Oxytocin for Induction of Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both oxytocin and misoprostol have been demonstrated to be safe and effective methods for induction of labor. A direct comparison of efficacy and time to delivery in multiparas has not been specifically investigated. Additionally, the study will look at costs of the two drugs.Oxytocin is administered through an IV so requires more direct patient care time from the Registered Nurse, IV pump, and tubing, whereas misoprostol is a tablet, administered only once, per vagina or orally, every 4 hours. Misoprostol is also very inexpensive comparatively; if equally or more efficacious than oxytocin, this could demonstrate quite a cost and time savings to Vanderbilt University Medical Center and other institutions. Safety of either drug is not in question.</detailed_description>
