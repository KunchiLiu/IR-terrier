	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of age and sex on the pharmacokinetics, and the safety of a single oral dose of 30 mg of apremilast in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Healthy Elderly Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, parallel group study where eligible elderly subjects (aged 65-85 years inclusive) and younger subjects (aged 18-55 years inclusive) and who are matched to the elderly subjects by sex and BMI (Â± 10%) will receive a single dose of 30 mg apremilast under fasting conditions. The subjects will check into the study center on Day -1, will be dosed on Day 1, and discharged from the study center on Day 3 after all scheduled pharmacokinetic blood draws and safety evaluations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for elderly group 1. Healthy male or female subjects of any ethnic origin between ages of 65 and 85 inclusive with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35. 2. Females must have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to screening or be postmenopausal (to be confirmed by lab tests). 3. Males must agree to use latex or polyurethane condoms when engaging in sex during the study and for at least 28 days after dosing. 4. Elderly subjects with stable, chronic medical condition may be eligible if the condition is wellcontrolled and medications do not interfere with study procedures or pharmacokinetic interpretation Inclusion Criteria for younger group: 1. Healthy male or female of any ethnic origin between the ages of 18 and 55 inclusive with a BMI between 18 and 35. 2. Males must agree to use latex or polyurethane condoms when engaging in sex during the study and for at least 28 days after dosing. 3. Females who are able to become pregnant have a negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline, and must agree to use one of the following: a highly effective form of contraception (ex. Nonoral hormonal, intrauterine device) OR oral hormonal contraceptive plus one additional form of barrier contraception OR two forms of barrier contraception These must be effective by the time of screening. For younger females who are not able to become pregnant, the conditions for the elderly females will apply. 1. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, or psychiatric illness, that would prevent the subject from signing the Informed Consent form, places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the study, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 2. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or plans to have elective or medical procedures during the conduct of the trial. 3. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the first dose administration or 5 halflives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer). 4. Subjects with known serum hepatitis, is a known carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus antibody. 5. Subjects who have used prescription systemic or topical medications within 30 days of dosing, unless it is being used to treat a stable, chronic medical condition. This includes medication that is an inhibitor or inducer of Pglycoprotein transporter and CYP3A4/5 used within 14 days of dosing.</criteria>
