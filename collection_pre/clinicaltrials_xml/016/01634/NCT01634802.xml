	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of a Computerized Decision Support System (CDSS) in form of alerts to clinicians enhances early detection of immunological treatment failure in HIV patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Use of Clinical Decision Support System in HIV Care in Resource Constrained Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that there is no difference in the time to detecting immunological treatment failure among HIV patients in resource poor settings whether the clinicians use an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system with a Computerized Decision Support (CDSS) or an EMR without a CDSS. In this study, 20 clinics were assigned to the intervention (EMR+CDSS) arm and non-intervention arm (EMR only) and will be followed up for 12 months to assess whether there are any differences in time taken to detect immunological treatment failure based on CD4 cell count.</detailed_description>
