	<brief_title>Bone Health and Vitamin D Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the prevalence of osteopenia and vitamin D deficiency in HIV-1 infected, HAART naive Thai patients compared to HIV-1 uninfected Thai participants. Furthermore, to determine the change in BMD after twelve months in HIV-1 infected Thai patients on a TDF-based HAART regimen compared to patients on a non-TDF containing regimen.</detailed_description>
