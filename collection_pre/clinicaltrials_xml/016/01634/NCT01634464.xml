	<brief_summary>In the PREOBE projects it is aimed to obtain genetic and biochemical biomarkers for the programming of obesity in early stages of life. This can be achieved by studying pregnant women with normal weight, overweight, obesity and gestational diabetes, and by analyzing how these conditions could impact on fetal growth and development; the risk of obesity in the offspring during the first 3 years of life will be also assessed (genetic polymorphisms of the most recognized genes related to obesity; gene expression of placental biomarkers indicators of early programming, polyunsaturated fatty acids, immunological and pro-inflammatory markers, analysis of endogenous and exogenous lipid peroxidation, allergies &amp; neurodevelopmental assessment...). Moreover, the interaction of pathological maternal conditions with confounder factors that could have a role in the proposed outcomes will be also studied (maternal and child dietary intake, medical history and socioeconomic &amp; environmental factors).</brief_summary>
