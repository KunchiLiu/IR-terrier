	<brief_summary>Patients with recurrent, refractory or metastatic solid tumors have a dismal prognosis with few viable treatment options. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an agent that has been widely used to treat malaria. Because HCQ also inhibits autophagy, a process central to survival of cancer in the face of metabolic stress, including the effects of anti-cancer therapy, it is now in human cancer trials combined with other agents to attempt to boost the efficacy of those agents. Autophagy inhibition improves the activity of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that blocks not only receptor tyrosine kinases such as KIT, VEGFR and PDGFR but also serine/threonine kinases along the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The investigators propose to treat patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with sorafenib, to boost its efficacy while attempting to mitigate its toxicity by combining with HCQ.</brief_summary>
