	<brief_summary>Since overweight and obesity, a risk factor for various diseases, is a prevalent problem in the modern society, it is important to search for new strategies to counteract this. In contrast to in person support, the internet provides a low cost opportunity, which is able to reach a large part of the population. Therefore a web-based weight loss program may be an adequate mean for many people. Now it is hypothesised that a web-based weight loss program is able to support a reduction of body weight and weight-related cardiovascular risk factors effectively and to promote a healthier lifestyle. It is expected that program use, compared to a control group, results in greater reductions in body weight and cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
