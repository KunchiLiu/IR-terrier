	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to establish the maximum maintenance dose of SPM 962 in patients with Parkinson's disease in a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label study by conducting safety evaluation of each patient following once-daily transdermal doses of SPM 962 within a range of 4.5 to 36.0 mg. (The administration period will consist of a standard 8-week dose-titration period, 4-week dose-maintenance period, and a dose de-escalation period) Exploratory evaluation of each patient's maintenance dose will also be conducted with attention to patient safety. The relationship of pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy will also be examined.</brief_summary>
