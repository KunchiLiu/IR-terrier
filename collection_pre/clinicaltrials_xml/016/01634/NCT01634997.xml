	<brief_title>Evaluation of SCOUT DS Device in the Diagnosis of Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will complete up to 330 subjects at the clinical site to evaluate the accuracy of SCOUT DS, random capillary glucose (RCG) and the Leicester diabetes risk questionnaire for detecting prediabetes and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in subjects at risk, but not having a pre-exiting diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A point of care A1c measurement (Siemens DCA Vantage or Axis-Shield Afinion) will serve as the reference method for defining a positive screen (A1c ≥ 6.0%).</detailed_description>
