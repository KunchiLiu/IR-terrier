	<brief_summary>Obesity is a major problem worldwide and current dietary interventions are not proving to be enough to cease the increase in levels of obesity and its detrimental side effects, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Existing data suggests that adjustments in the macronutrient composition of the diet, more specifically the protein content, may have beneficial effects on body composition and an antiobesegenic effect on appetite. This may be important in terms of controlling body weight and reducing the amount of fatty tissue within our bodies and organs, and therefore preventing obesity and its health related side effects. The investigators will perform a study to investigate whether a high protein low energy diet compared to a normal protein low energy diet, in overweight adults can modify appetite and aid loss of weight and fat mass. Subjects will receive either a high protein low energy diet (1.34g protein/kg body weight) or a normal protein low energy diet (0.8g protein/kg body weight) in the form of 2 meal replacements and one conventional meal per day with 2 snacks for 12 weeks. HYPOTHESIS In overweight subjects with the metabolic syndrome, a 12 week dietary intervention with a high protein low energy diet will lead to a reduced appetite, body weight and fat mass, more specifically to a greater fall in levels of fat in the liver and pancreas than a low energy normal protein diet.</brief_summary>
