	<brief_title>Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study. Each subject will be randomized to receive a single dose of 30 mg apremilast during each of the 2 periods; once under fasting conditions and once after a high fat meal. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive apremilast either fasted first, then fed, or fed first then fasted. The subjects will check into the study center on Day -1 of each period, will be dosed on Day 1, and discharged from the study center on Day 3 after all scheduled pharmacokinetic blood draws and safety evaluations. After a washout of at least 5 days to a maximum of 10 days, the subjects return for period 2 during which they will receive apremilast according to their assigned sequence.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy male or female subjects of any ethnic origin between ages of 18 and 65 inclusive with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 33. 2. Females who are able to become pregnant have a negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline, and must agree to use one of the following: a highly effective form of contraception (ex. Nonoral hormonal, intrauterine device) OR oral hormonal contraceptive plus one additional form of barrier contraception OR Two forms of barrier contraception These must be effective by the time of screening. 3. All other females must have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to screening or be postmenopausal (to be confirmed by lab tests). 4. Males must agree to use latex or polyurethane condoms when engaging in sex during the study and for at least 28 days after dosing. 1. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, or psychiatric illness, that would prevent the subject from signing the Informed Consent form, places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the study, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 2. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or plans to have elective or medical procedures during the conduct of the trial. 3. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the first dose administration or 5 halflives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer). 4. Subjects with known serum hepatitis, is a known carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus antibody. 5. Subjects who have used prescription systemic or topical medications within 30 days of dosing, unless it is being used to treat a stable, chronic medical condition. This includes medication that is an inhibitor or inducer of Pglycoprotein transporter and CYP3A4/5 used within 14 days of dosing.</criteria>
