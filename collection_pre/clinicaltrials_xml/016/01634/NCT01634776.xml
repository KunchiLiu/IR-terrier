	<brief_summary>Fatty acids or omega-3s are important in the human diet for brain development. Of the three main omega-3s (alpha-linolenic acid: ALA, 18:3n-3; eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA; 20:5n-3; docosahexaenoic acid: DHA, 22:6n-3), DHA and EPA have been studied extensively and have been shown to be important in brain function. Conversely, little is known about the effects of ALA even though the body can make DHA and EPA from it. Because the rate at which ALA makes DHA and EPA is very slow, ALA is not considered an important source of DHA and EPA. However, in the human diet, ALA is more readily available, more easily consumed, and less expensive relative to animal sources of DHA and EPA. So, it is very important that the investigators explore the effects of supplementation with ALA. It is possible that the ALA to DHA and EPA conversion rate can be altered by methylation, an epigenetic form of gene expression and regulation. In the present study, the investigators will examine memory abilities and genetic baselines in 16-month-olds. The investigators will then supplement their food with ALA or control oil for 4 months. At 20 months, the investigators will collect outcome data on memory, fatty acid status, genetic variations, and methylation. The investigators hypothesize that the ALA supplementation will result in an increase in the rate of ALA to DHA and EPA conversion through methylation and genetic variations and subsequently, memory abilities will improve. The data from this study will be used to design a larger R01 grant.</brief_summary>
