	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevail as the main cause of death in developed and developing countries and are among the most frequent causes of disabilities in Brazil and in the world. Economic alternatives have been studied to assist in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Within this context, the Solanum menogena, whose fruit known as eggplant is widely consumed in Brazil, is being used in alternative medicine with the purpose to reduce the concentrations of cholesterol, glucose and promote loss of body weight. Aubergine (eggplant) stands out for its high fibre content (approximately 40%) and low fat content. In addition, it is popularly known for its functional properties, aiding in reducing the risk of coronary diseases. The purplish coloring of the eggplant peel is attributed to the large amount of flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties and contribute to the flavor of eggplant. The investigators hypothesis is that the eggplant flour associated with a restricted calorie diet has effect in reduction in waist circumference, reduction of body fat and increasing HDL-cholesterol; this way, contributing to the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors All participants will be informed about the research and they will have to sign a consent form. The volunteers will be divided into two groups: one group will receive a restricted-calorie diet and supplementation with eggplant flour; and the other will receive a diet plus a placebo for 120 days, being both groups evaluated monthly. In each consultation, evaluation of weight, body composition, fulfillment of the diet and blood pressure measurement will be performed. In addition, blood will also be collected in order to determine glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, oxidized anti-LDL antibodies, 15-isoprostane and minerals (selenium, zinc, iron, manganese, magnesium and copper). The results will be analyzed by statistical program. The investigators expect that with the results obtained, the eggplant flour can be used as an ally in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.</brief_summary>
