	<brief_summary>A novel concept of self-gripping mesh has been developed to achieve secure and long-term posterior wall reinforcement. ProGrip™ mesh is a lightweight (40g/m2) monofilament polypropylene or polyester mesh with resorbable polylactic acid (PLA) micro-grips, which provide self-gripping properties during the first few months after implantation. The self-fixation of the mesh to the underlying tissues is instantly achieved at application, limiting or avoiding the requirement of sutures (which can penetrate underlying tissues and damage cutaneous nerves), and providing a near tension-¬free repair. Case series confirmed that Parietex ProGrip™ placed in onlay position allows a safe and painless treatment of incisional hernias and provides secure and efficient fixation mesh. On this basis, larger sizes Parietex ProGrip™ meshes have been developed for larger incisional hernia defect treatment. In order to assess the clinical outcomes following the use of ProGrip™ larger sizes in incisional hernia repair, this mono-center observational study has been initiated.</brief_summary>
