	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the 4-site "one-week" post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen as a possible alternative to the 2-site updated Thai Red Cross (TRC) PEP regimen. Primary objective: - To demonstrate that PEP using the new "one-week, 4-site" (4-4-4-0-0) intradermal PEP regimen (with and without rabies immunoglobulin), is non-inferior to PEP using the updated TRC (2-2-2-0-2) ID PEP regimen with rabies immunoglobulin in terms of seroprotection rate at Day 14. Secondary objectives: - To describe the immune response in each group at Day 0, Day 14 and Day 90. - To describe rabies virus-neutralizing antibody persistence during the 5 years after completion of PEP in each group. - To describe the immune response induced by a single-visit 4-site intradermal (ID) booster vaccination in each group at Year 5. - To describe the safety profile of each treatment group after the primary and booster vaccinations.</brief_summary>
