	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine and Cisplatin are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat advanced urothelial cancer. There is no standard chemotherapy for patients who cannot receive Cisplatin. However, most patients are treated with the chemotherapy drugs Gemcitabine and Carboplatin. In this study, the researchers hope to learn what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of Gemcitabine and Pazopanib has on urothelial cancer. Gemcitabine is given intravenously (through the veins) and works by killing rapidly dividing cells in the body, including cancer cells. Pazopanib is an oral chemotherapy and works by decreasing the blood supply to tumors which limits the tumor's source of oxygen and nutrients. The combination of Gemcitabine and Pazopanib is being tested in research studies such as this one. As of August 2011, more than 18 patients with various types of cancer have received treatment with Gemcitabine and Pazopanib. The main goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drugs Gemcitabine and Pazopanib can shrink or slow the growth of urothelial cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. The physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings will help us decide if the combination of Gemcitabine and Pazopanib is safe and effective.</brief_summary>

(Note: One paraffin block or 10 freshlyprepared unstained slides from the most representative single paraffin embedded tumor tissue block should be submitted. Slides from the primary tumor are preferred. If both the primary and metastatic tumor blocks are available, 10 slides from each of the sites should be submitted. If tissue from the primary tumor is not available, a paraffin block or unstained slides from a metastatic site are acceptable. Fine needle aspirates (FNAs) have insufficient tumor tissue and are not permitted.)

Platelets ≥100 X 109/L Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.2 X ULN (Note: Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation.) Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.2 X ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN Alanine amino transferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 X ULN (Note: Concomitant elevations in bilirubin and AST/ALT above 1.0 x ULN (upper limit of normal) are not permitted.) Calculated creatinine clearance (ClCR) ≥30 mL/min using the CKDEPI equation: eGFR = 141 x min(Scr/k, 1)a x max(Scr/k, 1)1.209 x 0.993 Age x 1.018 [if female] x 1.159 [if black] Scr is serum creatinine, k is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, a is 0.329 for females and 0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/k or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/k or 1 Urine Protein to Creatinine Ratio (UPC)d &lt;1 (Note: If UPC ≥1, then a 24 hour urine protein must be assessed. Subjects must have a 24hour urine protein value &lt;1 g to be eligible.) Prior treatment with systemic chemotherapy (prior intravesical therapy is permitted) Prior malignancy (Note: Subjects who have had another malignancy and have been diseasefree for 5 years subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma, subjects with successfully treated in situ carcinoma, or subjects who have had adenocarcinoma of the prostate that has been definitively treated with a posttreatment PSA that is nondetectable are eligible.) History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have previouslytreated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroids or antiseizure medication for 6 months prior to first dose of study drug. Screening with CNS imaging studies (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is required only if clinically indicated or if the subject has a history of CNS metastases.

The average QTc interval will be determined from the 3 ECG tracings by manual evaluation and will be used to determine if the subject will be excluded from the study. If the average QTc interval is &gt;480 msec, then the subject is not eligible to participate in the study Previous history of QTc prolongation as a result of other medication that required discontinuation of that medication Congenital long QT syndrome or 1st degree relative with unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age Use of any concomitant medication (during treatment with pazopanib or within 14 days of starting treatment) that are high risk for QTc prolongation or may induce Torsades de Pointes.
