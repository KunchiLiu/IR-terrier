	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery with or without lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with breast cancer that has too many of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on its cells and has spread to the brain. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery together with lapatinib ditosylate is an effective treatment for brain metastasis from breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy or Stereotactic Radiosurgery With or Without Lapatinib Ditosylate in Treating Patients With Brain Metastasis From HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if there is a signal for an increase in complete response (CR) rate in the measurable brain metastases at 12 weeks post radiation therapy (RT) (whole brain or stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) as determined by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate CR rate of the measurable brain metastases at 4 weeks post RT (WBRT/SRS) as determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. II. To evaluate objective response rate of measurable brain metastases at 4 and 12 weeks post RT (WBRT/SRS) as determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. III. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific objective response rate (CR + partial response [PR]) at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS. IV. To evaluate central nervous system (CNS) progressive disease outside the targeted measurable disease with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. V. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific progression at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS. VI. To evaluate treatment related adverse events when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. VII. To evaluate overall CNS complete response: disappearance of all CNS target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; with no new lesions, no use of corticosteroids, and patient is stable or improved clinically, when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. VIII. To evaluate overall CNS progressive disease (within or outside targeted measurable disease) with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. IX. To evaluate overall survival when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks for a total of 15 treatments or SRS for 1 treatment. ARM B: Patients undergo WBRT or SRS as in Arm A. Patients also receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
