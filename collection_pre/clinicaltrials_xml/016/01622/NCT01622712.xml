	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether preperitoneal mesh placement using a nitinol containing large pore polypropylene mesh (REBOUND HRDâ„¢) offers a satisfying patient recovery, quick reconvalescence and adequate tissue integration with acceptable mesh contraction in a multicenter (Belgian) prospective trial. Patients treated by open preperitoneal mesh repair for an unilateral inguinal hernia according the current surgical practice in the participating centers will be observed during one year post-surgery, after which they will have a CT scan of the surgical area in the groin to evaluate the mesh changes regarding shrinkage and migration.</brief_summary>
