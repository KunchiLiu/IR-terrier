	<brief_summary>Background: Zantrex-3® is a popular dietary supplement for weight control, which consists of a combination of yerba mate, guarana, caffeine and damiana. The combination has previously been shown to decrease gastric emptying and its weight controlling effects may be related to increased satiety and thermogenesis. Objective: To investigate the effect of Zantrex-3® on energy expenditure, hemodynamic factors and subjective appetite sensations. Design: Twenty-three men (BMI: 23.9±3.2 kg/m2, mean±SD) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The Zantrex-3® compound contained 365 mg xantines (caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants), yerba mate, guarana and damiana. The thermogenic effect was measured for 3 hours post-intake. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and appetite ratings were assessed every half hour.</brief_summary>
