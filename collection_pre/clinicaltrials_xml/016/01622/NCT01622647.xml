	<brief_summary>The proposed study intends to investigate several aspects of the respiratory effects of intravenous sedation of patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for knee replacement surgery. The study will include assessment of PaCO2 during the intraoperative period. PaCO2 is expected to be elevated as a result of intravenous sedation and postural factors. Further, the study will investigate how application of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (N-CPAP) may impact PaCO2.</brief_summary>
