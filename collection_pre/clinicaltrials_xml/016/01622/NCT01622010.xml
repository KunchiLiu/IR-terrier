	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine if there is a greater behaviour change in self management of heart failure following reinforced multimedia education focusing on physical activity as compared to standard care. It is the investigators belief that participants who receive DVD education in addition to usual care will show improved self management in comparison to receiving usual care alone. The investigators anticipate fewer hospital admissions due to improved self care management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of DVD Education on Physical Activity and Self Management of Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With an aging population, heart failure is becoming more common and there is an increasing role for physiotherapy involvement with these patients. The Heart Failure Clinic is conducted by a heart failure physician, cardiac nurse, and a pharmacist. Occupational and Physical Therapists are available on a consult basis. The Clinic has expanded quickly from 49 new patients in 2004 - 2005 to 435 new patients in 2010 - 2011. Due to space and time constraints in the clinic an Allied Heath Education Class was created to provide an interactive multidisciplinary education session. All new patients, regardless of their NYHA classification, and their families are invited to attend the class. Speakers include a Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist, Dietician and Pharmacist. There is a didactic section followed by discussion after each of the speakers. Few studies have focused on physical activity as one of the major self management strategies for heart failure. There is little understanding by patients about how physical activity can improve symptoms of heart failure over time in conjunction with other lifestyle modifications. Physiotherapists have the skills to provide this education and develop individual exercise programs. Patients are currently provided with verbal and written educational material regarding a diagnosis of heart failure, physical activity, diet and medication. Previous experience with patients following acute cardiac events, either medical or surgical, has shown that providing patients with a DVD which reinforced inpatient education was successful in bridging the gap between inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation programs. Patients were able to review the education provided in their own time. Therefore, a DVD was developed which focused on typical education provided to the heart failure patient by the physiotherapist. We will compare two randomly assigned groups. The first will receive standard education received in heart failure clinic and an optional Allied Health Education Class plus a copy of the Keeping the Beat with Physiotherapy: Heart Failure edition DVD. The second group will receive the standard education provided through the heart failure clinic and the optional education class. Participants will be followed up three times over a six month period via telephone. The survey questions require a simple yes/no answer or are of a likert-style. After each telephone survey participants, will be asked to mail in their exercise and weight logs. Chart reviews will also be conducted for the collection of readmission rates and the number of clinical visits occurring during the study.</detailed_description>
