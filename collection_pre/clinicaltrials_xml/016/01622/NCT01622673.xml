	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate: (1) the effect of co-administration of single doses of calcium carbonate antacid and magnesium/aluminum hydroxide antacid on the steady-state plasma pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants; and (2) the effect of staggered dosing of a single dose of a magnesium/aluminum hydroxide antacid 2 hours before and 2 hours after administration of raltegravir on the steady-state plasma pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir in the same participants. The study will determine whether (1) the C12hrs of steady-state raltegravir after co-administration of single doses of calcium carbonate antacid is decreased to a clinically meaningful degree compared with C12hrs after administration of raltegravir alone; and whether (2) the C12hrs of steady-state raltegravir after co-administration of a single dose of magnesium/aluminum hydroxide antacid is decreased to a clinically meaningful degree compared with the C12hrs after administration of raltegravir alone.</brief_summary>
