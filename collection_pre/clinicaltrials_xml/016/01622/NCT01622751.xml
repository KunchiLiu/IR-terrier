	<brief_summary>Context: Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived hormone with an insulin sensitizing effect, and has been related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. In addition, children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and the abnormality of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Objective: To determine if the sleep stages are related to the plasma levels of adiponectin, resistin, and RBP4 (retinol binding protein-4), and whether these relationships are influenced by age, obesity and insulin resistance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This comparative study was carried out in 28 PWS children and 18 controls. The enrolled PWS children were volunteers out of a pool of approximately 100 PWS children followed at Samsung Medical Center [median age 8.0 years, interquartile range (7.0-10.5 years), BMI: median 24.2 kg/m2 (23.0-27.5 kg/m2)] and 18 obese healthy children [median age 9.0 years interquartile range (7.0-11.0 years), BMI: median 24.2 kg/m2 interquartile range (23.1-27.6 kg/m2)].</detailed_description>
