	<brief_summary>Patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will receive standard treatment with R-CHOP (rituximab,cyclosphosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednison) for 6 cycles, cycle length is 14 or 21 days. In addition, valproate is given three times daily day 1-3 in escalated doses. The rationale for adding valproate to standard treatment is invitro data indicating a sensitizing effect to chemotherapy, and an increase in CD 20-expression. Patients are included in 3+3 cohorts with escalation of valproate dose, planned dos levels are 30, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 mg/kg/day. A total of 20 patients will be treated at the MTD.</brief_summary>
