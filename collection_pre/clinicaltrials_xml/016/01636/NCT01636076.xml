	<criteria>Patients with moderate to very severe COPD (GOLD 2 to GOLD 4) according to the 2011 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines Patients with a postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 70% of the predicted normal, and a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 at runin (Visit 101). Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years (defined as the number of packs of 20 cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by number of years the patient smoked. e.g.10 pack years = 1 pack /day x 10 yrs, or ½ pack/day x 20 yrs). An exsmoker may be defined as a subject who has not smoked for ≥ 6 months at screening. Patients who have had a COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids and/or hospitalization in the 6 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1). Patients who develop a COPD exacerbation between screening (Visit 1) and treatment (Visit 201) will not be eligible but will be permitted to be rescreened after a minimum of 6 weeks after the resolution of the COPD exacerbation. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to screening Visit 1. Patients who develop a respiratory tract infection between screening (Visit 1) and treatment (Visit 201) will not be eligible, but will be permitted to be rescreened 4 weeks after the resolution of the respiratory tract infection. Patients requiring long term oxygen therapy prescribed for &gt;12 hours per day. Patients with, a) any history of asthma or, b) onset of respiratory symptoms prior to age 40 years.
