	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the safety of use of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)in children with hemiparesis. The research question, "Is transcranial Direct Current Stimulation safe for use in children with congenital hemiparesis?" relates to two hypotheses: 1. tDCS will not produce a major adverse event, including seizure activity. 2. No change in paretic or nonparetic hand function or cognitive status will occur.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Completing a pilot safety study is paramount to the future goal of incorporating the tDCS pediatric safety data and combining tDCS and rehabilitation with constraint-induced movement therapy in order to improve motor outcomes beyond what rehabilitation therapies alone can provide and enhance quality of life for these children with hemiparesis.</detailed_description>
