	<brief_summary>Care for people suffering from depressive symptoms should be given in a step-wise approach. One first step can be the provision of self-help material. Online self-help is an innovative way of providing self-help. The investigators want to study the effect of an interactive online self-help-program (Deprexis) in the treatment of mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Participants will be randomised to either twelve weeks of online-self help or a waiting-list control. Symptoms of depression and other aspects will be assessed over a one year period. Thereafter the controls will also receive online-self help. The investigators hypothesise that online self-help is superior to the control condition in alleviating depressive symptoms and preventing full blown depression.</brief_summary>
