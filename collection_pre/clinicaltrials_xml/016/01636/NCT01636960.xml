	<brief_summary>This is a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIFN alfa-2b) as adjuvant treatment in Japanese participants with malignant melanoma after definitive surgical resection including complete lymphadenectomy. Participants on this study will initially receive PegIFN alfa-2b for 8 weeks (Induction Phase) and then may continue to receive PegIFN alfa-2b (Maintenance Phase) as long as they are experiencing clinical benefit (Up to 252 weeks). The primary hypothesis is that peginterferon alfa-2b administered on a weekly basis is safe and tolerated.</brief_summary>
