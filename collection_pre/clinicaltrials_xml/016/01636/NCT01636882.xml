Patients must have reached Week 24 of the core protocol in immunerelated complete response (irCR), immunerelated partial response (irPR), immunerelated stable disease (irSD), or immunerelated progressive disease (irPD) (unconfirmed) with evidence of tumor inflammatory reaction. 2. If patient is in irPD (unconfirmed) status, they must not have had a decrease in their Karnofsky Performances Scale (KPS) score &gt; 10 points and to be judged to not have "rapid clinical deterioration" by the investigator since the subject's last tumor measurement leading to irPD assessment. 3. Patients must start treatment in the extension protocol within 8 weeks of their last injection administered in the core protocol. 4. Patient is able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. 5. Fertile males and females must agree to the use of an adequate form of contraception, e.g., condoms for males. 1. Tumors to be injected lying in mucosal regions or close to an airway, major blood vessel or spinal cord that, in the opinion of the Investigators, could cause occlusion or compression in the case of tumor swelling or erosion into a major vessel in the case of necrosis. 2. If lesions are too small to be visualized or palpable for accurate injection. 3. Currently in status of irPD (confirmed) or irPD (unconfirmed) without evidence of tumor inflammatory response, or with rapid clinical deterioration, or with a decrease of 10 points or more on their KPS score since their last assessment before irPD (unconfirmed) assessment.</criteria>
