	<brief_summary>The present study investigates the effects of recreational soccer in type 2 diabetic men in regard to muscular, cardiovascular adaptations and glycaemic control. 12 men participate in 6 month structured recreational soccer training and 10 men act as control with no change in lifestyle. Testing consisting of fasting blood samples, muscle biopsies, Dexa-scans, echocardiography, maximal oxygen consumption, Yo-Yo interval test, bloodpressure, Resting heart rate, and endothelial function (Itamar, Endopat)will be performed at baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. The study examines the hypothesis that the high-intensity aerobic work profile combined with a high anaerobic turnover from the nature of soccer (accelerations, decelerations, turns, sudden stops) will improve glycaemic control, muscle and cardiac function and taken together will improve the overall health profile in type 2 diabetic men</brief_summary>
