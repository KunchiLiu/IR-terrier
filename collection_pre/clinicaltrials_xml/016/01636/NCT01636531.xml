	<brief_summary>This multi-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel group study will assess the relative bioavailability, tolerability and dose-exposure relationship of a high concentration liquid formulation (HCLF) versus a lyophilized formulation (LyoF) of gantenerumab (RO4909832) in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be randomized to receive single subcutaneous doses of either HCLF or LyoF. Anticipated time for treatment period and follow-up will be 13 weeks.</brief_summary>
