	<brief_title>Phase 1 Safety Study of Single and Multi-Dose Topically Applied OLT1177 Gel in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OLT1177 Gel is being developed for the topical treatment of pain and inflammation emanating from musculoskeletal and certain skin inflammatory conditions. This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of OLT1177 Gel in healthy subjects when given as single-dose or multi-dose applications. The study will be conducted in two parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A, approximately 18 healthy subjects in 3 dose escalating cohorts will be randomized to receive a single dose of the investigational drug (5 subjects OLT1177 Gel and 1 subject placebo gel). Upon completion of Part A, a new subject population of approximately 18 subjects in 3 dose escalating cohorts will be randomized in Part B of the study. Subjects will receive a total of 8 doses over 3 consecutive days given 6 hours apart while awake during the day and will be followed for up to 30 days for safety assessment.</detailed_description>
