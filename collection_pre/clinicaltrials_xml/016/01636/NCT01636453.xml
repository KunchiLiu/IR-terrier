	<brief_summary>To assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra Liberty Stent System as adjunctive treatment to embolic coils for wide-neck, saccular, intracranial aneurysms in the internal carotid artery (ICA). The Liberty Stent System is an implantable device comprised of a stent and delivery system designed as an adjunct to embolic coils in the treatment of wide-neck, saccular, intracranial aneurysms. It has three components: an implant, an introducer sheath and a delivery wire assembly. The implant component is made of superelastic and biocompatible nitinol tubular material. Patients presenting with wide-neck, saccular, intracranial aneurysms in the internal carotid artery (ICA) from the cavernous segment to the carotid terminus (including the paraclinoid, ophthalmic, hypophyseal and posterior communicating segments) will receive stent assisted coiling by the Penumbra Liberty Stent with any approved embolic coils currently on the market. Wide-neck aneurysms are defined by a neck ≥4mm or a dome-to-neck ratio &lt;2. Each patient will be followed and assessed for 2, 6 and 12 months after enrollment.</brief_summary>
