	<brief_summary>This study wants to understand which direction of shoulder movement and what posture of shoulder are best for the procedure of muscle strength testing of the muscle pectoralis major(PM). We will use muscle activity signals (sEMG) and force measurement to analyze the contribution of two parts of PM in three different contraction direction with three different shoulder postures.</brief_summary>
