	<brief_summary>This is a 24-week, phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. The study will have 9 scheduled visits and a telephone contact Follow-up visit one week following the end of study treatment. The study primary endpoint is -Clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 on Treatment Day 169 Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 169 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Treatment Day 168 (i.e. at the Week 24 visit). Secondary endpoints are; - Mean TDI focal score at Week 24 - Weighted mean clinic visit FEV1 over 0 to 6 hours post-dose at Visit 2 (Day 1) Eligible subjects will be randomised to GSK573719/GW642444 125/25mcg, GSK573719/GW642444 62.5/25mcg and placebo treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio such that of the planned 573 total number of randomised subjects, approximately 191 subjects will be randomised to each active treatment group and 191 subjects will be randomised to placebo. All treatments will be administered once daily in the morning by inhalation using a Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI). There will be a total of 9 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit.1) will complete a 7 to 14 day Run-In period followed by a 24-week Treatment period. Clinic visits will be at screening, Randomisation (Day1), Day2, after 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24-weeks of treatment, and 1 day after the Week 24 Visit (also referred as Treatment Day 169). A Follow-Up contact for adverse event assessment will be conducted by telephone approximately 7 days after Visit 9 or the Early Withdrawal Visit. The total duration of subject participation, including Follow-up will be approximately 27 weeks. All subjects will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol for use on an "as-needed" basis throughout the Run-In and Study Treatment Periods. At screening, pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed followed by post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry testing. Post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 and FEV1/FVC values will be used to determine subject eligibility. To further characterise bronchodilator responsiveness, post ipratropium testing will be conducted following completion of post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry. Spirometry will be conducted at each post-randomisation clinic visit. Six hour post-dose serial spirometry will be conducted at Visit 2. Trough spirometry will be obtained 23 and 24 hours after the previous day's dose of blinded study medication at Visits 3 to 9. Assessments of dyspnea will be obtained using the Baseline and Transition Dyspnoea Index (BDI/TDI) which is an interviewer based instrument. At Visit 2, the severity of dyspnoea at baseline will be assessed using the BDI. At subsequent visits (Visits 4, 6, and 8) change from baseline will be assessed using the TDI. Administration of the BDI and TDI should be done prior to spirometry and any other study-related procedures Disease specific health status will be evaluated using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT), at baseline (Visit 2) and Visits 4, 6 and 8. The occurrence of adverse events will be evaluated throughout the study beginning at Visit 2. SAEs will be collected over the same time period as for AEs. However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow up contact. Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), 12-lead ECGs and standard clinical laboratory tests (hematology and blood biochemistry) will be obtained at selected clinic visits. For determination of subject disposition, subjects will be considered to have completed the study, upon completion of Visit 9. There is no plan to provide any of the active study treatments for compassionate use following study completion. The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population will be the primary population of interest, and is defined as all randomised subjects who have received at least one dose of the randomised study medication during the Treatment Period. Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompanying Study Procedures Manual (SPM). The SPM will provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact subject safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Type of subject: outpatient. 2. Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation. 3. Age: 40 years of age or older at Screening (Visit 1). 4. Gender: Male or female subjects are eligible to participate in the study. 5. COPD History: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004] as follows: 6. Tobacco Use and Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of more than or equal to 10 packyears 7. Severity of Disease: A postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and a postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of less than or equal to 70% of predicted normal values calculated using NHANES III reference equations at Visit 1 [Hankinson1999,Hankinson, 2010]. 8. Dyspnea: A score of â‰¥2 on the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC) at Screening (Visit 2) 1. Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the study. 2. Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma. 3. Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis) and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. A subject, who in the opinion of the investigator has any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples may include clinically significant, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis or interstitial lung disease. 4.
