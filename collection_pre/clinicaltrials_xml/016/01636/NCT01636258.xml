	<brief_summary>To examine whether a lifestyle program results in weight loss and thereby delays or prevents progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes, we propose a pilot randomized controlled trial of 6 weeks duration with 30 participants held at Stephanie Tubbs Jones Health Center. Participants are randomized to receive all of the following: nutrition education, exercise instruction, stress management instruction, and culinary education or follow usual care. Outcomes include: blood sugars and cholesterol, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, diet, physical activity, perceived stress, and class attendance. Analysis is by Intention to treat analysis of variance. Results will be used to help design larger randomized trial in the future.</brief_summary>
