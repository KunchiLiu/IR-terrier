	<brief_summary>This is an efficacy and safety study to compare aprepitant with ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in the first cycle of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) in participants with solid tumors. MECs include a number of commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic drugs including: oxaliplatin-based, irinotecan-based, and carboplatin-based regimens. The primary hypothesis of this study is that the Aprepitant Regimen is superior to the Control (ondansetron) Regimen with respect to the percentage of participants with No Vomiting Overall (in the 120 hours following initiation of MEC) in participants with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
