	<brief_summary>The investigators are investigating the usefulness of 18F-Fluordeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) for staging and follow-up of colon cancer. Furthermore, the investigators combine 18F-FDG PET findings with clinical and histopathological features, circulating tumor cell (CTC) analyses, tumor gene expression and measurements of circulating cancer biomarkers sUPAR, TIMP-1 and CEA in order to predict tumor recurrence. The investigators hypothesis: The combination of functional imaging by 18F-FDG PET/CT and pre-existing and evolving molecular biomarkers will optimize tumor characterization, staging of disease and early detection of recurrence.</brief_summary>
