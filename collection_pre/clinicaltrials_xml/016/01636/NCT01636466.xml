	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of everolimus (Zortress®) in preventing antibody formation in patients with chronic failing kidney transplants. Everolimus (Zortress®) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of rejection in kidney transplant. The primary objective for the study is to determine whether conversion of patients with chronic renal graft failure approaching dialysis to an everolimus-based regimen will prevent allosensitization. The secondary objective will be to determine whether conversion of patients with chronic renal graft failure to everolimus (elimination of calcineurin inhibitor) will delay the onset of dialysis.</brief_summary>
