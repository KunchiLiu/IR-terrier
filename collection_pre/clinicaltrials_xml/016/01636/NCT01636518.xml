	<brief_summary>Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a form of rapid irregular heart rhythm that starts in the upper chambers of the heart (called atria) and is often associated with many health problems. It can cause stroke, palpitations and heart failure. The management of long standing (chronic) AF may require additional medications and blood thinners, potentially for life. It may also require procedures where the heart is shocked with an electrical current to restore normal rhythm. Some patients require a procedure called radiofrequency ablation to address the arrhythmia. The purpose of this registry is to collect information on patients undergoing this combination of procedures into a database, and to then use this information for scientific study to improve the treatment of atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
