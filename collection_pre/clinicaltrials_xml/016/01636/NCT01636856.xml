	<brief_summary>Randomized study of patients with primary snore, mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Protocol include 40 patients randomized to oropharyngeal exercise or use of nasal dilator, breathing exercise and nasal lavage. The objectives are study the effects of therapy on oropharyngeal in a series of clinical and physiologic and anatomic variables, changes on snore and quality of sleep using Pharyngeal Critical Pressure, Magnetic Resonance, Negative expiratory pressure and snore analyses. Hypothesis that the therapy group (oropharyngeal exercises) will have more modifications compared to the control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is randomized study with multiple primary endpoints. In December 2012 the study also started collecting tongue strength and endurance (IOPI). Because not all patients are able to perform all evaluations, the publications will be divided and presented according to the completion of the required number of patients for each primary endpoint.</detailed_description>
