	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, non-interventional post-market study. The study is a post-market long-term follow-up study based on the same cohort of patients (148 patients) enrolled in a previous investigational study from March 2007 to December 2009 (ATS 3f Enable™ Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 6000, number S2005) involving 10 European sites. Patient follow-up will take place on a yearly basis up to 10 years after the implant/enrollment. Medtronic ATS Inc. retains the right to terminate this study at any time after the 5 year followup. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic ATS Enable Aortic Bioprosthesis during long-term follow-up. As this is an observational study, safety and efficacy data will be summarized and described. There is no statistically powered study hypothesis.</brief_summary>
