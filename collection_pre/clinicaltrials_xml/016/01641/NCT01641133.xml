	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to assess the reactogenicity of Synflorix™ vaccine and Prevenar 13™ vaccine after primary vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age with either Synflorix™ or Prevenar 13™ vaccine or Prevenar 13™ and Synflorix™, respectively. In addition, this study aims at assessing the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and antibody persistence (approximately 8-11 months following primary vaccination) of the Synflorix™ vaccine and Prevenar 13™ vaccine after primary vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age with either Synflorix™ or Prevenar 13™ vaccine or Prevenar 13™ and Synflorix™, respectively. This study also aims at assessing the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Synflorix™ vaccine when given as a booster dose at 12-15 months of age following primary vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age with either Synflorix™ vaccine or Prevenar 13™ vaccine or Prevenar 13™ and Synflorix™, respectively.</brief_summary>

Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any seizures or progressive neurological disease. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products since birth or planned use during the study.
