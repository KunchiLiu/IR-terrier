	<detailed_description>The FDA approved the "limited enrollment" registry to provide us with additional clinical data from which to design a pivotal IDE study. FDA has stated that their decision for this was based upon "adequate safety information" which was submitted to them as part of the original IDE submission. Therefore, the purpose of this "limited enrollment" registry study is to gather initial data on the device's performance, when used with a Calcaneal Stem.</detailed_description>
