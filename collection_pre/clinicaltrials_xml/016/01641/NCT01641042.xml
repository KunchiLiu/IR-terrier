Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject has practiced adequate contraception for one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccine dose, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception from administration of the first vaccine dose until 2 months after administration of the second vaccine dose. Additional inclusion criterion for Atrisk group • Subjects with an increased risk for meningococcal disease, such as anatomic asplenia or some degree of functional asplenia or complement deficiencies. Additional inclusion criteria for Healthy group Healthy subject as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Agematched to a subject from the Atrisk group according to age strata 15 years, 610 years and 11 to 17 years. Child in care.

Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting 30 days before administration of each study vaccine dose until 30 days after administration of each study vaccine dose. Administration of licensed inactivated influenza vaccines is allowed as per local recommendations. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. History of meningococcal disease. Any confirmed or suspected Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine until one month after the second dose of study vaccine. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine including latex. Major congenital defects. History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS). History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted.

Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. Additional exclusion criteria for the Atrisk group • Vaccination against meningococcal disease of any serogroup within the last 3 years for subjects younger than 7 years. within the last 5 years for subjects 7 years and older. Additional exclusion criteria for the Healthy group Vaccination against meningococcal disease of any serogroup with polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine within the last 5 years. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition. Serious chronic illness. History of asplenia or hyposplenia or complement deficiencies.</criteria>
