	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of a behavioral intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep quality (CBT-SQ) to reduce sleep complaints, depression recurrence, and cellular and genomic markers of inflammation in older adults with sleep complaints who have a prior history of depression. The investigators aim to: 1) evaluate the effects of CBT-SQ vs. Sleep Seminar (SS) on objective (actigraphy) and subjective (sleep diary; questionnaire) measures of sleep symptoms over a two-year follow-up; 2) determine the effects of CBT-SQ vs. SS on recurrence of depressive symptoms and depression episode(s) over a two-year follow-up. The investigators will also secondarily examine the effects of CBT-SQ vs. SS on cellular and genomic markers of inflammation over a two-year follow-up, and explore whether markers of inflammation and cytokine genes can explain variability in the risk of depression recurrence in those older adults receiving CBT-SQ vs. SS. The present study is highly significant by being the first study, to the investigators knowledge, to focus on the prevention of depression in community dwelling older adults who have a history of depression, and by targeting sleep disturbance, a modifiable risk factor to prevent depression recurrence.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Older adults &gt;= 60 year of age Evidence of selfreported sleep disturbance as indexed by PSQI scores &gt;5. Psychiatric Disorders. 1. current major depressive disorder or other DSMIV psychiatric disorder (e.g. substance dependence) with the exception of a anxiety disorder; 2. presence of psychotic symptoms 3. acute suicidal or violent behavior or history of suicide attempt within the last year; Sleep Disorders. 4. current or lifetime history of sleep disorder (sleep apnea, nocturnal myoclonus, phaseshift disorder) as identified by SCIDIV and the Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders (DSISD); persons with comorbid insomnia will be included Medical conditions. 5. severe or acute medical illness (e.g., major surgery, metastatic cancer, stroke, or myocardial infarction) six months prior to study entry presence of comorbid medical conditions; 5) neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis; neurodegenerative dementia,); 6. severe pain disorders requiring daily pain management; 7. presence of comorbid inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders that would confound the assessment of sleep as well as inflammatory markers; 8. presence of uncontrolled medical condition that is deemed by the investigators to interfere with the proposed study procedures, or put the study participant at undue risk (e.g., an active heart failure categorized as Class III or greater according to New York Heart Association criteria; symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias; symptomatic, hemodynamically significant mitral or aortic valvular disease); 9. presence of chronic infections, which may elevate proinflammatory cytokines. While we will not exclude this individuals only behavioral outcomes will be measured on these subjects. No analysis of blood will be performed. (If a history of an acute infectious illness is identified within two weeks of a scheduled blood sampling, the session will be rescheduled to occur outside this two week period); Medication and substance use. 10. use of hormone containing medications including steroids; 11. immune modifying drugs that target specific immune responses agents such as TNF antagonists; 12. daily use of analgesics such as opioids. We will include those taking psychotropic medications (except for antipsychotic medications or who have have been treated with a depotneuroleptic within 6 months prior to study entry) In regards to psychotropic medication use, we will quantify past, current, and ongoing use of psychotropic medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, other antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives) and assess the effects of these medications on primary outcomes during the intervention, and followup period.</criteria>
