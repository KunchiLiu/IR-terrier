	<brief_summary>The study is being done to: - test a strategy of using a resistance test to choose anti-HIV drugs. Resistance tests look at the HIV in your blood to see which drugs might work best to lower your HIV infection. - see how well combinations of new anti-HIV drugs work to lower HIV infection - see if taking new anti-HIV drugs together is safe and tolerable - see if text messages improve people's anti-HIV drug-taking behavior (only at sites doing the adherence study) - in people taking certain combinations of anti-HIV drugs with an anti-TB drug, compare how these drugs act in the body - in Step 3, to see how people do after they stop having frequent clinic visits as part of a research study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Step 1: HIV1 infection Any previous combination of ARV treatment at any time with at least one regimen that contained one NNRTI and two NRTIs which was replaced with a PIbased regimen because of virologic, immunologic, or clinical treatment failure, or because of toxicity. NOTE: All potential participants with prior RAL exposure will be assigned to Cohort D. Current receipt of a PIbased regimen with no regimen change for a minimum of 24 weeks prior to screening. NOTE A: Within the 30 days prior to collection of the confirmatory VF sample, alteration in dose, dose frequency, or any withinclass substitution(s) for intolerance is permitted, as are drug interruptions for fewer than 7 cumulative days. NOTE B: There can be no changes and no drug interruptions within the 3 days immediately prior to the collection of the confirmatory VF sample. Confirmation of VF of current secondline PIbased ART. NOTE A: Failure of the current secondline regimen is defined as two consecutive measurements of plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL obtained at least 1 day apart while on the current PIbased regimen. NOTE B: The first measurement of plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL must have been obtained after at least 24 weeks of being on the current PIbased regimen and within 240 days prior to study entry. This measurement may be obtained from any local laboratory or from medical records regardless of the laboratory that performed the test. NOTE C: The second measurement of plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL must be obtained within 103 days prior to study entry and must be performed in a DAIDSapproved laboratory. CD4+ Tcell count result from a specimen drawn within 103 days prior to study entry; the date of specimen draw and CD4+ Tcell count must be recorded. Certain laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry. Females of reproductive potential (women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, ie, who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, hysterectomy or bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to randomization or registration. Female participants of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in the conception process (ie, active attempt to become pregnant, in vitro fertilization), and if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female participant must use at least one reliable form of contraceptive. Potential female participants must continue to use contraceptives while receiving study treatment and for 6 weeks after stopping study treatment. Female participants who are not of reproductive potential or whose male partner(s) has documented azoospermia) are not required to use contraceptives. Any statement of selfreported sterility or that of her partner's must be entered in the source documents. NOTE: Acceptable documentation of lack of reproductive potential is oral or written documentation from the participant. Karnofsky performance score &gt;/= 70 within 30 days prior to study entry. Ability and willingness of potential participant to provide informed consent. Willingness of potential participant to adhere to protocol requirements, especially with respect to treatment assignment and ability to obtain nonstudy provided ART, if needed. Ability to take oral study medications. No intention of permanent relocation that would preclude attending Step 1 and 2 study followup visits. Availability of a successful, interpretable resistance genotype report from a DAIDSapproved regional genotyping facility from testing performed on a plasma sample that was collected during screening (ie, at or after the date that a sample is collected to confirm HIV1 virologic failure) and which was shipped to a regional resistance testing laboratory once documentation of two screening plasma HIV1 RNA values ≥1000 copies/mL was available. NOTE: A repeat test of the original sample is acceptable if the initial genotype results are not available due to technical reasons. Identification of a cohort assignment and ARV regimen for use on study, selected from the recommended options provided by the site investigator, and reviewed and approved by the A5288 CMC. NOTE: The final CMCapproved cohort (A, B, C, or D) and planned ARV regimen must be entered into the enrollment system, the ACS, and kept in hardcopy as source documentation at the site. Exclusion Criteria for Step 1: Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or their formulation. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until candidate either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site investigator, for at least 7 days prior to study entry. Concurrent illness or condition that would compromise the ability to take study medication, follow the protocol, or that would make participation not in the best interest of the participant, per the site investigator. Requirement for taking any of the prohibited medications with the selected ARV study regimen, or within 14 days prior to study entry. Active tuberculosis (TB) or rifampin exposure less than 2 weeks prior to study entry.</criteria>
