	<brief_title>Beating Versus Arrested Heart for Mitral Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During open-heart surgery prevention of ischemia and reperfusion following cardioplegic arrest are essential for myocardial protection. Beating heart surgery on normothermic bypass simulates physiologic cardiac status and is good method for myocardial protection. A comparison of both available techniques for valve replacement arrested heart versus on-pump empty beating heart of the clinical and ultramicroscopic myocardial alterations will allowed to better understand myocardial protection because eliminated the use of cardioplegia and the corollary risk of ischemic reperfusion injury.</detailed_description>
