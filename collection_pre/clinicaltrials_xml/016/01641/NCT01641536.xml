	<brief_summary>This study is an open label, dose escalation study using the classical 3+3 design to determine the MTD of HB-110 and assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of HB-110 DNA therapeutic vaccine administered by Electroporation in combination with Entecavir in chronic hepatitis B patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of HB-110 Administered by Electroporation in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients enrolled in the trial will be successively allocated into three cohorts for HB-110 1mg, 2mg, and 4mg in combination with Entecavir according to the classical 3+3 protocol design. They will be administered by Electroporation device. The scheduled assessments and visits will be carried out over three periods: run-in period, treatment period, and follow-up period. The run-in period includes the screening visit where a written informed consent is obtained and the screening period where patients are assessed for eligibility. It will be completed within 14 days prior to Visit 1. The patients meeting inclusion criteria will start the treatment period. During the treatment period, subjects will be administered HB-110 by Electroporation at each visit in combination with antiviral drug, Entecavir. The Follow-up period starts once subjects complete the treatment period and will continue until the follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
