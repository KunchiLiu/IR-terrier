	<brief_summary>The assessment of the level of consciousness in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) can be complicated because the variables that are evaluated can be interpreted in a different way by different observers. The main objective is to determine interobserver agreement of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) among ICU nurses and assess whether professional experience change the results. Secondary objective: to determine interobserver agreement in each of the three components (motor response, verbal and eye opening) of the GCS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Glasgow Coma Scale in Neurological Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective observational study conducted in a multi-unit 18 beds, neurological and / or neurosurgical patients are included. Variables: Demographic, reason for admission, overall and its components GCS. The neurological assessment was performed by a minimum of 3 nurses. One of them applied algorithm and evaluation technique and all agreed independently valued response to stimuli. Interobserver agreement measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with confidence interval (CI) of 95%. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Trials hospital.</detailed_description>
