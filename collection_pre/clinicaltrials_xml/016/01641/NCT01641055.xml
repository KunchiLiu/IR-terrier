	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the possible health benefits of intake of proteins and peptides (small proteins) from salmon, herring and cod on glucose tolerance and inflammatory markers in overweight and obese adults. Overweight and obese subjects often have reduced glucose tolerance and a chronic low-grade inflammation, and previous findings from a study on cod proteins suggested that both glucose tolerance and immune function were improved.</brief_summary>
