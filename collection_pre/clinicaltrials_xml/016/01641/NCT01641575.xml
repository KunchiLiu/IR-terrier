	<brief_summary>The purpose of the first part of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ascending doses of gemcitabine elaidate in combination with cisplatin given to patients with advanced solid tumors, and to select a dose for further evaluation in the second part of the study. The purpose of the second part of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and exploratory clinical activity of gemcitabine elaidate in combination with cisplatin given to patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Ascending Study of Gemcitabine Elaidate (CO-101) in Combination With Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The chemotherapy doublet of cisplatin and gemcitabine is an effective regimen for solid tumors including NSCLC. Entry of gemcitabine into tumor cells has been shown to be dependent on specific membrane transporter proteins, particularly human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1). Patients with low tumor hENT-1 expression may respond poorly to gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. Gemcitabine elaidate (CO-1.01) is a fatty acid derivative of gemcitabine, and can enter cells in the absence of hENT1. CO-1.01 therefore, may overcome hENT1-mediated resistance to gemcitabine. CO-1.01 is currently being evaluated as a single agent in a pivotal randomized trial in 360 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The appropriate dose of CO-1.01 when given as part of combination therapy with a platinum agent such as cisplatin is not yet known. The objectives of this study are to: - determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CO-1.01 when combined with a fixed dose of cisplatin in patients with solid tumors - select a recommended dose (RD) for dose expansion in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC - explore clinical activity of CO-1.01 in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC</detailed_description>
