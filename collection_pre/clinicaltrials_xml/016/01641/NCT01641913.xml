	<brief_title>Intestinal Permeability in Response to Treatment in Eosinophilic Esophagitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis is an allergy mediated disease in which antigens exposed to the gastrointestinal tract trigger a combined immediate hypersensitivity. The investigators anticipate that patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis will have increased intestinal permeability on urine collection of sugars. The investigators are not sure whether these findings will be found in patients who have been successfully treated with topical esophageal steroids. Improvement in intestinal permeability would be perceived as indicating that esophageal disease drives the intestinal permeability. Lack of improvement would indicate that eosinophilic esophagitis is a more systemic disease in which increased small bowel permeability is a marker or perhaps important driver of the disease.</detailed_description>
