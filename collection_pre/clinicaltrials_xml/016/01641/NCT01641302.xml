	<brief_summary>The steep Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery have the potential to cause an increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Previous studies have proposed that ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of increased ICP. Therefore, this study is aim to confirm the increased ICP by ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD during laparoscopic surgery.</brief_summary>
