	<brief_summary>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes an initial phase of cognitive decline, usually among older adults, in which a person notices a decline in attention or memory, and performs worse than normal on cognitive tests of such. People with MCI are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease or related dementia than others their same age, and so MCI is thought of as an early warning sign of progressive cognitive decline. While some forms of MCI may be brought about by purely genetic causes, other cases may be due to a withdrawal of cognitive engagement with the world. In these cases, a rigorous program of cognitive training may be beneficial, halting or reversing symptom progression. The current study will evaluate a multifaceted cognitive activation program on older adults with MCI. This group program is intensive, running for 10 weeks, 3 times per week, for a total of 100 hours of training. Training consists of meditation exercises for broad attention activation, Tai Chi exercises to integrate cognition with body awareness, and cognitive training through computerized attention, memory, and problem solving exercise. Subjective impressions and objective measures of cognitive ability will be measured before and after the intervention. The investigators will also examine effects on mood and levels of daily function. Results will be compared to a waitlisted control group. The control group will subsequently be entered into a home-based version of the program for 10 weeks, with assessment before and after training, to look at the importance of the group meeting dynamic in promoting cognitive change.</brief_summary>
