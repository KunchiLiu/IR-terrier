	<brief_summary>A 2-part, Phase 1-2 controlled, open-label, randomized study in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In Part 1, patients will receive SGI-110 and carboplatin. The optimum dose will be identified in Part 1 based on safety and efficacy. In Part 2, patients will be randomized to receive the dose identified in Part 1 plus carboplatin or one of three treatment of choice at the discretion of the investigator. The treatment of choice consists of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or paclitaxel.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients who are women 18 years of age or older. 2. Patients who have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent highgrade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (Grade 2 or 3), primary peritoneal carcinomatosis or fallopian tube cancer. 3. Patients who have platinumresistant disease (defined as having relapsed within 6 months of her last platinumcontaining regimen). There is no limit on the number of prior treatment regimens in Part 1. In Part 2, patients may have had no more than 3 prior cytotoxic treatment regimens, excluding adjuvant or maintenance therapy. 4. Patients must have had prior paclitaxel treatment. 5. Patients who have measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 or detectable disease. 6. Patients with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 7. Patients with acceptable organ function. 8. Patients must be at least 3 weeks from last chemotherapy. 1. Patients who have hypersensitivity to SGI110 and/or carboplatin or other components of these drug products. 2. Patients who have received prior therapy with any hypomethylating agents. 3. Patients who are refractory to platinum treatment i.e., progressed while on platinum treatment. 4. Patients with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction. 5. Patients with Grade 2 or greater neuropathy. 6. Patients with known brain metastases. 7. Patients with known history of HIV, HCV or HBV.</criteria>
