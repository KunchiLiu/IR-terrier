	<detailed_description>High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke and affects 50 million people in the United States. Making healthy food choices, such as those in the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet, has been shown to improve blood pressure control in people with high blood pressure.
