	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of changing to DuoTrav® (Travoprost 0.004%/Timolol 0.5%) from prior prostaglandin analogue or beta-blocker monotherapy in Russian glaucoma patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension whose intraocular pressure (IOP) is uncontrolled while on their current treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary openangle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliative or pigment dispersion glaucoma. Be on a stable IOPlowering regimen of prostaglandin analogue or betablocker (monotherapy) within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Have IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, in such a way that should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period. Have an IOP of between 19 to 35 mmHg (at any time of the day) in at least one eye (which would be designated as the study eye). In any eye not designated as a study eye, the IOP should be able to be controlled on no pharmacologic therapy or on the study medicine alone. Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medication(s) prior to receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study. Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend all study visits. Have best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye. Read, sign, and date an Ethics Committee reviewed and approved informed consent form. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any component of DuoTrav® that is deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye. Corneal dystrophies in either eye. Any opacity or subject uncooperativeness that restricts adequate examination of the anterior chamber of either eye. Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either eye. Blepharitis or nonclinically significant conjunctival injection is allowed. History of ocular herpes simplex infection. Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye that is less than three months prior to the Screening Visit. Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment. Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause apart from glaucoma. Use of systemic medications known to affect IOP (e.g., oral betaadrenergic blockers, alphaagonists and blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers), which have not been on a stable course for 7 days prior to Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study. Bronchial asthma, a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical betablocker. History of severe allergic rhinitis. Unwillingness to risk the possibility of darkened iris or eyelash changes. Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control for at least one month prior to the Screening/Baseline Visit. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
