	<brief_summary>The objectives of this Phase I/II study are: 1. To find out the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PG2 in patients with advanced malignancy receiving chemotherapy and to define a "Study Dose" for Phase II. 2. To evaluate the hematopoietic and immunological responses after administering of PG2. Primarily to study the biological response of PG2, defined as WBC count in this study, and secondarily to study the immunological factors, IL-2, IL-6, TGF-beta, and G-CSF.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must have malignancy with metastatic or recurrent diseases. Patient must have a minimum of thirteen days period elapsed from any previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy and all treatmentrelated toxicities subsided. Patient must have at least 2 courses of chemotherapy treatment left, and a minimum of 13 days between the administration of the last dose of the chemotherapy with PG2 and the start of the next course of chemotherapy. Performance status is 02 by ECOG scale. Patient's compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate follow up. Adequate bone marrow function before the chemotherapy Adequate liver and renal function before the chemotherapy Written informed consent from patients Woman with childbearing potential should use contraception method through the whole PG2 treatment course. After the previous course of chemotherapy, the nadir of WBC dropped between 1000 to 3000/ mm3 (for phase II only). PG2 skin test is positive. Active infection Breast feeding Prior radiotherapy more than 30% of the bone marrow involved. Pregnant woman Bone marrow transplantation or brain disease</criteria>
