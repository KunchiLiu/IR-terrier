	<brief_summary>This is a monocentric study in 2 steps: A safety part to assess the feasibility of using Xenon in association with a thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with a sequential recruitment of 3, 6 or 9 patients according to predefined safety rules. The second part will randomly allocated patients (1:1) to receive TEA+Xenon or TEA+Desflurane. 28 patients will be enrolled and followed over 45 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Xenon Combined With Intraoperative Thoracic Epidural Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first step is divided into 3 parts. 9 patients will be sequentially enrolled (3 patients in each part). The patients will be followed during 45 days and the following rules will be used to assess the safety: First part: if no toxicity: initiation of the randomised part. If 1/3 toxicity: start of the second part. If 2 or 3/3 toxicity: end of the study. Second part: same rules and possible start of the third part. Third part: if no toxicity: initiation of the randomised part. If 1 or more toxicity: end of the study. The safety will be assessed after each part by an independent data safety monitoring board.</detailed_description>
