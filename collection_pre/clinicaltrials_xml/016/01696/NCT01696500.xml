	<brief_summary>Patients diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis were confirmed based on the investigators national diagnostic criteria. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not conflict with the exclusion criteria will receive NPB-01 (intravenous immunoglobulin) 400mg/kg/day for five consecutive days. Subsequently, efficacy of NPB-01 for therapy of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis will be evaluated the disease evaluation score et al. As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse events by 20 days after the start of the study treatment.</brief_summary>
