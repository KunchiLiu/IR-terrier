	<brief_summary>The study would enrolled a total of 2100 AMI patients undergoing PCI to one of three antithrombotic regimens: bivalirudin alone, or unfractionated heparin alone, or unfractionated heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. All enrolled patients would be followed-up to 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin in AMI patients with DES.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, active drug controlled multicenter clinical research and the study would enrolled a total of 2100 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to one of three antithrombotic regimens: bivalirudin alone, or unfractionated heparin alone, or unfractionated heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. All enrolled patients would be followed-up to 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year.
