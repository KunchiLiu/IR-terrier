	<brief_title>Safety Study of CB-5945 for the Treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 1,400 participants (approximately 700 participants per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at approximately 225 study centers to receive either 0.25 milligrams (mg) CB-5945 twice daily (BID) or a matching placebo BID for the 52-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. All randomized participants will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and quality of life from the first dose of study drug through Week 56.</detailed_description>
