	<brief_title>Comparative PK Study of Econazole Nitrate Foam and Econazole Nitrate Cream in Subjects With Interdigital Tinea Pedis Aged 12 Years to Less Than 18 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the results of a previous clinical study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of EN Foam versus the reference listed econazole nitrate cream and the foam vehicle in adults, the current clinical study is being conducted to provide additional pharmacokinetic data for EN in the foam formulation in subjects ages 12 to less than 18 years with interdigital tinea pedis to support a clinical bridge for systemic safety to the RLD in this pediatric population. The study also includes clinical and safety endpoints.</detailed_description>
