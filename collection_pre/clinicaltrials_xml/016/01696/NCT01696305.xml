	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, double-blind, active controlled phase 3 trial in the patients with thyroid disease, who will undergo total thyroidectomy (excluding the patients with the patient with the past history of thyroid surgery). An eligible patient will be randomized and allocated to either the test group (Hyalobarrier) or active-comparator group (Guardix-SG). He/she will undergo marshmallow esophagography in detecting esophageal dysmotility at 6 weeks after study intervention and will be followed for 12weeks. During the study, both the patients and the observer for the primary and secondary efficacy evaluation will be masked. Non-inferiority of the test device (Hyalobarrier) compared to the reference device (Guardix-SG) will be confirmed using the primary efficacy outcome,the percentage of normal esophageal transit.</brief_summary>
