	<brief_summary>The study hypothesized that a narrow gastric conduit(less than 3cm in width) would minimize anastomotic leakage following minimally invasive esophagectomy. Therefore we raise this random-controlled research, and investigate the leakage ratio from different widths of gastric conduit formed during the operation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Optimal Width of Gastric Conduit for Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy: Wide or Narrow?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy in Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University will be enrolled and be assigned to wide or narrow gastric conduit group randomly. Intra-operative blood supply and vascular SaO2 will be observed during the operation, and the rate of anastomotic leakage, together with its clinical details will be recorded in the two groups.</detailed_description>
