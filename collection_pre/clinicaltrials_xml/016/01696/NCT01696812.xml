	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are (1) to compare the clinical outcome in correlation with the electrode positions estimated by web-based image fusion of the preoperative MRI and the postoperative brain CT taken at a stable period after surgery using mutual information technique in the patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) after bilateral STN DBS and (2) to examine whether the documentation of the electrode position by using mutual information technique at a stable period after unilateral or bilateral STN stimulation provides useful information for the postoperative programming.</brief_summary>
