	<detailed_description>Study design: Human volunteers will receive conventional fish or vitamin D fortified fish for a period of 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, 25(OH)D3 will be measured in serum as the main outcome variables. Additional outcome variables are the Ca concentration in serum, PTH concentration in serum.
