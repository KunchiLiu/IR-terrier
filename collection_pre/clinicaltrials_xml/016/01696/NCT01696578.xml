	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Combined Intervention Approaches in the Treatment of Affective Disorders and Chronic Pain in War Victims</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this project is to contribute to the promotion of evidence-based health intervention which is dealing with the long-term consequences of trauma in the post-conflict Kosovo. This is the second phase of a series of multi-site case studies. Based on the knowledge generated in the first phase of project in 2007-2009, the investigators conclude that there is a need to continue with health interventions in northern Kosovo among those who are still suffering from the long-term effects of trauma. Many problems need to be addressed, ranging from unemployment and sleep disturbances to a high suicide rate. As our study shows, the situation is frequently complicated by co-morbidity between mental and physical problems, in particular, anger, hatred, severe depression and chronic pain. At this phase, the investigators aim to provide the available rehabilitation service to the victims of torture and massive violence in northern Kosovo. The investigators undertake an integrated intervention approach; that is a biofeedback supported cognitive-behavioral therapy (BF-CBT), which involves anger management, anxiety and phobia treatment (based on prolong exposure therapy)and a group physiotherapy intervention, which promotes physical fitness and social participation. The ultimate goal of this project is to determine both feasibility and the effectiveness of combined interventions in the countries with limited resources.</detailed_description>
