	<detailed_description>Intestinal insufficiency due to short bowel syndrome is a chronic, disabling condition with significant morbidity and mortality.Standard care includes home parenteral/enteral nutrition as well as intestinal transplantation, however multiple drugs, vitamins, antibiotics and symptom-relieving agents may be required. Little attention has been given to the indications and dosage schedules of such drugs, many of which are employed as off-label prescriptions because of lack of official guidelines. Prescriptional patterns of these drugs will be analyzed in a clinical cohort of home parenteral/enteral nutrition patients, registered at the outpatient service of Hospital das Clinicas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.</detailed_description>
