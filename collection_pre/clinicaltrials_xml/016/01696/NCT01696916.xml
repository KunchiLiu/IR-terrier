	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the development of partial pressure of carbon dioxide during the 6-min walking test and during night in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-patients (GOLD stage IV). Therefore the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation and the heart rate are registered by a device called "Sentec" during the mentioned periods. In addition a measurement of activity is realised by an activity monitor ("Sensewear").</brief_summary>
