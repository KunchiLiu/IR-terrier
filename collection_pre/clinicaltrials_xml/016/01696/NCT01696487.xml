	<brief_summary>The spectrum of NAFLD as emerging epidemic ranges from steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Disease progression is poorly understood and treatment options are limited. Fructose overconsumption has been associated with gut permeability and progression of NAFLD. To unravel the mechanisms of fructose-induced intestinal changes, volunteers will receive a 4-week fructose challenge prior to assessment of intestinal permeability/translocation using endomicroscopy, sugar probes, serum markers of intestinal damage, inflammation, iron/copper homeostasis and histological/molecular analysis of intestinal biopsies. Findings in volunteers will be compared with liver patients undergoing study procedures without fructose challenge. Translational in vitro experiments will explore cellular responses to fructose and endotoxin. This project should provide novel insights into dietary induced alterations of the gut integrity in progression of NAFLD to NASH.</brief_summary>
