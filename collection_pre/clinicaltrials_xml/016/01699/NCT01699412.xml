	<brief_title>Clinical Trial With Clobetasol and Dexamethasone for Topical Treatment of Oral Lesions of Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients with symptomatic oral lesions of cGVHD were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were patients with 12 years or less of age, history of allergy to any of the studied medications and patients already under other topical treatment for oral lesions of cGVHD. Patients were randomly assigned between two study groups: one group rinsed with a solution of clobetasol propionate 0.05% associated to nystatin 100,000 UI/mL; and another group rinsed with a solution of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/ml associated to nystatin 100,000 UI/mL. Patients were instructed to use the solution 3 times a day, during 1 minute, for 28 days. Clinical exams were performed at baseline and after 28 days. Patients were evaluated by an oral medicine expert, previously calibrated for evaluation of oral cGVHD lesions. Oral lesions of cGVHD were diagnosed according to NIH 2005 criteria, and graded according to the modified oral mucositis rating scale. Evaluation of the symptoms of the oral mucosa and of xerostomia were performed through visual analogue scale. Samples for fungal culture were obtained before and after the topical treatment. Results were submitted to a descriptive analysis. Chi-square was used for the comparison of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used for the comparison of measurable data inter and intra-groups, respectively. Significance level was set at 5%.</detailed_description>
