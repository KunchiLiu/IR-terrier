	<brief_summary>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechin in green tea, is postulated to modulate dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene overexpression in the brains of Down syndrome mouse models. The clinical study is aimed at demonstrating that normalization of Dyrk1A and APP functions is a therapeutic approach to improve cognitive performance and decelerate AD (Alzheimer's disease) like progression.</brief_summary>

Current ingestion of vitamin supplements or catechins or AINE in the two weeks preceding the study. History of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal problems or any other cause that may alter processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug, or that might suggest gastrointestinal irritation to drug.
