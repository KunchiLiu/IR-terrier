	<criteria>Esophageal anastomotic stricture post esophagectomy (esophagogastric strictures). Esophagectomy performed at the same institution where patient enrollment and followup is planned. Two dilations to at least 16 mm in diameter since esophagectomy. 1st dilation no more than 6 months post esophagectomy and 2nd dilation within 6 months of 1st dilation to 16mm. Dysphagia score of 2 (ability to swallow semisolid foods), 3 (ability to swallow liquids only) or 4 (unable to swallow liquids) at baseline. Unable to pass a standard endoscope (approx. 9.8 mm diameter). Age 18 years or older. Willing and able to comply with the study procedures and provide Stricture within 2 cm of the upper esophageal sphincter. Dysphagia related to motility disorder. Nonanastomotic esophageal strictures. Esophagocolonic strictures. Planned adjuvant radiation therapy post esophagectomy. Prior esophageal stent placements post esophagectomy. Active erosive esophagitis. Sensitivity to any components of the stent or delivery system. Concurrent medical condition that would affect the investigator's ability to evaluate the patient's condition or could compromise patient safety. Participation in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational device within 3 months prior to enrollment in this study. Stricture length &gt; 5 cm.</criteria>
