	<brief_summary>This multi-center, prospective, open label study analyzed specimens from fifty subjects at two study sites. Patients scheduled to undergo breast-conserving surgery were recruited in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study period per subject was the time it took to assess the ex vivo breast tissue sample using the study device. Image review was conducted after surgery and compared to the margin status findings in the post-operative pathology report.</brief_summary>
