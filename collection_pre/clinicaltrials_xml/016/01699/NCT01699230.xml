	<brief_title>Potential Effects of Omega 3 Supplementation on Cardiomyocytes Membranes for Patients With Coronary Atherosclerosis?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very few human data are currently available on the fatty acid composition of cardiomyocytes membranes. Preoperative omega-3 supplementation for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is correlated with a decreased frequency of postoperative complications in type of arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common complication: 30 to 50% after myocardial revascularization. The occurrence of atrial fibrillation increases morbidity and mortality after surgery for sure. The pathophysiological mechanisms of common atrial fibrillation treated in heart rhythm units are different from those of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Indeed, atrial fibrillation is a common disease primarily of the left atrium, although atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery is a multifactorial disease with implication of various pathogens such as inflammation without precise anatomical support. The preventive use of polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-3 long-chain (LC-AGPIÏ‰3), prior cardiac surgery is far from widespread due to a Lack of information dissemination, by insufficient number of published studies, despite the existence of a number of ongoing clinical trials and a complete ignorance of biological mechanisms of action. A human clinical study is needed. In a context of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and without deleterious side effects of preoperative enrichment in omega-3, it seems appropriate to conduct a feasibility study to provide information on structural changes in membranes of cardiomyocytes.</detailed_description>
