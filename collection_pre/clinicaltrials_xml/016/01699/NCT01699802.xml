	<brief_summary>The purpose is to investigate how the adsorptive capacity of the active carbon filter to carbon dioxide in an anaesthetic gas reflector (AnaConDa) is affected by adding inhaled anaesthetic agent. The hypothesis is that addition of inhaled anaesthetic agent will affect the amount of adsorption of carbon dioxide to the active carbon and thereby affect rebreathing of carbon dioxide.</brief_summary>
