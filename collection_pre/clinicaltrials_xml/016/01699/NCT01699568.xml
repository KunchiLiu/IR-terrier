	<brief_summary>Objectives: To compare the stability of implant surface treated by dual acid etching (Porous)and implants with anodized surface (Vulcano) over a period of 16 weeks after installation. Methods: it will be a clinical study with individuals with missing teeth requiring rehabilitation with dental implants in the maxilla and that fulfill the study inclusion criteria. The research sites will be randomized into two groups: the control group patient's sites receive implant surface treated by dual acid (AR Torque Porous, Connection Implant Systems, Aruja, Brazil) and in the test group implants with anodized surface (AR Torque Vulcano-Actives, Connection Implant Systems, Aruja, Brazil). The evaluation of the stability of the implants will be made over 16 weeks, through resonance frequency analysis with Osstell (Integration Diagnostics AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and comparative.</brief_summary>
