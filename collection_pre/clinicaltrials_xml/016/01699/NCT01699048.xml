	<brief_title>The Comparative Effectiveness of Hybrid Revascularization (MIDCAB Then PCI) With DES Versus Multivessel DES PCI or CABG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, single-center, randomized trial, intended to compare three revascularization strategies in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease: 1. Hybrid approach (Minimally invasive off-pump revascularization of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass followed by consecutive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the rest of the arteries with drug eluting stents (DES) (Hybrid group, n=50) 2. Multi-vessel PCI with DES (MV-PCI group, n=50) 3. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) treatment (CABG group, n=50) PCI in Hybrid and MV-PCI group will be performed with the same 2nd generation clinically proven DES (Xience V, Xience Prime). Study objective Compare three different revascularization strategies in patients with multi-vessel coronary disease The endpoints: The primary endpoints will be death, MI, stroke, or new myocardial ischemia and will be TVR and non-TVR at 30 days, 12 months and 5-year follow-up. The secondary endpoints: Procedural success, Procedural and post-procedural blood loss and number of transfusions, Recovery time, Heart Failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA)), life quality assessed by one of the life quality questionnaires</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Multivessel coronary artery disease with ≥ 70% and &lt;96% artery stenosis (according to QCA) 2. IIV CCS functional class of angina 3. Asymptomatic patients with stresstest documented ischemia. 4. Patients at 1 month after acute myocardial infarction 5. Ability to perform either of revascularization methods (Hybrid, MVDPCI, CABG). 6. Consensus on the treatment strategy between the members of the working group, including cardiologist, cardiac surgeon and interventional specialist. 7. Patients must have signed an informed consent. 1. Pregnancy. 2. Acute coronary syndrome. 3. Previous CABG. 4. Previous stent thrombosis. 5. Severe comorbidity with high procedural risk for either of the studied strategies. 6. Severe peripheral artery disease. 7. Other serious diseases limiting life expectancy (e.g. oncology) 8. Inability for longterm followup. 9. Participation in other clinical trials. 10. Inability to take dual antithrombotic therapy. Angiographic exclusion criteria 1. Critical stenosis (≥95%) in RCA,LAD, CX or Intermediate artery, feasible for revascularization. 2. Left main lesions. 3. Coronary artery occlusion of the major vessel. 4. Single vessel disease. 5. Need for emergency revascularization (Acute MI, ACS etc.).</criteria>
