	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, single-dose, cross-over, placebo-controlled study. The primary endpoint was chosen to demonstrate the superiority of a single-dose of the combined inhalation vs. the mono inhalation regarding the Inspiratory Capacity (IC) peak value. A total of 78 patients will be randomized to complete two visits with two single doses of treatment. Patients will be randomized in a cross-over manner. Treatment visits will be separated by a study medication wash-out period.Treatments will be administered in a blinded fashion. The patients will be male and female patients, ≥40 years of age, with a documented diagnosis of moderate or severe COPD according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria and &gt;10-pack years history of smoking, FEV1 &lt;80% and ≥30% of the predicted normal value.</detailed_description>
