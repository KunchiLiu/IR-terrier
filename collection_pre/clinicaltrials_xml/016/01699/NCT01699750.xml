	<detailed_description>This study will be divided into two phases. In the Pre-Investigational Phase (Phase 1), participants will wear PureVision contact lenses for 30 days and use ReNu® Multiplus® for contact lens care. Eligible participants will continue into the Investigational Phase (Phase 2) and be randomly assigned to wear AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses or ACUVUE® OASYS® with HYDRACLEAR® contact lenses for a total of two months. For contact lens care, participants will use OPTI-FREE® PUREMOIST® MPDS and BIOTRUE® for 30 days each.</detailed_description>
