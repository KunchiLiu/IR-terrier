	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how breast milk may protect infants from infection and promote favorable immunological, growth and development outcomes. By following mothers and their infants, we will evaluate the important interactions between infant immune responses and infectious disease events in relation to breast milk composition and feeding patterns. Our aim is to identify a set of predictive factors corresponding to healthy early infant growth and development in this setting in Northern Tanzania.</brief_summary>
