	<brief_summary>Cyclofem® is a monthly injectable contraceptive containing 25 mg of MPA and 5 mg of estradiol cypionate (E2C), a long acting ester of estradiol. The current study will assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MPA and E2 after administration of Cyclofem® and will provide critical information to determine similar bioavailability of Cyclofem to Lunelle in women residing in the USA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of Cyclofem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concept Foundation, an international nonprofit organization based in Bangkok, Thailand, was given the commercial rights to Cyclofem® by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use internationally. The brand names that the Concept Foundation has registered internationally include Cyclofem®, and Novafem® (Pharmacia Pharmaceuticals, Peapack NJ, formerly (Pharmacia and Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Michigan). The company launched its product under license from Concept Foundation with their own brand name, Lunelle™ in the US market. Lunelle™ was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, 2000 following which approximately 350,000 women had used the product. However, following the acquisition of Pharmacia and Upjohn by Pfizer and due to several production problems, Pfizer withdrew Lunelle™ from the US market. Concept Foundation has licensed Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Mumbai, India to manufacture and market Cyclofem® in India and other developing countries. US FDA approval of Cyclofem® is pivotal to the ultimate acceptance of such products in many countries because of the rigorous standards applied by the FDA for drug safety and efficacy. This initial PK study is the first step on the road to FDA approval with the ultimate goal to expand the access and range of methods available to women in the public sector. Approval of Cyclofem® by the US FDA would also allow the reintroduction of CICs to the US market.</detailed_description>
