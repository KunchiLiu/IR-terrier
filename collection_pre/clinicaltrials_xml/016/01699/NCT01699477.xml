	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to asses the efficacy and the clinical safety of the transcranial magnetic resonance guided high intensity focused ultrasound system ExAblate 4000, InSightec Ltd. for functional neurosurgery. The treatments to be conducted in this study are non-invasive, i.e. without opening the skull, and will create micro-thalamotomies in specific target areas such as thalamus, subthalamus and pallidum. The data obtained in this study will be used to evaluate the basic safety aspects of this new treatment technology and will serve as a basis for the clinical introduction of MR-guided ultrasound-neurosurgery.</brief_summary>
