	<brief_summary>The study is a Phase-I like double blind randomized placebo controlled crossover design trial. The objective is to assess the dose response relationship on glycemic and vascular effects of an acutely administered Korean White Ginseng (KWG)(Panax C.A. Meyer) in individuals with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes . Twenty seven subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (Key inclusion criteria: HbA1c ≤8.5%)or metabolic syndrome (Key inclusion criteria: as defined by The US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III)will be recruited for the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Dose Response of Korean White Ginseng in Metabolic Syndrome or Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study hypothesizes that KWG will dose dependently lower postprandial area under the curve compared to negative control, as well as will dose dependently decrease postprandial glycemia. It also assumes that use of KWG will dose dependently decrease aortic and brachial blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, and mean arterial pressure, and improve left ventricular ejection duration(ED) and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) compared to control. Finally, it expects to notice an effect on subjective satiety levels and have no significant adverse effects compared to control.</detailed_description>
