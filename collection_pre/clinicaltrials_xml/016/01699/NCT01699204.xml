	<detailed_description>The specific aim is to test the hypothesis that diesel exhaust (DE) increases airway reactivity via oxidative stress, particularly in asthmatics. To test this hypothesis, we use a crossover in vivo experimental model in mild asthmatics and normal controls using a state-of-the-art diesel exhaust exposure facility. Participants took N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) or placebo capsules three times daily for six days. On the final morning of supplementation, participants were exposed for 2 hours to either filtered air or diesel exhaust (300 µg·m-3 of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns). Twenty-six non-smokers between 19-49 years were studied under three experimental conditions (filtered air with placebo, diesel exhaust with placebo and diesel exhaust with N-acetylcysteine) using randomized, double-blind, crossover design, with a two week minimum washout between conditions. Methacholine challenge was performed pre-exposure (to determine baseline airway responsiveness) and post-exposure (to determine the effect of exposure).</detailed_description>
