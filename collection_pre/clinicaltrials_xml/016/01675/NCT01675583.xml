	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an optical device designed and developed to quantitatively monitor blood flow velocity of wound sites. It is hypothesized that the blood flow velocity of the wound site will provide critical information on the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</brief_summary>
