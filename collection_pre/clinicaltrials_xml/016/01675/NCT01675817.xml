	<brief_summary>Recent work has shown that heparin rebound is common after cardiac surgery. The exact doze of protamine required to neutralize heparin at the end of CPB is unknown. Besides, the precise doze of protamine to treat heparin rebound is also unknown. It is also unknown if precise titration of protamine perioperatively in cardiac surgery can influence transfusion requirements after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Heparin Rebound in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess how much protamine is required to neutralize residual heparin perioperatively in cardiac surgery through measurement of functional assays of heparin (anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). In the first phase of this study, protamine titration assays will be carried out on normal pooled plasma incubated with heparin in the laboratory. Once the correct dose of protamine required to neutralize the heparin is established in the laboratory, the second phase will begin. Herein, plasma samples from patients undergoing cardiac surgery (with anticoagulation with two different commercial preparations of heparin) will be evaluated for residual heparin (Anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). Protamine titration assays wil then be carried out in vitro to assess neutralization of heparin.</detailed_description>
