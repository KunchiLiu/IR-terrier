	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Gabapentin on Chronic Irritability in Neurologically Impaired Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design of the effects of gabapentin on chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children. The study will involve a 22 day medication titration, followed by a 7 day stable dosing period and a 6 day medication taper period. After an additional 3 day washout period, the subject will cross-over to the remaining arm of the study. Subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of chronic pain. Since the subjects are generally non-communicative, the subjects will be evaluated by two questionnaires and the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised, to be completed by their parent or primary caregiver. The primary aim is to determine if gabapentin provides symptom relief for chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children.</detailed_description>
