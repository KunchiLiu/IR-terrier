	<brief_title>Achieving Cannabis Cessation-Evaluating N-Acetylcysteine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the impact of NAC 1200 mg versus matched placebo (PBO) twice daily, added to contingency management (CM), on cannabis use among treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent adults (ages 18-50). After assessment and inclusion into the study, participants will be randomized to receive a 12-week course of NAC 1200 mg or matched placebo twice daily. All participants will concurrently participate in a twice-weekly contingency management (CM) intervention. Medication management will be conducted weekly throughout treatment by the medical clinician. Urine cannabinoid testing will occur at all visits, and will be used as the primary determinant of cannabis use. Participants will return approximately four weeks after treatment conclusion for evaluation of adverse events with medication discontinuation and sustained treatment effects.</detailed_description>
