	<brief_summary>The insertion of long-lasting intravenous device is done under local anesthesia. Currently, in the investigators hospital, no premedication is given to the patients. However, this procedure occurs in a particular emotional context related to the diagnosis of cancer or malign hemopathies. Therefore, administration of a sedative or anxiolytic drugs before the start of the procedure can be questionable. Hydroxyzine is the reference molecule for premedication because of its anxiolytic and anti-histaminic properties A new agent, pregabalin, shares also the same properties The main objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of pregabalin and hydroxyzine on the anxiety score as a premedication during the insertion of long-lasting intravenous device under local anesthesia.</brief_summary>
