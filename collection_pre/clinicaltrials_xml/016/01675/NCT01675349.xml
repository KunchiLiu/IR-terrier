	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the biologic activity of a Chenopodium album allergen extract in histamine equivalent prick (HEP) units, in order to be used as in-house reference preparation (IHRP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Standardization of Chenopodium Album Allergen Extract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, unblinded and non-randomized biological assay. The study design is a slight modification of the recommendations proposed by the Nordic Guidelines. Four concentrations of Chenopodium album allergen extract, together with a positive and negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar surface of the forearm.</detailed_description>

Subject can be male or female of any race and ethnic group. Age &gt; and =18 years and &lt; and =60 years at the study inclusion day. Positive skin prick test with a standardized commercially available preparation of chenopodium album allergen extract. A positive test for specific IgE to chenopodium album (CAPRAST major or equal to 2). Allergic symptoms during the pollen season of Chenopodium album. Medical history positive allergy inhalation (rhinitis and /or rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma) from Chenopodium album. Immunotherapy in the past 5 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with the allergen to be tested. Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions (e.g., antihistamines). Treatment with any of the following medications: tricyclic or tetracyclic o IMAOs antidepressants,bblockers or chronic use of corticosteroids or oral or use of corticoids both via oral or parenteral, in repeated patterns and intermittent (&gt; 10 mg/d√≠a de prednisone or equivalent). Women who are pregnant or period of breastfeeding and women with a pregnancy test positive during the visit 2, prior to the prick test. Dermographism affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit. Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit. Urticaria affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit. Diseases of the immune system relevant clinically, both autoimmune and immunodeficiencies. Serious diseases not controlled that may increase the risk for the safety of the subjects involved in this study, including, but not limited to the following: heart failure, uncontrolled or severe respiratory diseases, endocrine diseases, clinically relevant kidney or liver diseases or hematological diseases. Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days (or 5 times the biological halflife of the research of the study product, whichever is longer) prior to the inclusion of the subject in this clinical trial.
