	<brief_title>Dose Defining Study for the Administration of Vitamin K2 Supplements in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the past few years evidence is emerging for a role of Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) as one of the most powerful inhibitors of vascular calcification (Shurgers LJ et al. Thromb Haemost 2008; 100: 593-603). MGP is a Vitamin K dependent protein. This means that he presence of Vitamin K2 is required to promote the gamma-carboxylation process turning MGP in its carboxylated and active form. Recent data show that dp-uc MGP correlates well with Vitamin K status (Cranenburg CM et al. Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2010; 104/4: 811-822). It is widely recognized that patients with renal insufficiency treated with hemodialysis are prone to accelerated vascular calcification resulting in excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Goodman WG et al. N Engl J Med 2000; 342: 1478-1483). Consequently, the administration of Vitamin K2 supplements may protect hemodialysis patients against accelerated vascular calcification by enhancing the gamma-carboxylation process of MGP. However, the optimal dose of Vitamin K2 required to achieve these results remains to be defined</detailed_description>
