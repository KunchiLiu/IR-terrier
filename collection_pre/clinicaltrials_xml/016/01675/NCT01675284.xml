	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Reactogenicity, and Humoral Immune Responses to an Inactivated H5N1 Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1997, avian H5N1 influenza in Southeast Asia has caused several human infections and has a high mortality rate. Experts warn that the next influenza pandemic is imminent and could be severe and prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and worldwide distribution of specific pandemic influenza candidate vaccines. An H5N1 influenza vaccine was successfully produced from whole virus grown in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells. These purified inactivated vaccine antigens were safe and could induce immune responses in animal studies. Moreover, when formulated in aluminum phosphate a stronger response was generated even at low doses in animals (Chong et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2008). However, further investigations are necessary before their human safety and immunogenicity can be established. This human phase I clinical study, therefore, evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted H5N1 virion influenza vaccine.</detailed_description>
