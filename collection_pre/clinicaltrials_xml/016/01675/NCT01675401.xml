	<brief_summary>An increased body mass impairs vascular function (VF), an important characteristic of subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes and a risk marker for cardiovascular diseases. However, a wide variety of in vivo VF markers exists each measuring different aspects of VF. Each of these markers addresses a different aspect of the vasculature. Studies comparing under standardized conditions the differences and relationships of the many different VF measurements in lean and abdominally overweight / obese subjects are missing. Also, there is a great need to know which of these markers are sensitive to dietary challenges. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct an extensive study on dietary effects and interrelationships of a broad spectrum of VF measurements and plasma biomarkers in lean and overweight / obese subjects. Focus will be on FMD, a well accepted biomarker for cardiovascular disease. The investigators propose to examine, in a two-way parallel-randomized human intervention study, the effects of weight-loss in abdominally overweight / obese men on VF markers and plasma biomarkers related to low-grade inflammation and vascular activity during the fasting and both the postprandial and hyperinsulinemic state. Furthermore, differences - and relations between - VF measurements and plasma biomarkers will be compared cross-sectionally between lean and abdominally overweight / obese male subjects.</brief_summary>
