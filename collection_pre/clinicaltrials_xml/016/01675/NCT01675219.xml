	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer (BC), the second most common urological malignancy, is an important public health issue. One of the main challenges in the treatment of bladder cancer if the prevention of recurrences of non-invasive tumors, which is also associated with significant costs. The current study will investigate optimal treatment of patients with bladder cancer with high risk of tumor recurrence but low risk of progression. The main interest is comparison of photodynamic (PDD) bladder tumor resection (TUR-BR)to traditional TUR-BT. Also the efficacy of adjuvant optimized mitomycin-C is compared to patients with no adjuvant treatment.</brief_summary>
