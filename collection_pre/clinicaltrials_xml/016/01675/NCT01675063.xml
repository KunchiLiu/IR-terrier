	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this collaborative study is to advance the novel "pulse contour analysis" to the point at which it can be incorporated into a real-time device. The specific objective is to establish an auto-calibration algorithm that conveniently yields cardiac output (CO) in units of liters-per-minute. To achieve this objective, the waveforms for analysis and reference pulmonary artery catheter CO measurements will be recorded from critically ill patients and then analyzed off-line at Retia Medical. Successful completion of this study may ultimately help lead to improved outcomes of critically ill patients.</brief_summary>
