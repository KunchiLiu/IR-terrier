	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between increased bone metabolism in the 3 phase bone scintigraphy (TPBS) and decreased pressure pain thresholds in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the upper limb and a non-CRPS-group. The investigators assume that there will be a significant correlation between the investigated values in the CRPS-group whereas the non-CRPS-group shows no significant correlation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pressure pain of the distal hand joints is a predominant symptom of CRPS. But so far, the diagnostic value of pressure pain in the diagnosis of CRPS has not been investigated. We compared the pressure pain thresholds of the carpus, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints to a region of interest-based (ROI) analysis of a TBPS in patients with CRPS and patients with limb pain of other origin (non-CRPS-group).Additionally, the PPTs were established for a healthy control group to get reference data.</detailed_description>
