	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine the biologic causes of inflammation in patients with Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and related conditions. While patients will be treated according to decisions with their treating physician, this study will collect data and samples from patients prospectively to gain a better understanding of the disease. We are seeking to understand why some patients respond to medications, while others do not. We also seek to understand what happens biologically, preceding relapses. Gathering these data and samples will allow researchers to identify new ways of diagnosing and treating these diseases. Data and samples will be shared with researchers around the world to support collaborative efforts to treat these conditions.</brief_summary>
