	<brief_title>Confusion in the Elderly After Colon Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive changes in the elderly are common after surgery. It is not known if minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery can prevent these changes. A study will be conducted on patients scheduled to have abdominal surgery. The patients will have cognitive evaluations before and after surgery. A small amount of blood, about 2 tablespoons, will be collected no more than 5 times in 6 months. The results will be analyzed to determine if there are changes between those having open surgery versus patients having laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery, and if these changes coincide with cognitive changes.</detailed_description>
