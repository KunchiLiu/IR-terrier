	<brief_title>Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Staging Using Ultrasound Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) is a procedure that is performed via flexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation for visualization of lymph nodes in the chest and biopsy under real-time guidance for the staging of lung cancer or evaluation of enlarged lymph nodes. In addition, lung lesions or masses can be visualized and biopsied in the same sitting. The use of EBUS has enhanced the safety and diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy. Aim: The data of patients with suspected lung cancer or undiagnosed lymph node enlargement in whom bronchoscopy with EBUS guidance is clinically indicated will be collected prospectively. Results from EBUS are considered positive if a specific diagnosis is obtained ( eg malignancy) or if lymphocytes are present in the lymph node biopsy, indicating accurate sampling of lymph node. In patients with non-diagnostic EBUS, the results from other procedures will be compared for analysis.</detailed_description>
