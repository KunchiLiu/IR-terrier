	<brief_summary>The investigators are asking subjects to take part in a research study of soft tissue (gums) and bone (jawbone) healing around dental implants following tooth extraction. The investigators want to compare how the gums and the bone changes shape with healing in two different scenarios: 1. When the implant is placed at the same time the tooth is extracted. 2. When the tooth is extracted and then left to heal for a period of 4 to 8 weeks before the implant is placed. Previous studies have shown that both methods work and can give good results. In fact the two methods are used routinely as part of standard care but it is not known if the two procedures are equally good since they have never been compared in one same research study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The patient is 18 years or older. 2. Ability to understand and provide informed consent before starting the study. 3. Ability and willingness to comply with all study requirements. 4. The patient, if of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test. 5. Adequate oral hygiene to allow for implant therapy consistent with standards of care. 6. Adequate bone volume to accommodate the planned endosseous dental implant placement following immediate placement protocols utilizing Straumann Bone Level implants RC 4.1mm or Bone Level Implant NC 3.3 mm at 8, 10, 12 or 14 mm in length. 7. One or more teeth in either the maxilla or mandible anterior or premolar areas requiring extraction leading to a singletooth gap requiring implant placement as determined by the patient's dental provider. 8. Following extraction, surgical site anatomy presents conditions allowing immediate implant placement. 9. Primary stability of implant consistent with standards of care is achieved at the time of placement. 1. Patient reports current smoking habit with moderate or heavy smoking (more than 10 cigarettes per day) or tobacco chewing use. 2. History of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 5 years. 3. Severe bruxism or clenching habits. 4. Patient has significant untreated periodontal disease (grade III or IV), caries, or clinical or radiographic signs of infection within two adjacent tooth positions of implant area. 5. History of HIV infection, Hepatitis B or C. 6. Patients with a history of systemic disease that precludes standard dental implant therapy or alters daily activities to a level consistent with ASA III classification (including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, metabolic, neurologic, pulmonary, endocrine, autoimmune, or psychiatric disorders). 7. Presence of local inflammation or mucosal diseases such as lichen planus 8. Patient history consistent with high risk for subacute bacterial endocarditis 9. Current hematological disorder or coumadin (or similar) therapy 10. Patient has a disease that affects bone metabolism, such as but not limited to osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, congenital connective tissue disorders (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta), or Paget's disease. 11. Patient is taking medications or having treatments known to have an effect on bone turnover, including: thiazide diuretics, calcitonin, systemic steroids, bisphosphonates, vitamin D (&gt;800 IU/day), estrogen or progesterone therapy. 12. Current steroid treatment: defined as any person who within the last two years has received for two weeks a dose equivalent to 20 mg hydrocortisone 13. Patient currently undergoing chemotherapy 14. Patient history of radiation treatment to the head or neck 15. Physical or mental handicaps that would interfere with patient's ability to exercise good oral hygiene on a regular basis 16. Use of any investigational drug or device within the 30 day period immediately prior to implant surgery 17. Patient is pregnant 18. Extraction sites having anatomic conditions that preclude immediate implant placement.</criteria>
