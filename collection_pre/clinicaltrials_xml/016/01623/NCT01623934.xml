	<brief_summary>This study includes 2 phases. During phase 1, pregnant women are followed over the course of pregnancy. The phase 2 is a follow-up of the mother-child dyad at 3 and 5 year after delivery. The purpose of this phase 1 is to : - assess the contribution and interactions of adipokines in the development of insulin resistance during pregnancy and gestational diabetes; - assess levels of maternal adipokines as determinants of development and fetal growth; - determine the genetic variations that influence levels of adipokines and glucose regulation during pregnancy and in newborns. The purpose of this phase 2 is to: - identify DNA methylation variations at birth that are predictive of childhood overweight/obesity. - identify maternal characteristics associated with DNA methylation variations predictive of childhood overweight/obesity. - establish whether the loci predictive of childhood overweight/obesity at birth are still differentially methylated at 5 years of age (samples collected at 5 years of age). - identify DNA methylation variations at birth that are predictive of childhood neurodevelopment problems at 3 and 5 years of age.</brief_summary>
