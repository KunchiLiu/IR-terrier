	<brief_title>Studying Genes Associated With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Young Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct a preliminary investigation of the effects of loci strongly and consistently associated in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and validation studies of childhood/adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), autoimmune diseases, and atopic diseases on the risk of NHL (lymphoblastic and Burkitt lymphomas) in children and adolescents. OUTLINE: DNA samples are analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism and genotyped by fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based allelic discrimination (Taqman) assays using the ABI Prism 7900HT reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR system.</detailed_description>
