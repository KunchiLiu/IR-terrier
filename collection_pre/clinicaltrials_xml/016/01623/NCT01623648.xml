	<brief_title>High Protein Breakfast on Appetite, Postprandial Glycemia and Weight Loss in T2D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently we have shown that compared to low carbohydrate diet, an isocaloric diet with addition of high calorie and protein breakfast promoted sustained weight loss and prevented weight regain by reducing diet-induced compensatory changes in hunger, cravings and ghrelin suppression. However the effect of isocaloric and isoproteic breakfast with different source of proteins, (whey vs other proteins or vs low protein in breakfast) on weight loss, appetite and on glycemic fluctuations after breakfast lunch and dinner was not explored in obese diabetic individuals. To search whether compared to proteins like tuna, eggs and soy, the intake of whey protein in the breakfast will lead to reduced hunger and overall postprandial glycemia and will enhance weight loss in obese diabetic individuals</detailed_description>
