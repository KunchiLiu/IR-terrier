	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well trebananib works in treating patients with advanced angiosarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Trebananib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trebananib in Treating Patients With Advanced Angiosarcoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), defined as complete response (CR) +partial response (PR), in patients with advanced, unresectable angiosarcoma treated with trebananib (AMG 386). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced, unresectable angiosarcoma treated with AMG 386. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To correlate ORR, PFS, and OS with: Baseline and post-treatment changes in expression of angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) and TEK tyrosine kinase, endothelial (Tie2) by immunohistochemistry (IHC); Serum levels of angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and Ang2; Baseline and post-treatment changes in phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase status of TIE2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase Inhibitor (MEK) in tumor tissue; Mutational status of VEGFR-2 and amplification of v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (MYC)/fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4). OUTLINE: Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6 months for 18 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed angiosarcoma that is unresectable Patients must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST) 1.1, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 2 cm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 1 cm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam Patients must have had =&lt;

1,000 mg in a 24hour urine sample Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with AMG 386; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study Female of childbearing potential is defined as the following: A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) Generally wellcontrolled blood pressure with systolic blood pressure =&lt; 150 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure =&lt; 90 mm Hg (Note: The use of antihypertensive medications to control hypertension is permitted) Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document No known history of brain metastases History of clinically significant bleeding within 6 months of enrollment/randomization No unresolved toxicities from prior systemic therapy that are Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 &gt;= grade 2 in severity except alopecia Currently or previously treated with AMG 386, or other molecules that inhibit the angiopoietins or Tie2 receptor Clinically significant cardiovascular disease within 12 months prior to enrollment/randomization, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, grade 2 or greater (CTCAE version 4.0) peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias not controlled by outpatient medication or placement of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent Major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment or still recovering from prior surgery Treatment within 30 days prior to enrollment with strong immune modulators including, but not limited to, systemic cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, rapamycin, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and targeted immune modulators such as abatacept (CTLA4 Ig),adalimumab, alefacept, anakinra, belatacept (LEA29Y), efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab, or rituximab Nonhealing wound Subject not consenting to the use of highly effective contraceptive precautions (e.g., double barrier method [i.e., condom plus diaphragm]) during the course of the study and for 6 months after administration of the last study medication History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to AMG 386 History of allergic reactions to bacteriallyproduced proteins Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Patients who have not yet completed at least 21 days (30 days for prior monoclonal antibody therapy) since ending other investigational device or drug trials, or who are currently receiving other investigational treatments Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Nonpregnant, nonnursing; Note: Women of child bearing potential must have a pregnancy test, serum based within 7 days prior to registration; this is because AMG 386 is an inhibitor of angiogenesis with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects Patients with a history of venous or arterial thromboembolism within 12 months prior to enrollment/randomization should be excluded</criteria>
