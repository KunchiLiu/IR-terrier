	<brief_summary>Along with the improvement of the accuracy of detection of HBV serological markers, the optimization of antiviral therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection becomes feasible. Currently, the recommendation of optimized treatment especially interferon therapy are mainly based on retrospective studies, it still lacks prospective evidence. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics benefits of 48 weeks optimized interferon therapy (switch to telbivudine or plus adefovir dipivoxil) for HBeAg positive CHB with inadequate response to 24 weeks interferon treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization of Antiviral Therapy of Chronic HBV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with inadequate response to interferon therapy at 24 weeks were enrolled in this study and accepted the optimized therapy (add on ADV or switch to LDT) for 48weeks. All these patients were followed for 48 weeks and the HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA level were observed. Safety and the economic effect of the two optimized therapy methods also were observed.</detailed_description>
