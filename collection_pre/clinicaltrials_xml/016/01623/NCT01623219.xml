	<brief_summary>The investigator proposes to examine treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for Veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan provided through telemedicine which connects patients to doctors in different locations using the internet. In this study, Veterans will receive prolonged exposure therapy (PE). This treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms. For this study 9 weekly 90 minute sessions will be given over a period of up to 3 months. The first 2 sessions of each treatment will involve education, rational and treatment preparation. Sessions 3-9 will consist of recounting the traumatic event out loud and repeatedly. The purpose of this study is to determine if this treatment is effective when given through telehealth. To this end, the investigators propose to enroll up to 20 individuals who will access the investigators services through the GA telehealth network who has hundreds of telehealth sites across the state of Georgia. Patients will go to these sites to access the investigators therapists using GA telehealth equipment. The investigators hypothesize that PE delivered remotely through telemedicine will work to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.</brief_summary>
