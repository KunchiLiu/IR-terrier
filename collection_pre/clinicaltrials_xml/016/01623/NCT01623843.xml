	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether surgical correction of hip impingement morphology via arthroscopic osteochondroplasty (shaving of bone) will provide improved clinical results (decreased pain and improved function) in adult patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) compared to arthroscopic lavage (washing out of painful inflammation debris) and treating obvious damage of the hip joint.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Femoroacetabular Impingement RandomiSed Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition of the hip where there is a mismatch of the ball and socket in the hip joint. This mismatch creates abnormal contact in the hip which can cause patients to experience hip pain. This can eventually lead to hip damage and osteoarthritis. Hip arthroscopy, a form of minimally invasive surgery has become a popular treatment option. The investigators are conducting a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether surgical correction of the impingement morphology via arthroscopic osteochondroplasty (shaving of bone) will provide improved clinical results (decreased pain and improved function) in adult FAI patients compared to arthroscopic lavage (washing out of painful inflammation debris) and treating obvious damage of the hip joint.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult men or women ages 18 to 50 years 2. Hip pain for greater than 6 months with no relief from nonoperative means (physiotherapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication, rest) 3. Documentation of failed physiotherapy, including core conditioning of the hip, back, and abdomen 4. CAM or Mixed Type FAI as diagnosed on xrays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) 5. Temporary relief from an intraarticular hip injection 6. Informed consent from participant 7. Ability to speak, understand and read in the language of the clinical site 1. Previous inclusion in a study involving FAI 2. Evidence of hip dysplasia (centre edge angle less than 20) 3. Presence of advanced hip osteoarthritis (Tonnis Grade 2 or 3) 4. Presence of other hip syndromes (concurrent nonFAI related pathology) 5. Previous trauma to the affected hip 6. Previous surgery on the affected hip or contralateral hip 7.

Significant medical comorbidities (requiring daily assistance for ADLs) 11. History of paediatric hip disease (LeggCalvePerthes; slipped capital femoral epiphysis) 12. Ongoing litigation or compensation claims secondary to hip problems 13. Any other reasons given to exclude the patient</criteria>
