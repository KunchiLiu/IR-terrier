	<brief_summary>A randomized, controlled trial will be conducted during which pregnant women will be randomized to receive the intervention - viewing a prenatal education video about how to breastfeed an infant - or the sham intervention - viewing a prenatal education video about maternal nutrition and physical activity during pregnancy. Participants will be interviewed via telephone at one, three, and six months post-partum to determine how they feed their infants at each of these time frames.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research assistants will screen potential candidates at the University of Virginia Health System and Virginia Commonwealth University Primary Care Center and approach potential participants during a standard clinic visit. The charts of the day's patients will be screened prior to approaching women to invite them to enroll in the study. Following administration of the enrollment questionnaire, the patient will be randomized to the intervention or sham intervention arm of the study. The research assistant will open the study packet with the corresponding study identification number containing the intervention assignment. The research assistant will then load the assigned video into the DVD player and ask the patient to view the video. The participants will be blinded to which video is the true intervention. Following delivery, research assistants will abstract the medical records of the woman and infant. Data regarding complications for both the mother and baby will be recorded and the length of stay for mother and baby as well as information about the way in which the baby was fed during the hospital stay. Participants will be administered a one-month follow-up questionnaire by telephone. Follow-up questionnaires will be administered by research staff that did not enroll the participant such that the research assistant administering the telephone questionnaire will be blinded to the patient's assigned intervention group. The three-month questionnaire will be administered by telephone in the same fashion as the one-month. The six-month questionnaire will be administered by telephone. This questionnaire will conclude the study. A current address will be obtained at this time, and a children's book will be mailed to the participant thanking her for completing the study. For subjects lost to follow-up, we will contact the baby's pediatrician to retrieve the information on the questionnaires.</detailed_description>
