	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of pH and fluoride concentration in liquid dentifrices in the control of dental caries in early childhood, in non-fluoridated area. This study also aims to assess the effect of the consistency of liquid dentifrices in the fluoride uptake in the plaque and the fluoride concentration in the toenails, to estimate the fluoride intake from these formulations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study was carried out with schoolchildren living in a non-fluoridated area, with (A) or without (I) active caries lesions, were randomly allocated into 3 groups according to the LD used over 12 months: Group 1 (n=39-A/38-I): 550µgF/g-pH4.5, Group 2 (n=33-A/35-I) 1100µgF/g-pH7.0, Group 3 (n=33-A/34-I): 550µgF/g-pH7.0.</detailed_description>
