	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Study in Patients Received Iron Chelating Agent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transfusion-associated iron overload induces systemic toxicity. Recently, deferasirox, a convenient long acting oral agent, has been introduced in clinical practice with promising efficacy. However, some patients experience drug-related toxicities and cannot tolerate it. To investigate effect of genetic variations on the toxicities and find optimal target population, we planned to analyze the genetic polymorphisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) subfamily, multi-drug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) among pediatric patients received deferasirox.</detailed_description>
