	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the noninferiority of BIP48 (48 kDa peginterferon alfa-2b) compared to Pegasys ® (40 kDa peginterferon alfa-2a) associated with ribavirin, in naive patients with chronic hepatitis C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BIP48 (Peginterferon Alfa 2b 48kDa) Compared With Pegasys® (Peginterferon 2a 40kDa) for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be an open, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase II - III trial. Patients (n = 740) will be randomized (1:1) to receive BIP48 (peginterferon alfa-2b 48kDa) or Pegasys ® (peginterferon alfa-2a 40kDa) 180 micrograms ,subcutaneously,once a week,associated with ribavirin at a dose 1000-1250 mg, orally, daily. For genotype 1 treatment time will be 48 to 72 weeks and for genotypes 2 and 3, 24 to 48 weeks. The study's population will be naive patients, of both sex, between 18 and 70 years old, with chronic hepatitis C (HCV), genotypes 1, 2 or 3, from 18 to 25 Brazilian research centers. Diagnostic criteria will be as followed: positive anti-HCV and qualitative PCR, liver biopsy showing any degree of fibrosis and at least mild inflammatory activity, performed in the last 24 months. The interruption Criteria will be: no partial virological response at 12 weeks and positive quantitative PCR at week 24.The primary outcome will be the rate of sustained virologic response and the secondary endpoints will be the quality of life during treatment, frequency of adverse events and cost-effectiveness. As a substudy, will be performed a comparative assessment in 24 patients, evaluating viral kinetics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated doses of both alfapeginterferons .</detailed_description>
