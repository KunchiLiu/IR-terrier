	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of the spot urinary proteinuria, random urine protein- creatinin ratio for prediction of significant proteinuria (â‰¥ 300 mg/24h) and magnitude of proteinuria in patients with in mild preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia. The cross-sectional longitudinal study design used, 209 patients with pre-diagnosed preeclampsia in which in our inpatients clinic included this study. Random urine samples were taken before the 24 hour urine collection for spot urine analysis for evaluated proteinuria and protein/creatinin ratio. 24 hour urine analysis was performed in all patients as the gold standard of the urine total proteinuria.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group 1 consisted of mild preeclampsia and gestational preeclamptic patients and group 2 consisted of severe preeclamptic patients. The predictive values of the spot urinary dipstick proteinuria and protein/creatinin ratio were determinant and the correlations of the diagnostic test of 24 hour total proteinuria were evaluated. The correlations of the severity of the disease and the tests of the proteinuria were evaluated.</detailed_description>
