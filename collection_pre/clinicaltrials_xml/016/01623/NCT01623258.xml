	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to define the rate of upstaging of colon carcinoma lymph node metastasis with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the rate of lymph node metastasis between conventional histopathological processing of lymph nodes and SLN mapping with detailed pathologic examination using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients undergoing resection of colon carcinoma.</brief_summary>
