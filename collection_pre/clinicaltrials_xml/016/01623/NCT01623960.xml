	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Adult Patients With Severe Haemophilia in Turkey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder affecting one in 10000 male births worldwide. People with severe haemophilia usually suffer from recurrent life threatening bleeds (e.g. into the brain, digestive system or abdomen) and/or disabling degenerative disease of weight bearing joints (e.g. knees, elbows and ankles)resulting from haemorrhage into the joints. Daily activities of people with haemophilia has been shown to be dramatically hampered by the resultant joint damage. Evaluation of quality of life issues in people with severe haemophilia would help to create awareness of their problems and limitations. This would also set up the scene for developing policies to improve the treatment options/facilities and social life of the patients. Current study aims to assess the quality of life of adult patients with severe haemophilia in a developing country (Turkey) by using a validated Quality of Life Questionnaire (Turkish version of Haem-A-QoL).</detailed_description>
