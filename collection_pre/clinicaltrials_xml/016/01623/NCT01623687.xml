	<brief_summary>What is the intensity of F-PET uptake in healthy and osteo arthritic femur and acetabulum, compared to the uptake adjacent to four analyzed endoprosthetic components 1½ and 6 months after surgery?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Forming at Prosthetic Surfaces. Fingerprint2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical study of 26 patients, age 50-69 years, healthy unless osteoarthritis in one hip, randomized in four groups plus a reference group of same 26 patient´s contralateral healthy hip. Intervention will be surgery with a total hip arthroplasty. The studied endoprosthetic components are: Cemented Lubinus SP II stem with a ceramic 32 mm head, a cemented Lubinus cross linked cup (Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany). Palacose cement with gentamycin, applied with 3:rd generation cementation technique will be used for those cemented implants. Uncemented HA-coated Corail stem with a ceramic 32 mm head (DePuy, Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA), a fibrous metal Regenerex RingLoc cup (Biomet, Warsaw, Il, USA) All cups will have cross linked Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHWMP). Clinical score, radiography and PET uptake of Fluoride tracer (SUV) adjacent to the prosthetic surfaces will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
