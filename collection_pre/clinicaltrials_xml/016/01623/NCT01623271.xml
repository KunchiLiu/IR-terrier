	<brief_title>Treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome With Once Daily Gastric-Retentive Gabapentin (Gralise)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research is being conducted to see if the drug Gralise can help people with Complex Regional Pain Syndrom Type I (CRPS I) without causing too many side effects. CRPS I is one of the most common conditions of neuropathic pain (pain that results from damage to nerves in the peripheral nervous system). Gralise is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat postherpetic neuralgia (a complication of the disease Shingles, which is caused by the chickenpox virus), but is not approved to treat CRPS I.</detailed_description>
