	<brief_summary>Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations show a poor prognosis. Gemcitabine combined with cisplatin chemotherapy is an effective treatment measures for EGFR mutation-negative NSCLC patients, but the prognosis remains poor. Chemotherapy combined with targeted monoclonal antibody treatment may be better treatment options in these patients. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Bevacizumab blocks the ability of tumors to grow new blood vessels and spread. It is not yet known whether cisplatin and gemcitabine is more effective when given alone or with bevacizumab. This randomized trial studies how well giving cisplatin and gemcitabine alone or in combination with Bevacizumab (Avastin) works in treating patients with stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC without EGFR mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin and Gemcitabine With or Without Bevacizumab in EGFR Wild-type Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. The majority of lung cancer is nonsquamous NSCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) is a effective first-line treatment for EGFR mutations non-squamous NSCLC treatment. But those patients without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations show a poorer prognosis. Gemcitabine combined with cisplatin chemotherapy is an effective treatment measures for EGFR mutation-negative NSCLC patients, but the prognosis remains poor. Chemotherapy combined with targeted monoclonal antibody treatment may be better treatment options in these patients. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Bevacizumab blocks the ability of tumors to grow new blood vessels and spread. This randomized trial studies how well giving cisplatin and gemcitabine alone or in combination with Bevacizumab (Avastin) works in treating patients with stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC without EGFR mutations. Accordingly, we have come to a scientific hypothesis that cisplatin and gemcitabine combination with Bevacizumab might be a better treatment strategy for stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type. It can improve the PFS of stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type. The primary endpoint is disease-free time to progression (PFS). The secondary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety and quality of life (QOL). Through this study lay the foundation for further exploration of the non-squamous NSCLC first-line treatment in patients with EGFR wild-type strategy, and guide the rational application of bevacizumab.</detailed_description>
