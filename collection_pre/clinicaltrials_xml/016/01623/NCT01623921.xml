	<brief_summary>Background: Lung contusion affects 17%-25% of adult blunt trauma patients, and is the leading cause of death from blunt thoracic injury. Statins are lipid-lowering drugs with recently suggested anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key enzyme in the production of prostaglandins (PG), and evidence suggests that COX-2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Aims: The current study aims at evaluating the beneficial effects of statins and COX-2 receptor inhibitors on ALI elicited by blunt trauma to the chest. Methods: After approval by the institutional ethics and a scientific committee, and obtaining informed consent , patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) due to blunt trauma with a diagnosis of lung contusion will be enrolled in the study.The effects of statins and COX 2 inhibitors on ALI will be assessed by recording clinical parameters and measuring inflammatory mediators levels in the serum and in the bronchoalveolar space. Expected results: The investigators expect to find that the proposed treatment will be effective in reducing ALI burden. The investigators also suppose that using a combination of those drugs will synergistically potentiate their effect on ALI.</brief_summary>
