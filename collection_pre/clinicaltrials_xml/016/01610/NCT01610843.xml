	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to collect information about the clinical course and characteristics of sarcoidosis patients around the world through web-based surveys. Recruitment is directed at and driven by patients in the sarcoidosis community. This will allow the the investigators to study sarcoidosis patients across all demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic boundaries, not just patients seen at large research centers. The investigators believe this study can give investigators a broader and less biased view of sarcoidosis. The investigators would also like to collect genetic samples on this population to assess genetic variance in different phenotypes. The information for the study would be provided through a web based survey system that can be accessed by patients or physicians of patients from any computer with Internet access. This system would collect clinical information in sufficient detail so that the phenotype of individual patients can be evaluated. Upon agreeing to participate in further research studies through the website, subjects will also have the opportunity to provide a DNA sample.</brief_summary>
