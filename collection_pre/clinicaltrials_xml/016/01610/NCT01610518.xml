	<brief_summary>The ability of oat β-glucan to lower postprandial glycemic responses has been attributed to the viscosity of the solution in which the fibre is solubilized. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effect of β-glucan solutions on glycemic response when concentration, and thus viscosity, is varied by changing the solution volume but not the β-glucan dose. Therefore, the investigators will test the effects of altering β-glucan solution viscosity by altering solution volume at a fixed amount of β-glucan fibre.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Glycemic Response Elicited by Beta-glucans of Different Physical Properties and Form</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability of β-glucan to lower postprandial glycemic responses has been attributed to the viscosity of the solution in which the fibre is solubilized. It has been demonstrated that the viscosity of a β-glucan solution increases with the molecular weight (MW) of β-glucan polymers, as well as the dose or concentration (C) of those polymers in solution. Numerous studies have shown that glycemic response-lowering is strengthened when the C of a β-glucan solution of fixed liquid volume is increased by increasing β-glucan dose. However, the C of a β-glucan solution depends on not only the amount of fibre present but also on the solution volume. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effect of β-glucan solutions on glycemic response when C, and thus viscosity, is varied by changing the solution volume but not the β-glucan dose. Therefore, the investigators will test the effects of altering β-glucan solution viscosity by altering solution volume at a fixed amount of β-glucan fibre. Knowing how to incorporate β-glucan into solution so that its physiological benefits are preserved will assist in the development of β-glucan-containing functional foods.</detailed_description>
