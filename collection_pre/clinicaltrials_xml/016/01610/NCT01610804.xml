	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine changes in choroidal thickness in patients with Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) during the first 3 months after initial diagnosis via Enhanced-Depth-Imaging-Spectral-Domain-Optical-Coherence-Tomography (EDI-OCT). Study hypothesis: Since exudative changes in the choroid seem to constitute the primary pathology of CSCR, changes in choroidal thickness compared to healthy eyes should be present and be visible using EDI-OCT.</brief_summary>
