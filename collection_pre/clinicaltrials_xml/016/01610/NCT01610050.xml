	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of LFA102 in Japanese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study in Japanese patients with CRPC or advanced BC. LFA102 will be administered intravenously once every 4 weeks during the study. All patients will remain on treatment until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation (e.g. disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal) or study closure. This study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LFA102. Each cohort will enroll a minimum of 3 patients. A two-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model employing the escalation with overdose control principle will be used during the escalation phase for dose level selection and for determination of the MTD or RD.</detailed_description>
