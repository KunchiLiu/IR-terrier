	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of GSK Biologicals' vaccine GSK1437173A in the prevention of Herpes zoster (HZ) in autologous haematopoietic cell transplant recipients 18 years of age and older. To this end, the study will evaluate vaccine efficacy (VE) of the GSK1437173A vaccine, administered on a 2-dose schedule, compared to placebo in reducing the risk of developing HZ in this population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study entry (enrollment) occurs at the Prevaccination visit. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. A male or female aged 18 years or older at the time of study entry. Has undergone or will undergo autologous HCT within 5070 days prior to the first vaccination with the study vaccine/placebo, and there are no plans for additional HCTs. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. For this study population, nonchildbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. OR Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination with the study vaccine/placebo, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 12 months after completion of the vaccination series (i.e., until Month 13). Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use during the study period. However, the investigational use of a registered or nonregistered product to treat the subject's underlying disease for which the HCT was undertaken, or a complication of the underlying disease, is allowed. Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo. Planned administration during the study of a HZ vaccine other than the study vaccine. Occurrence of a varicella or HZ episode by clinical history within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine or study material and equipment. Prophylactic antiviral therapy with activity against Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) expected to last more than 6 months after transplantation. Administration and/or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between HCT and 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo. However, licensed nonreplicating vaccines may be administered up to 8 days prior to dose 1and/or 2, and/or at least 14 days after any dose of study vaccine/placebo. HIV infection by clinical history. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 13 (i.e., one year after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo).</criteria>
