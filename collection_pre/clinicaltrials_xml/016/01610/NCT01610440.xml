	<brief_summary>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive genetic disease always progressed slowly，tends to leading proximal skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness of limbs, as well as impaired respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle. To a large extent, patients always lose motor function gradually and die for heart failure or severe infection at the end stage of DMD. At present, the treatment strategy relies on heteropathy accompanied with rehabilitation training. However, the therapeutic effect remains extremely limited. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have been evidenced to improve motor function, increase muscle strength and reduce abnormal levels of related enzymes, such as creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This study is aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSCs transplantation for DMD.</brief_summary>
