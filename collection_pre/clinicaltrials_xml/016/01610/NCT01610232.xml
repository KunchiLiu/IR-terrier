	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis is that the infrared-LED illumination during treadmill training can enhance physical performance in postmenopausal women. The basis for such a hypothesis is based on the fact that the light therapy during the intense metabolic stage caused by exercise may be more efficient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infrared-LED During Physical Training for Rehabilitation, Physical Performance and Body Aesthetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phototherapy improves cellular activation via absorption of photons by chromophores present in the protein components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain - mainly NADH dehydrogenases and cytochrome C oxidase, which leads to increased electron transport, production of ATP, and tissue regeneration (skin, muscle, bone, and nerves). Moreover, phototherapy stimulates the anti-inflammatory effect with analgesia and vasodilatation. Regarding body aesthetics, phototherapy increases microcirculation, lymphatic drainage, as well as collagen synthesis for the treatment of cellulite. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the effects of a new clinical procedure: infrared radiation originated from LEDs associated with treadmill training in postmenopausal women. LED arrays were developed for an irradiation of a large area, such as hip and quadriceps muscles, main actuators during stance and swing phases. These body parts are furthermore areas where there is incidence of osteoporosis, mainly at the femur, localized fat deposits, and cellulite. Infrared radiation (850 nm) was selected because this spectral range shows better skin penetration compared to red interval.</detailed_description>
