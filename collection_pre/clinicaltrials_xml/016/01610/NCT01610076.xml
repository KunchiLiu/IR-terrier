	<brief_title>Code Status Video in the Intensive Care Unit: Video Assisted Patient Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After randomization subjects will be divided into control group and intervention group that will receive video tutorial. All subjects will have unlimited access to printed brochures about Advance Directives available at our institution. Use of those materials will be left to their discretion of patients, surrogates and health care professionals involved in patients care. This study was conducted in the medical ICU of tertiary medical center. Educational video tutorial to cardiovascular resuscitation, defibrillation, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Video presents illustrations of resuscitation performed on actors. It informs about the risk, benefits and statistical outcomes of Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Immediately after admission to ICU patients or their health care surrogates were asked to participate in the study. The time between admission and enrollment varied depending on patient's needs and feasibility of conducting research. Upon enrollment subjects were stratified into two groups. One was composed of patients participating in education and testing and another composed of health care surrogates participating on patient's behalf. Those groups were further divided to intervention group that received video education and control group. Stratified randomization occurred according to computer generated list which will be followed for duration of the study. Patients in all four groups had access to printed brochures about Advance Directives. Those pamphlets were available at the admission desk and at the nursing stations. All participants were tested from their knowledge of the code status and related terminology. Subjects randomized to the control group were tested immediately after obtaining consent. Subject from intervention group were tested immediately after video education. Test was administered by the investigator in the format of interview. Completion of the questionnaire took &lt;10 minutes. Questionnaire contained 17 testing questions. Questionnaire was validated and piloted prior to actual trial. Satisfaction from education as well as level of discomfort caused by participation in the study were assessed with numeric scales. Following the interview all participants were asked if they would like to discuss Code Status preferences with physician taking care of them. If so, response were noted and appropriate services will be notified immediately. If patients were unable to consent to the study or participate in video education and testing, their health care surrogates were allowed to participate on behalf of the patient. Person giving the consent participated as a subject. Participation of health care proxy were tracked in the collected data. Patient's medical record number was used as personalized code for all the subjects including health care surrogates.</detailed_description>
