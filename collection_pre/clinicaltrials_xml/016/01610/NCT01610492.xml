	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, open label, experimental medicine study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and mechanism of action of belimumab in subjects with antiphospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) autoantibody positive idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy (IMGN), and to profile the relationship between biomarkers, autoantibody status and clinical response. 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) belimumab intravenous (IV) will be administered at weeks 0, 2, and then every 4 weeks, over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with anti-PLA2R antibody positive IMGN followed by a further long term treatment period until subjects reach remission of proteinuria, up to a maximum of 2 years total treatment. All subjects will receive background supportive therapy throughout the study. The dosing frequency will be adjusted to every 2 weeks if the subject's proteinuria as assessed by urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) is greater than 1000 milligrams per millimole (mg/mmol) [greater than 10 grams(g)/24 hours (h)], to compensate for loss of belimumab in the urine. Effects on mechanistic markers will be measured by the level of proteinuria, levels of anti-PLA2R antibodies, and various other measures of kidney function. These will be compared to historical data. The pharmacokinetics of belimumab will be measured to confirm dosing in heavily proteinuric subjects. Pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, biomarkers and Quality of Life(QoL) in IMGN subjects will also be investigated. Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AE), clinical laboratory evaluations, and vital signs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &amp; Gender: Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Histological diagnosis: Have clinical diagnosis of IMGN, as verified by biopsy (either by light microscope with immunofluorescence, or by electron microscope) in the last 7 years with nonactive disease &gt;3 years (nonactive defined as subject not on immunosuppressants and proteinuria &lt;2g per 24h) (biopsy results and slides should be available for independent evaluation). Autoantibody: Have positive antiPLA2R autoantibody test results at screening. Proteinuria: Have clinically active disease (nephrotic range proteinuria) for at least 3 months prior to screening and no improvement (less than 30% reduction), despite supportive therapy (which should include maximal tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, and may include statins, diuretics, dietary salt restriction). During screening proteinuria must be greater than 400mg/mmol by PCR (or greater than 4.0g per 24h) as measured from a 24 h urine collection and/or spot urine sample (early morning where possible) on 2 occasions at least 7 days apart. Female Subjects: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or nursing and at least one of the following conditions apply: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 MilliInternational Units per millilitre(MlU/mL) and estradiol less than 40 picograms per milliliter (less than 147 picomoles per liter) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 16 weeks after the last dose NonIdiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN) or other condition affecting the kidney: If the diagnosis of MGN is secondary to other conditions, or the subject has renal impairment from a condition that is not MGN.

Blood Pressure: Uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure (BP) greater than 150/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) (treatment target greater than and equal to 140/80) as assessed by either : Blood pressures measured 3 times on each of at least 2 clinic visits during screening, after the patient has sat quietly for at least 5 minutes, with greater than 50% of measurements being greater than 150/90 or average daytime blood pressure on a 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor.
