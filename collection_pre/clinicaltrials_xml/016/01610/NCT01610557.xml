	<brief_summary>Background: - Diabetic macular edema is a common eye complication of diabetes. It causes the blood vessels in the retina at the back of the eye to leak, causing swelling. The macula is the center part of the retina that is important for seeing fine details and for tasks such as reading, driving, or sewing. Swelling of the macula leads to vision loss and possible blindness. Inflammation may play a role in diabetic macular edema. It is also possible that there is a problem with the blood vessels and the blood supply to cells of the retina. - A chemical in the body called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important in the formation of blood vessels in the body. Lowering VEGF levels may help treat diabetic macular edema by reducing abnormal leaking blood vessels in the eye. Drugs that can lower or block VEGF include ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Both drugs have been shown to help treat diabetic macular edema. Researchers want to see if one of the drugs works better than the other. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections for diabetic macular edema. Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have diabetic macular edema in at least one eye. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full eye exam will be performed. Blood and urine samples will be collected. - One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive treatment. If both eyes are affected, both eyes may be enrolled in the study and receive different drug treatments. - The main part of the study will last for 9 months. At each study visit, participants will have physical exams and eye exams. They will answer questions about their health and any side effects from the drugs. - Participants will be assigned to one of four groups. Two groups will have two series of ranibizumab and one series of bevacizumab shots. The other two groups will have two series of bevacizumab and one series of ranibizumab shots. A series is three eye injections of the same drug every 4 weeks. The injections will be given at these study visits. The series order will vary for the different groups. - After 9 months, participants will continue to have additional study visits. If the treatment seems to be successful, the study doctor may increase the time between visits. Study injections may be given as needed every 4 weeks for up to 3 years. - Participants may have laser treatments in a study eye if needed. After being in the study for 1 year, they may also have steroid injections or other treatments as directed for the macular edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab and Bevacizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of visual impairment. A frequent manifestation of DR is diabetic macular edema (DME) for which laser photocoagulation has been the only proven treatment for the last several decades. Studies have shown that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab have been efficacious in treating patients with DME. However, there has been no direct comparison of these agents to determine whether one treatment is more effective than the other. The objective of this study is to compare the treatment efficacy of ranibizumab versus bevacizumab in eyes with DME. Study Population: Sixty (60) participants with macular edema secondary to diabetes and any stage of DR (other than those requiring scatter laser photocoagulation for proliferative DR) in one or both eyes will be enrolled in this randomized study. Design: In this Phase II, multi-center, comparative, double-masked study, eyes will be randomly assigned to receive ranibizumab or bevacizumab. During the initial phase of the study participants will participate in a three-period, 36-week, crossover study in which study eyes will be assigned to one of four treatment groups (i.e., treatment sequences). The two drugs and three periods form a RRB/RBB/BBR/BRR pattern as follows: - Group 1 (RRB pattern) eyes will receive a series of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, then crossover to receive a series of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab at Weeks 24, 28 and 32. - Group 2 (RBB pattern) eyes will receive a series of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab at baseline and Weeks 4 and 8, then crossover to receive a series of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab at Weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32. - Group 3 (BBR pattern) eyes will receive a series of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, then crossover to receive a series of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab at Weeks 24, 28 and 32. - Group 4 (BRR pattern) eyes will receive a series of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab at baseline and Weeks 4 and 8, then crossover to receive a series of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab at Weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32. Participants for whom one eye is enrolled in the study will have this eye randomly assigned to one of the four groups above. Participants for whom both eyes are enrolled in the study will have the right eye randomly assigned to one of the four groups above; the left eye will be assigned to the group with the schedule inverse to that for the right eye. For example, if the right eye is randomly assigned to Group 1 (RRB pattern), the left eye will be automatically assigned to Group 3 (BBR pattern). Thus, at each treatment, the right eye for a participant enrolling both eyes in the study will always receive a different investigational product than the left eye. Following this crossover phase, eyes will be returned to the treatment (ranibizumab or bevacizumab) to which they were originally assigned and treated on an as-needed basis through a common termination date one year from enrollment of the last-enrolled participant at the National Eye Institute (NEI) and through Year 1 at the Bristol Eye Hospital (BEH). Both the treating investigators and participants will be masked to the group assignments. The primary outcome will be assessed at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and Year 1. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the mean change in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Changes in BCVA from baseline to four weeks following the end of each of the three periods (i.e., Weeks 12, 24 and 36) and at Year 1 will be used for the primary analysis. Secondary outcomes (assessed between the baseline and Week 12 visits, Weeks 12 and 24 visits and Weeks 24 and 36 visits and at Year 1) will include the mean changes in central macular thickness and central retinal volume by treatment group as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT); the slope of the changes in BCVA, central macular thickness and retinal volume; the proportion of eyes with visual improvement ≥ 10 letters; the proportion of eyes with visual improvement ≥ 15 letters; the proportion of eyes with ≥ 0.1 log unit loss or gain in logOCT; the proportion of eyes with ≥ 0.05 log unit loss or gain in logOCT; changes in fluid leakage in the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein angiography; and changes in macular structural improvement (i.e., resolution of cystic changes) as measured by OCT. The digital OCT images collected between the Baseline and Week 36 visits will be graded by a masked, external Reading Center. Other secondary outcomes will include the proportion of eyes meeting criteria for significant worsening, treatment success, or treatment failure, the frequency of re-injection among eyes in the treatment-as-needed phase of the study, and the proportion of eyes receiving focal/grid laser photocoagulation or other adjuvant treatment during the course of the study. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of adverse events. The number of eyes withdrawn from the investigational product due to vision loss or adverse events and the number of eyes deemed to have worsening disease will also contribute to the assessment of safety.</detailed_description>
