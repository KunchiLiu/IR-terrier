	<brief_title>Effects of Glucose-fructose Drinks During Training on Lactate Transport</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will enroll 24 healthy male volunteers. After baseline assessment of lactate transport and endurance performance, subjects will be randomized to either a 3-week intervention arm in which they will train with glucose-fructose intake during training, or to a control arm (water during training). After this 3-week intervention, lactate transport and endurance performance will be assessed again.</detailed_description>
