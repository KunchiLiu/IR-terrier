	<brief_title>A Study of the KineSpring System Versus High Tibial Osteotomy Surgery for Medial Compartment Knee Osteoarthritis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study will be to: - Demonstrate the non-inferiority of the KineSpring System compared to the standard surgical, high tibial osteotomy procedure in improving pain and function outcomes (as measured by the WOMAC pain and function subscales) at 24 months in patients with primarily uni-compartmental medial knee osteoarthritis. - Demonstrate that the KineSpring System is safe as measured by procedure and device-related complication rates through 24 months post-operatively</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects 25 to 80 years of age Documented diagnosis of knee OA Radiographic confirmation of mild to moderate medial compartment knee OA as demonstrated by a KellgrenLawrence grade of 1, 2 or 3 (scale 04) as assessed by the Investigator Has failed at least six months of conservative treatment with continued OA pain Knee flexion range ≥90≤150 degrees WOMAC pain score of at least 40 (scale 0100) at the baseline visit BMI&lt;35 or weight&lt;300 lbs Candidate for a high tibial osteotomy procedure Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this clinical investigation and from whom consent has been obtained Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand this clinical investigation, cooperate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return for all the required posttreatment followups. Exclusion Criteria (plus additional criteria not listed): Symptomatic OA with Kellgren Lawrence Grade 4 in the contralateral knee likely to necessitate surgical intervention within 12 months of enrollment Symptomatic OA in lateral or patellofemoral compartment of affected knee Tibialfemoral varus or valgus alignment&gt;10 degrees Flexion deformity&gt;10 degrees Hyperextension&gt;5 degrees Pathologic ligamentous instability (&gt;1 MCL injury or Lachman &gt;1) as assessed by the Investigator on physical examination Active infection, sepsis or osteomyelitis, history of infection in the target knee or distant foci of infections which may spread to the implant site Previous joint modifying surgery in the target knee are excluded within 12 months prior to planned study surgery date, such as ligament reconstruction or meniscus repair, cartilage transplantation, and microfracture. Arthroscopic surgeries for joint lavage, menisectomy, chondral debridement, and loose body removal are excluded within 3 months prior to planned study surgery date. Previous osteotomy or failed knee joint replacement in the target knee Known sensitivity to metal implants Rheumatoid arthritis, other forms of inflammatory joint disease or autoimmune disorder Paget's disease or metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation Moderate to severe osteoporosis or pathologic fractures as evidenced by radiolucency of the femoral or tibial cortex on xray Charcot's joint disease or other severe neurosensory deficits Immunologically suppressed or immunocompromised Any significant medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus requiring daily insulin therapy, advanced liver disease, advanced kidney disease, congestive cardiac failure, uncontrolled transient ischemic attack, cancer, radicular symptoms associated with lumbar spine pathology); significant psychiatric disorders or active alcohol/drug abuse (meeting standard diagnostic criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical manual for Mental Disorders (DSMIV); or other factor (e.g. planned relocation, uncooperative patient). Under litigation for or workers compensation for musculoskeletal injuries or disorders Is either pregnant or interested in becoming pregnant during the duration of the study Subjects who are currently involved in any investigational drug or device trial or have been enrolled in such trials within the last 3 months</criteria>
