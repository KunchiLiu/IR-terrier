	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of escalating doses INC280 when added to gefitinib in patients with lung cancer that are known to have dysregulation of the c-MET pathway and who have failed after benefiting on a prior treatment with either gefitinib or erlotinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of INC280 and Gefitinib in Patients With EGFR Mutated, c-MET-amplified NSCLC Who Have Progressed After EGFRi Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated INC280 and gefitinib(250mg) daily. Dose escalation for INC280 will be performed. Each cohort for the phase IB part will consist of 3 to 6 newly enrolled patients. A twice daily administration of INC280 may be investigated if deemed appropriate based on emerging results from ongoing clinical trials.</detailed_description>
