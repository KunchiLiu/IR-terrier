	<brief_summary>This study is to identify if a Novel Antiviral Drug could be used to treat babies with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) with central nervous system (CNS) disease. In this study the investigators will identify the best dose for young children as well as identify additional safety information about the Novel Antiviral Drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Dose-Determining Study of CMX001 In Infants With Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection Involving the Central Nervous System (CNS Disease)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the pharmacokinetics and safety of a Novel Antiviral Drug will be determined in babies with neonatal HSV CNS disease. The study will be conducted at 18 academic medical centers throughout the United States. Young infants presenting with virologic confirmation of neonatal HSV infection and evidence of CNS involvement will be eligible for study enrollment. Study Day 1 is defined as the day when dose 1 of the Novel Antiviral Drug study medication is administered.</detailed_description>
