	<brief_summary>This was a study of a genotyping tool that reported on how subjects responded to medications and could be used in a community psychiatry practice to improve medication choice for depression. After the DNA test, an interpretive report was provided to the subjects' physicians. The hypothesis of this pilot study was that it was feasible to use this pharmacogenomic algorithm in a new setting to treat depressed subjects..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Antidepressant Pharmacogenomic Algorithm in an Outpatient Clinical Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antidepressant medications are among the most widely prescribed medications. However, only 35% to 45% of depressed patients have a complete remission of their illness when initially treated with these medications. Consequently, the Mayo Clinic psychiatric pharmacogenomic team developed a pharmacogenomic algorithm designed to improve the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant medications by providing guidance in medication selection and appropriate dosing. This algorithm has been incorporated into a new genotyping interpretative report. The pharmacogenomic algorithm is based on genotyping both copies of four informative genes. These four genes are: 1) the Cytochrome (P450 2D6) gene; 2) the Cytochrome (P450 2C19) gene; 3) the Serotonin Transporter gene (SLC6A4); and 4) the Serotonin 2A receptor gene (5HTR2A). The trial took place at the Franciscan Skemp Healthcare System in La Crosse, Wisconsin over the course of 12 months.</detailed_description>
