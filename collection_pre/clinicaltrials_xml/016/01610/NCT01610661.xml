	<brief_title>Dietary Carbohydrate Type and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Indicators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this pilot study is to determine the relative comparability for an isocaloric exchange of (1) refined-carb for simple-carb and (2) refined-carb for unrefined-carb, on established and emerging CVD risk indicators. To achieve this goal, subjects with moderate dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol &gt; 100mg/dL) will consume diets enriched in 3 types of carbohydrate (simple-carb, refined-carb and unrefined-carb) according to a randomized, cross-over design.</detailed_description>
