	<detailed_description>This is an open non comparative safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study clinical trial. Healthy volunteers aged from 18 to 50 years old will be recruited and followed 42 days after treatment initiation as in the current World Health Organization malaria drug protocol efficacy assessment protocol.
