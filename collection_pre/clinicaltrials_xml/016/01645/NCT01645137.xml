	<brief_summary>The use of complementary and alternative medicine in neonatal ward has been steadily rising during the last decade. This integrated medicine approach has been shown to be helpful to improve neonatal health care. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) has been applied to premature infants to reduce the length of stay and to cope with clinical complications. Results from previous studies documented the positive association between OMT and shorter period of hospitalisation as well as improvement of clinical conditions. The aim of this nationwide multicenter study is to demonstrate the effect of OMT on length of stay (LOS) in premature infants across 3 neonatal intensive care units (NICU).</brief_summary>
