	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the changes measured by Somanetics Invos cerebral oximeter to the mean arterial pressure at brain level in patients having elective shoulder replacement surgery. The Somanetics Invos System measures and monitors the oxygen saturation (rS02) of blood in the brain tissues to help prevent brain injury or other complications. The investigators hypothesize that maintaining normocarbia and systemic mean arterial pressure at or above 70mmHg during general anesthesia in the beach chair position will decrease the number of cerebral deoxygenation events during the procedure.</brief_summary>
