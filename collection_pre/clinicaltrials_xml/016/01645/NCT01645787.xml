	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether 4-AP (Dalfampridine-ER, Ampyra) improves walking ability and endurance in adult patients with Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 3 compared to placebo and whether the duration of treatment affects outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short and Long Term Treatment With 4-AP in Ambulatory SMA Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetically determined neuromuscular disorder that results in muscle weakness and impaired functional mobility. Fatigue is a common symptom in SMA with a resultant impact on physical function and quality of life however the precise mechanisms are unknown. At present there is no treatment for SMA. There is evidence that 4-AP improves function in SMA animal models. In patients with multiple sclerosis, 4-AP was found to improve walking ability and diminish fatigue. The purpose of the study is to determine whether treatment with 4-AP is associated with an increase in walking speed and endurance compared to placebo and whether the duration of treatment affects outcome. The study comprises a short term treatment trial in which participants are treated for 2 weeks with 4-AP and placebo in random sequence followed by a long treatment trial of 6 weeks in which patients are also treated with placebo and 4 AP. The primary outcome measure of the clinical study will be the six minute walk test (6MWT), which has been documented to be a valid and sensitive instrument to identify fatigue among ambulatory SMA patients. We will also assess the effect of 4-AP on muscle and nerve electrical function via electromyography (EMG) during the short term trial. Results of this study may provide support for larger clinical trials.</detailed_description>
