	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized controlled study. The aim of this study is to 1. describe the stress patterns experienced during a CPR situation; 2. investigate whether the perceived stress was associated with CPR performance in terms of hands-on time and time to start CPR; 3. to investigate whether this task focusing strategy reduces perceived stress levels, and 4. whether this translates into better CPR performance. Based on findings that clear, directive leadership can enhance performance in cardiac resuscitation, we further 5) investigate if stress was associated with fewer leadership statements.</brief_summary>
