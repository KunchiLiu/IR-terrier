	<brief_summary>The importance of exercise for weight control is well documented; however if exercise results in an increase in food intake, the beneficial effect of exercise may not be seen. This study addresses a gap in the current literature and examines why some people eat more after exercise and why some people eat less and also examines whether these responses are consistent over time. Participants in this study will be asked to come to our center on 7 different occasions over a 3-4 month period. The first visit will be an assessment visit where body weight and body composition will be measured, questionnaires will be completed, and an exercise test will be performed. During the remaining 6 visits (3 pairs of sessions with visits in each pair separated by 48-96 hours) the procedures will be nearly identical. Upon arrival at our center, participants will consume a meal replacement, complete a series of questionnaires and then either rest or walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes (3 days will be resting and 3 will be exercising). One hour following the exercise/resting session, individuals will be given access to a buffet of food, unaware that their food intake will be monitored. All food will be weighed and measured before and after the eating period and the amount of food consumed after each pair of exercise and resting conditions will be compared to one another. It is hypothesized that the difference in food intake will be consistent across pairs of testing sessions. Findings from this study will help us to better understand the relationship between exercise and food intake and may ultimately lead to future studies that can address the clinically significant question of why some individuals gain weight and others lose weight when engaging in exercise training programs. Findings from this study may also help to develop exercise programs that maximize the beneficial effect of exercise on body weight.</brief_summary>
