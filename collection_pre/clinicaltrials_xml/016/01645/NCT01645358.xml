	<brief_summary>Lack of tolerance to the treatment, makes the interface choice for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) one of the key factor. To date the helmet is rarely used in Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure (AHRF), because of its large dead space, despite in hypoxic respiratory failure, it is largely employed as a "rotating" strategy when the facial mask is poorly tolerated. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare the clinical efficacy of a new helmet designed to specifically improve the performance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) versus a full face mask during an episode of AHRF.</brief_summary>
