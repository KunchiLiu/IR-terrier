	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of R406 in Healthy Volunteers When Given 100mg and 150 mg of Fostamatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An Open-label, Single-center, Randomized, 4-way Crossover Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of R406 in Healthy Volunteers when 100 and 150mg of Fostamatinib are Administered as the 13% Drug-loaded Tablet Versus the 38% Drug-loaded Tablet. Treatment sequences will be determined using two 2-2 crossover designs in sequence, 1 for treatments A and B, and 1 for treatments C and D. The order of the designs containing AB/BA and CD/DC within the overall design, as well as the order of treatments within each design, will be randomized. This gives a total of 8 possible treatment sequences as follows: ABCD, ABDC, BACD, BADC, CDAB, CDBA, DCAB, DCBA.</detailed_description>
