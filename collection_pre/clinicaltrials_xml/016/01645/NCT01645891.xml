	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Continuous Diffusion of Oxygen (CDO) therapy for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CDO in combination with standard moist wound therapy (MWT) on wound healing as compared to standard MWT alone.</brief_summary>
