	<brief_summary>Although gains have been made in achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDG), much is still needed in countries affected by high levels of HIV/AIDS. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is a cornerstone strategy in reducing infant mortality from HIV. The study will employ a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) with 26 health facilities randomized to two arms (intervention or control) to determine the effect of mobile phone technology on completion of key PMTCT milestones from antenatal to six weeks postpartum. The study will examine the acceptability, effectiveness, and cost of implementing a PMTCT-focused mHealth strategy among HIV-infected pregnant women, health workers, and male partners.</brief_summary>
