	<criteria>1. Ambulatory subjects with OA of the knee with symptoms for at least 6 months and pain on the majority of days in the last 30 days. Symptoms must include knee joint pain. 2. Male or female adults age &gt;40 years with a body mass index &lt;35 3. Radiographic evidence of at least one osteophyte in either knee on posteroanterior (PA) and lateral standing, flexed xray. 4. A KellegrenLawrence score of 23, or KL score of 1 accompanied by a clinically apparent effusion in the index knee. 5. A WOMAC pain score of &gt;8 on the index knee at screening visit. 1. A requirement for treatment with high potency opioids for pain relief. 2. Unwilling to abstain from NSAIDs and/or other analgesic medications except acetaminophen (i.e., COX2 inhibitors, tramadol) for 48 hours and acetaminophen for 24 hours prior to pain assessments during the study. Subjects taking low dose aspirin for cardiovascular health may remain on their stable dose throughout the study. 3. On an unstable dose of NSAIDs or analgesics for at least 1 months prior to screening visit 1. 4. Using a handicap assistance device (i.e., cane, walker) &gt;50% of the time. 5. Undergoing new physical therapy or participating in a weight loss or exercise program that has not been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening visit 1 and will not remain stable during their participation in the study. 6. Had a previous history of arthroscopic or open surgery to the index knee in the past 6 months or planned surgery during study follow up. 7. Had joint replacement surgery in the index knee. 8. Received corticosteroid, short acting hyaluronic acid, or other intraarticular injections of the index knee within 3 months of screening visit 1 and/or not willing to abstain from treatments for the duration of the study 9. A history in the past 510 years of reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis or fibromyalgia. 10. Clinical signs and symptoms of active knee infection or radiographic evidence of crystal disease other than chondrocalcinosis (i.e. gout). 11. A history of abnormal laboratory results &gt;2.5 x ULN indicative of any significant medical disease, which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subjects participation in the study 12. Any of the following abnormal laboratory results during screening: ALT and/or AST &gt;2.5x ULN Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL WBC &lt;3500 cells/mm3 Lymphocyte count &lt;1000 cells/mm3 Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN or calculated Glomerular filtration rate less than 50. Creatine phosphokinase level &gt; 2x ULN 13. A history of malignancy in the past ten years (&lt;10 years), with the exception of resected basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or resected cervical atypia or carcinoma in situ. 14. Significant hip pain, ipsilateral to the index knee that may interfere with assessments of index knee pain 15. A known or clinically suspected infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis C or B viruses 16. Participated within 3 months or will participate concurrently in another investigational drug or vaccine study 17. A history of drug or alcohol dependence or abuse in the past 3 years 18. A female with reproductive capability who is unwilling to use birth control for the duration of the study and/or intends to conceive within 12 months of dosing. 19. Ongoing use of hydroxychloroquine, or any antimalarial, or prior history of use within past 3 months or any prior history of history of allergy, hypersensitivity or toxicity to antimalarial use. 20. Ongoing use of a statin (HMG Co A reductase inhibitor), or use within past 3 months or any prior history of history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or toxicity to statin use. 21. Use of fibric acid derivative in past 3 months. 22. Other serious, nonmalignant, significant, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, could compromise subject safety, limit the subject's ability to complete the study, and/or compromise the objectives of the study.</criteria>
