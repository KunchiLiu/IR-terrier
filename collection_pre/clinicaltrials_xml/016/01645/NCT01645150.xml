	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effects of a 12-week resistance training program on cancer related fatigue in cancer patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. It is hypothesized that incidence and severity of cancer related fatigue can be reduced by exercise training in this population which leads to an improved treatment completion rate.</brief_summary>
