	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the neurological progression free survival with the use of an intrathecal chemotherapy with liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte®) in leptomeningeal metastasis of breast cancer (versus no intrathecal treatment).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interest of Intrathecal Chemotherapy With Liposomal Cytarabine (DepoCyte®) in Meningeal Metastasis of Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients eligible for the trial and having signed their consent to participate will be randomized to arm A or B. - Arm A: Standard systemic treatment without Depocyte® - Arm B: Standard systemic treatment with Depocyte® Patients randomized to arm B will receive an intrathecal injection of Depocyte® every 14 ± 2 days for a total of 5 cycles and then every 28 days until progression. The treatment should begin in the days following the randomization (maximum 10 days). The nature of the standard systemic treatment (chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted therapy) will be left to the discretion of the investigator according to the subtype of the breast cancer and according to the treatments already received. It will be determined prior to randomization. It can be amended at any time upon notice of the patient's referent oncologist. A focal radiotherapy on symptomatic sites can also be performed if necessary. Patients will have : - a clinical assessment within 3 days prior to the start of the study treatment, every 2 weeks for 2 months, then once a month until progression, and at the end of the study ; - a paraclinical assessment within 14 days prior to the start of the study treatment, every 2 months, and at the end of the study ; - and a biologic assessment within 7 days prior to the start of the study treatment, once a month until progression, and at the end of the study. They will likewise undergo a lumbar puncture prior to the start of treatment, once a month for patients in arm A, every 2 weeks for 2 months, then once a month until progression for patients in arm B and finally at the end of the study. They will also address questionnaires within 3 days prior to the start of the study treatment, every 2 weeks for 2 months, then once a month until progression and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer. New diagnosis of leptomeningeal involvement confirmed by CSF cytology or clinical signs and symptoms associated with abnormal MRI features. MRI criteria : meningeal metastasis &lt; 0.5 cm or &gt; 0.5 cm in case of focused radiation therapy. Patient requiring a systemic treatment (chemotherapy and / or targeted therapy and / or hormone therapy) at the time of inclusion. The systemic treatment is left to the discretion of the investigator in connection with the referent senologist according to the characteristics of the cancer, the previous treatments received and the clinical and biological general state. Focused radiotherapy is authorized. Age ≥ 18 years Performance Status (ECOG) ≤ 2. Patients unable to walk due to paralysis but moving in wheelchairs are considered to be ambulatory. Life expectancy &gt; 2 months. Patients with a rapidly progressive systemic disease are not eligible for this protocol. Brain metastasis allowed if asymptomatic. In case of suspicion of a CSF blocking, or after local radiotherapy for lifting a CSF blocking, a study of the flow of CSF has to be performed (isotopic method) to confirm the absence of a CSF flow blocking. Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of other cancer treatments received. Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic parameters : Total bilirubin ≤ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). SGOT/AST ≤ 2.5 ULN ; ≤ 5 ULN if hepatic metastasis Effective contraceptive method (CPMP/ICH/286/95) for non menopausal patients (eg intrauterine device (IUD), sexual abstinence, vasectomized partner ) (no hormonal contraception). Patients having a social security scheme. Informed consent form signed by the patient. Leptomeningeal metastasis other than from breast cancer. History of other cancer ( &lt; 5 years) except cervix carcinoma, basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma properly treated. Contraindication to MRI (including claustrophobia) MRI criteria : CSF flow obstruction (hydrocephalus in brain MRI or obstacle in spinal MRI) Contraindication to lumbar puncture and to ventricular catheterization. Progressive brain metastasis requiring a total brain radiation therapy. History of craniospinal radiotherapy (History of focal or whole brain radiation therapy for parenchymal metastasis accepted). History of intrathecal treatment (lumbar or ventricular). History of systemic treatment with ARAC or highdose systemic methotrexate. Intravenous high dose concomitant treatment with methotrexate. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Active infection (systemic or cerebromeningeal). Hypersensitivity to ARAC or DepoCyte. Other severe or non controlled pathology which could jeopardize the participation in the trial (infection, cardiovascular, digestive, renal, pulmonary disease). Patient already included in another therapeutic trial with an experimental molecule (within 30 days before the screening visit). Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Women must not breastfeed for at least 6 months. Patients unable to undergo medical follow up for geographic, social or psychological reasons.</criteria>
