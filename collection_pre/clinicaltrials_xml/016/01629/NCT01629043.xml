	<brief_summary>In a recent study it was found that neurologist care for Parkinson's provides a 20% reduction in nursing home placement, hip fracture, and death (Willis 2011). However, as the authors recognized, the investigators don't know what it is about expert care that delivers this benefit. The National Parkinson Foundation's Quality Improvement Initiative was designed to identify the components of great care that yield great outcomes. By capturing demographics, clinical interventions and outcomes over time from multiple centers across the U.S, Canada and internationally, the best care practices from different clinics and different healthcare systems will be analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In a recent study it was found that neurologist care for Parkinson's provides a 20% reduction in nursing home placement, hip fracture, and death (Willis 2011). However, as the authors recognized, we don't know what it is about expert care that delivers this benefit. The National Parkinson Foundation's Quality Improvement Initiative was designed to identify the components of great care that yield great outcomes. By capturing demographics, clinical interventions and outcomes over time from multiple centers across the U.S, Canada and internationally, the best care practices for improving care, survival, and quality of life from different clinics and different healthcare systems will be analyzed. NPF-QII contains demographic data, information about the patient's Parkinson's disease and other comorbid illness, patient assessments of Parkinson's related physical, emotional and cognitive disability and clinician tests of mobility, memory and cognition. It also includes data on the burden of the disease on caregivers. The tests and questionnaire instruments are currently in regular use in clinical practice. The intent of the registry is not to evaluate the instruments themselves but to collect essential data from previously validated tools. Registry data will be used to study the relationship between treatment and clinical symptoms of patients with Parkinson's. It will also be used to evaluate and improve care of patients at participating Centers. Through presentation and publication of results, it is hoped that improvement will become more widespread. Important benefits provided by such a Registry may ultimately be to: - Determine the long term effects of Parkinson's disease and related conditions on quality of life; - Generate regular reports for Centers including descriptions of their Parkinson's patient populations, treatments utilized at the Center and trends in their patients' outcomes over time; - Describe differences in current practice across Centers in the care of Parkinson's patients; - Identify patients who may be candidates for participation in trials of new medications; - Facilitate or initiate quality improvement efforts intended to enhance survival and/or improve quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients; and - Publish and otherwise disseminate findings related to most effective treatments to encourage rapid adoption of "best practices."</detailed_description>
