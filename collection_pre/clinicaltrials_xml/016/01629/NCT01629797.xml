	<brief_summary>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin in the pilosebaceous unit of the hair follicle, associated with oil production. It is found across skin types and is present in 85% of adolescents, representing a large affected population. Because of the universal nature of the disease, 36.3% of acne patients come from backgrounds other than Caucasian. The purpose of this study is to examine patient knowledge about acne in different populations and to assess the effectiveness of a teaching intervention on acne knowledge. The investigators aim is to better understand and subsequently reduce any potential health disparities within the minority populations. This project will evaluate differences in acne knowledge between different ethnic groups, and the efficacy of an educational intervention. Subjects will first complete a survey evaluating their knowledge of acne and how acne affects them psychosocially before an educational intervention. Immediately following the intervention, the patient's knowledge of acne will be evaluated again. Finally, two months after the intervention, a phone call will be made evaluating their retention of the education materials and their quality of life related to psychosocial effects of acne. Investigating this educational intervention and any current disparities in acne education and understanding will better allow us to educate and treat acne patients in the future.</brief_summary>
