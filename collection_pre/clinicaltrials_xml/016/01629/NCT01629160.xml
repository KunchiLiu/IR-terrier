	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility of using new technologies to characterize ventricular wall motion in patients indicated for mapping and ablation procedures. Echo will be performed preoperatively and patients will receive a 1-month followup telephone call.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Be in sinus rhythm Have the ability to provide informed consent for study participation and be willing and able to comply with the Clinical Investigational Plan described evaluations Be undergoing mapping and ablation that requires left heart access for either ventricular tachycardia (VT) or atrial fibrillation (AF) according to HRS (Heart Rhythm Society)/ESC (European Society of Cardiology)/German National guidelines. The patient needs to have at least one of the following indications for left heart mapping and ablation to be included in the study: a) Symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT (SMVT), or b) Frequent PVCs, nonsustained VT, or VT that is presumed to cause ventricular dysfunction, or c) Bundle branch reentrant or interfascicular VTs, or d) Symptomatic AF with indication for ablation per current HRS/ESC/German National guidelines in a patient who is either 1) refractory or intolerant to at least one Class 1 or Class 3 antiarrhythmic medication, or 2) unable/unwilling to take antiarrhythmic drug therapy and chooses ablation as the first line of therapy Have permanent AF Exhibit CheyneStokes respiration Have a recent myocardial infarction within 40 days prior to enrollment Have undergone cardiac surgery or coronary revascularization procedure within 3 months prior to enrollment or be scheduled for such procedures Have had a recent CVA or TIA within 3 months prior to enrollment Be less than 18 years of age Be pregnant Be currently participating in any other clinical investigation</criteria>
