	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Testing for minimal residual disease in blood samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia may help doctors plan better treatment. PURPOSE: This research trial studies a genetic test in detecting minimal residual disease in samples from younger patients registered on COG-AALL08B1 trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Test in Detecting Minimal Residual Disease in Samples From Younger Patients Registered on the COG-AALL08B1 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the feasibility of minimal residual disease (MRD) determination in pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using deep sequencing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. OUTLINE: Archived blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MDR using deep sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. MDR quantification results are then compared with the flow cytometry reference methods used in COG studies.</detailed_description>
