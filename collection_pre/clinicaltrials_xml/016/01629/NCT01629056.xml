	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the benefit of a new impedance-based computer software application during routine catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, to see if this information improves short and long term electrical disconnection of the pulmonary veins. This study will be a single blind prospective randomised control trial in patients undergoing AF ablation. Study participants will be randomly assigned to undergo parts of their pulmonary vein ablation with, and parts of their ablation without tissue contact data displayed for the doctor performing the ablation to see. The pulmonary veins will then be studied at the end of the procedure, and at any repeat procedure in the future, to look for a difference in the recovery rate of the ablations performed using contact data, compared to those ablations performed without the use of this contact data. If a reduction in tissue recovery is achieved through the use of this tissue contact data, it may lead in the future to a reduced need for repeat ablation procedures, and better outcomes for patients. The investigators hypothesise that the use of the Ensite™ Contact™ ECI data will reduce the recovery of conduction, and promote long-term pulmonary vein isolation in patients undergoing left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
