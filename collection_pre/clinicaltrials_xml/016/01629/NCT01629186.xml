	<brief_title>Nose-close and Abdomen-compression in Pediatric Flexible Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) technique—nasopharyngeal oxygenation with nose-close and abdomen-compression (NPO-NC-AC)—in small infants during flexible bronchoscopy (FB). METHODS: Infants with body weight (BW) &lt;5.0 kg and receiving nasal diagnostic or interventional FB (dFB, iFB) were enrolled. Under NPO (0.5 L/kg/min), when infant's heart rate (HR) &lt;80 beats/min or oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;85% for more than 10 seconds, rescue NC-AC was initiated. It was performed by (1) increased NPO flow to 0.5-1.0 L/kg/min; (2) NC 1 second for inspiration; and (3) AC 1 second for expiration with simultaneously released nostrils. Repeat doing steps (2) and (3) at a rate of 30 cycles/min until HR, SpO2, and blood pressure (BP) returned to normal. Cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored and analyzed.</detailed_description>
