	<brief_summary>Soft tissue loss with proper digital nerve (PDN) defect in the finger results in sensory loss of the finger pulp. Reconstruction of these complex soft tissue defects continues to be a challenge problem. To resolve this problem, we combined the nerve branch with the boomerang flap for simultaneous repair of soft tissue loss and PDN defect in these awkward areas. For comparison, we also collected a consecutive series of 32 patients with similar injury in the finger treated using a cross finger flap and a secondary free nerve graft.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Soft Tissue Loss With Nerve Defect in the Finger Using the Boomerang Nerve Flap</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients in this study group were required to meet all of the following criteria: soft tissue loss between the midpoint of the distal phalanx and PIP joint; associated PDN defect 1 to 4 cm in length; single or double PDN defects; and simultaneous repair of soft tissue loss and PDN defect. Patients were excluded when they had the following: injury to the course of the vascular pedicle or the donor site or the donor nerve; PDN defect less than 1 cm or larger than 4 cm in length; direct PDN repair; and thumb neurocutaneous defects.</detailed_description>
