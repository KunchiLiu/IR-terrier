	<brief_title>Caloric Stimulation on Cerebral Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study activities include monitoring with bilateral transcranial Doppler (TCD), EEG and continuous EKG monitoring at 30 second intervals for 5 minutes. This is followed by placement of the caloric stimulator investigational device for 20 minutes. An additional 20 minutes of TCD and EEG monitoring will also be recorded. This will end study participation.</detailed_description>
