	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the corneal epithelial cell response associated with lens wear that results in solution-induced corneal staining (Phase1) and to determine the cell appearance in symptomatic and asymptomatic contact lens wearers (Phase 2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination of Cell Population in Solution-Induced Corneal Staining (SICS) and Symptomatic Versus Asymptomatic Lens Wearers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants wore contact lenses pre-soaked overnight in contact lens solution for 2 hours and 4 hours, separate days. A minimum of 7 days separated the wear periods. Ocular surface cells were collected after both wear periods. In Phase 2, participants wore their habitual contact lenses on a daily wear basis for 4 weeks with habitual lens care. Ocular surface cells were collected after Day 1 and Day 28. Phase 2 included eligible participants who completed Phase 1 and new participants. A participant was considered to be asymptomatic if he/she can typically wear contact lenses comfortably for at least 10 hours/day a minimum of 5 days/week, and symptomatic if he/she typically wears contact lenses for a minimum of 3 days/week and experiences ocular discomfort after less than 6 hours of wear. Phase 1 participants not eligible to participate in Phase 2 or uninterested in continuing into Phase 2 were exited from the study.</detailed_description>
