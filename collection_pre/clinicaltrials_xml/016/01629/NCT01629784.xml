	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that there are significant differences in severity and outcome of lupus in patients of colored skin compared with Caucasians. There are many factors that lead to this discrepancy: genetics, poverty, education level, as well as behavioral and cultural factors. Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE) is a disease of flares and remissions with identifiable triggers. One of the most aggravating triggers in CLE is sun exposure. The investigators hypothesize that there are disparities in knowledge about photoprotection, leading to poorer outcomes in minority ethnic groups. This study aims to assess knowledge of risk factors and triggers, especially sun exposure, and the effects on quality of life of Caucasian and minority populations, by conducting an assessment survey and subsequent teaching intervention on appropriate skin protection techniques including appropriate sun screen application, and use of sun-protective clothing. After three months a survey to evaluate knowledge retention about and the application of the educational intervention will be conducted.</brief_summary>
