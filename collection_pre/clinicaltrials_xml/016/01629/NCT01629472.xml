	<brief_summary>There is some evidence that suggests that economic empowerment and challenging gender inequalities and prevailing ideas on masculinities will lead to a decrease in levels of partner violence. However, there is still a gap in our understanding of what elements are required. This project evaluates whether participation within a savings group and a discussion group confronting gender norms will lead to an increase in women's individual agency and decision-making ability that will improve their economic independence and decrease intimate partner violence in their homes.</brief_summary>
