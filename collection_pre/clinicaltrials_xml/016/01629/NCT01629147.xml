	<brief_title>Treatment of Chronic Constipation in Children With Lactobacillus Reuteri</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional chronic constipation is very common in childhood and is responsible for 20% of the clinic visits in pediatric gastroenterology. Constipation is defined by the Rome III criteria. The symptoms are difficult to treat in part of the patients and cause frustration to the patient and family. Probiotics are increasingly used in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic constipation in adults and children. A recent study revealed that the administration of Lactobacillus reuteri had a positive effect on bowel frequency in infants with chronic constipation. The study goal is to evaluate Lactobacillus reuteri (Biogaia) for treatment of chronic constipation in children 4-10 years of age, and to examine the influence of Lactobacillus reuteri (Biogaia) on constipation in different age groups of school aged children between 4-10 yrs of age.</detailed_description>
