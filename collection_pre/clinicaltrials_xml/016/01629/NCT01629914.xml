	<brief_title>Executive Functioning and Mindfulness in Adults With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The broad objective of this proposal is to identify functional neuroanatomical correlates of changes in executive brain functioning prior to and following an 8-week, group-based mindfulness meditation intervention within a group of 10 adults diagnosed with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Another group of 10 adults diagnosed with ADHD will be placed in the waitlist condition. Our primary hypothesis is that adults with ADHD in the treatment group will exhibit improved performance on a series of executive functioning tasks and that exposure to task stimuli will correspond to changes in neural functioning following an 8-week, group-based mindfulness intervention. Brain responses will be measured using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in brain regions associated with emotional and executive processes prior to and following treatment.</detailed_description>
