	<brief_summary>The investigators hope to determine whether the addition of an FOBT kit and educational materials to a second mailed invitation compared to a second mailed invitation alone increases use of appropriate screening tests (FOBT for average risk or colonoscopy if increased risk) by eligible persons within 6 months of the second mailing in: (1)Non-responders to an initial mailed CRC screening invitation from their family physician and, (2)Those who responded to the initial mailed CRC screening invitation and are due for repeat screening (i.e., "recall" patients). In addition, the investigators will also explore the impact of the investigators intervention in likely under-screened groups such as those living in more remote areas of the province and those with low socio-economic status as well as assessing the cost-effectiveness of this strategy.</brief_summary>
