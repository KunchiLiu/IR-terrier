	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will collect mucus from mechanical ventilated patients and patients with COPD to study the effect of temperature and humidity, on the biophysical properties of the airway mucus. It is hypothesised that changes in inspired gas temperature and humidity (over time) may affect the biophysical properties of the airway mucus and reduce the airway's ability to clear mucus, resulting in deleterious clinical affects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Humidification on Mucus Rheology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Expectorated sputum samples are collected and used to measure the biophysical properties of mucus secretions. The samples are later exposed to different temperatures and humidity levels during bench experiments.</detailed_description>
