	<brief_title>Intrathecal Bupivacaine Versus Bupivacaine and Clonidine in Paediatrics Age Group:A Comparative Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In our Randomized controlled, double blind study involving 30 subjects in two groups; the investigators compared the safety, efficacy and quality of using intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% and hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% with clonidine 1µg/kg in paediatric patients undergoing surgeries below T8 dermatome. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I patients aged between 3-10 years were scheduled for the surgeries below T8 dermatome up to two hrs duration. The patients were randomly allocated in - Group A-who received 0.5%of hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.4mg/kg for 5 to15 kg or 0.3 mg/kg for more than 15 kg intrathecally. Group B-who received 0.5%of hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.4mg/kg for 5 to15 kg or 0.3 mg/kg for more than 15 kg and 1µg/kg preservative free clonidine intrathecally. The patients studied across the group did not vary much with respect to age, weight and sex distribution.</detailed_description>
