	<brief_title>Efficacy of Aprepitant (Emend®) in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 Primary Aim To determine the efficacy of aprepitant (Emend®) in preventing and reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when added to standard antiemetic drug regimens for children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The working hypothesis will be that standard therapy + aprepitant is superior at preventing CINV than standard therapy + placebo. 1.2 Secondary Aim To evaluate the safety and toxicity of aprepitant (Emend®) in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy when compared to standard antiemetic therapy + placebo.</detailed_description>
