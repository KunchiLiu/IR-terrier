	<brief_summary>We propose a randomised controlled trial in a workplace setting to investigate whether a smartphone-delivered programme of mindfulness meditation influences psychological and biological indicators of well-being. We hypothesise that after 8 weeks participants who complete the meditation programme will show increases in psychological well-being and reduced activation of stress-related biological pathways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Controlled Trial to Investigate the Effects of a Mindfulness Smartphone App on Well-being in the Workplace</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mindfulness-based therapies can reduce depressive symptoms in patients and healthy subjects. Therapies such as MBSR (mindfulness-based stress reduction) typically consist of 8 group sessions led by an experienced practitioner, plus home practice and one full day of meditation. In this study we aim to investigate whether a mindfulness programme delivered as a series of podcasts on a mobile phone app could lead to gains in well-being and a reduction in stress.</detailed_description>
