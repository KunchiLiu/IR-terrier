	<brief_summary>RV568 is being developed as a possible treatment of smoking related lung disease (also known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - COPD). The main purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of a new inhaled formulation of RV568 in healthy volunteers. The study will be run in two parts; Part A and Part B. Part A (Cohorts 1, 2 &amp; 3) will investigate 6 different dose levels of RV568 given as a single dose and Part B (Cohorts 4 &amp; 5) will investigate 2 different dose levels of RV568 given once a day for 14 days.</brief_summary>
