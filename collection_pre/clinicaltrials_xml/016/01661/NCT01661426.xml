	<brief_summary>The traditional weight loss diet recommended by health professionals has been a low-fat, high-carbohydrate, calorie restricted diet. This recommendation has been challenged by a number of alternative dietary strategies, particularly low-carbohydrate diets. In several recent weight loss studies insulin resistant adults had more success with low- vs. high-carbohydrate diets, in contrast to insulin sensitive adults who had either more success or comparable success with the low-fat diets. The investigators plan to enroll 80 people with a wide range of insulin sensitivity/resistance. After determining their insulin resistance status, the investigators will split them in the middle and randomly assign them to one of four groups: (1) Low-Carbohydrate/Insulin Resistant (LC/IR); (2) Low-Carbohydrate/Insulin Sensitive (LC/IS); (3) Low-Fat/Insulin Resistant (LF/IR); and (4) Low-Fat/Insulin Sensitive (LF/IS) (20 people/group). The purpose of this study is to determine whether weight loss success can be increased if one follows the dietary approach appropriately matched to their insulin resistance status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators hope to learn whether matching the weight loss diet to one's insulin resistance status will increase weight loss the success. The relevance of these findings is highlighted by the fact that the national recommendations for weight loss are to follow a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. This would imply that about half the population has been given the wrong advice in regards to the most successful dietary pattern for weight loss.</detailed_description>
