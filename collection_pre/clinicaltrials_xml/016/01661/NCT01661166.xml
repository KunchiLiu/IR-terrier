	<brief_summary>The investigators will assess the incidence of Overactive Bladder/Detrusor Overactivity (OAB/DO) post-operatively in patients post robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to investigate whether fesoterodine will alter the incidence of OAB/DO in these patients. Additionally, the correlation between OAB symptoms and urodynamic DO will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
