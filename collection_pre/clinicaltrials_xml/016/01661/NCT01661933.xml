	<brief_summary>We have established that the hookworm Necator americanus (Na) dramatically alters the local and systemic immune landscape of the infected human host. Consistent with the principle of desensitisation, diet managed celiac disease subjects previously infected by us with Na will be invited to receive small incremental doses of gluten as pasta (3-25 mm straw of spaghetti) over 16 weeks. Each participant will then be carefully re-assessed to determine if it is appropriate to undertake a 12-week gluten challenge.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis The adaptive Th2/regulatory profile imposed by Na will promote gluten tolerance following a micro-dose desensitising programme. Primary Aim: To determine the safety and efficacy of Na as a tolerising agent in celiac subjects Specific Aim 1. Undertake a therapeutic pilot study comparing mucosal histopathology before and after a gluten challenge, to be preceded by a programmed desensitising micro-challenge using Na as a tolerising agent. Specific Aim 2. Assess systemic and mucosal immune responses to gluten micro-challenge, Na infection, and gluten re-challenge throughout the pilot study, to be referenced against hookworm-naive people with treated and untreated celiac disease. Specific Aim 3. Utilising blood and tissue from hookworm-naive celiac disease volunteers, undertake in vitro studies focusing on the effects of Na-derived excretory/secretory (ES) products on gluten-stimulated gut mucosal cell apoptosis, cytokine and gene profiles.</detailed_description>
