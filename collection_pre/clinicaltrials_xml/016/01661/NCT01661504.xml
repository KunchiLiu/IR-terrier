	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this proposed study is to develop the state of knowledge in the area of gender-based violence and reproductive health by conducting a randomized controlled trial to improve the health care provider's capacity to screen for intimate partner violence and to mitigate associated risk among women health clinic patrons of reproductive age (ages18-44) with recent experiences of physical or sexual partner violence in Mexico City and its surrounding area. The specific research objectives are as follows: 1. To increase mid-level health care providers' capacity to identify Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and assist women with risk mitigation 2. Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, to assess the impact of an enhanced health care worker screening and counselling program on (a) past year severe IPV (sexual or physical), including severe IPV; (b) reproductive coercion (c) use of community-based resources and safety planning; and (d) quality of life; versus minimum standard of care 3. To qualitatively examine which programmatic components may serve as mechanisms for observed changes stated in the second objective 4. To synthesize study findings and a) create recommendations for clinic-based intervention programs to address IPV in low and middle income countries and b) disseminate information as reports, presentation, and peer-reviewed publications</brief_summary>
