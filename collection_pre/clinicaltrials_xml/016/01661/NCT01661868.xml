	<brief_summary>This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about a drug called olaparib in women who have either: 1)never received a PARP inhibitor before to treat ovarian cancer (group 1) or 2)participants who have received a PARP inhibitor before to treat ovarian cancer, with the exception of olaparib (group 2). PARP inhibitors are drugs tht prevent cancer cells from repairing their DNA. In this research study, we are looking to see how well the drug olaparib works in women who have never received a PARP inhibitor for recurrent ovarian cancer as well as those who have received a prior PARP inhibitor and whose cancer has re-grown after receiving that PARP inhibitor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Olaparib for Patients With Recurrent BRCA Deficient Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Olaparib tablets will be taken twice daily, orally, in treatment cycles lasting 4 weeks. On days 1, 8, 12 and 22 of the first 2 cycles and day 1 of all other cycles, subjects will have a physical exam, be asked questions about their general health, and specific questions about any problems they might be having and any medications they are taking. Tumor will be assess by either CT or MRI scan every 2 cycles (every 2 months). Tumor biopsies will be optional in this study. Only participants that have received a PARP inhibitor in the past will be asked to have a biopsy of their tumor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer that has recurred following a platinumbased regimen used at initial diagnosis Measurable disease Estimated life expectancy greater than 16 weeks Normal organ and marrow function Evidence of nonchildbearing status for women of childbearing potential Able to swallow oral medication Pregnant or breastfeeding Prior PARP inhibitor use for another cancer such as breast cancer Receiving any other study agents or any other anticancer treatment Known brain metastases History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to olaparib Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive hear failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements History of a different malignancy unless diseasefree for at least 5 years Currently experiencing seizures or currently being treated with any antiepileptic for seizures Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive on combination antiretroviral therapy Presence of gastrointestinal disorders that, in the investigator's opinion, are likely to interfere with the absorption of olaparib, or with the patient's ability to take regular oral medication</criteria>
