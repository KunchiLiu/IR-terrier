	<brief_summary>Problem : Precise and personalized 3D knee kinematic assessment during physical and daily life activities is a challenge; therefore, it was never performed on an important number of individuals. However, a better understanding of 3D knee kinematics during such activities would allow a better understanding of this often injured joint. Hypothesis: A new system using personalized 3D bone imaging and a percutaneous bone fixation device that can be used under local anesthesiaallows for precise and reproducible assessment of 3D knee kinematics during physical and daily life activities. Objectives : - To study human knee 3D kinematics during dynamic activities using a novel minimally invasive measuring system - Investigate the correlations between standard clinical knee laxity tests and measured 3D knee kinematics during dynamic activities</brief_summary>
