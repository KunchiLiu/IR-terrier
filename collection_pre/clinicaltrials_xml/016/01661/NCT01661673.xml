	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics of EVP-0962 and Effects of EVP-0962 on Cerebral Spinal Fluid Amyloid Concentrations in Healthy Subjects and in Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Early Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, sequential escalating repeat daily dose study conducted in two parts. The first part is being conducted in healthy subjects and will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of escalating EVP-0962 doses (10, 50 100 and 200 mg) or matching placebo following once-daily administration for 14 days. The second part will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EVP-0962 following once-daily administration for 14 days in patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease at the dose level selected based on the available safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observations in the first part.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part 1: Male and female subjects between the ages of 45 to 65 (inclusive) in good health with a BMI of 1832 kg/m2 and negative urine drug screen of abuse test. Part 2: Male and female subjects between the ages of 45 to 85 (inclusive), MRI/CT scans compatible with diagnosis of MCI or early AD, meets the classification of MCI due to AD as defined by the National Institute on AgingAlzheimer's Association, and a BMI of 1832 kg/m2(inclusive). Subjects must meet the following Cognitive criteria: Subject Memory Complaint, cognitive impairment in one or more areas, CDRSB score less than or equal 1.0, MMSE greater than 24, and no impairment in social or occupational functioning. History of seizure disorder, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, QTc values greater than 450 ms, positive drug screening tests Pregnancy, nursing, (or if fertile female) not willing to utilize birth control measures during study CSSRS suicidal ideation score of 4 or 5 Unwilling to abstain from vigorous exercise Concurrent disease other than MCI or early AD that is attributing to patient's cognitive impairment.
