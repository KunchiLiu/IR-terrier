	<brief_summary>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is not curable with conventional therapy. This study sought to improve upon standard of care in newly diagnosed, untreated MCL patients who were transplant-eligible using drugs already established as active in MCL. The combination of Rituximab-Bendamustine followed by Rituximab-Cytarabine (RB/RC) was expected to maximize pre-ASCT complete response (CR) rate compared to historical rates approximating 55% with tolerable toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab/Bendamustine + Rituximab/Cytarabine for Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a PII single-arm design to determine whether the regimen looked promising for further study. Primary Objective â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of an alternating regimen of Rituximab-Bendamustine and Rituximab-Cytarabine (RB/RC) using the CR/Cru rate. Secondary Objectives - To assess safety. - To estimate the rate of complete remission (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). - To estimate the rate of successful stem cell mobilization after RB/RC in responding patients. - To estimate the proportion of patients who can successfully complete the regimen and proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). - To estimate the rate of neutrophil and platelet engraftment after ASCT. - To estimate the CR/CRu and PR rate for patients with blastoid variant MCL. - To estimate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity at treatment completion.</detailed_description>
