	<detailed_description>The National Cancer Institute s (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP) proposes conducting formative research as an integral part of the development of a new data collection instrument, the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) survey. Specifically, NCI proposes conducting cognitive testing with the objective of identifying potential sources of measurement or response errors within the questionnaires. Many of the questions are new questions that have not been previously tested, or previously-used questions that have never been used with a teenage population.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: The DCCPS contractor, Westat, will be conducting the study. Participants for the cognitive interviews will be recruited from the general population, and will include dyads of a parent or caregiver, and his/her teenage child between the ages of 11 and 18. Neither the contractor who will be coordinating the research (Westat) or NCI employees will be eligible to participate in the cognitive interviews.
