	<brief_summary>This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study will compare the safety and efficacy of tapering methotrexate (MTX) versus maintaining MTX dosage in patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) initiated on treatment with tocilizumab. Participants will receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks and MTX orally weekly throughout the study. At Week 24, participants achieving a good/moderate EULAR response will be randomized receiving the MTX Tapering arm or MTX Maintenance arm. Up to Week 56 participants will receive either tapering or stable dose MTX in combination with tocilizumab. From Week 56 to Week 72 participants will receive tocilizumab monotherapy.</brief_summary>
