	<brief_summary>Infections related to implantable pacemakers or cardioverters defibrillators are sometimes difficult to be diagnosed. Diificulties in the diagnosis include a low sensitivity of standard markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein or white blood cell count and the diagnosis is mainly based on the clinical presentation. The observational DIRT-study evaluates if new biomarkers may be more suitable to support a diagnosis of device associated infections than the currently available ones.</brief_summary>
