	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Daily use of the AVACEN Thermal Exchange System for 4 weeks will show improved Fibromyalgia pain and functioning markers, as assessed by biomarkers and clinical and psychological assessment. This non-invasive device is able to rapidly raise the core body temperature of the user by placing a hand in a vacuum chamber and resting it upon a heating element. The change in body temperature may change the sympathetic nervous system's activity and thereby reduce Fibromyalgia pain.</brief_summary>
