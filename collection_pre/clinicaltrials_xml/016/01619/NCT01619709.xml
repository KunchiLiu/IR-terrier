	<brief_summary>To evaluate Pet AV-45 Amyloid imaging in the etiological diagnosis of primary non traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and hypertension related hemorrhage).We hypothesize that patients with lobar hemorrhage (probably related to Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy) will have a greater AV45 cortical binding than patients with deep hemorrhage (probably related to hypertension).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) and hypertension related hemorrhage are the main causes of non traumatic primary intracerebral hemorrhage. In vivo diagnosis of these two cerebral diseases may be difficult and is based on hematoma location and pattern of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) distribution. We aimed to evaluate a multimodal approach including brain MRI, Pet AV-45 Amyloid imaging and neuropsychological assessment to improve etiological diagnosis of primary intracerebral hemorrhage. 70 patients with acute primary non traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage will be prospectively included and two groups will be compared: lobar hemorrhage group and deep hemorrhage group. Brain MRI, Pet AV-45 Cerebral Amyloid imaging (during the first month) and neuropsychological assessment (Three months later) are performed. Differences between the two groups are evaluated for AV45 cortical binding, CMB distribution, White Matter Lesions and cognitive profile.</detailed_description>
