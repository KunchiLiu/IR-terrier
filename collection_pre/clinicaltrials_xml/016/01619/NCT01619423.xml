	<brief_summary>The present trial is designed to determine whether pre-treatment with PledOx lowers the frequency and severity of side effects from FOLFOX6 administration in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The efficacy of two different doses of PledOx will be assessed when added to FOLFOX6 chemotherapy as first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of PledOx + FOLFOX6 Compared to Placebo + FOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally, nearly 800 000 colorectal cancers are believed to occur annually. Approximately about half of the patients with colorectal cancer develop metastatic disease. These patients are often offered chemotherapy with the FOLFOX6 regimen (FOL = FOLic acid; F = Fluorouracil (5-FU); OX = OXaliplatin) The use of FOLFOX6 is, however, hampered by a high incidence and severity of adverse reactions. In the current trial patients will receive the antioxidant agent PledOx in one of two different doses, or placebo, in the first 8 cycles of FOLFOX6 treatment.</detailed_description>
