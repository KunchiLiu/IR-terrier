	<brief_title>Prospective Pilot Study of Multimodal Radiological Evaluation Feasibility During Chemoradiotherapy of Rectal Adenocarcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the present project is to validate the feasibility of a multimodal radiological pathway while on chemoradiotherapy, in order to validate potentially predictive factors for chemoradiotherapy sensitivity of rectal adenocarcinomas. It is based on a structured clinical and radiological pathway for patients, using diffusion MRI and F misonidazole PET. Validation of these new tools is already needed in clinical practice since future institutional trials will be based on treatment individualisation, using preoperative predicting factors.</detailed_description>
