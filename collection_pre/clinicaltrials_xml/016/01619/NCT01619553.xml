	<brief_summary>Keloids have a strong genetic component. The goal of this study is to identify genes and regulatory elements on chromosomes that are the cause for keloids or contribute to keloid scarring.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis of Keloids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keloids are scars that keep growing beyond the border of the original wound. They typically persist for several years, expand for an extensive period of time and are sometimes called benign tumors. Keloids often have a lumpy surface and are often tender, itchy or inflamed around the growing border. Keloids in most keloid patients do not run in the family. In the inheritable form of keloids it is possible that there is one major gene mutation that puts family members at risk for developing keloids. There may be other variations in the DNA (DNA makes up the chromosomes) that determine whether keloids become large and aggressive or stay small and without many symptoms. For this study we will: - Send out study participation kits and consent by phone - Collect a saliva sample from eligible individuals - Obtain information regarding the keloids - Document keloids with photos - If keloid patients undergo keloid surgery we ask to obtain some scar tissue that would otherwise be discarded - Isolate DNA from the saliva sample - Perform genetic analyses of the DNA with the most up-to-date methods available to identify genetic variations - Study in the laboratory why the genetic variations cause keloids</detailed_description>
