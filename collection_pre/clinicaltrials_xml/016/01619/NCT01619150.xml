	<brief_title>A Single Center 2-way Crossover Study to Investigate the Mechanism of Action of Etoricoxib in Subjects With Osteoarthritis Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale: The purpose of this study is to investigate which pain mechanisms in subjects with painful knee osteoarthritis can be affected by the peripheral and central actions of etoricoxib as compared to placebo during a 4 week treatment therapy period. The present study will utilize a set of quantitative mechanism based pain biomarkers to assess peripheral and central pain manifestations in OA and the influence of etoricoxib on those individual manifestations in an attempt to understand and explain clinical pain alleviation. Study Treatment: Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 sequences of treatment: Sequence 1 (60 mg/day etoricoxib followed by placebo) or Sequence 2 (placebo followed by 60 mg/day etoricoxib). The two treatment periods of 4 weeks each are separated by a washout period of at least 6 days. Primary Objective: To assess which pain mechanisms are modulated by 60 mg daily administration of etoricoxib compared to placebo in subjects with osteoarthritic (OA) knee pain during two treatment periods of 4-weeks each. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate if changes in any of the mechanism based experimental pain assessment parameters can explain changes in clinical outcome parameters. To profile drug responders- versus non-responders based on pain mechanisms involved. To investigate if change in inflammatory, bone and cartilage related bio-chemical biomarkers can explain changes in either experimental or clinical pain parameters.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent (IRB/IEC specific) has been obtained prior to initiation of any protocol required procedures. 2. Male or female between 40 and 75 years of age. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening. 3. Body weight &gt;40 kg and &lt;150 kg with a body mass index (BMI) between 1940 kg/m2 inclusive. 4. Idiopathic osteoarthritic knee pain diagnosed in accordance with the American College of Rheumatology modified clinical classification criteria (Altman et al, 1986) and verified radiologically as KellgrenLawrence grade I, II or III (Kellgren and Lawrence, 1957) at the index knee. The clinical diagnosis of OA will be confirmed by the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification of idiopathic OA based upon the following criteria (index knee): 1. Knee pain for at least 14 days per month for the 3 months before study entry. 2. Osteophytes (with radiographic evidence). 3. And at least 1 of the following 3 conditions: Age &gt;50, or morning stiffness &lt;30 minutes, or crepitus. 4. Xray images of the knee joints are available confirming OA. Xray images older than12 months cannot be used. New photos are needed to confirm the diagnostic criteria for OA. 5. For the index knee, the average of the worst daily pain score over the last 14 days prior to day 0 must be 4.0 to 9.0. The 14day average score will be derived from worst daily pain scores recorded in a diary for the index knee. 6. Discontinued use of all analgesic medications (including overthecounter analgesics/ NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drug at least 3 days prior to visit 2 (subjects are allowed limited use of analgesic medications). 7. Have agreed to maintain the same activity level throughout the course of the study. 1. Have a history of recurrent seizures other than febrile seizures. 2. Have a history of frequent and/or severe allergic reactions with multiple medications. 3. Have a current or recent history, as determined by the investigator or his delegates, of severe, progressive, and/or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, psychiatric or cerebral disease which could interfere with the subject's participation in the study. 4. At screening, have an abnormality in the 12lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participation in the study. In addition, subjects with following findings will be excluded: 1. Confirmed Bazett's corrected QT (QTcB) interval &gt; 450 msec for men and &gt; 470 msec for women at screening. If QTcB is prolonged a second ECG will be taken to confirm the finding; (additional ECGs may be performed if required), 2. Bundle branch blocks and other conduction abnormalities other than mild first degree atrioventricular block, left anterior hemi block due to left axis deviation and right bundle branch block of benign origin i.e. not caused by other cardiac disease, 3. Irregular rhythms other than sinus arrhythmia or occasional supraventricular or ventricular ectopic beats, 4. History of unexplained syncope, 5. Family history of unexplained sudden death or sudden death due to long QT syndrome, 6. Twave configurations are not of sufficient quality for assessing QT interval determination, as assessed by the investigator. 5. Have an alanine aminotransaminase &gt; 2.5 times Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) at screening, based on reference ranges of the local laboratory. Moderate or greater hepatic impairment. 6. Have prior renal transplant, current renal dialysis or severe renal insufficiency (determined by a derived glomerular filtration rate using Cockcroft Gault formula of ≤30 ml/min/1,73m² calculated by the local lab), or serum creatinine laboratory value &gt;1.5 times ULN, based on the reference ranges of the local laboratory. 7. Have active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding. 8. Have known inflammatory intestinal disease. 9.
