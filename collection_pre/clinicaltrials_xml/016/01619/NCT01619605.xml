	<brief_title>The Utility of Serum Tryptase in the Diagnosis of Shrimp- Induced Anaphylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based primarily on the clinical history. In some circumstances, inability to confirm the clinical diagnosis such as present with unusual manifestation, or when skin signs are absent likely contributes to underrecognition and undertreatment of the disease. Currently, products of mast cell activation (histamine and total tryptase) can be measure in clinical laboratories as markers of acute anaphylaxis events, however these tests have clinically relevant limitations. Therefore, development of laboratory tests with improved sensitivity and specificity that will support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis are needed. In addition, shrimp is the major cause of seafood anaphylaxis among Thai children.</detailed_description>
