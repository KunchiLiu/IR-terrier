	<brief_summary>Acupuncture is used and recommended by the WHO for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The molecular bases of this recommendation are not known, the investigators want to compare with the usage of high-throughput molecular technologies the variations occurring in patients treated with acupuncture and conventional treatment with the ones treated with conventional treatment only. The investigators observe the variations in blood and in the gut microbiome.</brief_summary>
