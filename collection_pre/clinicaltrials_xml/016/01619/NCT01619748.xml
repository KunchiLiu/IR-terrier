	<brief_title>Peripheral Vascular Function in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a chronic respiratory disorder associated with endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and increased cardiovascular risk. The standard treatment paradigm is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), however, patient adherence to CPAP is variable. It is unclear to what extent that poor adherence to CPAP therapy augments vascular endothelial function and reduces cardiovascular risk compared to excellent adherence. The main aim of this research is to investigate vascular endothelial function in OSA patients who are poorly-adherent to CPAP therapy. Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated, endothelium-dependent macrovascular and microvascular function (by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation and forearm cutaneous thermal hyperaemia, respectively) and generalised microvascular function (by post-occlusion reactive hyperaemia) will be assessed in three obese OSA patient populations (high-adherence (n=20); low adherence (n=20); and, untreated (n=20)) and age-/BMI-matched OSA-free controls. We will also assess body composition, cardiovascular risk, lipid status and functional capacity. This research will evaluate treatment efficacy in patients who are poorly-adherent to CPAP treatment and could identify whether an alternative approach to their care should be explored.</detailed_description>
