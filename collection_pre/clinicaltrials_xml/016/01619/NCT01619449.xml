	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in clearing excess solutes and improving acid-base parameters. The investigators hypothesize that the use of intra-operative CRRT in OLT recipients is associated with increased solute removal and improved acid-base statues when compared to controls who do not receive CRRT</brief_summary>
