	<brief_summary>Objectives 1. To characterize mechanical ventilation practices during general anesthesia for surgery 2. To assess the dependence of intra-operative and post-operative pulmonary complications on intra-operative Mechanical Ventilation (MV) settings</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Assessment of Ventilatory Management During General Anesthesia for Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research questions - What MV-settings are used during general anesthesia for surgery? - Do MV-settings vary in and/or between centers? - Do MV-settings vary internationally? - Are MV-settings associated with incidence of intra-operative pulmonary complications? - Are MV-settings associated with incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 years All surgical procedures requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV)during general anesthesia for laparoscopic or nonlaparoscopic surgery. This includes MV performed with supraglottic devices (e.g. laryngeal mask) This includes patients receiving MV at the onset of the procedure (e.g. Intensive Care Unit patients) This includes patients who will receive onelung ventilation during the procedure Obstetric surgical procedures or any procedure during pregnancy Surgical procedures outside the operating room Surgical procedures involving extracorporal circulation</criteria>
