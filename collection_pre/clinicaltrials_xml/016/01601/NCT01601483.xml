	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II/III vehicle controlled, double masked, single center study. A single eye of 60 individuals with mild to moderate nonexudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) will be randomly assigned to receive either topical 1% MC-1101 or a vehicle control over 2 years. The study design will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MC-1101 for these patients. An analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted when all subjects have completed 12, 18 and 24 months.</brief_summary>
