	<criteria>hypogonadotropic hypogonadism decreased serum testosterone concentration below the normal range (serum T &lt; 300ng/dL), FSH and LH levels within or below the normal range, absence of a pituitary or hypothalamic mass lesions on MRI, presence of gonadotropin response to repetitive doses of GnRH, normal smell test and normal karyotypes previous androgen treatment, history of smoking, presence of bilateral anorchia, intellectual deficiency, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension or dyslipoproteinemia, medication of any kind and drug abuse. Because of possible confounding effects, patients with other hormone deficiencies were excluded. Participants with iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency were also excluded.</criteria>
