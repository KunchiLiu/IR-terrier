	<criteria>Males and females between 12 and 60 years of age Diagnosis of SCD, type Hb SS or Hb SB0 Thalassemia At least 1 episode of SCD pain crisis, acute chest syndrome, other acute SCD complications, or leg ulcers in the 12 months prior to screening Not being treated with Hydroxyurea (HU); if HU treatment has been previously administered and then discontinued, at least 3 months must have elapsed since last dose of HU If subject has been transfused in the 3 months prior to screening, then Hb A level &lt; 20% at screening Baseline Hb F level obtained within 14 days prior to randomization Able to swallow tablets Able and willing to give informed consent and/or assent If subject is a woman of childbearing potential (WCBP), she must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of first dose of HQK1001 and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to dosing on Day 1 If a subject is a WCBP, she must agree to use an effective form of contraception starting at screening and for one month after HQK1001 discontinuation Sexually active male subjects who have not had a vasectomy must agree to use latex condoms with WCBP partners or ensure that their partner(s) use an effective form of contraception starting at screening and for one month after HQK1001 discontinuation. Assigned to a regular transfusion program Use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents within 90 days prior to screening An SCD pain crisis or SCDrelated acute complication within 3 weeks prior to randomization More than 5 SCD pain crisis or SCDrelated acute complications within 12 months prior to screening Pulmonary hypertension requiring therapy ALT or AST &gt; 3x ULN Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x ULN Serum amylase levels &gt; 1.5x ULN Serum lipase level &gt; 1.5x ULN A serious, concurrent illness that would limit ability to complete or comply with the study requirements An acute illness (e.g., febrile, GI, respiratory) within 72 hours prior to screening History of syncope, clinically significant dysrhythmias or resuscitation from sudden death due to SCDrelated complication Symptomatic peptic ulcer, hiatus hernia, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) History of pancreatitis Chronic opiate use, which, in the view of the investigator, could confound evaluation of an investigational drug Current abuse of alcohol or drugs Use of another investigational agent within 4 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to screening Currently pregnant or breast feeding a child Known infection with HIV1 Infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C, such that subjects are currently on antiviral therapy or will be placed on therapy</criteria>
