	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will to compare the long-term effect of anodal versus cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor recovery in subacute stroke patients. Forty patients with subacute ischemic stroke will randomly assigned to one of three groups: Anodal, Cathodal and Sham. Each group will receive tDCS at an intensity of 2mA for 25 minutes daily for 6 consecutive days over the affected (Anodal, Sham) or unaffected (Cathodal) motor cortex. Patients will be assessed with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Barthel index (BI) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength scale at baseline, after end of the 6th tDCS session, and then 1, 2 and 3 months later. Motor cortical excitability will be measured at baseline and after the 6th session in both hemispheres.</brief_summary>
