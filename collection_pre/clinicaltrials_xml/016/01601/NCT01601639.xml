	<brief_title>Endoscopic Band Ligation Versus Argon Plasma Coagulation for the Treatment of Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia: a Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is a vascular structural malformation in the stomach that can lead to active or chronic intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic iron-deficiency anemia. The current standard endoscopic treatment is with APC. There have been multiple reports and case series in the literature about successful treatment with EBL for GAVE, even in cases where APC was unsuccessful for treatment of GAVE. Our goal is to compare the standard APC treatment with EBL in patients with Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia.</detailed_description>
