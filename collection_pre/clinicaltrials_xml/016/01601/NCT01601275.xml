	<brief_title>Database of All Patients With Microbiologically Proven Mycobacteria Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis currently infects one third of the world's population and is responsible for killing approximately 2 million individuals annually. This is a major public health concern worldwide, and there has been a huge impetus to implement strategies for better tuberculosis control. The investigators have established a system to track all patients with microbiologically proven tuberculosis treated at Singapore General Hospital, with vigilant recording and reporting systems, from the first instance when patients were diagnosed to the time they have completed anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. The investigators endeavour to use this system to improve patient care by adopting patient-supportive approaches that lead to high compliance rates and best possible outcomes of treatment.</detailed_description>
