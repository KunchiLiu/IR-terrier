	<brief_title>Endoscopic Versus Laparoscopic Myotomy for Treatment of Idiopathic Achalasia: A Randomized, Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy myotomy (POEM) has been recently introduced for treatment of achalasia, based on technical developments from NOTES (natural orifice translumenal surgery). The technique uses a submucosal esophageal tunnel through which a distal esophageal myotomy down to the proximal stomach is performed. Single center studies demonstrate promising short-term results of POEM for the treatment of achalasia, leading us to hope for a similar success rate along with reduced patient discomfort. For POEM to be integrated inot clinical routine, comparative data regarding safety and efficacy are necessary. This study intends to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM)for the treatment of achalasia compared to laparoscopic surgical therapy (laparoscopic Heller Myotomy)in a non-inferiority design. Patients with symptomatic achalasia and medical indication for interventional therapy will be randomized to either POEM therapy or standard laparoscopic Heller myotomy (with anti-reflux procedure)(LHM). They will be followed up closely in a defined time pattern evolving individual life quality and achalasia scores as well as clinical scores and diagnostics over a period of 5 years.</detailed_description>
