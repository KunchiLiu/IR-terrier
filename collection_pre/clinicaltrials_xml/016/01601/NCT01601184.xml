	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of vismodegib in combination with temozolomide (primary objective - phase I) and to estimate the efficacy of vismodegib in combination with temozolomide in adult patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory medulloblastomas to standard therapy measured by the 6-month progression-free rate (phase II). This study is an open-label Phase I/II, international, randomized. 38 patients will be included in the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Vismodegib in Combination With Temozolomide Versus Temozolomide Alone in Patients With Medulloblastomas With an Activation of the Sonic Hedgehog Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives are : phase I : to collect preliminary results on the 6-month progression-free rate of the combination vismodegib + temozolomide PHASE II To estimate in the two study arms: - the objective response rate (Complete response + Partial Response according to WHO criteria) after 6 months of treatment - the duration of treatment response - the best overall response obtained during the study - the progression-free survival (PFS) - the time to progression (TTP) - the time to treatment failure (TTF) - In the combination arm (vismodegib + temozolomide): to further evaluate the safety of the combination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Patients must have histologically confirmed medulloblastoma (including posterior fossa primitive neuroectodermal tumor) for which no known curative therapy exists Patients must have recurrent or refractory disease Patients must have evidence of measurable disease or lesion in preinclusion MRI. Patients with measurable spinal disease are eligible. NB: Patients with complete resection for recurrence are not eligible. Activation of the SHH pathway validated by IHC. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Neutrophils ≥ 1. 5 G/L Platelets ≥ 100 G /L Hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (calculated by CockcroftGault formula or MDRD formula for patients older than 65 years ) or serum creatinine within normal limits or less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN ALAT and ASAT ≤ 2.5 ULN Serum albumin ≥ 25 g/L. Patients recovered from prior treatmentrelated toxicity (persistent treatment related toxicity &lt;Grade 2 are allowed (NCICTCAE v4.0). Prior therapy: No prior hedgehog antagonist vismodegib or other antagonists of the hedgehog pathway, and no prior temozolomide treatment for patients to be randomized in Arm A or B. Patients previously treated with temozolomide are eligible for enrollment in study arm C on a case by case basis and following sponsor agreement More than 4 weeks since prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, 6 months after high dose therapy) or immunotherapy At least 3 months since prior craniospinal irradiation (≥ 23 Gy) At least 8 weeks since prior local irradiation to primary tumor At least 2 weeks since prior focal irradiation for symptomatic metastatic sites. At least 1 week since prior colonystimulating factors (e.g., GCSF, GMCSF, or erythropoietin) Women of childbearing potential* are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to study treatment initiation (i.e. Cycle 1 Day 1). *: Female patients who meet at least one of the following criteria are defined as women of nonchildbearing potential: ≥50 years old and naturally amenorrheic for ≥ 1 year Permanent premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist Previous bilateral salpingooophorectomy XY genotype, Turner's syndrome, or uterine agenesis Female patient who do not meet at least of the above criteria are defined as women of childbearing potential. An embryofetal development study in rats has confirmed the teratogenic potential of vismodegib. Therefore, women of childbearing potential and men must use two forms of effective contraception (including one barrier method refer to Appendix 4 for acceptable method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior to study entry, during the study period and for at least 24 months posttreatment for women and 2 months posttreatment for men. Prior to dispensing vismodegib, the investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the teratogenic potential of vismodegib. Ability to understand and willingness to comply to followup visits. Covered by a medical insurance (in countries where applicable) Tumor tissue sample not available for biological studies (from the initial diagnosis and/or relapse) Pregnant or breastfeeding women are not eligible. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition to vismodegib. Any contraindications to temozolomide treatment as per Temodal® SPC (see Appendix 5). Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption. Patients must be able to swallow capsules. Uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, or hypokalemia, defined as less than the lower limit of normal despite adequate electrolyte supplementation. History of congestive heart failure. History of ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication. Congenital long QT syndrome. Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (e.g., serious infection or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or other organ dysfunction) that would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate study treatment or would likely interfere with study procedures or results. Patients using prohibited concomitant and/or concurrent medications (see section "Prohibited concomitant/concurrent treatments.)</criteria>
