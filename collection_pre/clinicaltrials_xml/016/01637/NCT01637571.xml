	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate a new treatment for non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) related to gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), called Dexilant. The investigators would like to test its effectiveness in treating NCCP. The patient will undergo esophageal balloon distention testing (EBDT) before and after taking the new treatment for one month (Dexilant). EBDT evaluates the sensation and mechanical properties of the esophagus. A catheter with a deflated balloon is placed through the mouth and into the esophagus and the balloon is inflated with water. ECG and labs will be done throughout the study as a measurement of safety.</brief_summary>
