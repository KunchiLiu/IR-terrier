	<brief_summary>The recent literature shows an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). On the other hand there are no published studies related to CPAP treatment in this patient group. The investigators aim was to assess the effect of CPAP on sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA and to recognize and overcome possible difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPAP Therapy in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently published studies report a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with IPF. Underlying, and usually under-diagnosed OSA in these patients may be a reason for impaired sleep quality and may consequently have a negative influence on their daily activities and overall quality of life. In addition, underlying OSA may have a negative influence on the already impaired IPF-related morbidity and mortality. The absence of any effective treatment for IPF so far indicates that the recognition and treatment of generally under-diagnosed OSA in IPF patients should be a primary goal. Therefore, our primary aim in this study was to assess the results of effective CPAP therapy in terms of sleep quality and overall quality of life in IPF patients with moderate to severe OSA. The investigators used generally accepted instruments to assess quality of sleep and overall life. In addition, the investigators tried to determine and overcome the reasons for poor CPAP compliance in these patients</detailed_description>
