	<brief_summary>Infants of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected mothers with positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) have an increased risk of becoming infected with HBV. This study will determine whether telbivudine among both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBeAg positive pregnant women during the third trimester, in addition to standard immunoprophylaxis in infants, will be more effective than standard immunoprophylaxis alone at preventing HBV infections in these infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telbivudine Therapy in HBeAg-positive Pregnant Women to Prevent Mother-to-infant Transmission of HBV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants of HBV-infected mothers with positive HBeAg have an increased risk of becoming infected with HBV. Standard immunoprophylaxis against mother-to-infant transmission of HBV includes administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine; however, approximately 5-15% of the infants are not protected despite having received these preventive measures. It is reported that antiviral prophylaxis among HBV-infected pregnant women can reduce mother-to-infant transmission of HBV. However, more research is needed to obtain the definite conclusion. This study will determine whether telbivudine among HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive pregnant women during the third trimester, in addition to standard immunoprophylaxis in infants, will be more effective than standard immunoprophylaxis alone at preventing HBV infections in these infants.</detailed_description>
