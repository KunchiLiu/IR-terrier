	<brief_summary>Various vasoconstrictors have shown promising results in the management of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). However, there are very few studies on vasopressors in the management of type 2 HRS. Terlipressin has been used commonly; however it is costly and not available in some countries. In the present study, the investigators evaluated safety and efficacy of terlipressin and noradrenaline in the treatment of type 2 HRS</brief_summary>
