	<brief_title>Nurse PIV Insertion Success With and Without Assistive Devices in Patients 0-12 Months of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining peripheral intravenous (PIV) access is a nearly universal procedure for medical management of the hospitalized pediatric patient. In children, PIV placement can often be difficult due to the inability to identify peripheral veins (Wilson, 2007). Many assistive devices have been used or promoted to improve vein visualization with the intention of increasing PIV insertion success. Limited research was found to support this assumption regarding nursing PIV insertion success in children. This study is a randomized, controlled trial to determine if the use of a vein identification assistive device increases nurse PIV insertion success within the first two attempts in children 0-12 months of age when compared to unassisted methods. Patients admitted to Children's Hospital &amp; Medical Center (CHMC) Emergency Department, 4th floor medical-surgical unit, or 5th floor medical-surgical/ Intermediate Care Unit, up to 12 months of age requiring non-emergent PIV placement as part of their medical plan of care will be eligible. Following consent subjects will be randomized into one of three vein identification method study groups (1) Wee Sight Transilluminator - a hand held light emitting device held adjacent to or under the patient's extremity to visualize the venous anatomy; (2) VeinViewer - uses near infrared light to view hemoglobin and projects an image of venous anatomy onto the skin; and (3) Unassisted Methods - traditional techniques of vein visualization and palpation. Based on study group assignment the nurse will use the appropriate vein identification method during the first two PIV insertion attempts. Evaluation of vein identification methods will be based on PIV insertion success or failure.</detailed_description>
