	<brief_title>Pregabalin in Preventing Acute Pain Syndrome in Patients Receiving Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible effect of pregabalin on pain related to paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible effect of pregabalin on paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. II. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible relative toxicities related to pregabalin therapy in this study situation. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize neurological testing abnormalities that might occur with the P-APS, and to evaluate neurological testing abnormalities during the period of the longer-term chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). II. To determine the PRO incidence and characteristics of, and change in, P-APS and paclitaxel induced more chronic CIPN over several cycles. These data will serve to confirm the results obtained in our previous natural history study N08C1. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive pregabalin orally (PO) twice daily (BID), beginning on the first night of chemotherapy, for 12 weeks and then once daily (QD) for 1 week. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID, beginning on the first night of chemotherapy, for 12 weeks and then QD for 1 week. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 6 months.</detailed_description>
