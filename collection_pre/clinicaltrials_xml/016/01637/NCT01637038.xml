	<brief_title>The Effect of Remote Ischemic Postconditioning on Liver Graft and Renal Function in Patients Undergoing Living-related Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic reperfusion injury of liver graft and postoperative renal dysfunction is a common problem which influence poor outcome in subjects undergoing liver transplantation. The incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction was reported as high as 12 ~ 64% and is thought to be caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Ischemic pre- or postconditioning was reported to be effective for preventing ischemia/reperfusion injury during liver transplantation. Remote ischemic pre- or postconditioning was also reported to be protective for ischemia/reperfusion injury in major organs in previous animal studies. Therefore, we are trying to evaluate the clinical effect of remote ischemic postconditioning on liver graft function and postoperative renal function in subjects undergoing living-donor liver transplantation.</detailed_description>
