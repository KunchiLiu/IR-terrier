	<brief_summary>Objectives 1. To determine the impact of MSM-targeted multidisciplinary services on uptake of HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) 2. To determine the impact of MSM-targeted multidisciplinary services on the enrollment into care and retention of HIV-positive MSM Subject population: HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM clients, age â‰¥18 years old, of the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRC-AC) in Bangkok Thailand, the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, and the Sanglah Hospital in Bali, Indonesia Number of participants: 200 HIV-negative and 150 HIV-positive MSM participants</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multidisciplinary Services to Enhance HIV Testing and Linkage to Care Among MSM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective cohort study which will recruit 350 MSM clients within 3 months, and follow them for 12 months. MSM to be recruited will be first-time clients who come to the clinics for services other than VCT. These services may include but would not be limited to sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis and treatment, anal dysplasia screening, nutritional counseling and non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP). Approximately 250 MSM clients with unknown or previously negative HIV status will be offered HIV testing every 3 months (HIV-negative MSM cohort). MSM from the HIV-negative cohort who tested HIV-positive during the study (estimated 20%, 50 MSM) will be referred to the HIV-positive MSM cohort and will be followed up every 6 months. Additional clients who visit the clinic during the 3-month recruitment period with previously known HIV-positive status but have not been linked to HIV care (up to 100) will also be enrolled into HIV-positive MSM cohort. Therefore, there will be up to 150 HIV-positive subjects enrolled in this study. Each enrolled participant will have 12 months in the study. This study will allow us to assess VCT and linkage into care, as well as HIV risk behavior and need for nPEP, and the incidence or prevalence of important morbidities in MSM such as STIs, anal dysplasia/cancer, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.</detailed_description>
