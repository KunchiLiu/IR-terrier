	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if two medicines (allopurinol and losartan) can influence heart and blood vessel health compared to placebo in patients with sleep apnea who are using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aims of this research project are: 1) Determine if treatment with losartan, an angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R) antagonist, or allopurinol, a XO inhibitor, normalize chemoreflex control of sympathetic outflow and ventilation and improve local vascular regulation and stiffness; and 2) Determine if these interventions reduce the severity of sleep disordered breathing and lower diurnal blood pressure.</detailed_description>
