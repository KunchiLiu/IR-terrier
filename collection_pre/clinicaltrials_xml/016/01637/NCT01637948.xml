	<brief_title>Controlled Clinical Trial of Traditional Chinese Medicine Mouthrinse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) mouthrinse on gingival health and microbial profiles in orthodontic patients. This six-month randomized, single-blinded, parallel controlled clinical trial consists of 90 patients with fixed appliance treatment. The subjects were allocated to (1) negative-control group: oral hygiene instruction (OHI) alone; (2) positive-control group: OHI plus an EO mouthrinse (ListerineÂ®)(3) test group: OHI plus the TCM mouthrinse (5% Fructus mume extract). Clinical examinations included Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding Index (BI) and Modified Gingival Index (MGI). Salivary microbial quantifications included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Streptococci and Lactobacilli counts. Clinical and microbiological examinations were conducted at baseline, 3 and 6 months (T1, T2 and T3).</detailed_description>
