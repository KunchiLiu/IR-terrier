	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of I-PDT with Temoporfin for patients with Non-Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NR-NSCLC). Several clinical studies suggested that photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an effective treatment for patients with NR-NSCLC. PDT is a therapy where an external light source, such as laser, is used to activate a light-sensitive medicine to produce byproducts that can destroy cancer cells. In this study the investigators will use an experimental light sensitive medicine, Temoporfin, to perform interstitial PDT (I-PDT). In I-PDT, laser fibers are inserted into the tumor to activate the light-sensitive medicine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eighteen years of age and older, male or female, of all races and ethnicities. Histologically confirmed nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC). Not a candidate for curative surgery. Not a candidate for curative concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Not a candidate or does not wish to receive curative radiation therapy. Not a candidate or does not wish to receive radiofrequency or microwave thermal ablation. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; 2. The tumor is observable in CT with contrast. The tumor is accessible for unrestricted illumination of interstitial photodynamic therapy (IPDT). Deemed likely to survive for at least 3 months. Patient is able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. If the subject is a female of childbearing potential, the subject is willing to take a pregnancy test and practice strict birth control (estrogencontaining oral contraceptives or an intrauterine device) throughout the study and for 3 months after Temoporfin administration. Women who have had a hysterectomy are exempt from these requirements. Subject is willing to remain in a controlled light exposure environment for a time period of at least 15 days. History of laboratory tests that meet the following criteria Hematocrit &gt;= 33%, hemoglobin &gt;= 11 g/dl Platelet count &gt; 70,000 per microliter White blood count &gt; 3,000 per microliter or ANC &gt; 1500 per microliter Creatinine: 0.8 to 1.4 mg/dL Serum chloride: 101 to 111 mmol/L Serum potassium: 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L Serum sodium: 136 to 144 mEq/L Liver function test: albumin, bilirubin (direct/conjugated), ALT (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate transaminade), GGT (gamma glutamyl transferase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase) within normal limits BUN: 7 to 20 mg/dL The tumor invades a major blood vessel. The tumor is not clearly shown on the CT image. The tumor size is larger than 5 cm when measured in a contrasted CT image according to RECIST v1.1. The location and extension of the tumor precludes an effective IPDT. Patient with porphyria or other diseases exacerbated by light. Patient with hypersensitivity to Temoporfin or to any of its excipients. Patient with known allergies/hypersensitivity to porphyrins. Patient with a planned surgical procedure within the next 30 days. Patient with a coexisting ophthalmic disease likely to require slitlamp examination within the next 30 days. Patient with existing therapy with a photosensitizing agent (Temoporfin, porphyrin or derivatives of porphyrin). Patient has received prior PDT to the proposed treatment site within the prior 3 months. Patient with known sensitivity to the CT contrast agent (Omnipaque), which would preclude the use of the CT contrast agent. History of poor renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 40 mL/min/1.73m2, which would preclude the using of the CT contrast agent.</criteria>
