	<brief_title>Growth and Plasma Amino Acids in Infants With CMPA and Treated With a Newly Innovated Amino Acid Formula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe cases of cow's milk protein allergy are treated with the amino acid formula. The amino acid formula is composed of essential and non-essential amino acids, vegetable oils with or without MCT oil, and glucose polymer from various carbohydrate sources.
