	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Nasea(R)/Ramosetron Inj. in Patients Undergoing Facial Bone Fracture Operations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Participants - 100 patients with undergoing facial bone surgery are going to be randomly allocated to one of the 3 groups 2. Randomization - G1(n=33) - Ramosetron 0.3mg i.v. just before the beginning of the surgery - G2(n=33) - Ramosetron 0.3mg i.v. just after the end of the surgery and moving into the Recovery room - G3(n=33) - No medication but regular antiemetics i.v. if the patient wants 3. The primary endpoint - the incidence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h after surgery at 0-6h, 6-12 h and 12-24 h 4.
