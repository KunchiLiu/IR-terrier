	<brief_title>Intra-patient Dose Escalation Study Evaluating Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Pasireotide (SOM230) Subcutaneous (s.c.) Followed by Pasireotide LAR in Patients With Dumping Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>43 adult patients with dumping syndrome will receive 3 months of pasireotide s.c. during the dose escalation phase (dose can be increased based on the presence of hypoglycemia during OGTT). From Month 3- to Month 6 patients will then switch to pasireotide LAR. The core phase of the study is completed at tghe end of Month 6. Patients will be offered to enter into the 6 month extension phase if they experienced benefit with pasireotide LAR treatment</detailed_description>

Patients who received other therapies for dumping syndrome (such as acarbose, gama guar, pectin) must have stopped all treatments and allow a wash out period prior to signing the informed consent (i.e. at least 2 weeks between last previous therapy and first dose of study medication in this study). 9. Patients able to provide and have provided signed written informed consent prior to study participation. Exclusion criteria: 1. Bariatric patients who have lap band. 2. Patients with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus. 3. Patients who have failed treatment with somatostatin analogues for dumping syndrome in the past 4. Patients who have been treated with somatostatin analogues in the past, must have an appropriate interval between the last administration of somatostatin analogues treatment and the study drug as follows Octreotide s.c. for ≥ 72 hours Octreotide LAR for ≥ 56 days (8 weeks) Lanreotide Autogel for ≥ 98 days (14 weeks) Lanreotide SR ≥ 28 days (4 weeks) Patients who were already treated with pasireotide 5.

Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Patients with the presence of active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection or with a history of immunodeficiency, including a positive HIV test result (ELISA and Western blot). An HIV test will not be required; however, previous medical history will be reviewed. Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the treatment with this study treatment. Lifethreatening autoimmune and ischemic disorders.

History of, or current alcohol and/or drug misuse/abuse within the past 12 months 12. Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis 13. Patients with abnormal coagulation (PT and PTT elevated by 30% above normal limits). 14. Patients on continuous anticoagulation therapy. Patients who were on anticoagulant therapy must complete a washout period of at least 10 days and have confirmed normal coagulation parameters before study inclusion (patients receiving aspirin once a day are allowed to be enrolled). 15. Patients who are hypothyroid and not on adequate replacement therapy 16. Patients who have undergone major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 1 month. Patients should have recovered from the surgery and be in good clinical condition before entering the study. 17.

Patients with a history of noncompliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially unreliable or will be unable to complete the entire study. 19. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values considered by the investigator or the medical monitor of the sponsor to be clinically significant or which could have affected the interpretation of the study results. 20. QTrelated exclusion criteria: QTcF at screening &gt; 470 msec History of syncope or family history of idiopathic sudden death Sustained or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, cardiac failure, clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia, or highgrade AV block Concomitant disease(s) that could prolong QT such as autonomic neuropathy (caused by diabetes, or Parkinson's disease), HIV, cirrhosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism or cardiac failure Family history of long QT syndrome Concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval.
