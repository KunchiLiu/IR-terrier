	<brief_summary>Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) is a water-soluble derivative of tanshinone IIA isolated as the main pharmacologically active natural compound from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine,the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge known as Danshen. Danshen has been known for the function of improving body functions such as activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Danshen and its various formula products including STS have been long-time widely used in oriental countries, especially China to treat various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases for its pharmacological actions, including vasodilatation, anticoagulation, anti-inflammation, and free radical scavenging,with negligible adverse effects observed. The investigator's objective is to evaluate whether STS exhibits beneficial effects on pulmonary hypertension. This is a randomized, controlled, multicentre clinical trial study. 90 patients with pulmonary hypertension will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>
