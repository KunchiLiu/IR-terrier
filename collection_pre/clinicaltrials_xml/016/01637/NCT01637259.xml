	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an emerging problem in patients with treated HIV. Antiretroviral therapy associated renal dysfunction has been predominantly described in terms of reduced glomerular filtration (eGFR). Proteinuria is a key component of CKD and may occur in the absence of significant reductions in eGFR. This substudy is an exploration of changes in urinary protein excretion in a randomised, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MVC as a switch for either nucleoside or nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTI) or boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r) in HIV-1 infected individuals with stable, well-controlled plasma HIV-RNA while taking their first N(t)RTI + PI/r regimen of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MARCH Renal Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this substudy of MARCH is to characterize the changes in protein and salt excretion through the kidney utilising the randomised arms of the parent study MARCH. The investigators hypothesize there will be an improvement in proteinuria in those switching to maraviroc containing regimens.</detailed_description>
