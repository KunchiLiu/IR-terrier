	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to understand whether there is any difference in the amount of tasimelteon (including its breakdown product) in the blood when taken alone and in combination with either rifampin or ketoconazole. Cytochrome P450 3A4 is an important enzyme produced by the body to breakdown certain medications. In this study, the effect that this important enzyme has on tasimelteon is being studied by assessing the effect rifampin and ketoconazole have on tasimelteon and how they are broken down by your body. Rifampin is a known inducer of Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme meaning that it increases the activity of the enzyme. Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme meaning that it decreases the activity of the enzyme. In addition, the safety and tolerability of tasimelteon will also be assessed throughout the study.</brief_summary>
