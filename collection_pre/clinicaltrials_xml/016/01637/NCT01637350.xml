	<brief_summary>Different digestive tract reconstruction will affect the blood glucose level of gastric cancer with type 2 diabetes. Subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction and total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction may help to improve glycaemic control which includes fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, C -peptide and body weight of gastric cancer patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different digestive tract reconstruction will affect the blood glucose level of gastric cancer with type 2 diabetes. Subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction and total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction may help to improve glycaemic control which includes fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, C -peptide and body weight of gastric cancer patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators will observed fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, C -peptide and body weight of the patients preoperation, 14 days postoperation 3 month and 6month postoperation. The investigators will observed the effect of blood glucose to different digestive tract reconstruction after gastrectomy of gastric cancer with type 2 diabetes</detailed_description>
