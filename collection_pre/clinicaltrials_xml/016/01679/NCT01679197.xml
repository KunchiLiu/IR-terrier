	<brief_summary>This study involves research about an investigational medicine called metreleptin. The reason for this study is to find out how metreleptin can improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease associated with lipodystrophy, a rare disorder associated with abnormal loss of the body's fat tissue. In this study, metreleptin is considered to be investigational for the treatment of lipodystrophy. Metreleptin will be given via injections under the skin. We plan to continue therapy for a period of one year and evaluate the change in liver disease by a liver biopsy. We will also follow the metabolic parameters (e.g. blood cholesterol, liver function, insulin resistance) and body composition characteristics (e.g. the pattern of fat distribution in the body).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Protocol to Investigate the Efficacy of Recombinant Human Leptin (Metreleptin) in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) or Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Associated With Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal is to test the efficacy of restorative leptin therapy on the degree of hepatic steatosis and on amelioration of pathological features of NASH/NAFLD. In addition, the study will evaluate the impact of leptin therapy on total body insulin sensitivity and lipid levels as well as energy expenditure. In order to accomplish this aim, we now propose an efficacy study with recombinant human leptin therapy in patients with all forms of lipodystrophy who also have NASH/NAFLD. 1. AIM 1: To determine the efficacy of leptin in promoting amelioration of body composition, hepatic steatosis and histopathological scores in patients with all forms of lipodystrophy and NAFLD/NASH. We will conduct a 1 year, open-label study, to assess the metabolic effects of recombinant human leptin (METRELEPTIN, AztraZeneca, Wilmington, DE). The primary outcome measure will be NASH scores. We will also explore body weight, insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid control, body composition, and free fatty acid levels. 2. AIM 2: To Investigate molecular effects of leptin therapy. In parallel to our preliminary studies, gene expression will be performed on individuals participating in Aim 1 at baseline and following 1 year of leptin. We will combine this with measures of liver metabolite levels to provide novel insights into alterations in metabolism that occur secondary to leptin therapy. We will also measure plasma metabolites at baseline and after 2 (optional), 24 and 48 weeks of therapy to assess the dynamic changes induced by leptin and correlate these changes with phenotypic measures.</detailed_description>

Must practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate when use consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, tubal ligation, or a vasectomized partner) during the entire duration of metreleptin treatment. Has physicianconfirmed lipodystrophy as defined by evidence of generalized (whole body) or partial (limbs) loss of body fat outside the range of normal variation. Alcohol consumption of less than 40 grams/week. A liver ultrasound confirming nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or previous liver biopsy confirming NASH status. If ≥ 18 years of age, is able to read, understand and sign the U of M IRBMED approved informed consent form (ICF), communicate with study physician and study team, understand and comply with protocol requirements. If &lt; 18 and ≥ 7 years of age, is able to read, understand and sign the appropriate U of M IRBMED approved assent form and has a parent or legal guardian that is able to read, understand and sign the ICF. If &lt; 7 and ≥ 5 years of age or unable to read, the appropriate assent form must be explained to the child. If previously treated with thiazolidinediones or Vitamin E, stable dose of these medications for at least 3 months.
