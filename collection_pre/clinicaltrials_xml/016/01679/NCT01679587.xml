	<brief_summary>Primary objective was to assess in subjects with CKD: Safety and tolerability of molidustat (BAY 85-3934), effects of molidustat on non-invasive hemodynamics Secondary objectives were to assess: Effects on pharmacodynamic parameters of erythropoiesis (erythropoietin, reticulocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit), pharmacokinetics of molidustat, exploratory biomarkers, ie, midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, midregional pro-adrenomedullin, plasma renin activity, and optionally B-type natriuretic peptide, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and noradrenaline</brief_summary>
