	<brief_summary>The purpose of this dose range finding study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of JNJ-38518168 at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/d compared with placebo in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite concomitant methotrexate (MTX) therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Range Finding Study of JNJ-38518168 in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis in Spite of Treatment With Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), multicenter, placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time), dose range finding study of JNJ-38518168 in patients with active RA despite concomitant MTX therapy. The study will consist a screening period, a 24-week placebo-controlled period and a 4-week follow-up period between the last dose and the last visit. The duration of participation in the study for an individual patient will be up to 34 weeks (including screening). The patients will be assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and JNJ-38518168 (3 mg or 10 mg or 30 mg). Safety assessments and evaluations to determine the efficacy of JNJ-38518168 to reduce the signs and symptoms of RA will be performed at study visits. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
