	<brief_summary>The SimplyGo Study is a single site, cross-over study which aims to enroll a maximum of 30 participants (to allow for 20 completers) with a prescription for nocturnal oxygen, and meeting all eligibility criteria. All participants will undergo a single night polysomnography testing in a sleep lab while they're SpO2 is monitored. The study has a cross-over design, in which participants will receive their oxygen prescription in two different modes at different times during the night. The assignment (sleep vs. continuous mode) to which participants will initiate the night will be randomized, and all participants will utilize each of the two modes during the study. The hypothesis of this study is that there will not be a significant difference in oxygen saturation (SpO2) for participants while they use the SimplyGo Portable Oxygen Concentrator, set in 'Sleep Mode', or pulsed oxygen flow, as compared to their SpO2 while on continuous flow oxygen during sleep during the course of the one night sleep study.</brief_summary>
