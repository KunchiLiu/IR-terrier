	<brief_summary>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited disease of the connective tissue. Symptoms are fractures, growth retardation, blue sclera, bad teeth, impaired hearing a.o. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of treatment of adult OI patients with bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid), parathyroid hormone (PTH) or placebo on bone mass, fracture risk and quality of life. The investigators will therefore conduct a double blind, placebo controlled trial, taking genotype and previous antiresorptive therapy into account.</brief_summary>
