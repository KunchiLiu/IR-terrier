	<brief_summary>The propose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and the clinical efficiency of feedback-controlled robotics-assisted treadmill exercise (RATE) technology for cardiovascular rehabilitation early after stroke. The investigators hypothesize that feedback-controlled RATE might be suitable and effective to improve cardiovascular fitness and functional carryover in non-ambulatory individuals with sub-acute stroke.</brief_summary>
