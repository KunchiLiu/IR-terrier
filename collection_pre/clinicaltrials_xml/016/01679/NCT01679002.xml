	<brief_summary>To investigate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of once-daily and twice-daily regimens of BIA 2-093 and twice-daily regimen of Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®) in healthy subjects and to assess the tolerability of such regimens in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steady-state Pharmacokinetics of BIA 2-093 and Oxcarbazepine in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single centre, open-label, randomised, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. The study consisted of three 8-day treatment periods separated by washout periods of 10-15 days. On each of the treatment periods the volunteers received either a daily oral dose of BIA 2-093 900 mg once-daily (od), BIA 2-093 450 mg twice-daily (bid), or Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®) 450 mg bid.</detailed_description>
