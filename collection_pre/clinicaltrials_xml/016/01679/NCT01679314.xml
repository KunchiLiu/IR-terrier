	<brief_summary>The study will assess the treatment of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) stage III and IV who will self administer the AlphaCore stimulation three times a day over a course of 2 months. Patients will either receive an active AlphaCore device or a Sham device during these two months while not knowing which device they have been provided. At the end of the two months, all patients will be asked to continue in the study for another 2 months to self administer with the active AlphaCore device. Subjects will complete diaries at home on their breathing and quality of life and will return to the clinic monthly for assessment by the investigator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare (COPD) Assessment Test in COPD Stage III and IV in a Prophylactic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY VARIABLES: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the total Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) score change from baseline to the 8 week follow-up period comparing the two device groups. Secondary efficacy endpoints will be the mean difference from baseline to the 8 week follow-up for the following assessments: Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, 6 minutes walking test and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) Safety Variables: Each subject will be assessed throughout the study for Adverse Events and at the last visit (4 months) subjects will undergo another physical examination including vital signs and blood pressure.</detailed_description>
