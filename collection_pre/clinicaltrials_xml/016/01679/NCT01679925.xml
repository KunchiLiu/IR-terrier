	<brief_summary>GnRH agonists are used in the treatment of precocious puberty in order to improve adult height.However,the psychosocial impact of precocious puberty is often used by the clinician at diagnosis to justify treatment, but can not yet be properly assessed. It can not be considered as a rational neither for the indication to treatment, nor to assess its potential efficacy. The overall objective of this work is to improve the conditions leading to the therapeutic decision and the procedures for monitoring girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty.</brief_summary>
