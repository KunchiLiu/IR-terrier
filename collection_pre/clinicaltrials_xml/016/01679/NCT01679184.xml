	<brief_summary>Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) (HLA) levels and non-HLA antibody levels in recipients prior to living kidney transplantation and randomize these individuals into a desensitization protocol in order to evaluate shifts that can occur with the Luminex and XM-One assay after treatment and up to 6 months post transplant. If desensitization is needed prior to transplantation in individuals with a negative crossmatch but positive DSA and/or XM-one - patients will be evaluated clinically with routine lab tests (serum creatinine levels, spot urine protein and spot urine creatinine levels) as well as protocol biopsy evaluations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>XM-One Study for Living Donor Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Rates of acute rejection including subclinical rejection - acute T cell mediated (cellular) rejection, antibody mediated acute rejection, and chronic antibody-associated injury (i.e.: Transplant Glomerulopathy, Chronic allograft arteriopathy) between the groups. 2. Evaluation of endothelial cell activation and injury on biopsies by checking markers for endothelial cell activation and injury (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1/CD54; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-1/CD106; and E-selectin, ELAM-1/CD62E) in two-color stains of tissue with classical endothelial markers (CD34 and Factor VIII). 3. Measurement of serum/plasma levels of TNF-alpha and VEGF and decreased levels of protein C and protein S in the circulation, as an assessment of graft vascular perturbation. 4. Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs) will be measured by flow cytometry with markers for endothelial cell activation.</detailed_description>
