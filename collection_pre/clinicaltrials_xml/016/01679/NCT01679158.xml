	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of minor variations in Incisionless Operating Platform (IOP)procedural techniques on gastric emptying, hormone levels, satiety, and weight loss in the treatment of primary obesity. It will confirm, in an open prospective study, the action mechanisms for the "POSE" endoscopic treatment technique for obesity, and it will help determine if they are maintained at least 6 months following the procedure. Durability of weight loss will be tracked through post-POSE visits up to 18 months following the procedure.</brief_summary>
