	<brief_summary>Recently, an inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has been investigated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Data from these trials showed that the EV71 vaccine has good safety profile and was immunogenic. 320 U alum-adjuvant vaccine has been chosen as the candidate vaccine for the phase 3 clinical trial. This clinical trial is a supplementary phase 2 trial, which is designed to study the gene expression patterns induced by EV71 vaccine in Chinese healthy children aged from 2 to 5 years old use a systems biology approach combined with microarray analysis，RT-PCR and neutralizing antibody testing for PBMC and serum collected form the studied children population, to predict immunogenicity, and explore mechanistic insights about the EV71 vaccine.</brief_summary>
