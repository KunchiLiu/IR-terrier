	<brief_summary>The BAROSTIM NEO HTN trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Barostim Neo system in subjects with resistant hypertension. Currently, the BAROSTIM NEO HTN trial is not actively enrolling. CVRx is conducting long-term follow-up of patients implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO device. This update was not done for any subject protection concerns that would preclude continuation of the investigation.</brief_summary>
