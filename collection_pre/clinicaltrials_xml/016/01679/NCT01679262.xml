	<brief_summary>There are several studies that have measured various oropharyngeal airway space distances using radiological method. However, direct confirmation of optimal size of oropharyneal airways (OPAs) in individual using fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) is lacking as now. The purposes of this study were to directly determinate the proper size of OPA in individual by FOB via different sizes of OPA in adults under general anestheisia. Additionally, we examine the relationships among the size of OPA, straight length from the incisors to the tip of the epiglottis by laryngoscopy, patient height, and external facial measurements.</brief_summary>
