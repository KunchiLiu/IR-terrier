	<brief_summary>Elderly patients are increasingly admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. Short-term outcome (e.g. hospital survival) of an ICU stay is improving in this population but little data have been published on long-term outcome. Beyond survival, outcome assessment in the elderly requires to evaluate several aspects of health: mental status, activity of daily living, pain, depression, frailtyâ€¦ referred by geriatrician as "comprehensive geriatric assessment' (CGA). The purpose of the SENIOREA study is to evaluate one year outcome of elderly patients mechanically ventilated in the ICU by performing CGA one year after ICU admission. CGA will be performed on the patients' site of living. This prospective multicentric trial will be conducted over 8 medico-surgical ICUs.</brief_summary>
