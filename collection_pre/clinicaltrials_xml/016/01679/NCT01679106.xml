	<brief_summary>Up to 174 patients undergoing renal transplantation will be randomized to one of two groups. Randomization will be based on computer-generated codes using random block sizes ranging from 4 to 8. Group 1: TAP catheter with continuous infusion of Ropivicaine Group 2: Fentanyl IV PCA The TAP catheter will be removed 48 hours postoperatively. Following removal, the pain scores will be assessed at 60 and 72 hours postoperatively to determine any prolonged analgesic benefit. In addition, the presence of any pain at the incision site will be noted at the 1 month surgical follow-up to determine any evidence of chronic pain. The investigators hypothesis is that unilateral kidney transplant patients with a continuous TAP catheter will have decreased pain scores and opioid usage compared to those receiving standard analgesic therapy.</brief_summary>
