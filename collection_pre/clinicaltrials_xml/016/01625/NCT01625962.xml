	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the associations between indices of brain structure and function (measured at baseline, as soon as possible after injury) and course of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Subjects will be service members who have sustained mild traumatic brain injury (classified as either "impact-induced mTBI" or "blast-induced mTBI"; n = 100 completers) or an extracranial injury (ECI) with no evidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 100 completers). Subjects will complete an assessment battery at baseline and 6 months later that includes (1) structural magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from a 3-Tesla magnet; (2) event-related brain potentials (ERPs) derived from brain electrical activity; (3) neurocognitive tests; and (4) neurological soft signs (NSS). Specific indices of brain structure and function derived from these assessments are hypothesized to demonstrate a significant relationship with course of PTSD symptoms, which will be measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.</brief_summary>
