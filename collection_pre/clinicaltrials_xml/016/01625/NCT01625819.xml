	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to compare Tai Chi versus Resistance Exercise, Health Education and usual care for changes in cardiac functional capacity measured for ability of the heart to pump by measuring ejection fraction (EF), end systolic and diastolic volumes in heart failure (HF) patients. Also measured will be changes in physical function measured by walking speed and distance in the 6-min walk task, work performed during a bicycle task, and changes in daily physical activity. The investigators will compare groups for altered well-being including: depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, mindfulness, spirituality and quality of life. In addition the investigators will compare groups for altered vascular and pro-inflammatory markers, catecholamines, and autonomic function at rest and in response to the bicycle task. Also, the investigators will assess cardiac related hospitalization and death over a 12 month period by examining medical records.</brief_summary>
