	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Dual-axis Rotational Versus Standard Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) was developed as an innovative adaptation of rotational angiography (RA), but it requires a longer coronary injection compared to standard coronary angiography (SA). The risk of complications from the contrast agent (such as discomfort, warmth, pain, hypotension and bradycardia) is increased with the use of DARCA. It remains to be evaluated whether this approach is also suitable for coronary angiography, especially using in the patients with complex coronary lesions. Previous studies revealed promising results, but the number of patients included did not provide sufficient statistical power to allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, clinical tolerance, and hemodynamic effect of DARCA in comparison to the well-established SA.</detailed_description>
