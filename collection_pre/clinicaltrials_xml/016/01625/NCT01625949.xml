	<brief_summary>Background: When an acute myocardial infarction occurs, the artery supplying the infarct zone should be opened within twenty four hours of onset of infarction. This has clearly been shown to be beneficial. If the patient presents later than 24 hours of onset, at that stage a large part of the damage to the heart is irreversible. Intervening at this stage (beyond 24 hours is controversial). Some trials suggest that opening the artery even at this stage positively modifies the remodeling process while other trials suggest that such a benefit is not seen. Hypothesis: Opening an infarct related artery after 24 hours (until 6 months) and combining it with intracoronary stem cell therapy may provide incremental benefit.It is possible that the lack of benefit seen with late revascularization (&gt;24 hrs) after MI may be offset by giving intracoronary stem cells after opening the artery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Therapy in Patients With Myocardial Infarction and Persistent Total Occlusion of Infarct Related Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The benefit of opening an infarct related artery after the period of myocardial salvage (In patients who do not come to medical attention within 24 hrs of an infarctions) has been questioned in recent trials. On the other hand, Stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction has been shown to improve myocardial function both in the acute and chronic phases. It is possible that the lack of benefit seen with late revascularization (&gt;24 hrs) after MI may be offset by giving intracoronary stem cells after opening the artery. Patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) and occluded infarct related arteries supplying a large myocardial territory and with reduced ejection fraction will be randomized to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) arm and a PCI plus stem cell arm . The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that opening an infarct related artery after 24 hours and before six months and following it with intracoronary stem cell therapy may provide incremental benefit. The primary objective To demonstrate benefits in left ventricular recovery (improvement in function by echocardiogram and Nuclear imaging: Multigated acquisition [MUGA], reduction in scar size by tetrofosmin scan/Positron Emission Tomography[PET]. ) The secondary objectives To demonstrate improvement in functional capacity as assessed by 6 minute walk test and quality of life assessment, along with reduction of first occurrence of recurrent MI, hospitalization/treatment of New York Heart Association class IV congestive heart failure, or death</detailed_description>
