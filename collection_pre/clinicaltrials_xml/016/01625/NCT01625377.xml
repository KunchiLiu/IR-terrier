	<brief_summary>The aims of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early introduction one month post-transplantation of everolimus associated to EC-MPS with tacrolimus discontinuation in de novo liver transplant recipients and to evaluate if it leads to a better renal function 6 month post-transplantation compared to standard treatment associating tacrolimus and EC-MPS. The renal function was estimated by glomerular filtration rate.</brief_summary>
