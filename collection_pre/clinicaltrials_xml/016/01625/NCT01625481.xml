	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male or female of &gt;18 years of age Signed Informed Consent Patients requiring vascular reconstruction surgeries using synthetic (such as PTFE, Dacron) or autologous (such as native veins) grafts, including the following: Peripheral bypass surgeries, such as arterioarterial bypasses [including: axillo(bi)femoral, ilio(bi)femoral, femorofemoral, iliopopliteal, femoropopliteal (including below knee), femorotibial vessel bypass] Arteriovenous (AV) dialysis access shunt in the upper or lower extremity Patients able and willing to complete all followup visits Vascular surgery other than peripheral bypass surgeries and arteriovenous (AV) dialysis access shunt procedures as described above Reoperation at the same treatment site Known sensitivity to device materials, such as indigo carmine dye or alginate Pregnant or lactating women Systemic infection Participation in another clinical trial or treatment with any investigational agent in past 30 days Congenital coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia [&lt;100,000 platelet count], thromboasthenia, hemophilia, or von Willebrand disease) Severe congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV infection or long term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs) Prior radiation therapy to the operating field Intraoperative Major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the planned surgical procedure Intraoperative change in planned surgical procedure that results in the patient no longer meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criteria Local infection at the operating field</criteria>
