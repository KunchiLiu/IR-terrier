	<brief_summary>The investigators group has performed a number of studies on novel airway devices, including an observational study on the performance of a new supraglottic airway named Baska mask. In this new study the investigators wish to determine which criteria best predict the correct size of the Baska mask to be used in male patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination of the Optimal Approach to Select the Best Size of BASKA Mask to Use in Male Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our observational study of the performance of the Baska mask suggests that this novel supraglottic airway has promise as an alternative to the current standard device, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Our results indicate that while the manufacturer weight criteria work reasonably well in females this may not be the case in males. The investigators wish to determine how well the manufacturer recommended sizing criteria for the Baska mask work in males. This study is designed to determine which criteria best predict the correct size Baska mask to use in male patients. In addition the investigators will monitor the performance and safety of this device (insertion success rate, seal pressures, time to and ease of insertion, failure rate, complications etc)</detailed_description>
