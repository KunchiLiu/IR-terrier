	<brief_summary>Haemophilia is a disorder, usually genetic, affecting mostly male individuals, in which one of the proteins needed to form blood clots (FVIII) is missing or not present in sufficient levels. In a person with haemophilia, the clotting process is much slower and the person experiences bleeding episodes that can result in serious problems and potential disability. The current haemophilia standard of care is to maintain FVIII activity level above 1%. Sometimes, patients can develop antibodies (so called "inhibitors") against FVIII and it is no longer effective at controlling bleeds. Bleeds in these patients are currently treated using other proteins involved in the clotting process. The purpose of this study is to investigate how effectively BAY86-6150 may stop acute bleeds in "inhibitor" patients. This study consists of two parts, A and B. The purpose of part A is to find the most effective yet tolerable out of four doses of BAY86-6150 with regard to efficacy and safety (dose-finding part). Part A is expected to last 9 - 29 months. The purpose of part B is to confirm efficacy and safety of the dose found in part A in all participating patients (confirmatory part). Part B is expected to last 12-32 months. Approximately 60 male subjects 12 to 62 years-of-age with moderate or severe haemophilia A or B, with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX, who have had 4 or more bleeding episodes in the last 6 months, will participate in this study. Patient's bleeds will be treated with BAY86-6150 and with a rescue medication if no response is made to BAY86-6150. Patients will attend the treatment centre at regular intervals and be required to keep an electronic diary.</brief_summary>
