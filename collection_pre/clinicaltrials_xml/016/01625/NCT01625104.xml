	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess whether an aggressive quality improvement intervention strategy will decrease time from hospital presentation to first balloon inflation in non-transfer patients with acute ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Twelve hospitals in Michigan were randomized to either aggressive intervention or control. The intervention consisted of Grand Rounds at each hospital, sharing of best practices, and coordinating center staff working closely with staff at each intervention hospital to discuss solutions to barriers to rapid treatment for STEMI patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of a Quality Improvement Intervention to Decrease D2B Time in Primary PCI for AMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participating hospitals randomized to the aggressive intervention strategy actively worked to create teams to analyze processes of care for STEMI patients, identify areas needing improvement, and implemented strategies to streamline treatment. Hospitals randomized to control were instructed to conduct "business as usual".</detailed_description>
