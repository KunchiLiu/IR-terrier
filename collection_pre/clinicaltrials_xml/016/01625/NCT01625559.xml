	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of RPE cellular therapy in patients with SMD Group - When-MA09-hRPE cell transplantation to evaluate the safety of surgical procedures. - In future studies intended to assess the number of transplanted hRPE cells. - In the past, MA09-hRPE cell therapy used in the study was to evaluate the validity of the potential. - Homologous retinal pigment epithelial cells derived from embryonic stem cells, future studies of drugs that are used in representing the potential validity to evaluate the optimal dose.</brief_summary>
