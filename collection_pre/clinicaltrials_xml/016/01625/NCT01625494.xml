	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To assess the proportion of patients with controlled Office Blood Pressure Measurements (OBPM), defined as Systolic blood pressure &lt; 140 mmHg and Diastolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg, at the end of the study Secondary Objectives: - To examine over time the antihypertensive effect of the 4 doses of the fixed combination therapy irbesartan/amlodipine on OBPM (SBP (systolic blood pressure) and DBP (diastolic blood pressure) - To examine the proportion of patients with controlled OBPM (systolic BP&lt;140 mm Hg and diastolic BP&lt;90 mmHg) of the different dose groups over time - To determine the incidence and severity of adverse events.</brief_summary>
