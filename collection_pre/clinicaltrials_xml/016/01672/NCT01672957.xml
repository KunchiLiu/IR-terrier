	<brief_title>An Observational Study on Renal Function in Kidney Transplant Participants on Immunosuppressive Therapy Containing Mycophenolate Mofetil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant sampling method used in the Orange study was consecutive sampling, a non-probability sampling method where each participant meeting the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria is selected and enrolled in the study until the pre-set sample size is achieved. Thus, in the Orange study de novo kidney transplanted participants, who were on mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppressive combination therapy in routine clinical practice, were selected in a consecutive manner (a non-probability sampling method) if they met the inclusion/exclusion criteria until 128 participants were recruited to the study.</detailed_description>
