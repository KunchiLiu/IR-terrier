	<brief_summary>The main focus of this study is to develop blood and/or urine tests that will help to detect early signs of rejection in people who have had a liver transplant. Researchers will examine blood, urine, and tissue samples and try to identify markers for certain conditions such as rejection, response to therapy, and scarring of the liver. Additionally, researchers would like to identify biomarkers that can detect damage to the native kidneys before blood levels of creatinine rises. By studying gene expression, researchers hope to be able to diagnose these conditions earlier and improve liver survival.</brief_summary>
