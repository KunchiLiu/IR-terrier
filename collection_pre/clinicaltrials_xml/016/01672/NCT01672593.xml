	<brief_summary>Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract has been shown to promote closure of low-output ECFs. The primary objectives of this study are to compare the clinical efficacy, safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG) and a commercially available fibrin sealant Bioseal® in the management of patients with low-output volume ECFs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glue Sealing for Patients With Low-Output ECFs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This is a prospective, randomized, single-centered study clinical, safety and economic outcome of ECFs patients. - Subjects are randomized to one of 2 groups: - Group 1: Autologous PRFG-treatment (PRFG + SOC) - Group 2: Commercial FG-treatment (Bioseal® + SOC) - Study will include three phases: - Phase 1: Screening, consent and enrollment - Phase 2: Patients will receive either PRFG, or Bioseal only for 14 days - Phase 3: Follow up: for patients with closed fistula within 14 days, we will follow up them for 6 months. For patients whose fistulas were still open will be treated with other therapeutic option and follow up for 6 months after closure.</detailed_description>
