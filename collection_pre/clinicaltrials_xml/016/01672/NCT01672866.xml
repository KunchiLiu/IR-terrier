	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether simtuzumab (formerly referred to as GS-6624) is effective at preventing the histologic progression of liver fibrosis and the clinical progression to cirrhosis in participants with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It will consist of 2 phases: - Randomized Double-Blind Phase - Open Label Phase (optional)</brief_summary>
