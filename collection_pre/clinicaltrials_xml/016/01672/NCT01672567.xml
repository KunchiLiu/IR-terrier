	<brief_title>Effects of Egg Ingestion on Endothelial Function in Adults With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restriction of dietary cholesterol, and thus the avoidance or restriction of egg intake, is routinely recommended to patients with coronary disease. However, the relative importance of dietary cholesterol to serum lipids has become a subject of active debate. Eggs provide a complete array of amino acids and an array of micronutrients, and are low in total fat. Epidemiological and clinical studies have showed that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids decreases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Endothelial function testing represents a uniquely valuable means of assessing aggregated influences on cardiac risk by gauging physiologic responses of the vascular endothelium. In prior studies the investigators have shown that daily egg ingestion for 6 weeks did not adversely affect endothelial function in healthy adults or in hyperlipidemic adults. The investigators now propose a prospective, randomized, single-blind crossover study to assess the effects of eggs, egg substitute and high-carbohydrate American breakfast on endothelial responses and serum lipids in participants with clinically established CHD.</detailed_description>
