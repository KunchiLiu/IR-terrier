	<brief_summary>Being the craniostenoses sutural basically a disease, the fact that the brain being trapped in an enclosure that does not have complacency required to accompany their growth constitutes the challenge of treatment, which aims to restore the complacency of the suture and correct the stenotic compensatory cranial deformity. This paper proposes the combination of a helicoid osteotomy distraction osteogenesis provided by the use of springs distracting.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As demonstrated by some authors, the curved shape of the helix fits perfectly the remodeling of a curved surface as well as the skullcap. If you do not receive fixation, however, trace the helicoid of the bone osteotomy can turn on a spring that can expand or contract depending on the direction of the force that is received. This form of osteotomy was therefore chosen by the authors to induce bone compliance areas of secondary defect that should expand or compress indirectly during the process of dynamic remodeling of primary defect with springs.</detailed_description>
