	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood or tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody levels in samples from patients treated for prostate cancer on trial ECOG-E9802.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PSA Antibody Levels in Samples From Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated on Protocol ECOG-E9802</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody levels over time among patients treated on ECOG-E9802. Secondary - To characterize the concordance of PSA antibody assessment between the ECOG Immunology Laboratory and the NCI Immunology Laboratory. OUTLINE: Previously tested samples are evaluated for changes in PSA antibody levels over time (from baseline to follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks) at the ECOG Immunology Laboratory and the NCI Immunology Laboratory. Results are compared between the laboratories.</detailed_description>
