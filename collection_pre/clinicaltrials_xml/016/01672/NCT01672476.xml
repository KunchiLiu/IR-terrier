	<brief_summary>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, phase III Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan (BR-A-657·K) 30mg Compared to Placebo in Patients with Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan(BR-A-657∙K) 30mg Compared to Placebo in Patients With Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After subjects have signed informed consent voluntarily, when they are taking hypertension medication, they go through screening period for 7 days including wash-out period. After screening and wash-out period, subjects take the placebo for 14 days (Maximum 21 days), and evaluate their suitability to Inclusion and Exclusion criteria. Patients, who evaluated the proper subject for this clinical trial, are allocated to experimental group (Fimasartan 30mg) or Control group (Placebo group) or Reference group (Valsartan 80mg) randomly at a ratio 2:2:1 and their investigational drugs will be administered daily for the study period (8 weeks). Subjects visit their investigators twice during treatment period, when they take their investigational drugs for 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. The placebo period will be single-blinded and the treatment allocation in this study will be double-blinded.</detailed_description>
