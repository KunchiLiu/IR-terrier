	<brief_title>Effects of Dairy on Vitamin K-status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In earlier studies, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis were found to be associated with K2 intake, notably the higher menaquinones, MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9. Of these higher menaquinones, MK-7 was suggested to be the most effective form with respect to intestinal absorption, biologic half-life time, and efficacy on circulating biochemical markers. MK-7 is a natural product that is found in cheese, curd, and the Japanese food natto. Therefore, a nutrient enriched dairy product has been developed containing MK-7. The efficacy of this new product will be investigated on vitamin K status and on general health markers.</detailed_description>
