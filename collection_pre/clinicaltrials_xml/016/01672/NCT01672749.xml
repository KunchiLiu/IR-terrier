	<brief_summary>The foremost challenge when managing early onset scoliosis (curve deformity before the age of 10) is to prevent curve progression while maintaining growth of the spine. Current treatment options require repetitive interventions as the spine and the child grow. This study will compare two techniques of growth modulation: Standard dual growing rods versus the new Luqu√© Trolley screws Hypothesis: Patients treated with the DePuy Synthes TROLLEY system will undergo fewer re-operations after 3 years of follow-up (FU) than patients included in the comparison group</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical study is to show that the growth guiding construct with DePuy Synthes TROLLEY Gliding Vehicles allows for less re-operations and for ongoing spinal growth across an instrumented immature spine while preventing curve progression in early onset scoliosis patients.</detailed_description>
