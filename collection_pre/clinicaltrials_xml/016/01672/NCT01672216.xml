	<brief_summary>Previous studies revealed only a low evidence for the various biofeedback methods and pelvic floor exercises for treatment of chronic obstipation. The number of randomized controlled trials is low with in part significant systemic deficiencies. However, the results from the previous study with 3T treatment in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) are so promising that a further randomized controlled trial appears useful to demonstrate a higher degree of evidence. The purpose of this study is to determine whether triple target treatment (3T) or EMG-Biofeedback alone are effective in the treatment of chronic obstipation and if the duration of treatment (3, 6 or 9 months) influence the efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial to Compare the Outcome of Conservative Triple Target Treatment With EMG-Biofeedback in Chronic Obstipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods in this parallel-group randomized multicenter study with blinded observer we enroll 140 patients with chronic obstipation. The study is divided into two trials. After three months the first trial is completed and can be extended directly into the second trial (completed after 12 months) after an interim analysis. Primary endpoints are changes from baseline to three and twelve months in the Altomare ODS Score.</detailed_description>
