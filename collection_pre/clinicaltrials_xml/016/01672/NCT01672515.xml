	<brief_summary>Stroke is one of the three leading causes of human death, and a major cause of adult disability. Our pre-clinical studies confirmed that ischemic preconditioning can prevent cerebral infarction. Animal studies confirmed that ischemic postconditioning can reduce infarct size of cerebral infarction. Investigators hypothesized that postconditioning would reduce infarct volume of ischemic stroke patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protective Effects of Remote Limb Ischemic Preconditioning on Acute Cerebral Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study explored the neuroprotective effects of post-positioning on ischemic stroke patients with randomized, double-blinded and controlled method. Patients are divided into experimental and placebo groups to receive remote ischemic post-conditioning for 30 days. Remote ischemic post-conditioning is performed by the inflating tourniquets to certain extents on bilateral arms with 5 cycles of 5min inflation and 5min relax alternation for the total of 30 consecutive days. It is 200mmHg for RIPC group and 60mmHg for control group. Evaluation parameters include CRP, TNF-Î±, ICAM-1 and GFAP in blood at 0, 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after treatment; and MRI at 0 and 30 days after treatment.</detailed_description>
