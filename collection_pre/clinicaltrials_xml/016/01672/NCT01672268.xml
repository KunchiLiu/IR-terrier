	<brief_summary>This is a pilot prospective, comparative, monocentric, randomized study with 2 groups. People with a severe aortic stenosis and a high risk of surgery are referred to a Trans catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interest of Cardiac Computed Tomography to Optimize and Improve the Procedure of TAVI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is to show the interest of a cardiac computed tomography (CT) to improve the TAVI procedure. The Cardiac computed tomography (CT) shows the exact geometry of the aortic annulus and help the physician to find the right position of the prosthesis during the procedure. The hypothesis is that performing a cardiac CT before the TAVI could reduce the number of vascular peripheral complication, the number of stroke and can minimize the aortic regurgitation during the follow up.</detailed_description>
