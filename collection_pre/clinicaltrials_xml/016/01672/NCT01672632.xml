	<brief_summary>It has been shown that large fat cells are associated with more risks for insulin resistance and more cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol or triglycerides.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fat Cell Size and Overfeeding and Etopic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will look at fat cell size and how it affects fat deposition, insulin resistance and muscle oxidative capacity. A comparison will be made with the differences between participants with larger versus smaller fat cells in insulin resistance and blood levels of lipids. The study will also determine if characteristics of fat cells and muscle can predict the development of weight gain-induced insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
