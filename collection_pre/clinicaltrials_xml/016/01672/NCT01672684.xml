	<brief_title>Phase I: At-Home Support for Rural Women Using Group Video Calling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine whether delivering at-home professionally-led breast cancer support using group video calling is feasible, acceptable and satisfactory for women in rural northern California. II. To evaluate the feasibility of using on-line tools to recruit, screen, treat, and assess this population for a subsequent randomized clinical trial. III. Assess whether the rate of recruitment of women in this region in this study using predominantly on-line means of recruitment can be improved over that of the previous study using predominantly face-to-face means of recruitment. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate effect size changes in measures of quality of life (post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, perceived stress, and positive states of mind), satisfaction with social support, and self-efficacy for coping with cancer. II. Prescribe sample size. III. Perform I and II for all of these outcomes. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (experimental arm): Participants complete at-home group video calling sessions for 1 1/2 hours once weekly for 8 weeks. ARM II (control arm): Participants receive an educational workbook journal. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 week.</detailed_description>
