	<brief_title>Microwave Treatment and Corneal Collagen Crosslinking for Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of the Vedera KXS (a microwave-based procedure) combined with corneal collagen cross-linking performed with VibeX (Riboflavin Ophthalmic Solution)and the KXL System to corneal collagen cross-linking alone in reducing corneal curvature in patients with keratoconus. Patients will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: Vedera KXS combined with corneal collagen cross-linking or collagen cross-linking alone. The Vedera KXS procedure performs a controlled application of microwave energy in an annular configuration. The goal of this procedure is to reshape the cornea to flatten the cornea and improve corneal topography in patients with keratoconus. The primary goal of collagen crosslinking is to stabilize the corneal shape in keratoconus and prevent progression of the disease. Moreover, investigations of crosslinking have shown the procedure not only to decrease keratoconus progression, but also to decrease the steepness of the cone and improve uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity in some cases. Since the mechanism of improvement differs between the procedures, this study will compare the combined microwave/crosslinking treatment to crosslinking alone.</detailed_description>
