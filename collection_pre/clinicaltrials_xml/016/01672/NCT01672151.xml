	<brief_title>Efficacy of Rapamycin Therapy With Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug, is widely used to prevent allograft rejection and autoimmune diseases. Many studies have shown that the drug contributes to the expansion of regulatory T cells and preserves the highly suppressive function of autoreactive T cells. Patients with RITP often display a decreased proportion of regulatory T cells by flow cytometer, therefore, the investigators will examine the efficacy of rapamycin in RITP patients.</detailed_description>
