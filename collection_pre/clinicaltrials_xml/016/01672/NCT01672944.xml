	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate English and Spanish language educational materials that inform the community about a type of cancer research that involves the collection, storage, and processing of biospecimens. Part A of this study involved creating surveys about biospecimen donation and research. Now, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will begin to evaluate education materials about biospecimen donation and research. Phase II consists of two independent randomized controlled trials. Each trial is being conducted independently to test English and Spanish language materials (75 subjects each).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Biobanking Educational Tools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project addresses gaps in information by developing and validating English and Spanish language instruments to measure knowledge of and attitudes towards biospecimen donation and banking, as well as intention to donate biospecimens to a biobank (Part A). Once developed, the instruments will be used to evaluate biobanking educational priming tools by conducting two independent RCTs. Wherein English educational materials will be tested with 75 participants recruited from an urban clinic, and Spanish educational materials will be tested with 75 participant recruited form a rural community health center network. For each RCT following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to either: 1) educational priming tools (DVD and booklet) developed by the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN); or 2) an NCI-developed brochure entitled "Providing Your Tissue for Research: What You Need to Know." Seven to 28 days later participants will be given a telephone follow up interview.</detailed_description>
