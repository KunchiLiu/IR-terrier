	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the clinical value of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty with respect to acetabular cup implantation, and to document the long-term clinical outcome of patients with Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). IRB approval will be obtained at every study site to evaluate the basic clinical outcomes and post-operative component placement accuracy of each MAKOÂ® THA patient. The hypothesis is that robotic preparation of the acetabulum will significantly reduce the variability and inaccuracy in the component alignment parameters that lead to post-operative complications, including implant failure.</brief_summary>
