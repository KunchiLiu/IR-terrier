	<brief_summary>Ultrafiltration (UF) technology is unique for its ability to extract fluid as an isotonic solution, therefore not causing substantial changes in NaCl concentrations, and the use of peripheral veins makes it feasible to use in out of hospital medical centers, for non compensated Heart Failure (HF) with a low response to diuretics. The use of UF in the United States and Europe in out of hospital HF centers is accepted as daily practice. Therefore the hypothesis of this study is that it is feasible for a professional team to effectively use the UF for short courses on non compensated HF patients with low or no response to Diuretics, in a dedicated out of hospital HF center.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients will be treated in the LIN Heart Failure Center and will not include population defined in the Exclusion criteria. Up to 60 patients will be recruited and each one will undergo up to 30 treatments in time intervals defined by the cardiologist according to the clinical needs throughout the duration of the study. Inclusion duration of every patient will be terminated at the end of the treatment course. No prevention in adding more treatment courses per patient according to clinical needs upon the cardiologist's decision. Operating the UF system: During the treatment course two of the patient's peripheral veins will be cannulated. One will be used to draw blood from, and the other will be used to return the blood back in to the patient. The patient will be administered with Heparin IV, or Clexane SC with an ACT target of 180-200 that will be monitored every 4-6 hours. Fluid removal rate will be according to the cardiologists discretion and will not exceed 500 ml/hour Patient monitoring - Pulse and BP will be recorded at baseline, after 10 minutes for treatment onset and every 1 hour.</detailed_description>
