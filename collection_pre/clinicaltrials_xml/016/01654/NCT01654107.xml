	<detailed_description>In this Stage I Behavioral &amp; Integrative Treatment Development (R34) project, we propose to develop a theory-based smoking cessation intervention (called Persistence-targeted smoking cessation; PTSC). PTSC includes 8 weekly individual counseling sessions and use of nicotine lozenge for 12 weeks. We will test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention (i.e., cigarettes per day and prolonged abstinence). We hope to develop a feasible psychosocial treatment for use in a later randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>
