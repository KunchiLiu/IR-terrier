	<brief_summary>There is a high prevalence of sexual and body image problems among women treated for gynecologic cancer, which can lead to considerable distress. Given the sensitive and highly personal nature of these problems, women are often reluctant to speak to their doctors about these concerns and have few resources for support and information. The research team will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trail (RCT) to test the benefits of "GyneGals," a 12-week online (i.e. Internet-based) support group intervention for women who are sexually distressed due to gynecologic cancer and its treatment. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a professionally-facilitated, information-rich, online support group is beneficial for women who are sexually distressed due to gynecologic cancer and the side effects of treatment.</brief_summary>
