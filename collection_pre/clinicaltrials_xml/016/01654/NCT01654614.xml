	<brief_summary>Primary objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic capability of keratoconus match index (KMI) and keratoconus match probability (KMP) indexes in forme fruste keratoconus (FFK), and their association with a series of Pentacam-derived keratconus (KC) indexes. KMI and KMP parameters are KC-specifc indexes that are measured by Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA), based on the distinct ORA-derived waveform characteristics of KC eyes. Study participants were recruited from the Cornea Outpatient service in a consecutive if eligible basis. Two study groups were formed: a) FFK group (FFKG) that included patients diagnosed with FFK, and, b) Control group (CG) was formed by refractive surgery candidates. All ORA (Reichert Ophthalmic Instrument, Buffalo, NY, USA, software version: 3.01)and Pentacam (Pentacam HR, Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)measurements were performed by the same experienced operator in a consistent way</brief_summary>
