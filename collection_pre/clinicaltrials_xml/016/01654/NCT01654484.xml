	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of up to three concentrations of DE-117 ophthalmic solution (Low Dose, Medium Dose, and High Dose) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy (DE-117 ophthalmic solution with 0.0015% tafluprost) in subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution in Patients With POAG or OHT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two stage study. Stage One will explore the dose response of three concentrations of DE-117 as monotherapy compared with 0.0015% tafluprost and placebo. The safety and efficacy of DE-117 as adjunctive therapy (with 0.0015% tafluprost) compared with 0.0015% tafluprost and placebo will also be evaluated. In addition, the additive effect of adjunctive therapy of each concentration will be compared with the corresponding monotherapy concentration. Stage Two will assess the safety and efficacy of the optimal DE-117 concentration as monotherapy compared with 0.0015% tafluprost. The safety and efficacy of the optimal DE-117 concentration as adjunctive therapy (with 0.0015% tafluprost) compared with DE-117 monotherapy and 0.0015% tafluprost will also be evaluated.</detailed_description>
