	<brief_summary>The MID-Frail STUDY project focuses on the use of interventions designed to improve functional status and enhance quality of life (rather than traditional treatments such as glucose- and blood pressure- lowering) by acting on the mechanisms involved in producing frailty and its progression to adverse outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Modal Intervention In Frail And Prefrail Older People With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: Subjects enrolled in the main study will also be invited to join the following sub-studies: GENEFRAIL: this sub-study aims to determine the polymorphisms of several genes associated to frailty, in order to establish its predictive value for developing disability and response to treatment as well METABOFRAIL: this sub-study aims to investigate the metabolomic profile of frail and pre-frail patients. SARTRAIN: the combination of the assessment tools used in SARTRAIN (ARFI US, MRI, posturographic measurements) will provide a comprehensive study of the structural and functional characteristics of muscle and adjacent tissues and their change with time and the intervention. MID- POW: this sub-study aims to investigate changes in muscle power. The project also include an randomized controlled ancillary study: SENSOLE for which the aim is to investigate the potential effects of vibrating insoles device on gait and posture.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participant is willing and able to give written informed consent for participation in the study. Subjects aged 70 years or older, with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 2 years. Require to fulfill Fried ÃÅs criteria for frail or prefrail individuals. Exclusion criteria: Barthel score lower than 60 points. Inability to carry out SPPB test (total score=0). Mini Mental State Examination score less than 20 points. Subjects unwilling or unable to consent or unable to participate safely in intervention program. Previous history of myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable angina or congestive heart failure in IIIIV NYHA stage. Clinically instable patients in the clinical judgment of the investigator. Terminal illness (life expectancy &lt; 6 months). Any other condition that, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, means that it would not in the patient's best interests to enter the study.
