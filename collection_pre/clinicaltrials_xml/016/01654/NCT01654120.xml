	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of adding liraglutide to high dose insulin therapy compared to high dose insulin therapy alone in patients with insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes with insulin requirements of &gt; 100 units of insulin per day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Effectiveness of Liraglutide Added to High Dose Insulin in Type II Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 subjects with Type 2 diabetes using &gt; 100 units of insulin per day with or without metformin with HbA1c &gt; 6.5% will be randomized into 2 treatment groups: treatment group will have liraglutide added to insulin and control group will have insulin uptitration only for 6 months. Primary endpoint to be compared between groups will be HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary endpoints will include weight, total daily insulin dose, percent time in euglycemic, hyperglycemic, and hypoglycemic ranges by continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and effect on GlycoMark and hs-CRP. Safety endpoints will include incidence of hypoglycemia and incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male and female patients with Type 2 diabetes with HbA1c from 6.5 to 10% treated with intensive insulin therapy (MDI or CSII, including U500 insulintreated patients) using &gt; 100 units of insulin, with or without a stable dose of oral insulin sensitizing medications, for at least three months. 2. Aged 18 to 80 years. 3. Females of childbearing potential must be using adequate form of contraception. 4. Patient willing to monitor BG four times daily, use CGM, and comply with studyrelated protocol. 1. Type 1 diabetes. 2. Use of any GLP1 receptor agonist within previous three months. 3. Use of DPP4 inhibitors or oral insulin secretagogues within the previous three months. 4. Use of glucocorticoids (except inhaled). 5. Use of any experimental drug within previous three months. 6. Known or suspected allergy to liraglutide, Novolog or Levemir. 7. Personal or family history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid or MEN2. 8. Concomitant chronic renal disease with creatinine &gt; 1.5%. 9. Concomitant chronic hepatic, gastrointestinal or other illness (including pancreatitis or active cardiovascular disease except stable exertional angina). 10. Inability or unwillingness to monitor BG, use CGM, or comply with study protocol. 11. Women of childbearing potential unwilling to use adequate contraception, intending to become pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
