	<brief_summary>In a prospective observational study the incidence of Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Type 2 after orthotopic liver transplantation, associated factors, and hemostaseological findings in thrombocytes and anti-body patterns is going to be investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT II) in Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators examined the frequency of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies (IgG/M/A; EIA) and their functional activity (HIPA) in 38 whole organ deceased donor liver transplant recipients. Additionally, demographic, clinical, donor- and recipient-specific parameters and laboratory findings (ALAT, ASAT, cholinesterase) were investigated.</detailed_description>
