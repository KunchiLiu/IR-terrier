	<brief_summary>Morphine is the gold standard for treatment of severe acute pain but it has a number of adverse effects. No study has so far managed to identify the morphine-induced adverse drug reactions. The primary objective of this study is to determine predictive factors of morphine-induced adverse drug reaction when it is used in emergency departments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Prospective Study on Morphine-induced Adverse Drug Reactions in Emergency Departments.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to study a large cohort of morphine-induced adverse drug reactions patients, the consequences for patients, mainly in terms of severity, and predictive criteria. This will allow us to identify some patients most at risk of morphine-induced adverse drug reactions, and thus to adapt morphine titration and monitoring of these patients. Leading to a better understanding and a better prediction of adverse effects in patients, it is possible that part of the "opiophobia" which persists in emergency services disappear. Finally, it is toward a better security but also a better efficiency in the management of pain patients in emergencies that leads this study. The secondary objectives are: To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events related to morphine. To establish an inventory of morphine use in emergency departments in the different centres studied.</detailed_description>
