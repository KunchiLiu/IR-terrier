	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and usefulness of the Regenecure guided bone regeneration membrane for stimulating bone growth in patients that don't have enough bone for dental implant placement. The study will include 16 patients in each group, 20 non-smokers and 12 smokers, a total of 32 patients will participate in the study.</brief_summary>
