	<brief_summary>The investigators thus propose to use an innovative randomized effectiveness trial design to test the theory that early automatic identification of a ¡ Low Systolic Blood Pressure¡± clinical condition and decision-support alerts will prompt earlier hemodynamic support and a consequently reduce the duration of such conditions. Specifically, the investigators will test the hypothesis that providing DSS alerts in regards to hypotension reduces the duration of hypotensive episodes. The core of the investigators study will be an existing electronic anesthesia record and smart-alarm decision-support system. All patients undergoing surgery at Hillcrest will be randomly assigned to routine care or to DSS support. In patients assigned to DSS support, a systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg will generate a warning within three minutes after detection. Clinicians will be free to act on the alert, ignore the alert, or to consider the provided information without acting on it. The randomization, complete anesthesia record, detailed record of hypotensive events, alerts provided, clinician responses, and SAP response, will be captured by the investigators electronic record-keeping system. The investigators primary outcome will be the duration of time the patient has a systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg. Secondary outcome will be duration of hospitalization. The investigators will assess the effect of the alert on the primary outcome of time to SBP returning to above 80 mmHg using survival analysis, with time to event censored (and considered a non-event) at either the end of surgery or end of monitoring if patient did not return to above 80 mmHg.</brief_summary>
