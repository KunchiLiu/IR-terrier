	<brief_summary>- The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC is safe and may favorably change the clinical course for an individual patient. - The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC is synergistic in anti-tumor effect as seen in preclinical models, where HDIVC creates a pro-oxidative effect that adds to the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine. - The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC may improve Progression Free Survival (PFS). - The dosage schema of 1.2 g /kg bolus infusion followed by lower dose of 0.3 g / kg infusion may create sustained elevation in Vitamin C plasma levels for increased cytotoxic effect. - The addition of HDIVC &amp; oral supplementation of Vitamin C to standard treatment with gemcitabine may improve quality of life for patients with comparison to prior to treatment start of this protocol. - CA 19-9 and inflammatory markers may show trends for patients in this trial.</brief_summary>
