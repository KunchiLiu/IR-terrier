	<brief_title>Validation of the Korean Version of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire in Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First, the original version of WIQ will be translated into Korean, then it will be translated into English, again. The translated version will be sent to the original author to compare with the original version. After correcting, the Korean version will be completed. The patients with peripheral arterial disease will fill in the Korean version of WIQ before starting treatments. Baseline results of arterial function test, toe-brachial index and treadmill test will be recorded. Three months later, the patients will complete the questionnaire again. Arterial function test, toe-brachial index and treadmill test also will be taken again after treatment and the correlation of WIQ and other exams will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
