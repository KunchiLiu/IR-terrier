	<brief_summary>This trial is a single-blind, cross-over design. Up to three patients with confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma and up to three healthy volunteers will receive two doses of 20.0 (± 3) mCi of intravenously administered 99mTc MIP 1404 (preparation A or preparation B). Whole-body planar scintigraphic images will be acquired at various time points on the day of study drug administration. A pelvic SPECT/CT image will be acquired on the day of study drug administration. Blood will be collected for pharmacokinetic measurements following study drug administration. Each participant will receive an initial study drug administration (preparation A) and a second study drug administration (preparation B) approximately 7 to 21 days later. A final follow-up visit will occur approximately 2 - 3 weeks after the second study drug administration.</brief_summary>
