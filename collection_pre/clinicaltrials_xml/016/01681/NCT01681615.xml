	<brief_summary>The investigators want to find new challenge test for Acetylsalicylic hypersensitivity / Aspirin hypersensitivity. The investigators suggest that this new test will be as efficient as the already established protocols in terms of sensitivity and specificity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Challenge Test for Acetylsalicylic Acid Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypersensitivity to Acetylsalicylic Acid or Aspirin (and other NSAIDS) is a condition that affects up to 2,5% of the population. Most cases are seen in a complex of such hypersensitivity with chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and asthma. Despite research in finding a reliable in-vitro-test for the condition, challenge tests are still considered gold standard. So far oral, nasal, inhalation and intravenous routes of administration has been described in literature.</detailed_description>
