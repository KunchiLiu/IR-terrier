	<brief_summary>This research study is being conducted to examine the effects of daily inorganic nitrite treatment on the cardiometabolic and hormonal disturbances observed in overweight/obese adults with the metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Ultimately, oral nitrite therapy may have a major impact on the prevention and treatment of both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Nitrite in Adults With Metabolic Syndrome and Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. Several studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetable rich diets significantly reduced blood pressure and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease in general, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical and clinical research over the last decade has revealed the important vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with regards to reduction in blood pressure, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. More recent findings suggest that inorganic nitrate and nitrite therapy may be involved in the regulation of glucose-insulin homeostasis. For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrite salt represents a rational avenue of exploration for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, whereby nitrite would ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption which can be further oxidized to nitrate via the enterosalivary circulation pathway. In this pathway, about 25% of circulating nitrate is concentrated in the saliva and reduced to nitrite by commensal mouth bacteria with nitrate reductase enzymes. The proposal is the first human study to investigate the inorganic nitrite effects (in any form) on insulin sensitivity in a patient population. This will be the second human trial using orally delivered nitrite (previously as aqueous solution).</detailed_description>
