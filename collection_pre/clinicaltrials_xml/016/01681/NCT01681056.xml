	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Autosuggestion for Quality of Life of Geriatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Geriatric patients diagnosed with multipathology after getting information and signing informed consent will be included in this trial. Autosuggestion was created by patients according to their preferences, modified by researcher to accomplish autosuggestion principles, recorded in a tape to be heard by walkman daily for 30 days. Intervention and control groups received usual standard medical therapy. Baseline data were collected within one week after admission. Then the subject will be followed up for 30 days. Primary outcome was quality of life measured by COOP chart, analyze using on treatment analysis. Secondary outcomes were serum cortisol, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, IFN-ϒ (Interferon gamma), and N Acetyl Aspartat/ creatine ratio in limbic and paralimbic system by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.</detailed_description>
