	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting eligible patients for the purposes of assessing the temporal aspects and rates of Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI), based on the agreed-upon case definition so that the numbers needed for a pivotal study can be better estimated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial for the Safety and Effectiveness of a Novel Antimicrobial-Coated Foley Catheter for Reduction of CAUTI.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be a prospective, single site, randomized clinical investigation comparing the safety and effectiveness of the ICET TIC antimicrobial Foley catheter, against the infection control standard-of-care, the BARD ® LUBRI-SIL® I.C. Foley catheter. Approximately 160 patients will be screened. The study has been designed to enroll approximately 120 eligible subjects to obtain about 60 evaluable subjects (30 in each arm). Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to the experimental or standard-of-care group in a 1:1 ratio.</detailed_description>
