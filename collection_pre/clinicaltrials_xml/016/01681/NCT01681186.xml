	<brief_summary>This study involves 2 parts, Part A and Part B. The purpose of Part A is to evaluate the safety and side effects of LY2940680 in healthy people. Part A will involve two groups of participants, each taking up to two single doses of LY2940680 at different dose levels. There is a minimum 14 day washout period between each of the participant's doses. The purpose of Part B is to study how much of the study drug, in capsule or tablet form, gets into the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. In addition, the effect of food and a proton pump inhibitor on LY2940680 will be studied. Part B will involve one group of participants who will take four single doses of 100 mg LY2940680. There is a minimum 7 day washout period between doses. Participants may only enroll in one part. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
