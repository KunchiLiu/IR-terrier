	<criteria>• The patient must be ≥18 of age; Symptomatic ischemic heart disease and/or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia including chronic stable coronary artery disease, or acute coronary syndrome including nonSTelevation and STelevation myocardial infarction; Acceptable candidate for CABG; The patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations;4.Patients who agree to accept the followup visits. Patients can understand the study objectives psychologically and linguistically and show the sufficient compliance to the study protocol. Patients present acceptance of the risks and benefits described in the informed consent form. Angiographic Inclusion criteria: At least one lesion with a diameter stenosis &gt;70% or more suitable for coronary stent implantation in a vessel with a reference diameter ranging from 2.5 mm to 4.0 mm; Patients with multilesion or multivessel coronary disease, must have successful treatment (&lt;30% diameter stenosis visual estimate) of the first treated lesion prior to treatment of other lesions at the same brand of stent. Staged (planned) procedures must be performed within 30 days of the index procedure. General Exclusion Criteria Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated or in which patient will not be able to comply with dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 1 year; Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer, known malignancy, congestive heart failure, organ transplant recipient or candidate) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than 1 year); Left ventricular function &lt;40%; Cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic compromise requiring pressors and/or inotropes or mechanical support; Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, stainless steel alloy, cobalt chromium, Rapamycinry , styrenebutylenesstyrene or polylactic acid (PLA) polymer, and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated; Any significant medical condition which in the Investigator's opinion may interfere with the patient's optimal participation in the study; Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study or patient in inclusion in another investigational drug or device study during followup. Existing impairment in liver and kidney. Extremely tortuous and/or calcification lesions. Angiographic exclusion criteria: • Two or more chronic total occlusions in the proximal half of the epicardial coronary artery which cannot be recannalized.</criteria>
