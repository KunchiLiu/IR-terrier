	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurological disorder. Symptoms are tremor, slowness in movement, rigidity and postural instability. As the disease progresses and treatment with L-dopa is no longer sufficient, some patients may be treated with deep brain stimulation. When treated with deep brain stimulation, electrodes are inserted in the affected area of the brain and through stimulation, motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are significantly reduced. During the first year of DBS treatment patients and spouses may experience changes in everyday life and illness trajectory posing new opportunities as well as new challenges. The purpose of the study is to develop an individualised and targeted nursing program to support patients and relatives manage changes and challenges in life the first three months after Deep Brain Stimulation. The intervention is expected to generate important knowledge that will serve as a foundation for the further development of a future nursing program.</brief_summary>
