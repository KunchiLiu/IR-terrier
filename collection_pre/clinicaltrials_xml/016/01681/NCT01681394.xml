	<brief_summary>It has been evidenced that chocolate and cocoa consumption increase vasodilation and reduce blood pressure. However, the mechanisms implicated in these effects have not been elucidated yet. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in gene expression induced by the administration of a polyphenol-rich cocoa extract in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of a Polyphenol-rich Cocoa Extract on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Gene Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind and cross-over study. The intervention will consist in the administration of 250g of chocolate cream with or without the extract after 12 hours fasting. Blood samples will be taken at point 0, 2, 3 and 6 hours after the administration. At each time point, blood pressure and endothelial function (with a non-invasive method) will be measured.</detailed_description>
