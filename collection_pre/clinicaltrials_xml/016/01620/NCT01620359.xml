	<brief_summary>The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi site, international study is to develop data to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ExAblate MRgFUS system in the ablation of breast cancer and of MRI. The goal of MRgFUS ablation of breast cancer is to plan and ablate the entire tumor volume in a treatable and device accessible location.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ExAblate Focused Ultrasound Ablation of Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this international, non-randomized, single-arm study, a total of 200 patients with a positive diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with a scheduled surgical resection will be enrolled into the trial. Eligible participants will be evaluated and treated with ExAblate breast ablation prior to their planned definitive surgical treatment. After the 10 to 21 days post ExAblate therapy, study participants will have another contrast-enhanced MR imaging examination. Their planned tumor excision will then be completed no later than 14 days from the contrast-enhanced, post ExAblate procedure MR imaging examination. Additionally, the end points of the study will be compared against the CORE Pathology Lab results.</detailed_description>
