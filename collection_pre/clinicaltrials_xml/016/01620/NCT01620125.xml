	<brief_summary>Recent data suggest that the trillions of bacteria in the investigators gastrointestinal tracts (gut microbiota) can function as an environmental factor that modulates the amount of body fat. Obese individuals have an altered gut microbiota and germ-free mice are resistant to developing diet-induced obesity and have lower fasting insulin and glucose and improved glucose tolerance. Administration of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus strain in fermented milk for 12 weeks reduced adiposity and body weight in obese adults, possibly by reducing lipid absorption and inflammatory status. However, there are no studies to the investigators knowledge that address whether probiotic supplementation improves glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes patients.</brief_summary>
