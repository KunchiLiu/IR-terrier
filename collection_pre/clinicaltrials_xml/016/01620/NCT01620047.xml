	<brief_summary>Major surgery involving the knee is often associated with severe postoperative pain. Postoperative pain control remains a significant contributor to delayed recovery and length of hospital stay. Approaches to minimize postoperative pain after surgery are a matter of major concern due to the need for early mobilization, a crucial factor in good postoperative rehabilitation. Femoral nerve blocks by either continuous infusion or single injection of anesthetics provide an effective method for analgesia while minimizing the need for systemic opioid therapy, reducing the opioid induced side effects, and facilitating early ambulation. Administration of fentanyl has shown to be a highly effective method to control pain after Total Knee Replacement (TKR). The investigators hypothesize that fentanyl infusions will result in greater post-operative strength in the operative knee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Knee Strength Following Total Knee Replacement: A Double-Blinded Randomized Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects scheduled to receive a unilateral, primary total knee replacement were evaluated for eligibility in the preoperative anesthesia center. Adults, older than 18 years of age, ASA I-III were included in the study. Subjects who were either pregnant, on anticoagulant therapy, allergic to opioids, local anesthetics, chronic pain patients, history of traumatic lower extremity injury, or had a body mass index of greater than 35 kg/m2 were excluded from the study.</detailed_description>
