	<brief_title>Laparoscopy-assisted ERCP in Patients With Altered Gastric Anatome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients would have had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the past that had altered their gastric anatomy. Now they have developed bilary and/or pancreatic problems that require and ERCP. With their altered gastric anatomy a standard ERCP would not be possible. Thus they are scheduled for a Laparoscopy-assisted ERCP.</detailed_description>
