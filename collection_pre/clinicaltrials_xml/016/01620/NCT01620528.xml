	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Elagolix in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Endometriosis-Associated Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of two doses of elagolix (Dose 1 and Dose 2) versus placebo in premenopausal 18 to 49 year old women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain. Approximately 875 subjects will be enrolled into the study at approximately 160 sites. The study consists of 4 periods: 1) Washout Period (if applicable); 2) a Screening Period of up to 100 days prior to first dose; 3) a 6 month Treatment Period; and 4) a Post treatment Follow-up Period of up to 12 months (if applicable). An electronic diary will be dispensed and training provided to record endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding, and analgesic medication use for endometriosis-associated pain on a daily basis. Pregnancy testing will be performed monthly throughout the study. Subjects will be required to use non-hormonal dual contraception during the study, and will be counseled on appropriate and effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.</detailed_description>
