	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to evaluate the advanced maternal age as a rationale for performing intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI). This prospective randomized study included couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a result of advanced maternal age (≥ 37 years old). Couples were randomly allocated to receive one of two sperm selection procedures (ICSI, n = 33; or IMSI, n = 33). The groups were compared with regard to fertilization rate, percentage of high-quality embryos, implantation, pregnancy and miscarriage rates.</brief_summary>
