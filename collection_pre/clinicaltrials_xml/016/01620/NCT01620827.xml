	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that study subjects will be more responsive to follow-up phone calls made from personal cell phone numbers than from hospital landline numbers. To evaluate this, study subjects previously enrolled in a cardiac biomarker study (the Early Identification of Acute Coronary Syndrome study) were randomized to receive their follow-up phone calls (the calls associated with the Early ID study occur at 30 days and 1 year after initial enrollment) from either a hospital office landline or from the personal cell phones of the research assistants making these calls. This was done as a 1:1 randomization. The number of call attempts required to reach the study subjects were recorded as the calls were made and the date of successful follow-up was recorded once contact was made.</brief_summary>
