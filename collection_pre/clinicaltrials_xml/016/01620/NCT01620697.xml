	<brief_summary>While perirenal fat measurement is an easy reproducible surrogate of visceral fat, its value as independent parameter in predicting postoperative complications after colorectal resection remains poorly investigated. The investigators want to test the value of perirenal fat as surrogate of visceral obesity as risk factor for morbidity in colorectal surgery and to compare it to the effect of Body mass index (BMI) and Waist- Hip ratio (WHR).</brief_summary>
