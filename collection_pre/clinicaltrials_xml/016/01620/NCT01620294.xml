	<brief_summary>After open colorectal surgery the surgical site infection (SSI) is very high among abdominal surgeries. The goal of the investigators randomized, prospective, multicentric, internet-based study is to compare rate of SSI after surgery of colon and rectum by using triclosan-coated suture for abdominal wall closure. 180-180 cases in seven centres are involved in this study. Two arms are separated by computer randomization at abdominal wall closure: application of triclosan-coated and non-coated PDS suture (PDS versus PDS-Plus). Triclosan is an antiseptic material which the investigators hope will provide better local infection control at the site with reducing the risk of bacterial colonisation.</brief_summary>
