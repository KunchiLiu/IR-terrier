	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the present trial is to compare the radiation attenuation provided by XPF caps (0.5mm lead-equivalent and 0.3mm lead-equivalent) to the standard protection (fabric cap, basically no protection) as measured in % radiation attenuation) during 150 days of fluoroscopy guided cardiology interventions. The second objective is to compare the operator comfort (rated on a visual analog scale) of wearing the XPF protection caps compared to the standard fabric caps.</brief_summary>
