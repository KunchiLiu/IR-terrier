	<brief_summary>Left main stenosis use to be treated by bypass but with the improvement of angioplasty techniques, an increasing number of patients are submit to left main coronary angioplasty. Consequences of left main intra stent stenosis can be disastrous yet, for the moment, no precise recommendation concerning the follow up of these patients exist. The investigators ought to determine if stress echocardiography can predict left main intra stent stenosis as well (non inferiorly)as control angiography that use to be done.</brief_summary>
