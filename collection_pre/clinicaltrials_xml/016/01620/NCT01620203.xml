	<brief_summary>Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) is an important morbidity affecting premature infants and can have considerable effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. The investigators showed that preterm infants with severe ICH have decreased cerebral oxygenation several weeks after the hemorrhage. The mechanisms involved in this state of decreased cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants and the effects on cerebral function are unknown. This longitudinal observation study will evaluate physiologic parameters to determine trends in cerebral oxygenation and function in preterm infants with ICH in comparison to infants without ICH.</brief_summary>
