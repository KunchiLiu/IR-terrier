	<brief_summary>The study seeks to evaluate the condition of patients 5 years after having undergone partial knee replacement for localized osteoarthritis of the knee. Participating patients will voluntarily undergo detailed evaluation of clinical and radiologic outcomes 5 years after surgery. The aims of the study are to describe the survivorship of the prostheses and the clinical results of patients, and to elucidate and describe the natural history disease of the untreated knee joint compartments after a partial replacement. Patients who were operated by the principal investigator 5 years previously will be invited to participate. The study is observational in nature; there is no element of experimentation or test of an intervention.</brief_summary>
