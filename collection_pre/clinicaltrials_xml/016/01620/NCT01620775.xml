	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess: Hypothesis #1: That there is a significant central pain component in a distinct subset of patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis(KOA), Chronic low back pain(CLBP), painful diabetic neuropathy(PDN.) Hypothesis # 2: To establish a reliable strategy for differentiation of central pain predominant from peripheral pain predominant knee osteoarthritis(KOA), chronic low back pain(CLBP)and peripheral diabetic neuropathy(PDN) patients using clinical features, experimental pain testing and magnetic resonance(MR) Spectroscopy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will identify clinical and neuroimaging markers in chronic pain in an effort to provide individual-based treatments. This study will differentiate chronic pain subjects (knee osteoarthritis, low back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy) into two groups: those who have central pain predominant symptoms and those who have peripheral pain predominant symptoms. The response to medical treatment between these two groups is quite different, thus a reliable strategy to correctly categorize chronic pain sufferers offers the opportunity to provide targeted, effective treatments. Chronic pain is a prevalent problem in the VA veteran population with significant associated costs; in particular knee osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy are common in this population. The proposed study will use different clinical pain tests and advanced neuroimaging techniques to improve our understanding of chronic pain and improve patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
