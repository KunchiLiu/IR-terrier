	<brief_title>The Efficacy of the no!no!Back for Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The no!no!Back is an electrically operated, continuous passive motion device including a platform that performs angular oscillations. The device is intended to be used at home as an accessory for relieving of mild to moderate low back pain (LBP). This study is designed to determine the efficacy of daily use home use with the no!no!Back device during 3 weeks and to assess the sustained effect 3 weeks later. Up to 30 subjects will be randomized to either an immediate treatment (IT) group that will receive the no!no!Back device at the baseline visit, or to the wait-list control (WLC) group that will receive the device 3 weeks later. The evaluation will include level of pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS), functional health status by Oswestry disability index (ODI), and subject satisfaction.</detailed_description>
