	<brief_summary>Percutaneous tracheostomy in Intensive care unit (ICU) is performed with the use of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope inside the conventional single lumen endotracheal tube owned by the patients. This situation may lead to many disadvantages for ventilation and airway protection of critically ill patients during the procedures. The use of double lumen endotracheal tube dedicated to the percutaneous tracheostomies may: 1. improve the ventilation of patients during the procedure, 2. protect the posterior tracheal wall from damage related to the different step of tracheostomies, 3. protect the lungs from blood and secretions coming down from the chosen site of tracheostomy. So the aim of this study is to evaluate the oxygenation, gas exchange, ventilation and complications of percutaneous tracheostomies performed in ICU with a dedicated double lumen endotracheal tube.</brief_summary>
