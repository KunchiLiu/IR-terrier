	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in nursing home residents, and bacteriuria is the greatest trigger for antimicrobial therapy in the nursing home setting. The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of two oral cranberry capsules per day in the reduction of bacteriuria plus pyuria in female nursing home residents. These aims will be accomplished by conducting a double blind randomized placebo controlled efficacy trial of two oral cranberry capsules daily versus placebo in a cohort of Connecticut female nursing home residents.</brief_summary>
