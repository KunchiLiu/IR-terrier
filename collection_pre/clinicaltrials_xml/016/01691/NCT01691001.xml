	<brief_summary>Although the aetiology of emergence agitation (EA) derives from multiple factors, it is a frequent side effect of sevoflurane anaesthesia in children. Dexmedetomidine, a potent selective Î±2-adrenergic agonist, can reduce the doses of hypnotics, opioids, analgesics, and anaesthetics that must be concomitantly administered. This study was conducted to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine infusion on sevoflurane requirements and recovery profiles with EA in children undergoing ambulatory surgery.</brief_summary>
