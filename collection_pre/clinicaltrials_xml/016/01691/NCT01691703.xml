	<brief_summary>A difficult tracheal intubation can be a problem, even if one has taken all precautions. A possible solution can be using a videolaryngoscope in conjunct with the Bonfils® intubation scope. As such, the videolaryngoscope can be used to achieve the best possible view and space of the laryngeal inlet for the insertion and manoeuvring of the Bonfils® intubation scope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Technique for Difficult Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this blinded, unrandomised trial the investigators would like to investigate the change in Cormack and Lehane grade when using both videolaryngoscope (Macintosh videolaryngoscope, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and Bonfils® (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). They also want to record the success of intubation and the time needed until successful endotracheal intubation when using this technique as well as complications (trauma to the oral cavity, dental trauma, and regurgitation seen by the anaesthesiologist) that may occur. Also saturation (SpO2) at the end of the procedure will be noted and adjuncts that are used.</detailed_description>
