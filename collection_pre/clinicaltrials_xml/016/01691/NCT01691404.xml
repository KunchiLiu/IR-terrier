	<brief_summary>Flavonoid-rich foods such as tea and cocoa have been identified as having a blood pressure-lowering effect. Part of this effect is thought to be due to the flavonoid content of these foods although it is currently unknown which flavonoids play a role. Epicatechin is one the major flavonoids in cocoa while quercetin is largely found in tea. During this study the investigators plan to investigate the effects of pure epicatechin and quercetin supplementation on vascular function and blood pressure in untreated (prehypertensive) subjects by way of a three-armed double-blind crossover intervention. Participants will sequentially consume supplements containing quercetin, epicatechin or placebo for a period of 4 weeks. Before and after this 4 week period, measurements of vascular function and blood pressure will be taken. The investigators hypothesize that the supplementation of epicatechin and quercetin will improve vascular function and blood pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Effects of Epicatechin and Quercetin Supplementation on Vascular Function and Blood Pressure (FLAVO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By means of a three-armed double-blind crossover intervention, the effects of pure flavonoid supplementation will be investigated. The products under investigation will be epicatechin and quercetin-3-glucoside. Subjects will be asked to consume either 160mg of quercetin-3-glucoside, 100mg of epicatechin or a placebo capsule for a period of 4 weeks. Measurements of vascular function and blood pressure will be taken before and after each 4-week intervention period. A 4-week washout period will be planned between each intervention. Measurements of vascular function will include flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave analysis, pulse wave velocity and vasomotion as well as biomarkers of inflammation and vascular function.</detailed_description>
