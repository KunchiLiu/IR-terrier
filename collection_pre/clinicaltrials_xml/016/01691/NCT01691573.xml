	<brief_summary>The main objective of the European Pediatric Catheter Ablation Registry is to collect data on ablation procedures in the European pediatric population in order to improve the management of this subset of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Pediatric Catheter Ablation Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation has revolutionized the management of cardiac arrhythmias in patients and has become first-line therapy for managing many pediatric patients with atrioventricular accessory pathway or atrioventricular nodal-mediated supraventricular tachycardia. Cardiac ablation in children is not a standardized procedure as in adults as evidence gaps still have to be filled. On a European perspective, lack of a dedicated scientific society has limited so far the collection and sharing of data among the most experienced centers. Actually there are no sufficient data available about the management of pediatric patients undergoing ablation in clinical practice, in particular regarding indications, methodology and clinical follow-up.</detailed_description>
