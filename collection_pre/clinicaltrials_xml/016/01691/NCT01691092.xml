	<brief_summary>This study is designed to look at that involvement of a process in the brain called the glutamate system in depression. Participants will undergo a screening session, up to two fMRI scans, and up to three PET scans, as well as cognitive testing at each scan session. For one of the PET scans, a drug (either ketamine or n-acetyl cysteine) will be administered. Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize administration of ketamine or n-acetylcysteine (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5. Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills after drug challenge. Hypothesis 3: The investigators hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in MRI measures post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis. Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5 availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging of mGLuR5 With Drug Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: To determine the acute effect of medication-induced glutamate release on mGluR5 availability in human subjects. Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize administration of ketamine or n-acetylcysteine (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5 availability. Aim 2: To determine if glutamate release via administration of ketamine or NAC has pro cognitive benefits. Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills after drug challenge. Aim 3: To determine if there is synaptogenesis detectable by PET and MRI post ketamine or NAC within a week of drug challenge (at the time of greatest antidepressant response). Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in MRI measures, post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis. Aim 4: To determine if there is a difference in reduction of mGluR5 availability after ketamine administration when radiotracer is administered bolus as compared to bolus to constant infusion in the same subjects (ABP688 radiotracer only). Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5 availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.</detailed_description>
