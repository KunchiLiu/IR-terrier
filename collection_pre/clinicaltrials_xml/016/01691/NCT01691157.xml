	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of an evidence based exercise program for shoulder impingement. Approximately 1% of adults consult their General Practitioner (GP) with shoulder pain each year, making it the third most common reason for musculoskeletal GP consultations in the UK. A further 50% of these patients are diagnosed with subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) (shoulder impingement syndrome) and commonly referred for physiotherapy treatment. This trial aims to compare the effectiveness of an evidence based exercise protocol with usual physiotherapy care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise in the Physiotherapy Management of Shoulder Impingement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physiotherapy management of shoulder impingement frequently involves exercise, however there is little evidence underpinning exercise prescription and outcomes are poor. Few trials have investigated which muscles should be targeted and how they should be strengthened with respect to the mode, frequency, duration, intensity and progression. This is a randomized controlled trial(RCT) investigating the effectiveness of an evidence based exercise program for shoulder impingement. This research may have an impact on how physiotherapists provide exercise programs to patients with shoulder impingement.</detailed_description>
