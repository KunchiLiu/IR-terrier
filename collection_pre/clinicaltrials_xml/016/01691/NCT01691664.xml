	<brief_summary>Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells show cytolytic activity against tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining Radiation therapy with adoptive cellular therapy after surgery may be more effective than uses radiation therapy alone in treating esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Esophageal Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>cytologically or histologically confirmed esophageal carcinoma Tumor extension beyond muscularis propria and/or nodal involvement without evidence of M1 disease Prior en bloc resection, with curative intent, of all known tumor No metastatic disease Age: &gt; 18 Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 At least 3 weeks since prior surgery Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow Blood exams qualified for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl, neutrophil ≥1.5×109/L and platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L, creatinine ≤1.5 UNL All patients must be evaluated by a radiation oncologist prior to enrollment to ensure patient is appropriate for radiotherapy Informed consent signed Patients with metastatic disease. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Patients with poor bone marrow, liver and kidney functions, which would make radiation therapy intolerable Patients with contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or haematemesis</criteria>
