	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Vanoxerine for Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter to Normal Sinus Rhythm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vanoxerine has important antiarrhythmic properties and may prove effective in converting AF/AFL to sinus rhythm in subjects with a history of AF. This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-modifying study in subjects who have been in symptomatic AF or AFL for more than 3 hours and less than 7 days as dated by symptoms, who have AF/AFL documented on ECG at the time of study drug administration, and who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine compared to placebo following oral administration.</detailed_description>
