	<brief_summary>No clinical trials with PBF-509 in humans have been performed to date. Only preclinical studies have been done to assess the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, the safety and the toxicological profile of the PBF-509. An initial testing of PBF-509 in humans is planned, starting with the first-into-man clinical trial where a single oral, dose-escalating, and placebo-controlled design will be implemented.</brief_summary>
