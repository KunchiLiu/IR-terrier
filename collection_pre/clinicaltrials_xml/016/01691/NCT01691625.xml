	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show if the adoptive cellular therapy with autologous dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) combined with concurrent chemoradiation could improve the quality of life of the patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, compared with concurrent chemoradiation only.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Age: &gt; 18 Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 At least one measurable tumor lesions according to the RECIST criteria. Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow Blood exams qualified for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl, neutrophil ≥1.5×109/L and platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L, creatinine ≤1.5 UNL Informed consent signed Patients with metastatic disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Patients with poor bone marrow, liver and kidney functions, which would make chemotherapy intolerable Patients with contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or haematemesis coexisted morbidities that investigators believed not suitable for chemoradiation</criteria>
