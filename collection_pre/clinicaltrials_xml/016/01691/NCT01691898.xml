	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pinatuzumab vedotin (DCDT2980S) or polatuzumab vedotin (DCDS4501A) in combination with rituximab (RTX), as well as a combination of polatuzumab vedotin with obinutuzumab in participants with relapsed or refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).</brief_summary>
