	<brief_summary>The rationale for this study is to further explore if development of antibodies against TNF-α blocking agents is associated with reduced clinical effect/worsened clinical outcome. An important aspect of the study is to carry out an exploratory analysis of the immunogenicity of the 4 recommended TNF-α blockers in the treatment of RA in Denmark, using the same cell-based assay.</brief_summary>
