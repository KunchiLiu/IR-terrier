	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin A for the Treatment of Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subcutaneous injection of botulinum toxin type A will be performed at two points in a nasal and temporal extent of the orbicularis muscle of a group of patients with keratoconus (Botulinum toxin A group).The idea is to evaluate the change in palpebral fissure in patients from group botulinum toxin A over a period of 18 months.The measurements of the palpebral fissure will be performed by the Image J (version 1.34s) program, developed by the National Institutes of Health (USA).The unit of measure is the millimetre.The patients of the botulinum toxin A group will be compared with a control group, without any intervention.</detailed_description>
