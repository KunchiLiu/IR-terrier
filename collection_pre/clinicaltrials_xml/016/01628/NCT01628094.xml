	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety , efficacy and tolerability of the combination treatment RO5466731, RO5190591, ritonavir and Copegus (ribavirin) with or without RO5024048 in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. In Part 1, treatment-na誰ve patients will be randomized to receive treatment with RO5466731, RO5190591 plus ritonavir, and Copegus, with or without RO5024048. In Part 2, further treatment-na誰ve patients will receive a successful regimen from Part 1, or a reduced intensity regimen, and patients who have previously experienced null response to interferon-based treatment will be added to the study.</brief_summary>
