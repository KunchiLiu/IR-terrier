	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that the long-term results of rehabilitation and subsequent aging after Brain Trauma depend on brain's premorbid anatomical (structural) and functional (cognitive, emotional) reserves. The purpose of this study are: 1. to determine whether such reserves exist. 2. to study their convergent and discriminant validity. 3. to study their characteristics.</brief_summary>
