	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of SPM 962 in advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients in a multi-center, placebo-controlled study following once-daily multiple transdermal doses of SPM 962 within a range of 4.5 to 36.0 mg (12 weeks of dose titration/maintenance period). Recommended maintenance dose range is also to be investigated with distribution of the maintenance dose and accumulated response rate of efficacy.</brief_summary>
