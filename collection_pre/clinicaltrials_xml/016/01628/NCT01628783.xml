	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators use clinical, biological and imaging markers to develop predictive markers for remission from depression. The investigators compare individuals who have received placebo to individuals who have received 10 mg of escitalopram for one week. In this double-blind, randomized study the investigators a) compare the groups to observe the short-term effects of escitalopram and b) study the predictive value of these observations with respect to remission. Measures include, but are not restricted to, limbic emotional reactivity as assessed by fMRI, emotional processing, emotional memory, autobiographical memory.</brief_summary>
