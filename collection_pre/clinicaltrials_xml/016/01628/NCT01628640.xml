	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a viral agent called vesicular stomatitis virus for the use in patients with liver cancer. The study virus has a gene inserted into it which will allow for the production of interferon beta, which is a substance that will have the dual functions of restricting the spread of the virus to the tumor cells and not healthy liver cells and also to have some independent anti-cancer activity. Although the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of delivery of this viral agent to people, patients may benefit clinically by having shrinkage or stabilization of their tumor or reduction in their cancer related symptoms (e.g. pain). - Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-interferon beta (IFN-beta) (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory or intolerant to sorafenib therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the tumor response rate and overall survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFN-beta in patients with HCC by measurement of VSV-IFN-beta in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). II. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFN-beta by way of measuring serum interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFN-beta listed above. III. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-hIFN-beta specific) and natural killer (NK) cell responses. IV. Assess status of human interferon beta pathway pre/post therapy in tumor/normal liver tissue (status of IFN-beta, interferon stimulated gene factor 3 [ISGF3 complex constituting signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/2 and p48 (ISGF3 Î³)]). V. Assess phosphorylation of STAT1/2 post-therapy. VI. Evaluate transcription of interferon mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL], 2'-5' oligoadenylate/ribonucleic acid [RNA]se L proteins, heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility class antigens and interferon regulatory factor [IRF]-7). VII. Assess presence of VSV in tumor/normal liver subsequent to administration of VSV-human IFN-beta (hIFN- beta). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta intratumorally on day 1. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 3 years.</detailed_description>
