	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: 1. Specific physiotherapy interventions will decrease pain, improve pelvic floor motor control, increase self efficacy, improve sexual function and decrease pain catastrophizing behaviour in women with provoked vulvar vestibulodynia. This study will look at specific physiotherapy treatment interventions to see if they decrease pain, improve pelvic floor motor control, increase self efficacy, improve sexual function and decrease pain catastophizing behaviour. Participants will fill out a questionnaire on their pain symptoms and complete standardized scales prior to starting treatment and after 4 sessions to determine change due to interventions. 2. A combination of physiotherapy, group educational sessions and group cognitive behavioural therapy will have better outcomes than physiotherapy alone. Results of physiotherapy intervention alone will be compared to results of those treated with physiotherapy, group educational sessions and group cognitive behavioural therapy at a separate treatment centre. Physiotherapy interventions and outcome measures are the same between both groups. Justification: Standard treatment is hard to identify as many approaches are taken, none with any evidence to support them. This study aims to look at specific techniques (pelvic floor coordination and relaxation exercises, education on female sexual response and pain pathophysiology education) to see if there is a benefit.</brief_summary>
