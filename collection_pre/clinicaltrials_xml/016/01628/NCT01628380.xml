	<brief_summary>Aim of the Study is to compare two-years disease-free survival of Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC, CDDP+Paclitaxel) vs CRS alone in Stage IIIC unresectable epithelial tubal/ovarian cancer with partial or complete response after 3 cycles of 1st line chemotherapy (CBDCA +Paclitaxel).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Trial Evaluating Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Upfront Treatment of Stage IIIC Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible: Female adult women (18 to 70 years old) patients, with epithelial ovarian/tubal (FIGO stage IIIC) with a Fagotti modified Laparoscopic Scoring System ≥ 4 who will show a complete or partial clinical response(RECIST 1.1) after 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel). Duration of recruitment: 2 years. Sample size has been calculated to reach a confidence level of 95% with a power of 80%, considering a 45% and 75% disease-free survival at 2 years in CRS and CRS+HIPEC group respectively. Sample size will be 47 patients for each group. After CRS, only patients with adequate cytoreduction (CC 0-1, residual tumor ≤ 2.5mm) will be randomized. Patients with suboptimal cytoreduction (CC 2-3, residual tumor &gt; 2.5mm) are not suitable for randomization. The drug schedule elected in the current study is Cisplatin (CDDP) (100 mg/m2 of body surface area) + Paclitaxel (175mg/m2 of body surface area). Closed/open technique, as preferred. Duration: 90 minutes. Mean Intra-abdominal Temperature: 42°C. Primary Endpoint: 2-years disease-free survival. Secondary Endpoints: 1-year, 3- and 5-years disease-free survival; 1 month, 1-year, 3- and 5-years overall survival; toxicity induced by HIPEC using the NCI CTC criteria; one month and six months morbidity; duration of operation; return of bowel function; length of hospital stay; return to normal activity; six months and one year QOL, using the SF-36 v1.0; percentage of patients in both arms completing the scheduled postoperative chemotherapy; Subgroup analysis: PCI ≤ 15; pts. ≤ 40yrs. Main topics of this Study: Focused only on upfront treatment of primary disease. Select platinum-sensible patients (responders to platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Take advantage of NACT to maximize chances for cytoreduction. Standardized strategy for CRS: radical surgery, associated to any surgical procedure needed to obtain a zero or ≤ 0.25cm residual tumor (peritonectomy, bowel resection, diaphragmatic stripping, gastric resection, etc.). Pelvic and peri-aortic lymphadenectomy is not chosen as standard procedure, but should warrant adequate staging. Compare only the effect of HIPEC.</detailed_description>
