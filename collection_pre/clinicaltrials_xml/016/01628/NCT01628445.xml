	<brief_summary>Liraglutide is a GLP1 agonist used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and is is asociated with improved blood glucose control, weight loss and low rates of hypoglycemia when used alone or in combination with metformin. Liraglutide has not been extensively tested in people with type 2 diabetes who are taking relatively large doses of insulin (&gt;50 U/day). Often these patients are insulin resistant and despite using large doses of insulin are not able to achieve glucose targets. The rationale for this study is to assess if the addition of liraglutide in addition to usual care versus placebo can improve blood glucose levels in people not achieving a target HbA1C of less than 7.0%.</brief_summary>
