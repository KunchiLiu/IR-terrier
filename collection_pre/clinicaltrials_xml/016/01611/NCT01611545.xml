	<brief_summary>The aim of this biospecimen repository is to evaluate an individual's genotype, identify the variances, and understand how they relate to treatment with clopidogrel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics and Effective Treatment With Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this project is to distinguish genetic profiles that will assist a practitioner in determining the right dose or alternate medication for the patient. In partnership with the genetics team of the Avera Institute for Human Genetics and physicians with the Avera Heart Hospital of South Dakota and North Central Heart Institute, the research team will perform genetic analysis to identify genetic variances.</detailed_description>
