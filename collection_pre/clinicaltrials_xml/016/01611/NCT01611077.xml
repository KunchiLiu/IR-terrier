	<brief_summary>The investigators want to find out if a treatment with a new combination of two different antihypertensive drugs (olmesartan and amlodipine) in one tablet in patients with moderately elevated blood pressure is more effective than treatment with just one substance (candesartan). All antihypertensive treatment will be ceased for two weeks to achieve comparable baseline conditions. Treatment is then started with the single substance. After six weeks, therapy is changed to another single substance and after a further six weeks, to the fixed combination tablet. Blood pressure is determined by office measurements taken by the doctor and via long-term ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Participants may be male or female and must be over 18 years of age.</brief_summary>
