	<brief_summary>Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) is a novel proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. In this Phase I study, the DT-LM was evaluated for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients with advance solid tumors. It was also evaluated for pharmacokinetic and anti-tumor effects of DT-LM compared to commerical docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) for Injection in Chemotherapy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere®), given by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, has contributed significantly to the treatment of a variety of malignancies, such as ovarian, breast, gastric, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as head and neck cancer and some other cancers. In the preclinical, DT-LM showed reduced toxicity (especially myelosuppression）and comparable therapeutic efficacy. In clinic, it is believed that DT-LM will offer fewer side effects to the patient at similar doses, and possibly greater effectiveness when used at higher doses. DT-LM could not only avoid the serious hypersensitivity reactions caused by Tween 80, but also be stable, safe and convenient for clinical administration. This study is designed to determine the following: - The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of DT-LM. - The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel following intravenous administration of DT-LM. - Any anti-tumor effects of DT-LM. Controlled trial is also carrying out to reveal the differences in safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between DT-LM and Taxotere.</detailed_description>
