	<brief_summary>Therapeutic alliance, and drug observance are major difficulties in the care of persons presenting schizophrenic symptomatology. They appear to be linked to insight, the consciousness that one has of his troubles. Nurse care in psychiatry aims at improving it, but usually without using specific evaluation tool. Insight is usually not evaluated during care, and its evolution is also not known, although it is highly probable that a positive evolution of insight for a person in hospital correlated to an adapted and optimal care by the medical and nursing teams. The investigators do not know examples of insight evaluation during a sequence of hospital care, or any evidence of insight variation in relation to evolution abilities of some schizophrenic patients cared in hospital. The investigators propose here to evaluate insight in people presenting schizophrenia or related troubles, at the beginning of hospitalization (I1) and 1 month later (I2), to better characterize insight variations, and identify the sociodemographic, clinical and therapeutic variables linked to it.</brief_summary>
