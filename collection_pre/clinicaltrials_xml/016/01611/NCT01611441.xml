	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to better understand how specific proteins/markers in blood, urine, synovial fluid (a lubricating fluid secreted by the membrane lining the joints), and joint tissue are involved in osteoarthritis of the knee. The aim is to investigate if there is a correlation between x-ray results, specific proteins/markers and different types of pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The study consists of 3 visits over 3-20 days and the last visit will be the day of surgery.</brief_summary>
