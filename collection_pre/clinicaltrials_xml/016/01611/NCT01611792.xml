	<brief_summary>Low back pain affects 80% of Americans at some time during their lives. Although recovery usually occurs within 6 months, there is a 50% recurrence within one year's time. It has long been thought that poor control of trunk muscle may lead to abnormal forces across the spine, which then damage local spinal structures, thus, leading to low back pain. However, the investigators know little about the function of specific trunk muscles in healthy subjects during various activities of daily life. Furthermore, the precise muscle dysfunction associated with low back pain has not been well characterized at all. In addition, the investigators know little about which exercise protocol is most beneficial for particular subgroups of people with low back pain. Thus, the purposes of this study are to learn more about: 1) how trunk muscles are affected by low back pain; 2) which exercises might be most beneficial for people with certain kinds of low back pain; and 3) how these exercises influence trunk muscle function. By having a better understanding of which trunk muscles are affected by low back pain, rehabilitation specialists can design exercise programs and therapeutic interventions that are more specific and more effective.</brief_summary>
