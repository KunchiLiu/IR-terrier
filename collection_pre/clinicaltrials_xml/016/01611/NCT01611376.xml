	<brief_title>Impedance Cardiography During Major Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrathoracic structures have relatively constant resistance except the influence of changing diameter of aorta. Great vessels in thorax has the lowest resistance, and their diameter changes by the beats of the heart. As their diameter increases, their resistance decreases. ICG measures the difference between the resistances caused by heartbeats, and calculates cardiac output. But during the surgery, there are many interfering electrical currents made by electro cautery, patient positioning, and internal organ handling. Therefore, it has been thought that ICG is not a valid tool for measuring cardiac output during the surgery. The investigators validated ICG's usefulness during the surgery, by comparing it with Floctac/Vigileo.</detailed_description>
