	<brief_title>Surgery or Chemotherapy in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer (SOC 1 Trial)?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer with a positive SCR score randomized to secondary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age at recurrence â‰¥ 18 years Patients with platinumsensitive, first relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (EOC, PPC, FTC), which is defined as those with treatment free interval of 6 months or more. A complete secondary cytoreduction predicting score, iMODEL [Tian WJ, Ann Surg Oncol 2012,19(2):597604]&lt;=4.7, including FIGO stage (0 or 0.8); residual disease after primary surgery (0 or 1.5); Progressionfree interval (0 or 2.4); PS ECOG (0 or 2.4); Ca125 (0 or 1.8); and ascites at recurrence (0 or 3.0). Assessed by the experienced surgeons, complete resection of all recurrent disease is possible. If single lesion outside the peritoneal cavity can be resected, MRI/CT or PET/CT scan should be performed to exclude simultaneous intraabdominal lesions. Patients who have given their signed and written informed consent and their consent. Patients with borderline tumors as well as nonepithelial tumors. Patients for intervaldebulking, or for secondlook surgery, or palliative surgery planned. Impossible to assess the resectability or evaluate the score. Radiological signs suggesting complete resection is impossible. More than one prior chemotherapy. Second relapse or more Patients with second or other malignancies who have been treated by surgery, if the treatment might interfere with the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer or if major impact on prognosis is expected. Progression during chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months after firstline therapy Any contradiction not allowing surgery and/or chemotherapy 1. Accompanied by hypoxia serious chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2. Uncontrolled hypertension, cerebrovascular accident/ Stroke, myocardial infarct, unstable angina, untreated thrombosis, chronic congestive heart failure, or serious arrhythmia in need of medicine. 3. Severe hepatitis, history of liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency 4. Active ulcer history, abdominal wall fistula, perforation of gastrointestinal tract, or Intraabdominal abscess, or simultaneously apply treatment/prevent ulcers therapy. 5. Uncontrolled diabetes 6. Uncontrolled epilepsy need longterm antiepileptic treatment. Any medication induced considerable risk of surgery, e.g. estimated bleeding due to oral anticoagulating agents, or bevacizumab)</criteria>
