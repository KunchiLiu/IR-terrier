	<brief_summary>Is the early removal of Foley catheter safe in patients undergoing general thoracic surgery with an epidural catheter in place?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early or Late Foley Removal After Thoracotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesis that removing the foley catheter within 48 hours after a thoracotomy in patients that have an epidural catheter will result in an increase in the rate of urinary infections and the need for reinsertion of the foley. We have designed a randomized trial to test this hypothesis.</detailed_description>
