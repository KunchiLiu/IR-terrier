	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Be ≥12 years of age. 2. Weigh ≥ 40 kg. 3. Be a recipient of stem cell or solid organ transplantation. 4. Have documented CMV infection in blood or plasma, with a screening value of ≥1,000 DNA copies/mL. 5. Have a current CMV infection that is resistant (known CMV genetic mutations) or refractory (clinical failure to respond) to treatment with ganciclovir/valganciclovir and/or foscarnet. 6. If female, be either postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or have a negative pregnancy test prior to randomization. 7. Be able to swallow tablets. 8. If adult, provide written informed consent. If child (age &lt;18 years), have a parent/legal guardian who is willing and able to provide written informed consent (with assent from the child when appropriate). 9. Be assessed by the investigator to determine whether prophylaxis for nonCMV herpesvirus infections (e.g., herpes simplex virus [HSV type 1 and type 2] and varicella zoster virus [VZV]) is appropriate according to institutional guidelines or standard practices, keeping in mind that maribavir is not active in vitro against these viruses. Exclusion Criteria 1. Be receiving any other antiCMV agent(s). 2. Have a current CMV infection that is considered resistant or refractory due to inadequate adherence to prior oral antiCMV treatment. 3. Have severe vomiting, diarrhea, or other severe gastrointestinal illness within 24 hours prior to the time of enrollment. 4. Have severe hepatic impairment. 5. Require mechanical ventilation or vasopressors for hemodynamic support at the time of enrollment. 6. Have expected survival less than 6 weeks. 7. Be pregnant or breastfeeding. 8. Other clinically significant medical or surgical condition.</criteria>
