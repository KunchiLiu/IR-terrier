	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria selected: Histologically verified diagnosis if MALT lymphoma of any localization Measurable disease upon diagnosis or first or greater relapse after local therapy, prior chemotherapy orHPeradication. In addition, also in patients with gastric MALTlymphoma judged refractory to HPeradication by a minimum followup of 12 months after successfulHPeradication will be included in the study. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma and no evidence of HPinfection may be enrolled immediately Ann Arbor Stage IIV In case of prior treatment with Rituximab, the presence of CD20 on lymphoma cells must have been demonstrated before inclusion in the trial. ECOG performance status of 0,1 or 2 Patient must be able to take aspirin daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin Exclusion Criteria selected: Lymphoma histology other than MALT lymphoma or MALT lymphoma with a diffuse large cell lymphoma ("high grade lymphoma") component Use of any investigational agent within 28 days prior to initiation of treatment with lenalidomide History of malignancy other than squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within the last 5 years Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within the last 4 weeks Evidence of CNS involvement A history of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant and adversely affecting compliance to study drugs Severe peripheral polyneuropathy Clinically significant cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or lenalidomide or rituximab</criteria>
