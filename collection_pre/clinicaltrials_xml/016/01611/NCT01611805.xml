	<brief_summary>This is an double-blind, single dose, four-period, crossover study in Japanese healthy male volunteers to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of single doses of GSK1605786A. Approximately 24 subjects will receive three treatments of 250, 500, and 1000mg GSK1605786 under fasted conditions or 500mg after food intake plus placebo in a dose ascending crossover design. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected following each dose and safety assessments will be performed. The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of GSK1605786 after single oral doses of GSK1605786 at the dose levels of 250mg, 500mg and 1000 mg under fasted conditions will be assessed. In addition, a comparison will be made between the pharmacokinetics of GSK1605786 under fed and fasted conditions.</brief_summary>
