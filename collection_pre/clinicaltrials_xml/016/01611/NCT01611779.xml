	<brief_title>FAST as a Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has become a major health problem in the United States. With prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2-4% of the population, untreated OSA has been implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure. The first and most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, utilized by an estimated 3 million Americans. CPAP is effective in reducing apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used properly. However, the nasal mask required for CPAP during sleep leads to poor acceptance and compliance rates. Published studies on CPAP have shown that only 58-8-% of patient accept CPAP therapy and further 65-90% of these patients exhibit long-term compliance with CPAP. It is widely accepted that the region behind the tongue is a major site of collapse during obstructive sleep apnea. In fact there are many surgical procedures performed currently to address tongue based collapse. These include RF ablation of the tongue base, genioglossus advancement, hyoid suspension, maxillomandibular advancement, and tongue base suspension. The current study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of tongue stabilization, and assess safety and treatment of the tongue stabilization.</detailed_description>
