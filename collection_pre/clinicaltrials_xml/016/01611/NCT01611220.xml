	<brief_title>Dissonance Inpatient Relapse Prevention Program for Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa is often successful in restoring body weight, but a high percentage of patients relapse following discharge. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a relapse prevention program during the last phase of inpatient treatment. Patients, when they achieve a BMI of 18.5, are randomly allocated to complete the standard cognitive behavior inpatient treatment (CBT-I) or to complete the standard CBT-I plus eight relapse prevention groups based on the cognitive dissonance. The intervention has been derived by the selective and indicated prevention programs using a dissonance-based approach. This intervention showed to be effective in reducing the risk for eating pathology onset. The primary outcome of the study is to assess the number of patients allocated to the two condition with a BMI equal or greater than 18.5 at 12-months after discharge.</detailed_description>
