	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single-dose, two-period, cross-over study. This study will utilize 14C radiolabeled GSK1322322 to investigate the recovery, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of GSK1322322 in 6 healthy adult male subjects through the sampling of blood, urine, and feces. Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 7 to 8 weeks i.e., 30 day screening period, two dosing periods (approximately 8 days each) and a follow up visit. The subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day 1 of the first treatment period and remain in the unit for up to approximately 16 days through the end of the second treatment period. On Day 1 of Period 1, each subject will receive 14C radiolabeled GSK1322322 as a single therapeutic intravenous (IV) dose (1000 milligrams [mg]). When the total radioactivity is &lt;1% of the administered dose in all subjects, Period 2 dosing will begin (approximately 8 days after the IV dose). On Day 1 of Period 2, each subject will receive single therapeutic oral solution dose (1200 mg). Blood, urine, bile and fecal samples will be collected during both the periods. The subject may be discharged from the unit as early as Day 8 of Period 2. Subjects will visit the study unit for the follow-up visit 7 to 10 days following discharge from the unit.</brief_summary>
