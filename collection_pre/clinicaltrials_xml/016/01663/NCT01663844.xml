	<brief_summary>This study includes two sub-trials. Both are included in this singe registration since they have parallel inclusion of participants and have been approved by the Swedish ethics board together in one application. Trial 1 includes patients with both insomnia and major or minor depression. Participants are randomized to either a combined therapist guided Internet-CBT for insomnia and depression, or to Internet-CBT for depression with an addition of a placebo intervention for insomnia. The primary purpose is to evaluate changes in insomnia and depression severity for the combination treatment compared to the depression treatment, after treatment and at 6 and 36 months follow up. A secondary purpose is to evaluate cognitive functioning before and after treatment, as well as cost effectiveness. Recruitment is done in the Stockholm County through mass media and the Internet psychiatry clinic's regular patient recruitment. Trial 2 includes patients with insomnia who do not meet criteria for major or minor depression. All participants start therapist guided Internet-CBT for insomnia. After 4 weeks patients that are judged to be at risk of treatment failure are randomized to either continued treatment or treatment with added support intended to enhance outcome. The primary purpose is to evaluate change in insomnia severity for participants who get added support, compared to continued treatment with regular support level. A secondary purpose is to evaluate cognitive functioning before and after treatment, as well as cost effectiveness. Recruitment is done in the Stockholm County through mass media and the Internet psychiatry clinic's regular patient recruitment. NOTE: The first participants in trial 1 will be regarded as pilots, due to problems with the experimental treatment: technical issues as well as problems with the design of treatment modules. These problems were corrected when discovered. 12 participants in the experimental arm were affected by these errors. The pilot participants will not be included in the main analyses of data. This was decided upon on 31st of October 2014.</brief_summary>
