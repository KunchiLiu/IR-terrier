	<brief_title>The Effects of Intra Operative Hand Reflexology for Patients Receiving Out Patient Vein Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The negative effects of anxiety and pain on surgical recovery are well documented. It is also accepted that distraction can be effective in pain reduction. This randomised controlled trial will explore the effect of intra operative hand reflexology on pain perception and anxiety during office-based surgery under local anaesthetic. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the experimental condition, in which they will receive a hand reflexology during treatment, or control condition in which they will receive usual standard care. Immediate and longer term outcomes will be explored. Eight weeks after surgery, participants will return to the clinic for a follow up appointment. While they are in the waiting area they will be asked to complete a short questionnaire to assess time taken to return to pre surgical levels of functioning, pain experienced in the first four weeks after surgery, severity of venous symptoms and satisfaction with treatment.</detailed_description>
