	<brief_summary>Introduction: Insoles and shoes are frequently prescribed to prevent foot ulcers in patients at risk of diabetes. A combination of neuropathy and foot deformities raises the risk from 1% to between 4-7% according to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, Guidelines Diabetes Care 2010. Preventative care, which includes foot care, annual inspection of the feet, education and prescription of insoles in combination with well fitting shoes are supposed to decrease the risk of ulcers and prevent amputation. Further research is, however, needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these commonly prescribed insoles. The aim of this study is to compare three different types of insoles with respect to pressure distribution. Every 6 months follow-up is assessed until 24 months is reached.</brief_summary>
