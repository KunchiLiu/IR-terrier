	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate and document physiologic and functional changes in visual performance and retinal function of patients diagnosed with albinism (a dopamine deficiency state) following a trial of oral Levodopa/carbidopa treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vision Response to Dopamine Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators propose that the retina itself in albinism is deficient in dopamine, and vision improvement will occur as a result of improved retinal function in response to the deficient neurotransmitter dopamine. This study has a pretest-posttest design in order to determine if improvement in vision is in response to replacement of deficiency (dopamine). The ERG testing and OCT will be critical determinants to confirm vision improvement as a result of improved retinal function, but are not primary outcome data. Main outcome measures will be collected at pre-treatment, 1 month, 3 months, and 4 months. Change in visual acuity as measured in logMAR by Snellen or SVEP after 3 months of treatment is the primary outcome. Patients include OCA1a patients, OCA1b, OCA2, and unclassified OCA. OCA1a patients clinically are known to have the worst vision, and physiologically have the lowest (or absent) levels of tyrosinase function (Dopamine Production). All patients will be treated with Levodopa/carbidopa 4mg/kg/day in three divided doses.</detailed_description>
