	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples to enable validation of genetic testing for diseases within a multi-disease carrier screening panel. Samples will be collected from adult women or men who have previously tested positive as carriers for various recessive conditions. These are healthy adults who carry a mutation that might place them at increased risk of having a child with a specific genetic disorder. Study participation will be open to adults that were previously tested as part of their routine medical care and where test results demonstrated positive carrier status for a specific genetic disease. Samples will be tested for the disease mutation for which the subjects provides documentation of prior testing.</brief_summary>
