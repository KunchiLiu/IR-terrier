	<brief_summary>The purpose of the international plastic bronchitis registry is to understand the natural course and long term health outcomes of subjects diagnosed with plastic bronchitis due to different types of casts. This provides essential data for identifying best practices and treatments. The secondary aim is to understand the structure of casts and mechanism of their formation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Plastic Bronchitis Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plastic bronchitis (PB) patients have casts removed during bronchoscopy as part of their routine care or that they are able to expectorate (cough out) casts naturally. The casts are normally discarded. Patients that agree to participate in the registry ship the airway casts and medical history to Dr. Bruce Rubin's Research Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond Virginia, USA. The lab evaluates the biopolymer composition and structure of the airway casts by immunohistochemistry in order to identify microscopic differences between expectorated casts of subjects with plastic bronchitis and sputum from other populations (cystic fibrosis,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and normal airways). The lab also conducts in vitro evaluation of clearability, adhesivity, cohesivity, and inflammatory mediator concentrations to better understand the nature of the disease.</detailed_description>
