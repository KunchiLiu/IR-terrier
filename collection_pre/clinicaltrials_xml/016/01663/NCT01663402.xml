	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the effect of alirocumab with placebo on the occurrence of cardiovascular events (composite endpoint of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in patients who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event 4 to 52 weeks prior to randomization and are treated with evidence-based medical and dietary management of dyslipidemia. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on secondary endpoints (any CHD event , major CHD event, any CV event, composite of all cause mortality/non-fatal MI/non-fatal ischemic stroke, all cause mortality). - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab. - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on lipid parameters.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration will be 64 months, including up to a 4-month run-in period, 60 months randomized treatment period. Number of patients aged from 18 to 64 years and &gt;= 65 years old are based on the number of randomized patients (18600 patients).</detailed_description>
