	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belimumab, in combination with azathioprine, for the maintenance of remission following a standard induction regimen in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis. The random assignment in this study is "1 to 1" which means that participants have an equal chance of receiving belimumab or placebo.</brief_summary>
