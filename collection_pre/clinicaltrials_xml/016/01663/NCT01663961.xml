	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of a Single Dose of Digoxin on the Actions in the Bodies of Healthy Subjects After Having Taken Several Doses of YM178</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects receive a single oral dose of digoxin on Day 1. A full pharmacokinetic profile of digoxin is obtained for up to 144 hours post-dose. On the morning of Day 7, after the scheduled assessments are done, the subjects leave the clinic and return on Day 9. From Day 10 up to and including Day 23, subjects receive daily oral doses of YM178 q.d. A single dose of digoxin is given in combination with YM178 on Day 18 (8 days after the first dose of YM178). On this day, a complete pharmacokinetic profile for digoxin is obtained up to 144 hours post-dose. From Day 16 up to and including Day 19, blood samples for bioanalysis of YM178 are taken regularly. In addition, vital signs, safety ECG (Electrocardiogram) measurements, safety laboratory assessments, adverse events and concomitant medications are monitored throughout the investigational period. Subjects return for a Post Study Visit 7-14 days after the last dosing occasion.</detailed_description>
