	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Relative Bioavailability of Three Formulations and Food Effect on GSK1322322 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, randomized, single dose, four period, balanced crossover study to assess in eligible healthy male or female subjects: - The relative bioavailability of the wet milled GSK1322322 tablet formulation with and without food compared to an oral mesylate salt solution. - The effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1322322 when given either orally or IV. - The absolute bioavailability of the wet milled tablet and the oral mesylate salt solution compared to the IV formulation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). QTcB &lt; 450 msec; or QTcB &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Male or female (of non childbearing potential) between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample withsimultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until the final follow up visit. Body weight ≥ 40 kg (Refer to Table 3 for weight stratification details). Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for HIV antibody. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety due to potential drug interaction. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.10. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Pregnant females as determined by positive [serum or urine] hCG test at screening or prior to dosing. Lactating females. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. Unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice [and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices] from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination): Males Females Heart rate &lt;45 and &gt;100 bpm &lt;50 and &gt;100 bpm PR Interval &lt;120 and &gt;220 msec QRS duration &lt;70 and &gt;120 msec QTc interval (Bazett) &gt;450 msec Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (does not include ST segment changes associated with repolarization). Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to left or right complete bundle branch block, AV block [2nd degree or higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome), sinus pauses&gt; 3 seconds, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (≥3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats) or any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with the safety of the individual subject.</criteria>
