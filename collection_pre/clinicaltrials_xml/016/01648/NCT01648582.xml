	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine if once-weekly dulaglutide is efficient and safe compared to once-daily insulin glargine in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control with 1 or 2 oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAM) (metformin and/or a sulfonylurea), in addition to any healthy lifestyle changes recommended by their healthcare providers.</brief_summary>
