	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated defects in the trafficking and translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to be a major cause of insulin resistance in humans. IRAP (Secreted Insulin Regulated AminoPeptidase) is a protein which collocalizes and is translocated with GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. The extracellular domain of IRAP is cleaved and released in the bloodstream. Therefore, IRAP plasma concentration could be a good marker of insulin sensitivity. In this study the investigators seek to confirm this hypothesis by using the gold standard of insulin sensitivity assessment: the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. It is a multicenter descriptive study.</brief_summary>
