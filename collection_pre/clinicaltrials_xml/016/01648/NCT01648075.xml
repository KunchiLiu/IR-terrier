	<brief_summary>Probiotics are microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts can confer health benefits. In vitro and clinical studies support the idea that lactobacilli have protective effects on oral health. A recent study in which preschoolers consumed milk drinks enriched with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, reported a reduction in caries, as well as additional benefits to children. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of milk beverages enriched with Lactobacillus rhamnosus on the incidence of caries in preschool Chilean children.</brief_summary>
