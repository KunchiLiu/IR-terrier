	<brief_summary>No consensus guidelines exist for management of post-transplant glucocorticoid induced hyperglycemia, but most published reviews recommend insulin as first line therapy. A variety of insulin regimens have been proposed, including mealtime short-acting regular or analog insulin, once daily neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin, pre-mixed insulin, or basal insulin alone such as glargine or detemir. However, no randomized trial has ever examined different insulin regimens to determine which most effectively controls post-transplant steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Consequently, the proposed study intends to examine three commonly used insulin regimens used for managing post-transplant once-daily glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia to determine which is most effective: - Group 1: Intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin at breakfast - Group 2: Short-acting insulin (regular or aspart) before meals - Group 3: Insulin glargine at breakfast Question/Hypothesis: Among three commonly used insulin regimens, which is most effective for managing post-transplant once-daily glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia?</brief_summary>
