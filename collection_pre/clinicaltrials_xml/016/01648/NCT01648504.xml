	<brief_summary>The investigators will attempt to improve the patient experience before colonoscopy. The investigators will provide an in-office ipad video series and an electronic web guide to help patients learn all the best ways to prepare for colonoscopy. The investigators will then follow the patients who receive this eGuide to colonoscopy and observe whether or not they enjoyed the additional access to information from their providers, and will monitor whether or not they were better prepared for their colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Johns Hopkins Interactive eGuide to Colonoscopy and Ipad Office Education to Improve Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study would assess the ability of an e-intervention in patient education and instructions during peri-procedure and procedural day visits to improve the experience of gastroenterology procedures. This study would seek to show that through this alternative educational measure, there would be an increased show rate to colonoscopy appointments, an increased preparation quality, and an increase in patient understanding and satisfaction with the colonoscopy procedure. The investigators will attempt to track procedure completion rate and polyp detection rate for individual providers. The e-intervention would be multimodal. In the pre-procedure setting, ipad would be able to provide a viewpoint for the video education, a template for the patients (or caregivers) to send themselves links to appropriate instructions to remind them of their obligations by secure email. This e-intervention would supplement traditional printed and website accessible instructions.</detailed_description>
