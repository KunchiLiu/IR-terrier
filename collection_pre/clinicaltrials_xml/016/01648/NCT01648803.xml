	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease using movement sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to determine if this is a feasible measure to use in addition to self report, and eventually the goal will be to replace self report with a more reliable measure such as movement sensors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wearable Movement Sensors for Assessing Motor Impairments and Dyskinesias in Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Parkinson disease and motor fluctuations will wear movement sensors during their regular clinic visit with the principal investigator. The visit will be videotaped and medication status (ON without dyskinesia, ON with dyskinesia, or OFF) will be independently rated from review of the video.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who will be included in the study have probable or definite idiopathic PD (CAPSIT criteria (23)), Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage 24; One or more of the following PDassociated motor impairments experienced in the week prior to enrollment (based on history and/or examination): motor fluctuations (end of dose wearing off with hypokinesia and/or levodopainduced choreiform dyskinesias), tremor, freezing of gait, or frequent falls (â‰¥ 1 per week). Neurological disorders (other than PD) or orthopedic deficits that, in the investigator's judgement, contribute substantially to impaired movement (e.g. stroke with motor sequelae; Essential tremor; Severe osteoarthritis); Cognitive impairment sufficiently severe to interfere with informed consent.</criteria>
