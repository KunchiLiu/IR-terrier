	<brief_summary>The primary objective of LUTEGA 2 is it to determine the long term effect (about 2 more years after LUTEGA 1, NCT00763659) of the supplementation with a fixed combination of lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3- fatty acids in two different dosages on the optical density (OD) of macular pigment in patients with non- exudative age related maculopathy. The dosage groups are crossed after LUTEGA 1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Effects of Lutein/Zeaxanthin and Omega-3- Supplementation for Two More Years (LUTEGA 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LUTEGA 2 is a cross-over- study and the continue of LUTEGA 1. After one year of supplementation in randomized, placebo- controlled, double blind study (LUTEGA 1), the treatment arms are unblind to cross over the different dosage groups. The measurement of optical density of macular pigment (MPOD) uses the 1- wavelength reflection method recording reflection images at 480 nm by a fundus camera. The patients are followed up over two years in eight more visits (every three months) In addition to the MPOD- measurement each examination includes standardized visual acuity test (ETDRS), amsler- grid, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus photography (color and autofluorescence) and a blood sample (every six months).</detailed_description>
