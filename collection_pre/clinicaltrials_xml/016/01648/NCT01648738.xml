	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Short, Intensive and Standardised Spa Therapy for Low Back Pain on Sick Leave Duration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sick leave due to low back pain (LBP) is costly and compromises workforce productivity. Sick leave itself, fears and believes regarding return to work, and a low self-esteem have been identified as independent predictors of extended sick leave. Previous data suggested that multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs, including physical activities and psychobehavioral management, should decrease sick leave duration in chronic LBP. However these programs are heavy (at least 4 weeks long), and are often proposed to patients at the end of the management (over 6 months after the beginning of symptoms). Another approach could be to propose a shorter multidisciplinary program (for example 5 days long), earlier in the history of LBP to break the vicious circle as soon as possible. The target population could be people suffering from subacute LBP with sick leave duration between 4 and 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
