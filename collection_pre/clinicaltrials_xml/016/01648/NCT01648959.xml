	<brief_summary>Various parts of the brain are sensitive to various anesthetics.We like to study the effect of dexmedetomidine on the different parts of the brain in patients who are coming for DBS electrode removal under sedation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra Cranial EEG Activity During Dexmedetomidine Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cortical and sub cortical structures will have different sensitivities to various anesthetics.The objective of this study is to look at the changes in the intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics during dexmedetomidine sedation and to determine the differences in the EEG characteristics between cortical and subcortical structures.</detailed_description>
