	<brief_summary>This is a research study about the relationship between lung cancer and environmental risk factors. The purpose of this study is to try to understand the effects of trace elements such as arsenic and chromium, as well as radon on the development of lung cancer. To do this, the investigators will collect information and environmental and biologic specimens from people who live in Appalachian Kentucky who a) have lung cancer or b) don't have lung cancer and will serve as control subjects. The investigators will create a specimen repository of from these people and their residences to compare differences in many risks factors for cancer. By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn why there are more lung cancers in Kentucky's fifth Congressional District than anywhere else in the nation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Population-based Case-control Study of Lung Cancer in Appalachian Kentucky: The Role of Environmental Carcinogens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appalachian Kentucky has one of the highest incidence rates of lung cancer in the United States. The disproportionately high incidence is not explained by tobacco alone. Preliminary analysis of trace element content in toenail samples reveals higher levels of arsenic, chromium and nickel in Appalachian Kentucky residents than elsewhere in Kentucky. Trace elements are known to promote carcinogenesis by increased oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, and reduced DNA repair efficiency. These findings justify further investigation of the role that trace elements play in the development of lung cancer in this region. Hypothesis: The unexpectedly high rate of lung cancer in Appalachian Kentucky is associated with exposure to environmental carcinogens that increase oxidative stress and DNA damage. Specific Aims Aim 1: Conduct a case-control study of lung cancer and matched controls in the 5th Congressional District of Kentucky to compare rates of moderate to high arsenic in lung cancer cases and controls. Aim 2: Create a specimen repository of biologic and environmental samples from these subjects and their residences for analysis of DNA repair markers and, in the future, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Aim 3: Fund four pilot projects which will utilize collected data from Aim 1 to develop investigators focused on lung cancer research in this study population and to generate preliminary data that will lead to independent funding. Study Design: This is a population-based, case-control study encompassing the 5th Congressional District of Kentucky. Relevance: This translational research and repository will fundamentally improve our understanding of the causes of the disproportionately high incidence of lung cancer in Appalachian Kentucky, foster collaboration among scientists dedicated to the study of lung cancer and provide a permanent resource to be used for future research.</detailed_description>
