	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of CADS by primary care providers (PCPs) for their patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) changes the quality of care relative to a "usual care" group in terms of objective outcome measures of glycemic control (e.g., A1c, mean blood glucose, frequency of hypoglycemic episodes) and in terms of subjective ratings by patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of a Computer Program to Help Primary Care Providers Treat Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CADS software integrates the patient's home blood glucose data with appropriate laboratory data (e.g. A1c, liver function, kidney function), demographic data (age, gender), current and previous medications, and active/inactive medical diagnoses. The software makes a recommendation about what medication changes are appropriate with potential alternates. Providers with their patients are block randomized into CADS or "Usual Care" for 1 year.</detailed_description>
