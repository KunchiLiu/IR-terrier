	<brief_summary>It is about a multicentric study prospective of more than patients' 60 years with a thrombopenia isolated of less than 100 G/L blood platelet without cause found to estimate so certain examinations realized in the diagnosis (medullary cytogenetics, dosage of the TPO, the Anti-platelet antibodies, isotopic lifetime of platelet) are in favour of the diagnosis of PTI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is about a multicentric study prospective of more than patients' 60 years with a thrombopenia isolated of less than 100 G/L blood platelet without cause found to estimate so certain examinations realized in the diagnosis (medullary cytogenetics, dosage of the TPO, the Anti-platelet antibodies, isotopic lifetime of platelet) are in favour of the diagnosis of PTI. The principal endpoint is to evaluate if the medullary cytogenetics is the predictive factor of the diagnosis of PTI in front of a thrombopenia isolated in elderly. The secondary endpoints are : - to identify at the time of the diagnosis, the factors and/or predictive markers correlated in the final diagnosis of PTI or SMD - to study the respective frequency of the PTI and the SMD in front of a thrombopenia seemingly isolated of the subject of more than 60 years. 200 patients will be included. 160 patients should be assessable at the end of study by considering the excluded patients, the dead and the lost sight.They will be followed every 4 months, during two years. In every visit, will be realized a clinical examination, a blood film, a haemogram. If the haemogram is abnormal, a bone marrow biopsy is realized. The patient who presents a myelodysplastic syndrome is excluded.</detailed_description>
