	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the neuropsychological effects of transvascular aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Patients undergoing TAVI usually suffer from congestive heart failure and low cardiac output which may limit their cognitive abilities. TAVI results in significant improvements in cardiac function and therefore may improve cognitive functions. However, TAVI may also be associated with stroke and may therefore have a negative impact on cognition. Therefore, in this study the investigators wish to perform a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests before and after TAVI to test the net effects of TAVI on cognitive performance over time. The investigators plan to include all patients planned to have TAVI in the study and to test them before, 3,7, 30 and 360 days post TAVI with a standardized battery of test.</brief_summary>
