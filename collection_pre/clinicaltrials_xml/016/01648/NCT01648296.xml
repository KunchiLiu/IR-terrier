	<brief_summary>A single center, open-label baseline controlled imaging study to designed to assess whether Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measurements of myocardial Fatty Acid (FA) metabolism performed with [18F]FluorbetaOx correlates with measurements using [11C]palmitate. This study involves the investigational use of a PET radioactive tracer, fluorine-18 radiolabeled fatty acid analog, [18F]FluorbetaOx designed to measure beta oxidation of fatty acids in the myocardium. The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of the method in heart failure patients with dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obese subjects (Body Mass Index of ≥ 30kg/m2) with or without T2DM and normal healthy subjects to provide a wide range of perturbations in myocardial FA metabolism. Specific objectives include: 1. To assess the diagnostic quality of [18F]FluorbetaOx PET images and kinetics at the proposed 10 millicurie (mCi) dose. 2. To quantitatively determine the relationship between PET measurements of myocardial FA metabolism obtained with [18F]FluorbetaOx and those using [11C]Palmitate. 3. To calculate human dosimetry based on the human biodistribution of [18F]FluorbetaOx. 4. Correlate measurements of myocardial FA metabolism with changes in left ventricular (LV)structure and function performed on a clinically indicated echocardiography at 6-9 months after imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fatty Acid Radiotracer Comparison Study in Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PET imaging will be broken down into 2 groups of subjects (dosimetry and kinetic dynamic imaging/[11C]palmitate comparison) with entry into these groups will occur simultaneously. All PET imaging will be performed with a Siemens Biograph 40 PET-CT scanner. All patients will undergo routine clinical evaluation as dictated by the treating heart failure cardiologist. The results of the PET studies will not be provided to the patient or the treating cardiologist unless, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, the images demonstrate an unsuspected abnormality that may warrant further evaluation. Subjects will be instructed not to eat after midnight the night before the study. However, patients will be instructed to continue their heart failure and diabetic medical regimens. The morning of their PET study, subjects will have two intravenous catheters placed. One will be placed in each arm for the purpose of administering radioactive tracers ([15O]Water, [11C]Palmitate, and [18F]FluorbetaOx), drawing blood samples for safety laboratory analysis. Urine samples will be obtained along with an Electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs. A follow-up telephone contact will be done 2-3 days post imaging study to capture unanticipated and serious adverse events (SAEs).</detailed_description>
