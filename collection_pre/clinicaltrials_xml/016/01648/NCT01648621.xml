	<brief_summary>Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also have other diseases referred to as comorbidities. Often these patients require health care by a variety of health care professionals from services linked to hospitals and in the community. Unfortunately, sometimes it may be difficult for these patients to receive appropriate care in a timely manner resulting in a trip to the emergency department. As well, patients may benefit from education that enables them to recognize early signs indicating they are getting sicker and to self-manage their disease. Our study will examine a strategy that includes a case manager who will make weekly phone contact with COPD patients with comorbidity that present either to the emergency department or are admitted to hospital. Weekly contact will focus on teaching patients to recognize worsening symptoms and self-management strategies. The case manager will work with patients, caregivers, community health care providers and hospital specialists to promote communication and optimize care delivery. The investigators will examine the impact of our intervention on the need for emergency department visits and hospital admission. The investigators will also examine the impact on patients' health related quality of life, number of COPD exacerbations, and disease progression.</brief_summary>
