	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to study the variability of lung function parameters and bronchial inflammatory markers in 20 patients with bronchiolitis obliterans at the age of 6 to 25 years compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. The investigators will perform a pulmonary function test (body plethysmography with TLCO), and measure the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Further a blood sample is drawn to determine the systemic inflammation. Finally induced sputum is collected and a cell count is performed, and cells and supernatants are analyzed for inflammatory markers. This investigation will be repeated after 4-6 weeks. The aim of this study is to define baseline values and the variability of possible outcome parameters for future interventional studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to characterize the variability of lung function values and bronchial inflammation of 20 Patients with Bronchiolitis obliterans aged between 6 up to 25 years. The patients' data will be compared with the results of a reference group with similar age conditions to determine possible outcome-parameters for following interventional studies. The sputum samples will be processed and quantitatively analyzed to get a profile of the cytological composition. (Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) and by cytometric bead assay (CBA).) Methods and Work Programme: This study consists of two study visits (V1 and V2) V1: - Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (eNO) - Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography - Bronchodilation - Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography - Blood test: blood count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, (genetic markers of the non-specific pulmonary defense system) - Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations V2: - Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (eNO) - Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography - Bronchodilation - Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography - Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations</detailed_description>
