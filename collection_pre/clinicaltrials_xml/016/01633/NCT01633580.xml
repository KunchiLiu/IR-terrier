	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to analyse if corifollitropin alfa, an agent for prolonged ovarian stimulation, administered from day 4 can be clinically used instead of day 2 onwards for a controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in an antagonist protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>D2 Versus D4 Corifollitropin Alfa in GnRH Antagonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corifollitropin alfa is a new recombinant gonadotrophin with sustained follicle-stimulating activity. It offers novel and effective treatment option for potential normal responder patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonist co-treatment for IVF or in vitro fertilisation resulting in a high ongoing pregnancy rate, equal to that achieved with daily rFSH. Normally, this medication is started on day 2 of the cycle. In the present randomised trial, we want to evaluate whether this agent can be clinically used when started on day 4 of the cycle.</detailed_description>
