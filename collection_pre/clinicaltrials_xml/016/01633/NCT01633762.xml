	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the effect of eradication of gut microbiota on 1) glucose metabolism including postprandial plasma responses of the incretin hormones GIP and GLP-1, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon, 2) metabolomic profiles and resting energy expenditure (REE) 3) appetite, satiety, food intake, gastric emptying and gall bladder emptying, 4) levels of markers of bone formation and resorption as well as serotonin, 5) markers of systemic inflammation, and 6) on the (prospective) composition of bacteria in faeces, blood and saliva. Thus, the overall objective is to provide detailed knowledge on the physiological role of gut microbiota combined with bioinformatic analyses of the functional implications of changes in bacteria composition on the level of both species and phylum.</brief_summary>
