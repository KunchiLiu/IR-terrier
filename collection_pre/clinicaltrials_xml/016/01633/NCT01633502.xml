	<brief_summary>Cardiogenic shock a serious complication of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Despite rapid invasive treatment, circulatory support using positive inotropes and mechanical support with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP), and evaluation of several new treatments during the last decade, the mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock still exceeds 50%. An alternative to current management is restoration of the volume of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output) using a ventricular assist device. In the acute setting this is difficult but can be done using the Impella device which is a catheter-based, axial flow pump that pumps blood directly from the left ventricle into the circulation thereby restoring blood flow to the failing organs. In 2012 a more powerful Impella has been introduced that is able to deliver 3.5l/min (approximately 75% of a normal cardiac output). The hypothesis of the current study is to reduce mortality and morbidity of patients with cardiogenic shock using the Impella cVAD. The study will be carried out as a randomized multicenter study where eligible patients will be randomized to receive conventional circulatory support or support with the Impella device and inotropic support if needed. A total of 360 patients are planned to be enrolled, and the primary endpoint will be death.</brief_summary>
