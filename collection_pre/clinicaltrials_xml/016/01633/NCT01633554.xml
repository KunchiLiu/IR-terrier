	<brief_summary>IL-33 is a recently identified number of the IL-1 family. Hepatic over-expression of IL-33 has been recently linked to liver fibrosis. ST-2 exerts pro-inflammatory effects of IL-33. We aimed to determine ability of ST2 to predict fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ST-2; a Non-invasive Fibrosis Marker for Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ST-2 is an IL-1 receptor family member and exists in both a membrane-bound isoform and a soluble (sST2) isoform. It has a functional ligand (Interleukin-33) and via ST-2/IL-33 inflammation and immunity is regulated. Hepatic over-expression of IL-33 has been recently linked to liver fibrosis. ST-2 exerts pro-inflammatory effects of IL-33. We aimed to determine ability of ST2 to predict fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B.</detailed_description>
