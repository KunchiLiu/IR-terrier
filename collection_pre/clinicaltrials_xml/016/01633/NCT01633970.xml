	<brief_summary>This open-label, Phase Ib study that has six treatment arms is designed to assess the safety, pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PDL1] antibody) administered with bevacizumab (Arm A) and with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFOX) (Arm B), with carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm C), with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Arm D), with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm E), and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm F) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study includes dose escalation cohort for establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and then expansion cohort will be initiated based on a selected dose level at or below the MTD or MAD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General Histologically or cytologically documented advanced solid tumors Adequate hematologic and end organ function Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 Resolution of any acute, clinically significant treatmentrelated toxicity from prior therapy to Grade less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 1 prior to study entry, with the exception of alopecia Eligible Tumor Types: Arm A Escalation Cohorts and Arms A and B Biopsy Cohort (Cutaneous/Subcutaneous Lesions) Histologically or cytologically documented, incurable or metastatic solid malignancy that has failed all available or acceptable standard therapy for which the participant is eligible Arm A and B Safety Expansion Cohorts, Arm B Escalation Cohorts, and Arm B Biopsy Cohort (Liver Lesions) Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Participants in the Arm A Safety Expansion Cohort must have mCRC for which established therapies have proved ineffective or intolerable. Participants with malignancies other than mCRC within 5 years prior to Day 1 (except for those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death, such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, or ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent) are not eligible. Arm A renal cell carcinoma (RCC) Cohort: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component. Arm A Tumor TypeSpecific Cohort: Gastric Cancer: Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction for which established therapies have proved ineffective or intolerable. The decision may be made to restrict enrollment to participants with a specified tumor PDL1 status (e.g., immunohistochemistry [IHC] status 0/1 or 2/3) Ovarian Cancer: Measurable/assessable ovarian cancer (defined as epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer) that has progressed less than (&lt;) 6 months after completing platinumbased therapy. The following histological types are eligible: Adenocarcinoma NOS, clear cell adenocarcinoma, endometriod adenocarcinoma, malignant Brenner's tumour, mixed epithelial carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma Bladder Cancer: Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced (T4b, any N; or any T, N 23) or metastatic (M1, Stage IV) transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra) Participants with mixed histologies are required to have a dominant transitional cell pattern Locally advanced bladder cancer must be inoperable based on involvement of pelvic sidewall or adjacent viscera (clinical stage T4b) or bulky nodal metastasis (N2N3) Disease progression during or following treatment with at least one platinumcontaining regimen (e.g., GC, MVAC, CarboGem, etc.) for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or disease recurrence Cervical Cancer: Persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (including adenosquamous tumors) Arms C, D, and E Cohorts: Histologically or cytologically documented Stage IIIB (not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy), Stage IV, or recurrent nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Arm F Cohort: Histologically confirmed estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)negative (triplenegative) adenocarcinoma of the breast that has been treated with systemic cytotoxic therapy. Locally recurrent disease must not be amenable to resection with curative intent Participants with tumors amenable to excisional, punch, or core needle biopsy are eligible for a separate biopsy expansion cohort Tumor molecular status: Arm A safety expansion cohort Up to 10 participants with CRC and high microsatellite instability (MSIH) may be enrolled General Exclusions Any approved anticancer therapy, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or herbal therapy intended as anticancer therapy, within 3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment; the following are allowed: hormonal therapy with gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists or antagonists for prostate cancer, hormonereplacement therapy, and palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases greater than (&gt;) 2 weeks prior to Day 1 Bisphosphonate therapy for symptomatic hypercalcemia Known clinically significant liver disease Known primary central nervous (CNS) malignancy or active CNS metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control) Pregnant or lactating women Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or any component of the atezolizumab formulation History of autoimmune disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C infection; history of hepatitis B is allowed if infection has resolved (absence of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, or signs or symptoms of significant infection within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 Received oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1 Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before Day 1 or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study BevacizumabSpecific Exclusions (Arms A and B) Exclusion Criteria Unique to Arm A RCC Cohort Any prior systemic treatment (including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antibody therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or investigational therapy) for RCC. All treatments, neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or for locally advanced or metastatic RCC are not permitted Arm A Tumor TypeSpecific Cohort: Gastric Cancer: Prior approved or experimental antivascular endothelial growth factor or its receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) therapy (including, for example, bevacizumab or nintedanib). The decision may be made to allocate a specified number of slots to participants who have received prior antiVEGF/VEGFR therapy Ovarian Cancer: Refractory disease History of bowel obstruction &gt;2 prior anticancer regimens Prior approved or experimental antiVEGF/VEGFR therapy (including, for example, bevacizumab or nintedanib) Cervical Cancer: &gt; 2 prior cytotoxic regimens, not including prior cisplatinbased chemotherapy concomitantly administered with primary pelvic radiation Exclusion Criteria Unique to Arm B: Prior treatment with an oxaliplatincontaining regimen.
