	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a replicable, psychologically-based group education intervention, Re-Inventing Yourself after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), which aims to enhance personal self-efficacy. A structured six-week, manualized, group therapy intervention that delivers positive psychology concepts within a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based model has been created for the purpose of developing a resilient and optimistic sense of efficacy for people with SCI. Concepts covered within this intervention include: reframing and restructuring a person's method of looking at events, building confidence by focusing on personal strengths, developing methods of recognizing and appreciating the good in one's life and expressing gratitude for positive attributes. The goals of this intervention are to increase personal self-efficacy, enhance emotional well-being and improve participation in society for people with SCI living in the community. The investigators hypothesize that persons receiving the intervention will demonstrate improved SCI-specific and overall self-efficacy as compared to waitlist controls.</brief_summary>
