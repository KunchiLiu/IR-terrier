	<brief_summary>In this research study, the investigators piloted a uniform acupuncture treatment protocol among adults with depression who were taking an antidepressant medication that was providing only partial or no symptom alleviation. The study's aims were evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of acupuncture augmentation treatment among this population. The investigators hypothesized that acupuncture as an augmentation treatment would be associated with a response rate of at least 50%, which the investigators defined as a decrease in depressive symptoms from the beginning to the end of the study of 50% or more, and that the response would be greater among patients who received acupuncture 2 times per week (vs. 1 time per week). The investigators also hypothesized that acupuncture would be associated with minimal side effects.</brief_summary>
