	<brief_summary>- Rotavirus Hospital Admissions Surveillance - Retrospective surveillance for 2010 and 2011 for hospital admissions in children aged 0 to 16 years due to rotavirus gastroenteritis will be completed by all centers of the IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program, ACTive) pediatric hospital network. - Prospective surveillance of rotavirus-related admissions for children aged 0 to 16 years was conducted in 2012-14 inclusive and will be performed for an additional three years, 2015, 2016 and 2017 at all 12 sites. Surveillance methodology will continue using the same case-finding strategy and the same case report form as in past surveillance (Case reporting is done electronically. - Emergency Department Burden of Disease Case finding for all-cause diarrheal illness using ICD codes was undertaken prospectively for 2012 to 2014 and will not continue in the years 2015-17 inclusive. Systematic stool sampling was carried out for cases of gastroenteritis in children &lt; 5 years of age presenting to the ED departments at the IMPACT hospitals in 2012 and 2013 and 5 of the 12 center hospitals in 2014. This component will not continue in to the 2015-17 protocol study years. However the admitted cases presenting to the IMPACT center hospitals with positive rotavirus will be reported and stool samples saved for genotyping at a later date.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canadian Rotavirus Surveillance Through the Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has the ability to provide contemporary Canadian data on the two of the most important outcome measures for effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine: hospital admissions and emergency department visits. The extended time period that already exists prior to vaccine implementation (2005 to 2011) will provide longterm baseline data with which to compare disease burden from 2012 to 2017. The major advantages to this study are that surveillance occurs at the same hospitals and the same methodology and CRF has been used since 2005. This will ensure reliability and consistency in the surveillance study. The national data set captures patients from age group 0 to 16 years in 12 centers across the country. The retrospective and prospective studies will be in a unique position to capture all children admitted to the 12 pediatric hospitals in Canada. Since reliance on discharge codes alone may underestimate gastroenteritis due to rotavirus, laboratory surveillance coupled with medical record review will ensure the complete capture of the true disease burden. Data on the health status of children will facilitate the evaluation of children who are medically fragile for which rotavirus infections may be more significant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>There are three parts to this criteria Hospital admission surveillance (to December 2017); Emergency Department determination of disease burden (To December 2014); and genotype surveillance (to December 2017) A. Hospital admission surveillance: Age 0 to 16 years of age. Inpatient status at the IMPACT hospital Acute onset of symptoms of acute gastroenteritis with or without diarrheal stools, with or without vomiting, with or without fever. Laboratory confirmation of rotavirus in stool specimens or autopsy tissue sample with the use of antigen detection methods (enzyme linked immunoassay [ELISA] or immunochromatographic methods) or electron microscopy or molecular (PCR) diagnosis in a stool specimen taken within 14 days after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. Cases identified by autopsy must have had gastrointestinal symptoms before death. Referred cases of rotavirus infections that have laboratory confirmation from another institution using the same criteria as above Exclusion criteria Nonlaboratory confirmed diagnosis. Clinical data is not accessible to the nurse monitor. Incidental findings of rotavirus in patients admitted to hospital without acute gastrointestinal symptoms. B. Emergency Department Visits for determination of disease burden and determination proportion of rotavirus infections Inclusion criteria: The number of children under 5 years of age discharged from the ED with a ICD code diagnosis of diarrheal illness. Parents of children who present to the emergency departments at the participating centers will be asked to allow their child's stool sample to be tested for rotavirus according to the guidelines set out by the respective Ethics review boards at each IMPACT center. C: Rotavirus genotyping C. Rotavirus Genotype Surveillance which includes both the specimens from A and B above. Exclusion criteria: No stool sample Inclusion criteria: Rotavirus identification: Rotavirus identification at sites will be accomplished by rotavirus antigen detected by EIA (Enzyme Immuno Assay) or electron microscopy. At all hospitals, patients admitted to hospital with acute diarrheal illness have stool specimens sent for viral testing. Stool specimens from admitted patients will be saved. The rotavirus positive specimens from patients presenting to the ED and who have consented to stool specimen that test positive for rotavirus will also be saved. A convenience sample of rotavirus positive specimens will be forwarded for genotype testing to the National microbiology laboratory. All rotavirus positive stools from the ED and hospitalized cases will be line listed by date of collection or diagnosis. At the end of the season, depending on the number of positives, the sites will select every second, third or fourth specimen (and so forth) to forward to the genotyping laboratory in order to equal 20 specimens per site and ensure equal representation for all time periods of the rotavirus season and from sites of acquisition (ED and hospitalized cases). This will yield a maximum of 280 samples per year. These stools will be stored frozen to 80Â°C for genotype analysis. Nine provinces will send isolates directly to the National Microbiology Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Timothy Booth for genotype analysis. The two IMPACT centers in Montreal will do genotype analysis in their provincial laboratory and will subsequently share the data with the Vaccine Evaluation Center in Vancouver. A proportion of the strains will be exchanged between both laboratories in order to validate results.</criteria>
