	<brief_summary>Because the diabetics are fracturing at a younger age than the general population (12), this leads us to believe there are significant factors that lead to fracture in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) other than bone mineral density (BMD). Very little longitudinal data exists on BMD in adults with Type 1 DM and the effects of glucose control on BMD. No longitudinal data exists on pQCT in adults with Type 1 DM. Hypothesis: Adult subjects with diabetes and poor glucose control will lose bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by DXA compared to age and sex matched healthy controls.</brief_summary>
