	<brief_title>Annual Study to Investigate Inactivated Subunit Influenza Vaccine Due to New Virus Strains for the 2012/2013 Season</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open, baseline-controlled study in two age groups: adults and elderly. The subjects will be screened within 14 days prior to or at Visit 1 (Day 1). At Visit 1 (Day 1) subjects will be vaccinated after blood sampling for baseline serum antihemagglutinin antibody titration. Subjects will be asked to record local and systemic reactions daily on a diary at home for 72 hours after vaccination. One week later (Visit 2, Day 8) the subjects will return to the study site to hand in the diary and for the assessment of safety and tolerability (reactogenicity and overall inconvenience). Three weeks after vaccination (Visit 3, Day 22) the subjects will return to the study site for blood sampling to assess immunogenicity and for the assessment of safety and tolerability.</detailed_description>
