	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Lifestyles Passport Program (HLPP) in preventing infant and childhood obesity. It is hypothesized that the participants in the intervention arm will exhibit less excessive weight-for-length gain from 4- to 6-months of age. In 2-years and 5-years, it is predicted that the participants in the intervention arm will yield lower Body Mass Index (BMI) z-scores than the participants in the control arm, who receive usual care.</brief_summary>
