	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies lenalidomide as chemoprevention in treating patients with high-risk, early stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of lenalidomide may slow disease progression in patients with early stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide as Chemoprevention in Treating Patients With High-Risk, Early-Stage B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine time to progression in patients with high risk CLL. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Overall response rate including (complete remission [CR]+partial remission [PR]) of lenalidomide. II. To determine the incidence of immune mediated flare reaction. III. To characterize the toxicity profile of single agent lenalidomide in previously untreated B-CLL. IV. To correlate expression of B-CLL co-stimulatory ligands and clinical efficacy of lenalidomide in this patient population. V. To conduct correlative studies. OUTLINE: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
