	<brief_title>Efficacy of the PARI LC Sprint Sp Nebulizer for Acute Asthma Attack in Hospitalized Children Less Than 36 Months of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether the use of the LC Sprint Sp Nebulizer results in: A-shortened duration of oxygen-dependence. B-reduced side effects by assessing the patient's heart rate before and 30 minutes after the first aerosol and noting the occurrence of desaturation &lt;90% during the nebulisation sessions. C-increased acceptance of the aerosol, measured via a questionnaire given to the patient's parents at the end of hospitalization (a single questionnaire will be completed by either parent or both parents). D-shortened length of stay based on the following discharge criteria: observation of a respiratory severity score ≤ 2 (Clinical Asthma Score (CAS)) for at least 12 consecutive hours and a transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2)&gt; 94% when awake or &gt; 91% during sleep.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The parent or legal representative must have given his/her informed and signed consent The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan The patient has an attack of moderate to severe asthma (at least the third episode of wheezing dyspnea since birth) requiring hospitalization defined by the following criteria: requires oxygen: SpO2 &lt;92% on room air (if CAS ≤ 4/10) And / or CAS&gt; 4/10 (after 3 attempted nebulized salbutamol sessions over 1 hour of emergency care). The patient is participating in another study The patients has already been included in this study a previous time The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship The parent or legal representative refuses to sign the consent It is impossible to correctly inform the parent or legal representative The patient has a contra indication for a treatement used in this study Patient was born at &lt; 34 weeks of pregnancy or bronchdysplasic First or second episode of bronchiolitis Asthma attack with CAS score ≤ 4/10 or inpatient basis for a nonbreathing related motive. Acute severe Asthma attack: hypercapnia, impaired consciousness, need for hospitalization in intensive care, need for mechanical ventilation, need for salbutamol IV Patient with known congenital heart disease Patient with chronic respiratory disease other than asthma Patient with encephalopathy Patient with known immune deficiency CAS ≤ 2 and transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2)&gt; 94% when awake or &gt; 91% when asleep for at least 12h</criteria>
