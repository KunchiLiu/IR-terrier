	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis is the most common affection of joints worldwide. Multiple international guidelines on the approach and treatment of knee osteoarthritis are available. Nevertheless there seems to be a gap between usual care and the preferred one. A vigorous set of evidence-based quality indicators on osteoarthritis diagnosis and therapy was developed by a multidisciplinary expert team. This project aims to map usual care and to explore the gaps between usual care and international guidelines in a second stage. This will enable us to develop a tightly targeted quality improvement intervention later on.</brief_summary>
