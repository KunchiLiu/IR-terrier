	<brief_summary>Dystocia is the most common indication for primary cesarean section. The most common cause of dystocia is uterine dysfunction. In all cephalopelvic disproportion studies, more attention is usually paid on fetus and pelvic rather than on the role of uterine contraction in delivery. So we decided to determine the relationship between dystocia and uterine contraction patterns.</brief_summary>
