	<brief_summary>For the prediction of late-onset preeclampsia (PE) in low risk women, the investigators established a cut-off value for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and evaluated the combination models of Elecys, second trimester uterine artery (UtA) doppler, and fetoplacental proteins for Down syndrome screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening for Preeclampsia With Various Markers in Low-risk Pregnancy Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective study was carried on in Cha hospital. Serum samples for Down syndrome screening were assayed to estimate pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), alpha-fetoprotein , unconjugated estriol, human chorionic gonadotrophin , and inhibin-A. Women screened for Down syndrome were offered UtA Doppler at 20-24 weeks of gestation and then collected serial serum samples for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at two time points (24-27 and 34-37 weeks' gestation).</detailed_description>
