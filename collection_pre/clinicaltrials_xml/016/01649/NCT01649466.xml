	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of vildagliptin versus NPH insulin add-on to glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that do not reach adequate glycemic control on their current sulfonylurea monotherapy to give treating physicians a guidance which additional anti-diabetic treatment can be used if sulfonylurea monotherapy is not sufficient to reach glycemic control.</brief_summary>
