Outpatient status at last visit of Study 33107203. 1. Sexually active males who are not practicing two different methods of birth control during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study medication or who will not remain abstinent during the study and for 90 days after the last dose, or sexually active females of childbearing potential who are not practicing two different methods of birth control during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication or who will not remain abstinent during the study and for 30 days after the last dose. If employing birth control, two of the following precautions must be used: vasectomy, tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pill, birth control depot injection, birth control implant, condom, or sponge with spermicide. 2. Females who are breastfeeding and/or who have a positive pregnancy test result prior to receiving openlabel OPC34712. 3.

Subjects who do not continue to meet all applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria for Protocol 33107203 at the last visit (ie, Week 6) of Protocol 33107203. 5. Subjects who represent a risk of committing suicide based on an answer of "Yes" to either Question 4 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, Without Specific Plan) or Question 5 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent) on the "Suicidal Ideation" portion of the CSSRS, or an answer of "Yes" to any of the suiciderelated behaviors (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behavior) on the "Suicidal Behavior" portion of the CSSRS. A subject who has had any suicidal ideation within the last 6 months, any suicidal behaviors within the last two years, or who in the clinical judgment of the investigator presents a serious risk of suicide should be excluded from the study. 6.
