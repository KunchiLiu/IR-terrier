	<brief_summary>This study involves the use of an enriched hematopoetic stem cell infusion (stem cells, produced by the bone marrow) from the same donor who provided the original kidney transplant. This kidney transplant may have taken place months to years previously.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Tolerance in Recipients of Living Kidney Allografts by Donor FCRx Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves the use of a combination of an enriched hematopoetic stem cell infusion (stem cells, produced by the bone marrow, generate the cells that form the blood elements, help fight infection and assist in clotting) and kidney transplantation from the same donor to try to avoid the need for long-term anti-rejection drug therapy. The desired result of this study is to allow your body to develop "tolerance" to the transplanted kidney. Tolerance means that your body would see the transplanted kidney as part of you and not try to get rid of, or reject it. To prevent rejection, drugs called immunosuppressive agents must be taken on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to determine if this procedure is safe and to try to substantially reduce or even eliminate the need for anti-rejection medications.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient has received a renal transplant only The original donor for the patient must be willing to participate in the study and meet all of the donor eligibility criteria Patient must be between the ages of 18 and 65 years The crossmatch is negative between donor and recipient within 30 days of the infusion Potential recipients who are women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine test is acceptable) within 48 hours prior to receiving Granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF) and agree to use reliable contraception for 1 year following infusion Potential donors who are women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine test is acceptable) within 48 hours prior to receiving GCSF No evidence of donorspecific antibody presently or historically Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) less than or equal to 20% within 30 days of the FCRx infusion Note: The subjects do not need to be local residents in order to be eligible for this trial, but must be willing to reside in the area, or within a four hour drive, for the first month of the protocol so that we can monitor them closely in the early post stem cell transplant period. As long as there is insurance or funding that will cover the cost of the stem cell transplant and any research related complications, it is not necessary for the subjects to be US citizens to participate in this trial. Clinically active bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection Pregnancy Clinical or serologic evidence of viral infection which would preclude the recipient from receiving an infusion Previous radiation therapy at a dose which would preclude Total Body Irradiation (TBI) Positive crossmatch between donor and recipient Evidence for immunologic memory against donor Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 35 or less than 18 Positive serologies for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Uncontrolled concomitant infection or any other unstable medical condition that could interfere with the study objectives. Patients with impaired organ function, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35% or forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume (FEV), or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) less than 50%, or transaminases greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal will be excluded from participation. Biopsy proven rejection episode. Insufficient funds for bone marrow processing costs</criteria>
