	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a normothermia protocol that includes preoperative warming and standard intra operative temperature management in patients undergoing general surgery. The study aim is to compare short term outcomes in patients for whom warming is expanded by commencing in the pre operative area and is maintained through post operative recovery versus patients receiving the standard warming at time of induction. The overall study goal is to test for differences in the rate of hypothermic events between the two groups. A secondary goal is to test for differences in the complication rate and patient satisfaction between the two groups. This study is testing the hypothesis that expanded warming significantly reduces rates of hypothermia and complications over standard warming used only during surgery.</brief_summary>
