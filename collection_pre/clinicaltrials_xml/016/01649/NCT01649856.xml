	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, open label parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous versus intravenous MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) in combination with CHOP chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated CD20-positive diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma. Patients will be randomized to receive either MabThera/Rituxan 1400 mg subcutaneously or MabThera/Rituxan 375 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle for 8 cycles, in combination with 6-8 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 months.</brief_summary>
