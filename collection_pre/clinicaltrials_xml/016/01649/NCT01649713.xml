	<brief_summary>This is a yearly licence tolerability and immunogenicity study of Fluval AB suspension for injection (trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine, active ingredient content: 15 μgHA/strain/0.5mL) in adult and elderly subjects to assess immunogenicity of a single intramuscular injection of Fluval AB suspension for injection, as measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, and to evaluate safety and tolerability (incidence of adverse events) of a single intramuscular injection of Fluval AB suspension for injection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yearly Licence Tolerability and Immunogenicity Study of Fluval AB Seasonal Influenza Vaccine to be Used in the 2012/2013 Vaccination Season</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the 2011-2012 vaccination season the following influenza virus strains were recommended to be included in the influenza vaccines: - A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like virus, - A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2)-like virus, - B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. For the 2012-2013 season the following strains were recommended (Amended EU Recommendations for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Composition for the Season 2012/2013, EMA/CHMP/BWP/140597/2012): - A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like virus, - A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like virus, - B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus. Since the A/H3N2 and the B virus strains were changed, a yearly licence clinical study have to be performed.</detailed_description>
