	<brief_title>Pediatric Lupus Trial of Belimumab Plus Background Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of belimumab intravenous (IV) in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SELENA SLEDAI score ≥ 6). The study will consist of three phases: a 52-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase; a long term open label continuation phase; and a long term safety follow up phase. The long term open label continuation and safety follow up periods will continue for at least 5 years and possibly up to 10 years from a subject's initial treatment with belimumab. Enrolment will be staggered by age cohorts to allow safety and PK interim analyses. Subjects will be randomized to belimumab 10mg/kg or placebo IV monthly dosing while continuing to receive background standard therapy throughout the study. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will monitor the study as it progresses.</detailed_description>
