	<brief_title>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Youth: Effectiveness in a Community Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation aims to examine the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) in treating child traumatic stress when implemented in community settings on a state-wide level in Delaware. Youth (ages 7-16 years) with a history of documented trauma (sexual or physical abuse, traumatic loss, domestic or community violence) and symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) receive approximately 10 sessions of TF-CBT delivered in a state-contracted mental health agency. Children and adolescents are recruited from a public mental health population. PTSD symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems have been assessed in the first 72 participants at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months after intake; subsequent participants (n=38) are only being assessed for symptoms and problems at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-months after intake.</detailed_description>
