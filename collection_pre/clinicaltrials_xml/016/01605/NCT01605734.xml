	<brief_summary>TACE is widely used in patients with unresectable HCC. However, it is a non-curative approach; thus ,strategies to further improve the survival of these patients are needed. Sorafenib is regarded as standard treatment for advanced HCC. It is the first systemic therapy to demonstrate a significant survival benefit in HCC patients.The hypothesis is that the combination of TACE with sorafenib could improve the survival of patients with unresectable HCC.</brief_summary>
