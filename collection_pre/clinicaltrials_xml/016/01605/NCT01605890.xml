	<brief_summary>The HIV-2 is less common ie 1-2 million people in West Africa. HIV-2 does have the same sensibility to antiretroviral treatment (ART) compared to HIV-1. The ART strategies that are appropriate for the HIV-1 infection are not as effective for HIV-2. Classical triple therapy including PI is less effective for HIV-2. Also, the choice of ARTs in a second line treatment is limited. The first line optimal treatment has to be defined by a prospective and randomized evaluation of other strategies. The primary endpoint will be adapted to the specificity of the HIV-2 infection. The 1st step is to define, with a phase II clinical trial, whether a strategy including 2 NRTIs and raltegravir, as an alternative strategy to the classical triple therapy, shows an immunovirological response, at least, as good as the one obtained with the triple therapy. The hypothesis is that the low ART response observed in HIV-2 infection is due to a low virological strength of the ARTs used and that the combination of 2 NRTIs and raltegravir should show a therapeutic success of at least 50% at week 48.</brief_summary>
