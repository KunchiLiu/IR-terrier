Individuals subject to conditions that result in elevated levels of methaemoglobin, unless specific dyshaemoglobins are called for in the study protocol. Subjects who would be placed at undue medical risk associated with any procedures called for in the protocol (e.g. arterial cannulation or hypoxia).
