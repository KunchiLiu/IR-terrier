	<brief_summary>Radial artery access for cardiac catheterization can require multiple attempts. Multiple attempts increase the time required, patient discomfort, and the risk of arterial spasm. Ultrasound guidance has been shown in other studies to reduce the number of attempts and complications in central venous and femoral artery access. This study will test if the addition of ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts and time required to access the radial artery.</brief_summary>
