	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that cardiovascular and metabolic alterations due to obesity already manifest at childhood age. To identify these alterations and risk factors, the investigators have established a cohort of 177 healthy obese and lean control children, age ranging from 6y to 18y, for evaluation of cardiovascular and metabolic parameters, as well as quantification of biomarkers of obesity and inflammation. Follow-up analyses are planned after 2 years (completed) and additionally after 5, 7 and 9 years. In addition, the investigators will assess the effects of increased physical activity and exercise on cardiovascular function.</brief_summary>
