	<brief_summary>Low systemic flow as measured by Doppler-echocardiography has been associated with poor neurological outcome. Yet, it has not been systematically evaluated whether the treatment of this hemodynamic condition is beneficial or not. This study aims to evaluate if treating low systemic flow in preterm infants with dobutamine has any effect on the cerebral circulation and in newborn prognosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dobutamine Versus Placebo for Low Superior Vena Cava Flow in Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While rates of survival for very preterm infants are increasing, a significant number of these patients suffer from neurodevelopmental disabilities. The pathophysiology of brain injury in the preterm infant is unclear, although haemodynamic disturbances during the period of transitional circulation after birth leading to ischemia-reperfusion events seem to play an important role. Up to one third of infants born under 30 weeks of gestation develop low systemic flow as measured by Doppler-echocardiography (low superior vena cava flow, SVCF); this finding has been associated with poor neurological outcome. Yet, it has not been systematically evaluated whether the treatment of this hemodynamic condition is beneficial or not. This study aims to evaluate if treating low systemic flow in preterm infants with dobutamina, DB, (inotrope-sympathicomimetic drug) has any effect on the cerebral circulation; specific interest of our research would be to target DB dose for individual patient´s response. Secondly, by means of two non-invasive technologies (cerebral and cardiac ultrasonography-Doppler and near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), the investigators search to characterise eventual differences in brain perfusion patterns during the adaptation to the transitional circulation that might be associated with the development of brain injury in the most vulnerable population.</detailed_description>
