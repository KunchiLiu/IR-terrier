	<brief_title>Crossover Evaluation of Effect of Atorvastatin on PK of Irinotecan in CRC Patients Receiving FOLFIRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, crossover study to address the pharmacokinetic effects of atorvastatin on irinotecan metabolism in patients receiving their first cycle of FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan). Each cycle of FOLFIRI is defined as 28 days, with a dose of FOLFIRI administered on day 1 and day 15. Patients will be recruited from the UNC Lineberger Cancer Center, referred by their primary oncologist for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). After obtaining informed consent, the patient will be randomized to either ARM A or ARM B. Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and 15 of FOLFIRI prior to treatment with irinotecan (baseline), immediately following the end of the irinotecan infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours following the end of the irinotecan infusion. ARM A subjects will receive atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily given for two weeks starting on Day -14 during PERIOD ONE. ARM A will then receive no statin during PERIOD TWO. Patients will receive FOLFIRI infusion on day 1 and day 15. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and periodically through 24 hours. ARM B subjects will receive no atorvastatin during PERIOD ONE. ARM B subjects will receive atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily for two weeks during PERIOD TWO (starting on Day 2). Patients will receive FOLFIRI infusion on day 1 and day 15. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and periodically through 24 hours. DNA extraction and genetic analysis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Federico Innocenti and those patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele will be excluded due to their altered irinotecan metabolism. Patients will be followed until Day 1 of Cycle 2 of FOLFIRI. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event(s).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years of age (no upper age limit) 2. Histological or cytological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, and patient scheduled to begin FOLFIRI for treatment of their metastatic disease 3. Patients taking statins at the time of enrollment are permitted. Patients taking statins (or one of the prohibited drugs, see section 4.2.27 and section 12.1) must agree to a 2 week washout prior to treatment with atorvastatin (see Schema) and section 5.2 4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 6. Adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function, as evidenced by the following within 7 days of treatment initiation with atorvastatin (or nothing, if enrolled into Arm B): absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm3 platelets ≥100,000/mm3 hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN Amylase and lipase ≤1.5 x ULN INR/PTT ≤1.5 x ULN CPK ≤ ULN 7. Women of childbearing potential and male subjects must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of study participation. Adequate contraception is defined as any medically recommended method (or combination of methods) as per standard of care. 8. Medical oncologist agrees that two week window is appropriate/safe prior to start of FOLFIRI for trial candidate. 9. The subject is capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in the protocol 10. Signed, IRBapproved written informed consent 1. Any prior allergies to statin therapy or adverse events that precluded further use, including but not limited to myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, etc. Patients who had to change from atorvastatin to another statin for safety or efficacy reasons will also be excluded. 2. Prior treatment with FOLFIRI or single agent irinotecan is prohibited within six weeks of enrollment. All prior toxicity from previous irinotecan administration must be resolved prior to enrollment. No more than 2 prior therapeutic regimens for metastatic disease are allowed. 3. Patients will not be allowed to receive bevacizumab or EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab or panitumumab) for the duration of the study (1 cycle). 4. Patients with baseline LDL ≤ 100 mg/dL who are not currently treated with statins 5. Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, and patients of Asian descent homozygous or heterozygous for the UGT1A1*6 allele will be excluded due to their altered irinotecan metabolism 6. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients. Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test performed a maximum of 7 days before start of atorvastatin and FOLFIRI treatment, and a negative result must be documented before start of treatment with atorvastatin or FOLFIRI (whichever is received first by patient). 7. Patients who have been treated with any hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factors (e.g., GCSF, GMCSF) ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug. Erythropoietin or darbepoetin therapy, if initiated ≥2 weeks prior to enrollment, may be continued. 8. History of Gilbert's syndrome 9. Pernicious anemia or other anemias due to Vitamin B12 deficiency (due to potential masking of deficiency by leucovorin) 10. Known Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency 11.
