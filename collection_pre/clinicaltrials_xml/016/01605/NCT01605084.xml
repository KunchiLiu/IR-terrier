	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent 2. HIV1 infected patients with viremia (VL ≥ 500/mL) on or after their first NNRTI or INIbased cART regimen and meeting one of the two criteria below: On 1st line Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or Integrase inhibitor (INI)based Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with HIV1 RNA ≥ 500 c/ML after being on the same therapy for at least 12 weeks Off 1st line NNRTI or INIbased Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for at least 2 weeks after having been on antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and who are noncompliant and off first line cART without a history of virologic failure with resistance, with a : HIV1 RNA ≥ 500 c/ML 3. Fully sensitive genotype and phenotype report for Atazanavir/Ritonavir (clinical cutoff of 5.2) and Darunavir/Ritonavir (clinical cutoff ranging from 10 to 90) 4. At least one NRTI other than Lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) with full sensitivity (one "active" NRTI) by genotype and phenotype, ie, PhenoSense Genotype (GT), report must provide a "sensitive" net assessment of susceptibility. An NRTI or PI (reported with or without ritonavir) with a "partially sensitive" net assessment will not be considered "fully sensitive" 4. Mentally able to participate in the study 5. Men and women ≥ 18 years old Women of child bearing potential who engage in vaginal intercourse and who are not clinically sterilized must use highly effective methods of birth control during the study 1. Screening HIV genotype showing presence at baseline of any of the following Protease inhibitor (PI) Mutation Patterns associated with genotypic resistance to Atazanavir sulfate/ Ritonavir or Darunavir/Ritonavir will lead to exclusion: 1. Subjects with any darunavir associated mutations* at baseline (*V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V) 2. Subjects with a major mutation to Atazanavir sulfate consisting of N88S 3. Subjects with more than 3 of any of the following Atazanavir sulfate related mutations:D30N, M36I/V, M46I/L/T, I54V/L/T/M/A, A71V/T/I/G, G73S/A/C/T, V77I, V82A/F/T/S/I, I84V/A, N88D or L90M 2. Subjects with &lt; 1 fully active NRTI on PhenoSense report, other than lamivudine and emtricitabine 3. Diagnosed with active tuberculosis 4. Chronic hepatitis B infection 5. Hepatitis Cpositive patients who are not clinically stable or need treatment during the study period 6. Acute hepatitis in the 30 days prior to study entry 7. Any gastrointestinal disease or surgical procedure that may impact the absorption of study drug 8. Intractable diarrhea within 30 days prior to study entry 9. Presence of a newly diagnosed Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)related opportunistic infection or any medical condition requiring acute therapy at the time of enrollment 10. Subject's with Cushing's syndrome 11. Untreated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism 12. Recent therapy with agents with significant systemic myelosuppressive, neurotoxic, pancreatotoxic, hepatotoxic or cytotoxic potential within 3 months of study start 13. Subject's with obstructive liver disease 14. Active alcohol or illegal substance use 15. Inability to swallow capsules 16. Active peripheral neuropathy 17. Presence of cardiomypathy or any significant cardiovascular disease 18. Known, clinically significant cardiac conduction system disease 19. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings: Moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency Screening laboratory values as follows: T4 &lt; 4mcg/dL or &gt;11mcg/dL and/or Thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) &lt;0.5mU/L or &gt;5.0mU/L Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 cc/min Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL Total serum lipase ≥ 1.4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Liver enzymes [Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT)] ≥ 5 times the ULN Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 5 times the ULN Platelets &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3 Positive blood screen for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Total serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times the ULN 20. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction: Previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to any of the components of atazanavir or the other experimental agents in this study Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Darunavir should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy History of allergy to atazanavir, ritonavir, or darunavir History of allergy to NRTIs included as NRTI backbone options in this study History of clinically relevant severe drug reaction 21. Sex and Reproductive Status: Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment prior to study drug administration Women who become pregnant during the study will be taken offprotocol Women using a prohibited contraceptive method Women who are breastfeeding 22. Other Exclusion Criteria Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of wither a psychiatric or physical illness</criteria>
