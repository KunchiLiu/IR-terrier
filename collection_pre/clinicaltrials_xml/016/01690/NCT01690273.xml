	<brief_summary>Mobility exercises are used in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) patients to preserve and restore axial mobility, but there are no data regarding a specific rehabilitation program that includes flexibility alone and its association with resistance exercises in AS patients with stable disease activity. So, we assessed the effects of two exercise programs in terms of mobility, functional capacity, quality of life and disease activity in AS patients. Methods. Fifty-five sedentary AS patients with a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Activity Index (BASDAI) &lt;4 were included.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The AS patients were randomly assigned into three groups, to receive a mobility exercise program (M) or mobility plus elastic resistance exercise program (M+R) or no exercise (C). The exercises group sessions were conducted twice per week for 16 weeks. This supervised program comprised 30 minutes of outdoor stretching and mobility exercises for the spine and limbs (M). After the flexibility program, M+R group carry out more 30 minutes of elastic resistance exercises. The mobility, disease activity and functional parameters were evaluated at baseline and after 16 weeks, with the evaluator blinded to the treatment group.</detailed_description>
