	<brief_summary>This study will test the clinical effectiveness and safety of apremilast compared with placebo as well as etanercept compared with placebo in the same group of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a new oral agent that is under clinical development for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune disorders, such as psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Behçet disease. Etanercept is approved for the treatment of psoriasis; it is the most widely prescribed anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3b Safety and Efficacy Study of Apremilast to Treat Moderate to Severe Plaque-plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast, etanercept, and placebo, in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Approximately 240 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment groups. All subjects will receive both tablets and injections through Week 16. The study will consist of four phases: - Screening Phase - up to 35 days - Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase - Weeks 0-16 - Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16-104 - Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase During the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, subjects will receive treatment with one of the following: - apremilast (APR) 30 mg tablets orally twice a day (BID) plus once weekly (QW) evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) saline (placebo) injections (1 mL x 2 injections SC), or - etanercept (ETN) 50 mg evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) once weekly (QW) injections (2 x 25 mg) plus placebo tablets orally twice a day (BID), or - placebo tablets and evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) saline (placebo) injections. All subjects will be asked to participate in a 4-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase either upon completion of the study or upon discontinuation of investigational product for those subjects who terminate the study early.</detailed_description>
