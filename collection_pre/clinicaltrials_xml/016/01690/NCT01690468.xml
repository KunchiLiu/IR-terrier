At least one prior regimen of chemotherapy, with no maximum number of chemotherapy cycles A serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg% obtained ≤ 2 weeks prior to entry Adequate hematologic reserve obtained ≤ 2 weeks prior to entry: leukocytes ≥ 3,000 mm^3; absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 mm^3; platelets ≥ 100,000 mm^3 Adequate hepatocellular function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3x upper limit of normal within institutional limits; bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 Life expectancy of at least 90 days The patient should be off chemotherapy, biologic therapy and radiation for 28 days. Neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to grade 1 per Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4 Prior TCNPM therapy History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to TCNPM Patients must be diseasefree of prior invasive malignancies for &gt;2 years with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
