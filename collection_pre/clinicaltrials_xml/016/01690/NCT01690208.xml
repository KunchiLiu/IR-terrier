	<brief_summary>This is a pilot translational study aiming to compare the effects of a multi-component care program with personalized drug regimen augmented by behavioural therapy with psychological support and peer influence, led by a diabetes specialist team on metabolic control, psychological health and behaviours in difficult-to-treat type 2 diabetic patients versus usual care. The study hypothesis is to evaluate a novel individualized, multicomponent care program to optimize glycemic control in difficult-to-treat type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic patients are at high risk for co-morbidities which are closely related to disease duration and coexisting cardiovascular risk factors and complications. Data has shown that the following 3 groups of diabetic patients are at extremely high risk for future events: 1. Obese type 2 diabetic patients: Weight control is a major therapeutic challenge which often requires cognitive-psychological-behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to pharmacological and surgical interventions. After long disease duration, often characterized by the presence of complications, many obese diabetic patients need insulin to control glycemia which put them at risk of further weight gain which sets up a vicious cycle. 2. Young type 2 diabetic patients: In both Pima Indian and Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients, young age of onset substantially increased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, mainly due to long disease duration. Furthermore, these patients often default follow up or are non-compliant due to competing priorities and lack of symptoms. These young patients also have marked phenotypic heterogeneity characterised by insulin insufficiency and/or obesity with strong family history. 3. Diabetic patients with established cardiovascular-renal complications. In a series of analyses, Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with established cardiovascular and kidney disease had 38% event rates including all-cause death and cardiovascular-renal complications including peripheral vascular disease (PVD) over 5 years. These 3 groups of patients are difficult to treat with many unmet needs requiring complex treatment regimens, intensive counselling and emotional support. In a series of studies, the investigators have confirmed the marked benefits of using a team approach to deliver structured care with particular emphasis on continuation of care and periodic reminders on clinical outcomes. Preliminary analysis from our peer support program also demonstrated the benefits of utilizing organized and visual information to communicate personalized risks and targets, further augmented by peer support, to improve risk factor control in type 2 diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
