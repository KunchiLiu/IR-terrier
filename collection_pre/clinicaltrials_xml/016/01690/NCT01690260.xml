	<brief_summary>Results of growth factors indicate that Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) have an exceptional ability to stimulate different characteristics of mesenchymale cells to osseous cells. Local application of BMP results in an increase of osseous tissue regardless of the location of the growth factor. 5 years clinical studies show that BMP's can stimulate an increase of osseous tissue and improve clinical results when autologous bone graft is reduced or removed. The purpose of this study is to examine whether recombinant growth factor BMP-2 can replace autologous bone graft in order to stimulating ossification during transplantation of osseous tissue.</brief_summary>
