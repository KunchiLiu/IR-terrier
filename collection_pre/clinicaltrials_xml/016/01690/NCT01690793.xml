	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that there is a statistically significant decrease of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides (NHPs) in subjects with asthma exacerbation compared to levels following treatment of an exacerbation of asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides in Exacerbation of Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design 1. Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides in individuals suffering from exacerbation of asthma. 2. Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides 5-7 days after initiation of treatment of exacerbation of asthma. 3. Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides 10-14 days after initiation of treatment of exacerbation of asthma. 3 comparisons of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides levels will be made: 1. Exacerbation compared to 5-7 days after initiation of treatment 2. Exacerbation compared to 10-14 days after initiation of treatment 3. 5-7 days after initiation of treatment compared to 10-14 days after initiation of treatment. Samples of blood will be secured in the Division of Allergy/Immunology at the University of South Florida, Joy McCann Culverhouse Airways Disease Center. All samples will be appropriately coded to maintain confidentiality. Blood specimens will be held at minus 20 degrees Celsius.</detailed_description>
