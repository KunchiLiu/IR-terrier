	<brief_summary>In this study, Interactive Research and Development (IRD) in Karachi, Pakistan is evaluating the impact of Interactive Reminders on drug compliance and treatment outcomes. Interactive Reminders is an interactive SMS reminder system to help patients remember to take their TB medication. In this system, patients receive daily SMS reminders for the duration of their treatment at a pre-specified time, reminding them to take their medication. Patients are asked to reply back to the system, either through SMS or a missed call, with the time they took their medicine that day. If a response is not received within two hours, a second reminder is sent. If a response is still not received in a further two hours, a third and final reminder for the day is sent. Non-responsive patients are followed up with phone calls and a list of non-responsive patients is shared with clinics based on the parameters of non-responsiveness that they specify. IRD seeks to determine the impact of this system on treatment outcomes and compliance to prescribed medication through administering a randomized control trial among newly diagnosed TB patients in Karachi, Pakistan.</brief_summary>
