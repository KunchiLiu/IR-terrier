	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to determine if real time visual feedback of body movements improves balance control more than walking on a treadmill alone. Individuals participating in this research study will be tested using a battery of clinical strength and balance assessments twice before a 4 week training period and once after the training period. The 4 week training period will consist of 12 sessions walking on a treadmill. The experimental group will see real time visual feedback regarding their body movements, and the control group will not receive this visual feedback. Following the 4 week training each participant will again be tested using the battery of clinical strength and balance assessments.</brief_summary>
