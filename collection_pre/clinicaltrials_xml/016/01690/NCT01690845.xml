	<brief_summary>Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is reported to be the most frequent cause of elevated aminotransferase levels in hospital. Up to 10 % of critically ill patients develop HH during the course of their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Occurrence of HH is a life threatening event and ICU-mortality is reported to be up to 60%. Early therapeutic intervention is of central prognostic importance in patients with HH to improve the hemodynamic impairment as early as possible, to reduce hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy, to avoid progression of organ failure and to improve outcome. Studies reported that Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS®) therapy improved the hemodynamic situation in patients with acute and acute on chronic liver failure. The study hypothesis is that MARS® therapy in critically ill patients with severe HH improves hepatic hemodynamics and function and consecutively the course of the disease. 40 patients with suffering of severe HH with aminotransferase levels &gt; 40 times the upper limit of normal of more than 12 hours will be randomized 1:1 to MARS® therapy (n=20) or conventional therapy (n=20). 4 MARS®-sessions will be performed on three consecutive days, each for at least 12 hours. Treatment will be continued under special circumstances. The maximum duration of the treatment phase is 7 days. The primary endpoint is the difference of the indocyanine plasma disappearance rate at day 7. The expected duration of the study is 2 years.</brief_summary>
