	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed epithelial, primary fallopian or primary peritoneal cancer. 2. Verified progression by either RECIST criteria and/or GCIG CA125 criteria after previous first line chemotherapy or progression after later lines of cytotoxic treatment. 3. Platinum resistance or partially platinum sensitive disease Relapsed within six months of prior first line/later lines of platinumbased therapy or Relapsed within sixtwelve months of prior first line/later lines of platinumbased therapy 4. Age ≥ 18 years. 5. Performance status 02. 6. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 or CA125 GCIG criteria 7. Adequate bone marrow function, liver function, renal function and coagulation parameters (within 7 days prior to enrollment): WBC ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/l or neutrophils (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/l Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l Hemoglobin ≥ 9.7 g/dl (6 mmol/L) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum transaminases ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 8. Written informed consent. 9. Tissue available for BRCAness analysis/BRCA mutation analysis. 1. Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor. 2. Patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutation. 3. Platinumrefractory disease (disease that progressed or was stable during prior platinum therapy) 4. Patients who have received (or are planning to receive) treatment with any other investigational agent, or who have participated in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to entering this trial. 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding. For fertile women a negative pregnancy test at screening is mandatory. 6. Fertile patients not willing to use acceptable and safe methods of contraception during and for 6 months after treatment 7. Other present or previous malignancy except curatively treated cervical cancer stage I, nonmelanotic skin cancer or other cancer with minimal risk of relapse. Previous breast cancer is allowed, if disease free followup at least five years prior to enrollment. 8. CNS metastasis. 9. History of any chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality, which is not medically controlled or in the opinion of the Investigator may increase the risks associated with study drug administration (e.g. diabetes, cardiac diseases, hypertension, renal or liver disease). 10. Allergy to the ingredients of the study medication.</criteria>
