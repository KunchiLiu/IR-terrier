	<brief_summary>When used in conjunction with a local anesthetic, dexamethasone may prolong both the sensory and motor effects of high supraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block (SBP) in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. This study seeks to determine if there is a relationship between the duration of sensory and motor blockade in supraclavicular brachial plexus nerve blocks (SBP) when combined with increasing doses of dexamethasone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Response Study of Dexamethasone in Combination With Bupivacaine 0.25%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exact mechanism of dexamethasone on peripheral nerve block is unclear. The current theory is that the effect is not dose related, while only 4mg and 8mg doses were studied. Our hypothesis is that the dose differences at 1mg, 2mg, or 4mg, does not have significant effect on the duration of analgesia. Therefore, we are not considering any patients to receive suboptimal dosing of preservative free dexamethasone in this study.</detailed_description>
