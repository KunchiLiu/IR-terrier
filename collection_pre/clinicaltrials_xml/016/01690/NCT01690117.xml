	<brief_title>German Adaptation of REACH II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caring for elderly people with dementia imposes a heavy strain on care providers like family caregivers and puts them at risk of psychological and physical morbidity. A variety of psychosocial interventions have been developed which aim at improving caregiver emotional and physical health. These interventions differ in terms of treatment delivery (individual or group format) and content (education, symptom appraisal, problem solving, skill building, stress management or behavior modification). Systematic reviews and meta analyses have concluded that individualized programs have a greater impact than group interventions, and problem solving or behavior modification strategies are superior to education alone. Structured multi-component interventions may also reduce the risk of patients home admissions. The intervention program "Resources to Enhance Alzheimer`s Caregivers Health -second step" (REACH II) is a multimodal, individualized and structured multi-component intervention program for family caregivers and was successfully evaluated in a multisite, randomized and controlled trial in the USA. The overall objectives of REACH II are to identify and reduce modificable risk factors to enhance the well-being of the caregivers and to enhance the quality of care. It takes place at caregivers home and focuses on 5 domains that are important to caregivers: reducing depression, decreasing burden, improving self care, enhancing social support, and managing problem behaviours. Since there is a lack of effective treatment programs for family caregivers of demented persons in the German Health system respectively care system the purpose of the present study is to adapt and to implement REACH II to the care system conditions of a medium-sized East German town (Leipzig). To test the effects of this adapted intervention program the present study is design as unisite, randomized and controlled trail. Primary outcome is reducing family caregiver burden.</detailed_description>
