	<brief_title>A Study of Residual Curarization Incidence in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last twenty years, residual curarization in PACU (Post Anesthesia Care Unit) has become a common problem in clinical practice and poses high risk to patients. The residual curarization incidence of Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) varies very much between different studies. These differences indicates the necessity of further study. In China, there is no common view of the harmfulness of residual curarization and its complications. The consensus on the necessity of neuromuscular transmission monitoring and neuromuscular blockade antagonist has not been reached yet. There is also no similar large-scale survey in China. In this case, the investigators conduct this large scale multicentre study, which is designed to learn the incidence of residual curarization and its complications. Further analysis of risk factors will also been made. All these efforts are hoped to fill the data gap and provide reliable evidences for rational use of NMBA.</detailed_description>
