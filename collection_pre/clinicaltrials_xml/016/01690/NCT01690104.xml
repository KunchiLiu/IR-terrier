	<brief_summary>We are investigating the effects of pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation on the regulation of blood pressure in healthy volunteers. Rifampicin (an antibiotic and also an efficient PXR activator) and placebo will be given for a week to volunteers and blood pressure is measured 24 hours using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor. Blood pressure regulating hormones will be measured in blood. Our hypothesis is that PXR is involved in the regulation of blood pressure.</brief_summary>
