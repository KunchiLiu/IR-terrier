	<detailed_description>This study involves fasted and post-prandial components. Fasted Study: Participants will provide fasting blood samples pre-and post-intervention [4-week administration of supplement or placebo] in Treatment Period I. Participants will again provide fasting blood samples pre-and post-intervention [4-week administration of supplement or placebo, opposite to Treatment Period I] during Treatment Period II.
