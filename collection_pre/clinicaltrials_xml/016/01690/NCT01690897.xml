	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Treatment for Women With Sexual Interest/Desire Concerns: The MIND Group</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES: 1. Compared to baseline, the MIND group will have significantly greater improvements in self-report measures of: (a) subjective sexual arousal; (b) perception of genital arousal; (c) sexual desire; (e) sexual distress; (f) depressive symptoms; (g) mindfulness, and (h) genital sexual response as measured by a vaginal photoplethysmograph. 2. We hypothesize no significant change in any of the endpoints listed in #1 from the first to the second wait-list (pre-treatment) conditions. 3. We are interested in concordance between genital and subjective sexual arousal as another endpoint. It is unknown if participation in the MIND group will significantly increase concordance</detailed_description>
