	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pazopanib hydrochloride and bevacizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with previously untreated kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can prevent tumor growth by blocking the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safe phase II dose of this novel regimen. (Phase I) II. To determine the median progression free survival (PFS) from this novel regimen. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the proposed regimen. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the response rate. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride). (Phase I) IV. To evaluate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) levels at various time points and correlate with response. (Phase I) V. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of this new regimen. (Phase II) VI. To evaluate the VEGF levels, interleukin (IL)-8 levels and MDSC levels at various time points and correlate with outcome. (Phase II) VII. To evaluate the PFS rate at 12 months. (Phase II) VIII. To evaluate overall survival. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-28, and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 36 and 50. Courses repeat every 70 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>
