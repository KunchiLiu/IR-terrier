	<brief_title>Everolimus Stent in Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy and safety of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary artery disease is well established. It is well known that Drug Eluting Stent (DES) have dramatically decreased Restenosis rates for both on-label and off-label indications. However, the concern for increased (late) stent thrombosis is still present DES implantation in patient with acute myocardial infarction is still controversial because acute coronary lesion presents the highest possible thrombotic burden Newer DES with new antiproliferative drugs and more biocompatible polymers have shown a significant reduction of (late) stent thrombosis in patients in stable condition. Aim of the study was to asses the long term efficacy and safety on second generation everolimus eluting stent compared with first generation sirolimus eluting stent</detailed_description>
