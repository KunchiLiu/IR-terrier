	<brief_summary>The investigators are doing this research study to compare the pharmacokinetics (rate of absorption) of insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (Novolog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra) within individual subjects. Additionally, the investigators will perform a preliminary feasibility evaluation of a minimally invasive continuous insulin monitoring (CIM) device and its use to derive PK parameters in human subjects.</brief_summary>
