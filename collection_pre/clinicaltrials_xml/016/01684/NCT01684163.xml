	<brief_summary>GLYX-13 is a NMDA receptor glycine site partial agonist being studied in subjects with major depressive disorder (depression) who have responded inadequately to another antidepressant drug during the current episode. This trial will assess the effects of GLYX-13 on depression when added to another antidepressant drug that the patient is already taking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of GLYX-13 in Subjects With Inadequate/Partial Response to Antidepressants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the mean difference in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 (HDRS-17) score for the combined GLYX-13 mean change versus the placebo group mean change at the end of a 6 week randomized withdrawal phase (predose baseline score - score at end of randomized withdrawal period).</detailed_description>
