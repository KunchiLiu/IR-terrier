	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the research is to develop new methods for studying the link between diet, health and disease. The enquiry consists of two part. A metabolomic biomarker discovery study followed by a randomised controlled trial of moderate dietary induced weight loss. A cohort of moderately overweight men and women will undergo a metabolomic study follow by randomised controlled trial of a healthy diet with a 20% energy restriction for a 12 week period. This intervention will improve the volunteer's body composition and reduce their risk of developing diabetes. Extensive tests will be conducted before and after the dietary intervention using emerging technologies with current state-of-the-art methods. These tests will monitor the numerous physiological adaptations that have occurred on a gene, cell, organ and organismic level. The study will, therefore, aim for a scientific breakthrough by developing a series of novel biological "markers" that can accurately determine an individual's health status.</brief_summary>
