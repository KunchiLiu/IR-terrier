	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety Study of ALbumin Therapy in Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the statistics of the cause of death in 2008 by the Statistics Korea, the stroke was accounted for a large proportion of cause of death among adults, as well as higher mortality, severe sequelae. These stroke in acute phase showed neurological deterioration over 50% of the patients after beginning of treatment and the sequelae resulting in that the nervous tissue was not regenerated is regarded as irreversible changes. The test group administered 20% albumin based on 1.25g/kg (up to 100g (500ml) over 80kg body weight) to the patients occurred within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms and equal amount of placebo (saline solution (0.9% normal saline)) administered to the control group will be compared to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALbumin for the patients with acute ischemic stroke.</detailed_description>
