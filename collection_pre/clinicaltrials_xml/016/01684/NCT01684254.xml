	<brief_summary>The present project will focus on evaluating the technical efficacy of the in-shoe gait monitoring device (ActiveGait) through laboratory based biomechanical gait assessments of children who exhibit gait deviations due to CP or idiopathic toe walking wearing the device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An In-Shoe Device to Monitor Toe-Walking in Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators on this protocol intend to develop the device and rely on it to propose a Toe Walk Severity (TWS) index, a novel outcome measure for quantifying changes in severity of toe walking over time and for assessing the outcome of surgical and non-surgical interventions. Tasks include: A.Validate data acquisition measurements in laboratory setting compared to gold-standard video analysis and field (outside of laboratory). B.Develop multi-stage classification algorithm from subset of laboratory and field data. C.Validate classification algorithm against random subsets of laboratory and field data. D.Explore the development of a Toe Walking Severity (TWS) index from available biomechanical and ActiveGait data for different ambulatory conditions. E.Perform longitudinal study of the childhood toe walking population including both laboratory analysis and at-home monitoring using ActiveGait technology. F.Analyze statistically the sensitivity and specificity of the TWS index compared to clinical observations. Gather evidence that the TWS index provides a means to track changes in severity of toe walking over time.</detailed_description>
