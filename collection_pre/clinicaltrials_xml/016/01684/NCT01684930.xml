	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this proposal is that in subjects with PAD, regular consumption of a high nitrate supplement which raises plasma nitrite, in conjunction with 12 weeks of supervised exercise training at the limb ischemic threshold (SET) will produce a greater clinical benefit (increases in COT and PWT) than placebo plus supervised exercise at the limb ischemic threshold (PET).</brief_summary>
