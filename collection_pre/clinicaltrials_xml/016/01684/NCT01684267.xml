	<brief_summary>To test the usability and effectiveness of a robotic device, called the Robotic Gait Rehabilitation (RGR) Trainer, in (1) healthy subjects with no gait impairment and (2) patients with stroke with gait abnormalities secondary to impaired knee function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvic Obliquity Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients Using Robotically Generated Force Fields</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The device is designed to train stroke patients to correct abnormal gait patterns associated with exaggerated and uncoordinated movements of the pelvis by applying force fields to correct the movement of the pelvis. The focus will be on correcting hip hiking (i.e. exaggerated unilateral upward movements of one side of the pelvis) in post-stroke patients. The human-robot interface will be based on impedance control techniques so that the force-field actuators generate smooth virtual spring/damper restitution forces at the patient's pelvic area. As part of the study we will determine whether the force fields applied by the actuated components of the device can effect an acute change in gait biomechanics, primarily pelvis motion during stance and swing phases, in healthy subjects and patients with stroke during ambulation. The investigators will also evaluate the usability of the orthosis in terms of donning &amp; doffing, user confidence, and comfort.</detailed_description>
