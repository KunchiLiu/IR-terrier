	<brief_summary>This study integrates a model of occupational-therapy based cognitive rehabilitation as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for cocaine abusers. We hypothesize that cognitive impairment and quality of life would improve and that cocaine use would decrease in those participants receiving occupational-therapy based cognitive rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
