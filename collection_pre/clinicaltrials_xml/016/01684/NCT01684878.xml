	<brief_summary>This two-part, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pertuzumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. In the non-randomized Part 1 safety run-in, participants will receive pertuzumab plus either topotecan or paclitaxel. In the randomized, double-blind Part 2 of the study, participants will receive either pertuzumab or placebo in combination with chemotherapy (topotecan, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine).</brief_summary>
