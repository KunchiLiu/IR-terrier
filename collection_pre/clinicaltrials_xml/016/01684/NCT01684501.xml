	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to perform clinical testing of the PowerFoot in a group of individuals with trans-tibial amputation with the objective of optimizing its performance and comparing it with a current state-of-art passive-elastic ankle-foot prosthesis, i.e. the Ceterus Flex-Foot.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will measure performance during level ground walking and in simulated uneven terrain. The investigators will also compare the metabolic cost and self-selected gait speed with the PowerFoot versus the traditional Ceterus Flex-Foot. Tasks will include: - Perform biomechanical analysis (kinematic and kinetic gait parameters) of the PowerFoot and the Ceterus in a group of individuals with trans-tibial amputation during level walking, ramp ambulation, and stair ambulation. - Compare in the laboratory and in the field the performance of the PowerFoot with the Ceterus.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>weigh more than 200 lbs are high level ambulators corresponding to levels E to F of the Special Interest Group of Amputee Medicine (SIGAM) mobility grade have the ability to follow multistep commands. score level D on the SIGAM mobility grade have experienced 1 or more falls in the last month before the study have a residual limb length which does not allow for seven inches clearance of bracket attachment for the PowerFoot the residual limb must be stable in volume (no change in socket or socket padding in last 6 months) and without pain that limits function the soundside (contralateral) lower extremity must be free of impediments that affect gait, range of motion, or limb muscle activity Any diagnosed cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and/ or orthopedic conditions that would interfere with subject participation</criteria>
