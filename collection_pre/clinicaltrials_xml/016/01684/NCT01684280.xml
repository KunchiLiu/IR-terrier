	<brief_summary>To investigate: 1. Associations between miRNA and insulin signaling-related gene expressions in abdominal adipose tissues in obese subjects. 2. Differences in miRNAs expressed by intrabdominal omental adipose tissues between genders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obesity-related Genes in Taiwanese Undergoing Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared the differences in microRNA expressions of abdominal adipose tissue in morbid obese male and female subjects to elucidate the possible regulatory role of microRNA in insulin signaling-related gene expression levels and its association with biochemical markers. We hope to find a miRNA that can be used to predict the syndrome associated with obesity.</detailed_description>
