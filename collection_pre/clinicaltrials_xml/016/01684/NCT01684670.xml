	<brief_summary>This research study is designed to investigate the feasibility and treatment effects of a behavioral speech treatment in adults and children with Down Syndrome (DS) and dysarthria. The speech sessions will provide an intensive, articulation-based intervention focused on increasing effort during speech production via use of "clear speech." A single subject multiple baselines across subjects design will be employed in a total of six subjects divided into two groups of three. Changes in dependent measures will be determined by visual inspection, effect size determination, and time series analysis. The study follows accepted procedures in rehabilitation treatment and research and there are minimal foreseeable risks associated with participation.</brief_summary>
