	<brief_title>An Assessment of the Feasibility and Safety of Conservative Oxygen Therapy in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Identify patients likely to require ventilation until the day after tomorrow (a time frame of 36 hours of average) 2. Deliver a conservative oxygen therapy protocol while in ICU (a time frame on average of 10 days) 3. Target an oxygen saturation between 90 and 92% 4. Adjust FiO2 to achieve target SaO2 at all times 5. Assess percentage of time patient is within target 6. Assess for safety of this approach</detailed_description>
