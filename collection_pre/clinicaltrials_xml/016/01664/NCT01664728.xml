	<brief_title>An Expanded Access Study of Abiraterone Acetate in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer Who Have Completed Clinical Study COU-AA-001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known) extended access study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continued administration of abiraterone acetate in patients who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment in Clinical Study COU-AA-001 and continue to receive clinical benefit from this treatment. Patients will continue with the same dose regimen administered at the end of Study COU-AA-001 and will receive a low-dose glucocorticoid daily. Patients will be followed every 3 months for disease progression and survival for up to 3 years following study entry. Safety will be monitored throughout the study up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication.</detailed_description>
