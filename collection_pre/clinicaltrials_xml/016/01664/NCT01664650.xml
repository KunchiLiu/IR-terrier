	<brief_summary>The 15-25% of the population of developed countries suffers for metabolic syndrome. It is associated with a 2-4 fold increase in cardiovascular morbility and mortality and with a 5- 9 fold increase in developing type II diabetes. MS prevalence increases after the onset of menopause, because of estrogen deficiency. It is still not clear if menopause itself increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in al women or only in those that develop MS. Many MS patients that show slight modification in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters are not generally pharmacologically treated since diabetes or alteration in the lipid profile are not evidenced. In this respect it is of importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat MS. Genistein (4,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), shown a potentially preventive role on the cardiovascular apparatus in post-menopausal women, may be termed as selective ER modulator (SERM), since it reveals both ER-alpha full agonist and ER-beta partial agonist activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Genistein in Postmenopausal Women With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators studied whether genistein may represent an efficacious and safe alternative for reducing vascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. The clinical study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 150 patients with metabolic syndrome. After a 4-week stabilization on a standard fat-reduced diet, participants were randomly assigned to receive either phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and following treatment fasting plasma glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid concentrations, plasma total homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin and visfatin were measured. Bioimpedentiometric and nutritional analysis, as well as a safety assessment of the endometrium and vagina were also performed.</detailed_description>
