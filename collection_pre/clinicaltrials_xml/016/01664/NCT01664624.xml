	<brief_title>Roflumilast Plus Alogliptin Proof-of-Mechanism Study in Type2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study to evaluate the antiglycemic efficacy and safety of roflumilast + alogliptin compared to alogliptin alone and roflumilast alone; it will also include an open-label exenatide treatment arm as a control. The antiglycemic efficacy of the combination will be evaluated through the measurement of postprandial active GLP-1 level, ß cell secretion activity (via the measurement of C-peptide and insulin levels), appetite sensations (as assessed by VAS) and glycemic control as assessed by a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS).</detailed_description>
