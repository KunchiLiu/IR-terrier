	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the examination of the hypothesis that synchronized nasal IMV as compared to non-synchronized nasal IMV will decrease breathing effort in preterm infants immediately after extubation when recovering from Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Another objective is to examine the effects for synchronized non-invasive mechanical ventilation on gas exchange and cerebral oxygen saturation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Synchronization More Effective During Noninvasive Ventilation in Immediately Extubated Preterm Infants?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators plan to test the hypothesis that synchronized nasal IMV (S-NIMV) as compared to non-synchronized nasal IMV (NIMV) will decrease breathing effort in preterm infants immediately after extubation when recovery from RDS, as measured by phasic esophageal pressure deflection. Furthermore, the investigators plan to evaluate the effects of synchronized NIMV on gas exchange and brain oxygenation, and to evaluate the reliability of a newly developed abdominal pressure sensor device for the S-NIMV mode in a newly designed commercially available ventilator device.</detailed_description>
