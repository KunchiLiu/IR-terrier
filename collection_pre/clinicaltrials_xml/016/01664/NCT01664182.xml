	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well trebananib with or without bevacizumab, pazopanib hydrochloride, sorafenib tosylate, or sunitinib malate works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Trebananib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Bevacizumab, pazopanib hydrochloride, sorafenib tosylate, and sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving trebananib with or without bevacizumab, pazopanib hydrochloride, sorafenib tosylate, or sunitinib malate is more effective in treating kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trebananib With or Without Bevacizumab, Pazopanib Hydrochloride, Sorafenib Tosylate, or Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of trebananib (AMG 386) alone and in combination with continuation of previously administered bevacizumab, pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib), sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib), or sunitinib malate (sunitinib) in advanced renal cell carcinoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate progression free survival in each arm. II. To evaluate the tolerance and toxicity of AMG 386 alone and in combination with continuation of the prior VEGF targeted agent. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the association between pretreatment tumor gene expression levels and response to AMG 386 in combination with continuation of the prior VEGF targeted agent. II. To evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in angiogenic genes and response to AMG 386 in combination with continuation of the prior VEGF targeted agent. III. To compare changes in circulating angiogenic factors in patients treated with AMG 386 monotherapy to those treated with AMG 386 in combination with VEGF-targeted therapy. IV. To compare expression of angiogenic genes from archival tumor specimens to the expression in biopsy specimens obtained after progression on anti-VEGF therapy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive trebananib as in Arm I and either bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29; pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42; sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-42; or sunitinib malate PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-8 weeks.</detailed_description>
