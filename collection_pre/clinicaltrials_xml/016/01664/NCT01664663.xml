	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the valu of individually dose escalated radiotherapy compared with a standard dose of radiotherapy combined with standard concomitant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (stage III) with good performance status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Randomized Study on Locally Advanced NSCLC Escalated Dose on Individual Basis Treatment With Radiochemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, multicentre phase II trial of individually escalated radiotherapy up to 84 Gy due to normal tissue dose constraints combined with standard concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin-vinorelbine) compared to standard dose radiotherapy (68 Gy) combined with the same chemotherapy. There are restrictions due to lung function, performance status and pre-treatment weight loss. The main endpoint is progression free survival and additional endpoints are local control, overall survival, toxicity quality of life and relapse pattern.</detailed_description>
