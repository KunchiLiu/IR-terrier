	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (Eritromax ®) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters are similar to the comparator drug (Eprex ®) in healthy subjects following administration of single intravenous dose. The objective of this randomized, crossover, clinical trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the drug Eritromax® marketed by Blau Farmacêutica, compared to the product Eprex ®, produced by Janssen-Cilag, by assessing plasma concentration of the drug and the reticulocyte count following a single-dose intravenous administration of 100 IU/kg in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
