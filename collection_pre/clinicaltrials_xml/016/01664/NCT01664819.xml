	<brief_summary>Aravind Eye Hospital and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Proctor Foundation collaborated on the Antioxidants for the Prevention of Cataract Study from 1997-2002. (1) In the study, 798 participants aged 35-50 years were enrolled from 5 rural villages, and randomized to thrice weekly antioxidants (vitamin C, 500 mg; beta carotene, 15 mg; and alpha-tocopherol, 400 IU) or placebo. After 5 years of supplementation, there was no significant difference in cataract formation between the antioxidant group and placebo. In this follow-up study, we will return to study villages to determine whether rates of cataract surgery are different in the 2 groups. 1. Gritz DC, Srinivasan M, Smith SD, et al.
