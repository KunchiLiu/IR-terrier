	<brief_summary>Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is known to reduce infarct size post MI when used in the peri/immediate post infarct period. However little is known as to the effect of repeated remote conditioning post-MI (Myocardial Infarction) on not only infarct size, but also on ventricular remodeling and ultimately cardiac failure. In this phase II first in man trial, the investigators intend to carry out daily remote ischaemic conditioning in post MI patients. The principal hypothesis is that RIC applied on a daily basis for 4 weeks following a heart attack improves the ejection fraction at 4 months as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.</brief_summary>
