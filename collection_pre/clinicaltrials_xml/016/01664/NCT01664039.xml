	<criteria>Diagnosed with either openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in at least one eye and be treatment naïve to any glaucoma treatment. Intraocular pressure (IOP) between 19 mmHg and 35 mmHg in at least one eye, which would be the study eye. IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, in such a way that should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period. Able to follow instructions and be willing and able to attend all study visits. Best corrected Snellen visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye. Must read, sign, and date an Ethics Committeeapproved informed consent form. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any components of the study medications to be used in this study that is deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye. Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either eye. Prior treatment of dry eye with punctal plugs, punctal cautery, Restasis® or topical ocular corticosteroids. History of ocular surface disease (dry eye) or current/prior use of dry eye medications (either overthe counter or prescription medications). Contact lens wear. Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye that is less than three months prior to the Screening Visit. Use of any systemic medications known to affect IOP (e.g., oral betaadrenergic blockers, alphaagonists and blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers), which have not been on a stable course for at least 7 days prior to Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study. Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control, are pregnant, or lactating. Unwilling to risk the possibility of darkened iris or eyelash changes. Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
