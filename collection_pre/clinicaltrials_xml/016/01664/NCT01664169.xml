	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying plasma samples from patients with pancreatic cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with pancreatic cancer treated on study CALGB-80303.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Plasma Specimens From Patients Treated on Study CALGB-80303</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether the observed predictive value of plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 for overall survival (OS) in study BO17706 can be replicated in study CALGB-80303 using the same Immunological Multiparameter Chip Technology (IMPACT) assay. - To determine whether the observed predictive value of plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 for progression-free survival (PFS), and other circulating biomarkers in study BO17706, can be replicated in study CALGB-80303 using the same IMPACT assay. - To explore the relationship between efficacy and other biomarkers measured in the plasma samples. OUTLINE: The samples required for this study are stored in the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office at The Ohio State University from patients enrolled on protocol CALGB-80303. No additional samples are required from patients. The following markers are analyzed in EDTA plasma samples using the Immunological MultiParameter Chip Technology (IMPACT) a Roche proprietary multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform: VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, E-selectin, VEGF-R3, IL-8, bFGF, PDGF-C, ICAM-1, and PlGF.</detailed_description>
