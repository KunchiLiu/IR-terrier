	<brief_summary>The aim of this intervention study is to examine whether tailored exercise therapy training is effective and cost-effective to decrease headache frequency and intensity, reduce medication used for chronic headache and patientsÂ´ absence from work, improve their neck muscle force, cervical spine mobility, functional ability and quality of life, and increase general physical activity in chronic headache women at regular work during a 6-month intervention. The intervention itself with pilot-tested upper-neck specific exercise regimen aims that patients would independently commit to train and exercise to reduce their headache, and thus increase their quality of life. In addition, reduced pain and frequency of headache may increase the objectively measured daily physical activity of chronic headache patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training With Physically Active Lifestyle to Reduce Headache and Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tension-type,migraine and cervicogenic headache are the most common reasons for visits to a primary care physician among working women. Headache has major economic impact due to patients' absence from work, and pharmacy claims. Neck symptoms induce three percent of all visits to a primary care physician and 1 % of all costs in health care, and moreover, institutionalizing increase costs of treatment. Active treatment may offer cost-effective option for outpatients. In addition, there is no data showing how much headache/neck pain restricts participation in physical activity (PA) or other activities in society. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether specific therapeutic exercises reduce cervicogenic headache cost-effectively, and simultaneously improve neck function and quality of life. The other aim is to evaluate the effect of exercises on daily PA in women with chronic headache. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1. Specific therapeutic exercises based on individual training reduce cost-effectively cervicogenic headache and improve neck function, and quality of life on women at regular work during a 6-month intervention 2. The intervention increases general physical activity of women with cervicogenic headache 3. The intervention assists them to manage the headache by way of exercising during the follow-up. 4. Physical activity of women with chronic cervicogenic headache is lower than average in Finnish population. The HEADEX intervention study is a randomized controlled trial. Volunteers, women at regular work and having ongoing status with chronic migraine and/or cervicogenic headache will be recruited using newspaper advertising, from the register of Finnish Migraine Society and occupational health care services in Helsinki, Tampere and Jyvaskyla. The study sample is restricted to women, as the headache is much more common in women. After recruitment, the eligibility of patients to participate is screened. In total, the aim is to obtain 120 women to participate. The two subsequent baseline assessments and follow-up of headaches with the diary between two months before the beginning of the intervention enable ensuring intensity and type of the headache and that it is chronic. Randomisation is centralised but the intervention will be accomplished and clustered in three study centres. Sample size has been estimated for the primary outcomes. The number of participant will be 60 women in treatment and 60 control group. The 6 months exercise intervention consists of 6 supervised progressive exercise training sessions and home training program, and the participants are instructed to increase their PA. The main emphasis of the exercise program is to improve and relearn postural and movement control of neck, and later on strengthen the postural muscles. The exercise intervention consists of six supervised progressive exercise training sessions to teach rehabilitative training technique with similar home training program. Before the intervention, information on work ergonomics will be enquired and if needed, changes will be recommended. The control group will receive Transcutaneous Nervous Stimulation treatment (6 times) as a placebo treatment (intensity 0), and recommendation to maintain their PA at previous level. The follow-up is identical for both groups, and information on exercise frequency is collected up to 24 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
