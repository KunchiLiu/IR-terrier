	<brief_summary>Aim: To assess in vivo if the intake of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis DN- 1173010 probiotic for a period of 2 weeks affects the salivary levels or biofilms of mutans streptococci and the lactobacilli of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Methods: A crossover, double-blind, randomized and placebo controlled clinical trial will be performed with 26 volunteers during 4 periods. During periods 2 and 4 (2 weeks each) the volunteers will have a daily ingestion of yogurt containing probiotic or of control yogurt which did not contain probiotic. Periods 1 and 3 were run-in and wash-out periods of 1 and 4 weeks, respectively. Experimental samples of saliva and biofilm will be collected from each participant at the end of each phase. Mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, total aciduric microorganisms, Candida spp. and total cultivable microorganisms will be counted. The values before and after the treatment will be compared with Wilcoxon's test (p&lt;0.05).</brief_summary>
