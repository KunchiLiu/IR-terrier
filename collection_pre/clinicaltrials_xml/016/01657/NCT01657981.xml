	<brief_title>A Study to Find Out How YM150 is Absorbed Into and Eliminated From the Body in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy male subjects are admitted on Day 0. Subjects receive a single oral dose of 14C-labeled YM150 in the morning of Day 1 and remain in the unit for 7 days (6 nights). Blood, plasma, urine and feces samples are collected until 120 hrs after dosing for analysis of 14C-labeled radioactivity, YM150, YM-222714 and other metabolites. Expired air is collected as well for assessment of 14C-radioactivity.</detailed_description>
