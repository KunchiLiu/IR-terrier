	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of PRO-155 Versus Nevanac in Post Phacoemulsification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postsurgical inflammation is an inevitable condition after cataract surgery. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is a safe option for treating ocular inflammation. This is a phase II randomized double-blind clinical trial. The aim is to compare and to evaluate efficacy and safety of two ophthalmic solutions in patients post phacoemulsification. Patients will be randomized to receive either PRO-155 or Nevanac for 60 days.</detailed_description>
