	<brief_summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common and distressing complication in patients undergoing general anesthesia. However, although 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists have significantly reduced PONV, it is reported that over 35% of patients treated with ondansetron experience PONV. Though the cause of failure in ondansetron treatment is not clear, the investigators assumed that polymorphism in the 5-HT3 receptor gene would contribute to such inter-individual variation. In this study, the investigators examine whether the polymorphisms of 5-HT3 receptor gene affect the efficacy of ondansetron to prevent PONV in patients undergoing general anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery.</brief_summary>
