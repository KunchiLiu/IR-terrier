	<brief_summary>Allergic rhinitis is a common condition caused by inflammation of nasal mucosa. The study was performed to gain information on this inflammation, including effect of intranasal corticosteroid treatment hereupon and potential influence on the lower airways, ie asthma. The study was randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind in patients, monoallergic to grasspollen, presenting symptoms of rhinitis and asthma during season. Treatment,ie intranasal corticosteroid or placebo, were given four weeks. After two weeks of treatment intranasal allergen challenge was performed. Measurements were performed during the full study period. The study was performed out of pollen season.</brief_summary>
