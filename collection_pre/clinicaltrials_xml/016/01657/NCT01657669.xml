	<brief_summary>This is an open label study to evaluate 2.0 mg intravitreal aflibercept injection administered in subject who have active choroidal neovascularization due to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Clinical Effects of Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection 2.0mg as a Predictor of Long-term Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty (20) consented participant who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled to be followed for 48 weeks. All subjects will receive 2.0 mg intravitreal aflibercept injections with three initial monthly doses, and mandatory doses at Weeks 16, 24, 32, and 40. Dosing at monthly intervals is allowed if needed in the opinion of the investigator based on presence of fluid on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and/or a decrease in visual acuity of greater than or equal to 5 letters from the best previous visit. Only one eye will be enrolled in the study.</detailed_description>
