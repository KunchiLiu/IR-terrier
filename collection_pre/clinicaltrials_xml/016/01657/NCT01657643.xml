	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to find out if probiotics (healthy bacteria found in yogurt) can improve the health-related quality of life (HRQL) during upper respiratory infections (like the common cold) in college students living in residence hall on-campus at Framingham State University (Framingham, MA) who are randomized to receive a probiotic or placebo candy daily for 12 weeks. HRQL is a subjective measure, defined as the aspects of quality of life (i.e., one's satisfaction with their life) that related specifically to a person's health (for example, ability to carry out normal daily activities). The investigators hypothesize that HRQL during URIs will be significantly higher in the probiotic groups compared to the placebo group. The proposed study will also seek to address the following secondary objectives: missed school and work days due to a upper respiratory infection.</brief_summary>
