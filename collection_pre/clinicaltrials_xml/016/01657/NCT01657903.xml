	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the ability of two European Union (EU) regulated gel to foam toothpaste formulations versus a non-fluoride toothpaste using a modified in-situ model of dental erosion and remineralization. A positive control i.e fluoride containing toothpaste marketed in EU will also be compared to non-fluoride toothpaste.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess the remineralization effects of two EU gel to foam toothpaste formulations with 1450 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride as sodium fluoride (NaF) and 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) versus a non-fluoride (0 ppm F)/KNO3 toothpaste as a negative control. The two experimental gel to foam toothpaste formulations differ in their relative dentine abrasivity (RDA) values which is an in-vitro measure of a toothpaste abrasivity to the dentinal tissues. A marketed toothpaste containing NaF and KNO3 will serve as a positive control.</detailed_description>

Oral Requirements: An intact maxillary dental arch suitable for the retention of the palatal appliance and an intact mandibular dental arch. Subjects may have fixed bridges replacing missing teeth. A gum base stimulated whole saliva flow rate ≥ 0.8 g/min and an unstimulated whole saliva flow rate ≥ 0.2 g/min. Contraception: Women of childbearing potential who are, in the opinion of the investigator, practicing a reliable method of contraception. Oral Health: Current active caries or periodontal disease that may compromise the study or the health of the subjects. Lesions of the oral cavity that could interfere with the study evaluations, including severe gingivitis, grossly carious lesions, periodontitis and other severe periodontal disease. Allergy/Intolerance: Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. Clinical Study/Experimental Medication: Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit Previous participation in this study Substance abuse: Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse.
