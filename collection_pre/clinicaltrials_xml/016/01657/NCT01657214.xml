	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: In the dose escalation: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR125844. In the expansion cohort: to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumoral effect of SAR125844 in patients with measurable and MET gene amplification (including gastric cancer patients). Secondary Objectives: To characterize and confirm the global safety profile of SAR125844 including cumulative toxicities. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of SAR125844. To explore the pharmacodynamic effects (PDy) of SAR125844. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR125844. To explore the relationship of MET gene amplification status with antitumor effects. To evaluate other pharmacodynamic biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I, Dose Escalation of SAR125844 in Asian Solid Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For both cohorts, escalation and expansion, the duration of the study for one patient will include a period for inclusion of up to 3 weeks and a 4-week treatment cycle(s).The patient may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop, followed by a minimum of 30-days follow-up. If a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohort, continues to benefit from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study treatment for a maximum of 1 year and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the study flowchart. Such patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP administration.</detailed_description>
