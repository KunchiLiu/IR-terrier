	<brief_summary>Prospective, follow-up registry of heart failure patients with or without sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). To test the hypothesis that treatment of nocturnal central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration by adaptive servoventilation (ASV) improves symptoms, cardiac performance and event-free survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Adaptive Servoventilation in Patients With Systolic Heart Failure and Sleep-Disordered Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is intended to investigate therapeutic effects of adaptive servoventilation in patients with sleep-disordered breathing and chronic heart failure. These effects include short-/long-term effects on - symptoms and quality of life - physical and cardiac performance (6min walking test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing) - echocardiographic parameters - arrhythmias - NT-proBNP - Respiratory stability (blood gases, rebreathing test, VE/VCO2-slope in cardiopulmonary exercise testing) - Compliance with ASV therapy - Event free survival (death, heart transplantation, assist device implantation) All of these data are also obtained in patients who basically meet the inclusion criteria but in whom sleep-disordered breathing was excluded by means of cardiorespiratory polygraphy or polysomnography and in patients with sleep-disordered breathing who do not undergo adaptive servoventilation for various reasons.</detailed_description>
