	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to: develop an emergency care visit registry for pediatric patients for Quality Improvement purposes and to support future research; to use the emergency care visit registry to collect stakeholder-prioritized emergency care performance improvement measures for important pediatric medical and trauma conditions at the level of the ED and individual clinical; and report emergency care performance improvement measures to individual ED clinicians and sites, and measure subsequent changes in quality performance. The hypothesis is that by providing this type of information to individual clinicians will result in improved performance and decreased variability (variation) of care for an individual clinician, between different clinicians, and eventually between hospital sites.</brief_summary>
