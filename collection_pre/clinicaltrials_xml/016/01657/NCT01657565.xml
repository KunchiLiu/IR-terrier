	<brief_summary>Introduction: An increasing proportion of childhood appendicitis is treated with laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). The investigators wanted to elucidate the outcome of childhood appendicitis treated primarily by residents in a university hospital. Material and methods: All children (age&lt;16 years) treated surgically with appendectomy in our department between January 2006 and January 2011 were retrospectively identified. Readmission, reoperation or postoperative length of stay (LOS) exceeding five days were considered as non-satisfactory outcomes.</brief_summary>
