	<brief_title>Warmed, Humidified Carbon Dioxide Insufflation vs Standard Carbon Dioxide in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing warmed, humidified carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy will have less postoperative pain than patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with standard CO2 insufflation. The study design is a double-blind, prospective, randomized study comparing patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with standard CO2 insufflation vs those receiving warmed, humidified CO2. Main variables included postoperative pain (rated with a visual analog scales) and analgesic requirements.</detailed_description>
