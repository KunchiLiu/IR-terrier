	<brief_summary>Professional societies recommend that endoscopists measure their ceacal intubation rate, adenoma detection rate as indicators of the screening colonoscopy quality. However, it is uncertain how to improve adenoma detection rate and reduce inter-endoscopists' variability in the detection of adenomas. The investigators hypothesize that a hands-on-training intervention tailored to the results of environmental assessment and audit on colonoscopy quality indicators results in higher adenoma detection rate improvement than simple audit and feedback. The investigators further hypothesize that by training the leaders of the screening centres, the effect of the intervention will be further disseminated among other endoscopists from the participating centers, and will thus result in additional increase in individual adenoma detection rate. The primary aim is to compare the impact on adenoma detection rate of two screening colonoscopy improvement programs: 1. Tailored training intervention. 2. Audit feedback on colonoscopy quality indicators.</brief_summary>
