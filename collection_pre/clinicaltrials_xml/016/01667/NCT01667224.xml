	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Actiponin on Antiobesity in Obese Korean Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of Actiponin in Korean subjects on body weight and fat loss along with changes in metabolic markers based on 12 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eighty obesity subjects with BMI &gt; 25kg/m2 and waist-hip ratio (WHR) ≥ 0.90 for men and ≥ 0.85 for women were randomly divided into either Actiponin (n=40, 450mg/day) or placebo group (n=40, 450mg/day) for 12weeks.</detailed_description>
