	<brief_summary>The true prevalence of drug allergy in patients with a history of penicillin/aminopenicillin allergy will be determined by using commercially available standard skin test reagents and the diagnostic agents available in Thailand. We hypothesize that only minority of patients with such a history are truly allergic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Diagnosis of Penicillin/Aminopenicillin Allergy in Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a history of penicillin/aminopenicillin allergy will be evaluated by the standard skin test reagents (major and minor determinants of penicillin, amoxicillin, and clavulanic if applicable). Diagnostic values of the measurement of specific IgE to penicillin/aminopenicillin and skin test reagents currently available in Thailand will be comparatively analyzed with the standard skin test reagents. The measurement of drug-induced interferon-gamma releasing cells will be measured in patients with a history of non-immediate reaction.</detailed_description>
