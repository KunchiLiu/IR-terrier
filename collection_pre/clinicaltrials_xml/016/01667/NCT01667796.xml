	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine if patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and healthy individuals attain a similar increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. The investigators will also assess whether the immunologic or relevant gene expression response to oral vitamin D supplementation differs in patients with MS and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
