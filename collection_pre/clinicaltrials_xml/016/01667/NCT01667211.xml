	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Plus Nedaplatin in Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Albumin-bound paclitaxel is a novel, solvent-free, albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel designed to avoid problems associated with solvents used in Taxol. And albumin-bound paclitaxel was characterized with high tolerated doses with greater efficacy, and with greater concentration in tumor tissue compared with normal tissues. This is a single center, non-randomized, open-label Phase II clinical study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of albumin-bound paclitaxel plus nedaplatin in patients with advanced, recurrent metastatic cervical cancer. About 30 patients will receive 175-200 mg/m2 albumin-bound paclitaxel, d 1 combined with 80- 100 mg/m2 nedaplatin, d 2, every 3 weeks. At least 2 cycles will be completed for each patient, for whom responded to the treatment, 4-6 cycles will be completed.</detailed_description>
