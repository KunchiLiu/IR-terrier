	<brief_summary>Ketamine infusions resulted in an acute reduction in global depression scores and in severity of suicidal ideation. The investigators therefore plan to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of repeated intravenous administration of ketamine in severely depressed, treatment resistant patients. The results of the study could lead to development of new strategies for treating depression.</brief_summary>
