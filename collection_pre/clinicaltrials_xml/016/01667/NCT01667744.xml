	<brief_summary>Symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, etc.) and treatment usage (doctor or emergency room visits, testing, hospital days, etc.) in patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes are known to be related to emotional distress (Anxiety, Depression and Anger). In addition, behavioral treatment of emotional distress is known to decrease symptoms, and treatment usage. The present protocol tests whether the addition of a medication known to reduce emotional distress can also reduce symptoms and treatment usage. This will done by recruiting patients with ACS during their hospital stay, randomizing them to receive citalopram or placebo, and then examining their symptoms and treatment usage at 6 months.</brief_summary>
