	<brief_summary>Study to test technical accuracy and userfriendliness of two Point-of-care C Reactive Protein devices (POC CRP devices) in comparison with laboratory CRP testing on children and adults. Research questions: 1. Are the POC CRP devices technically accurate? Do the measured values agree with CRP values measured at the clinical laboratory? 2. Are the 2 POC CRP devices equivalent ? 2.1. Are the 2 POC CRP devices equally reliable? 2.1.1. Comparison of 2 measurements in the same patient on 1 device (inter-observer-variability) 2.1.2. Comparison of 2 measurements in the same patient on 2 identical devices (inter-device-variability) 2.2. Are the 2 Point-of-Care CRP devices equally userfriendly in a general practice surgery?
