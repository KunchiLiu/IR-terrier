	<brief_summary>Since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy life expectancy of HIV-infected persons is rising. Different cohorts are observing an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases in this aging HIV-infected population. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors like smoking are more frequent in HIV-infected persons. For example chronic inflammation due to HIV-infection and metabolic disorders also caused by some antiretroviral substances as special non-traditional risk factors in HIV-infected persons can influence the development of cardiovascular diseases additionally. Therefore new research focus in special risk profile associated with HIV-infection or antiretroviral treatment and prevention for HIV-infected patients is developing. This present study is an ongoing prospective regional multicenter trial that was conducted to analyse the incidence, prevalence and clinical course of cardiovacular disorders in HIV-infected out-patients. Cardiac disorders witch are associated with HIV are pericarditis, pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocarditis, bacterial endocarditis and heart valve disorders. In addition to previously stated disorders of the heart, the premature atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, a further even more important disease of the heart in this patient population, went into the focus of most HIV-researchers and physicians.</brief_summary>
