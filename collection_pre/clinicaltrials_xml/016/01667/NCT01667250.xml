Agrees not to use any migraine prevention treatments (including Botox injections) and/or medications (exclusive of medications taken for acute relief of migraine symptoms). Is able to provide written Informed Consent Agrees to refrain from changing the type or dosage of any prophylactic medications for indications other than chronic migraine that in the opinion of the clinician may interfere with the study Has a history of aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumors or significant head trauma. Has a lesion (including lymphadenopathy), dysaesthesia, previous surgery or abnormal anatomy at the GammaCore treatment site. Has known or suspected severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, severe carotid artery disease (e.g. bruits or history of TIA or CVA), congestive heart failure (CHF), known severe coronary artery disease or recent myocardial infarction. Has an abnormal baseline ECG (e.g. second and third degree heart block, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, recent history of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or clinically significant premature ventricular contraction) Has had a previous bilateral, right, or left cervical vagotomy. Has uncontrolled high blood pressure. Is currently implanted with an electrical and/or neurostimulator device, including but not limited to cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, vagal neurostimulator, deep brain stimulator, spinal stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant. Has a history of carotid endarterectomy or vascular neck surgery on the right side. Has been implanted with metal cervical spine hardware or has a metallic implant near the GammaCore stimulation site. Has a recent or repeated history of syncope. Has a recent or repeated history of seizure. Has a known history or suspicion of substance abuse or addiction. Has had a surgery for migraine prevention. Has received Botox injections for migraine prevention within the past 6 months. Has taken medications for migraine prophylaxis in the previous 30 days. In the opinion of the investigator/research staff the subject is incapable of operating the GammaCore device as intended and performing the data collection procedures. Is pregnant, nursing, thinking of becoming pregnant in the next 9 months, or of childbearing years and is unwilling to use an accepted form of birth control. Is participating in any other therapeutic clinical investigation or has participated in a clinical trial in the preceding 30 days. Belongs to a vulnerable population or has any condition such that his or her ability to provide informed consent, comply with followup requirements, or provide selfassessments is compromised (e.g., homeless, developmentally disabled, prisoner).
