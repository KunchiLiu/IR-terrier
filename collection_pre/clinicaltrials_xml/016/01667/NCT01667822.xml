	<brief_summary>Background: Studies show that about 1 out of 3 patients in Primary Care suffer primarily from mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders and depression. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment of these disorders. Despite the strong evidence for CBT there is a lack of evidence-based psychological treatment in primary care. For various reasons, the progress of research has not affected clinical practice. For successful implementation of CBT in primary care cost-effective therapies, access to therapists with proper training and supervision, evidence-based manuals and management that support the implementation is needed. Aim: The aim of this trial is to evaluate a stepped care model with CBT in primary care. All patients are first treated with self-help CBT (N = 400). Patients that do not improve after treatment (9 weeks) are randomized to individual CBT or continued self-help treatment. Based on published studies 2/3 is expected to be improved after self-help and therefore do not undergo randomization. 1/3 (n = 133) who didnÂ´t respond to treatment is randomized to individual CBT (N = 67) or continued self-help treatment (N = 67).</brief_summary>
