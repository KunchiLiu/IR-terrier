	<brief_summary>This is a three-year (except for participants with chronic kidney disease [CKD] or cirrhosis) multicenter study to follow participants who received at least one dose of grazoprevir (MK-5172) in a previous study to determine whether they remain hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA negative over time, and to determine if they have developed antiviral resistance. The study will also evaluate long-term adverse events in this population. Participants from MK-5172-052 (NCT02092350) with CKD or cirrhosis will be followed for five years. As of Amendment 03, the study design is revised such that continued enrollment will only be for participants who failed prior therapy with a grazoprevir regimen. Participants with CKD enrolled from MK-5172-052 (NCT02092350) will continue enrollment regardless of prior treatment-response and remain in this study for five years, while participants enrolled from all other studies with HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be discontinued and end their participation after the next scheduled visit. In addition, participants who receive other HCV treatments concurrent with this follow-up study or received other HCV treatments prior to this study will be discontinued and their data excluded from analysis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Previously participated in a HCV treatment protocol that included grazoprevir in the treatment regimen. Must enroll in the present study within three months of the last study visit of their previous protocol in which they received a grazoprevircontaining regimen. For Amendment 03: Participants must have received a grazoprevircontaining regimen in a prior trial and have been identified as having failed therapy in that study. Has received HCV therapy after completion of the protocoldefined grazoprevir treatment trial regimen and before or after entry into this followup study For Amendment 03: Has failed therapy due to reinfection. For Amendment 03: Has failed therapy and received retreatment with HCV therapy, except in the case where they were retreated in a Mercksponsored protocol.</criteria>
