	<brief_summary>This observational study will evaluate the presence and evolution of fatigue on treatment with RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to at least two DMARDs (one of them methotrexate) or to anti-TNF treatment. Patients initiated on treatment with RoActemra/Actemra (8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks) with or without methotrexate will be followed for 4 months.</brief_summary>
