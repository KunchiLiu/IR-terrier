	<brief_summary>This single-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with crossover component will evaluate the GABAAalpha5 receptor expression, occupancy and functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with Down syndrome and healthy controls following single dose RG1662. Participants will receive a single dose of placebo before the imaging session (PET and MRI), and a single dose of RG1662 before the second imaging session.</brief_summary>
