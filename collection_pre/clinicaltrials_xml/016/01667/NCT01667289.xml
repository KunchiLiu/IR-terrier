	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Alone Versus Concurrent Chemoradiation in Low Risk NK/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy alone is commonly used in NK/T-cell lymphoma without adverse risk including lymph node involvement, local invasion, B symptoms and high LDH level. Recently, methotrexate was prove to be a radiosensitizer in NK/T-cell lymphoma cells. Therefore, the investigators aim to verify the superiority and safety of weekly methotrexate in combination with radiotherapy in a randomized phase II study.</detailed_description>
