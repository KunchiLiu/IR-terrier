	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Followed by Adjuvant Chemotherapy in NK/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patients with stage I/II NK/T-cell lymphoma, the sequence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is controversial. Some studies demonstrated the advantage of upfront radiotherapy. Therefore, we designed this single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with DICE regimen plus peg-asparaginase which was proved to be effective in NK/T-cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
