	<brief_summary>Weight loss is effective in reducing many complications of obesity, with the majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery having substantial improvements in their weight-related illnesses. The investigators propose a pilot study in 45 subjects with mild to moderate obesity to compare how losing 10% of initial body weight via one of three common weight loss strategies (medical weight loss with a low calorie diet, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, and adjustable gastric banding) affects diabetes. While the investigators do not expect this pilot study to provide definitive answers, it will provide valuable information to design a larger trial which will help guide therapy for people with mild-moderate obesity and substantial comorbidities.</brief_summary>
