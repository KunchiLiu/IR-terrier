	<brief_summary>This was a multicenter, multi-reader, open-label, Phase 2 study assessing the safety and performance characteristics of MIP 1404 imaging in the detection of prostate gland and pelvic lymph node cancer. Comparative performance characteristics between MIP 1404 imaging and MRI were also assessed, as judged by histopathology results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study With MIP-1404 in Men With High-Risk PC Scheduled for RP and EPLND Compared to Histopathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, open label study of approximately 100 high-risk prostate cancer patients scheduled for prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients receive a single IV dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (study drug) followed by SPECT/CT scan 3-6 hours after injection. As standard of care, patients will undergo prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) within three weeks of study drug dosing. 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data will be evaluated for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male aged 21 years or older. Ability to provide signed informed consent and willingness to comply with protocol requirements. Biopsy confirmed presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. At highrisk for metastatic disease by a stage of cT3, cT4, or a total nomogram score of greater than or equal to 130. Scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Agree to use an acceptable form of birth control for a period of 7 days after the 99mTc MIP1404 injection. Participating would significantly delay the scheduled standard of care therapy. Administered a radioisotope within 5 physical half lives prior to study drug injection. Have any medical condition or other circumstances that, in the opinion of the investigator, would significantly decrease obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives or completing the study. Have a contraindication for MR imaging.</criteria>
