	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, control pilot study is to measure the effects of a gentle, 12 week hatha yoga program on post-menopausal, obese, sedentary South Asian women at risk for cardiovascular disease. Hatha yoga is a form of structured physical exercises known as asanas, combined with breathing exercises called pranayama, and relaxation techniques. The yoga intervention consists of 9 different yoga poses (asanas) and 3 different breathing exercises (pranayama) that can be easily replicated and readily performed by individuals who are middle-aged and older, overweight, unfit, or who suffer from a chronic illness.</brief_summary>
