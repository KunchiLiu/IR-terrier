	<brief_summary>Several techniques have been advocated to get good contacts in dental composite restorations including interdental separation ring. The investigators study focuses on using separation ring with circumferential matrix band instead of a sectional band. Moreover, the investigators have attempted to study proximal tightness and proximal contours of composite restoration as separate variables</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Proximal Composite Restorations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 188 premolar teeth with proximal cavity to be assigned on alternate basis in two groups. Intervention group teeth received Automatrix band after cavity preparation followed by the separation ring using clamp while the control group received Automatrix band alone. All teeth to be restored with P-60 composite restorative material(3M-ESPE Dental, USA). Outcome (proximal tightness) is determined by a blinded assessor just after the restoration.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>patients who had supra gingival Class II cavities in permanent premolars. Teeth with cavity isthmus less than onethird of intercuspal distance were inducted Partially erupted teeth, teeth with noncarious tooth surface wear or with orthodontic bands or brackets or whose adjacent tooth continuous with the cavity side is missing were excluded.</criteria>
