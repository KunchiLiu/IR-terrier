	<brief_summary>Select 600 cases of women with breast cancer of triple negative or Her-2 positive or with more than 4 axillary lymph node metastasis. All the patients were accepted the chemotherapy of Anthracycline and/or Taxane. Divide them into two groups randomly. Then the experimental group will be treated with Xeloda(1000mg/m2,orally,2 times/day) for six cycles (21 days/cycle,each taking two weeks suspending for one week) as Sequential Adjuvant Therapy. And the control group will not receive any adjuvant therapy.Finally the investigators will assess the 5-year disease-free survival, 5 years and 10-year overall survival and safety of using medications.</brief_summary>
