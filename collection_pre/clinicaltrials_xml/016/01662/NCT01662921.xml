	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that insulin glulisine is non-inferior to currently proven rapid-acting insulin lispro when used in a basal/bolus regimen to treat hyperglycemia in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparator Trial Using Insulin Glulisine vs. Insulin Lispro for Treatment of Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, only two rapid-acting insulin analogs have been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of diabetes during pregnancy: insulin aspart and insulin lispro. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin glulisine are unique and insulin glulisine may be the best rapid-acting analog for the treatment of post-prandial hyperglycemia. We believe that insulin glulisine should be evaluated in women with gestational diabetes for its potential efficacy.</detailed_description>
