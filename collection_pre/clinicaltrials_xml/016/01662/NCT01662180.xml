	<brief_title>Predicting Ovarian Response in Artificial Insemination With Low Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center, open-label, prospective cohorts study. Patients with a regular indication for COH/IUI (controlled ovarian stimulation/ intra uterine insemination) will be asked to participate. Patient's characteristics will be documented including age, weight, BMI, smoking status, cycle day 2 3 or 4 FSH /Estradiol levels, antral follicle count, and AMH. AMH and FSH/Estradiol will be determined centrally after completion of inclusion of all patients in the study. All patients will receive a fixed 75 IU recFSH per day conform normal stimulation protocol starting from cycle day 3, 4 or 5 after exclusion of ovarian cysts by ultrasound. Ovarian response will be documented by ultrasound only. Once the dominant follicle(s) reach a mean diameter of 16-18 mm, hCG (5000IU or 250 mcg) will be applied and insemination will be scheduled 36-42 hours later. Cancellation criteria will be defined according to the national guidelines provided by the NVOG (7).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility (13) and a spontaneous chance of conception below 40% (Hunault score). Unexplained subfertility including minimal to mild endometriosis (AFS grade 1 or 2) is defined as the failure to conceive after at least one year of unprotected intercourse whereas the standard fertility workup was unable to detect any factors that might influence fertility negatively. semen analysis should be normal according to the WHO guidelines (8), ovulation should be documented (by BBT charts, ovulation detection by ultrasound or normal luteal progesterone values), tubal patency should be confirmed (HSG, laparoscopy or fertiloscopy) and when a postcoital test was performed a cervical factor should have been excluded. Mild male subfertility is defined as abnormal semen parameters according to the WHO (8) but an average total motile sperm account before processing of at least 10 million. Hunault score â‰¥ 40% Endometriosis AFS grade 3 or 4 Contraindications for the use of gonadotrophins (cysts larger than 2 cm, allergy for gonadotrophins) Total motile sperm count after sperm processing below 1 million Women aged younger than eighteen years or older than 45 years. Previous treatment with COH/IUI for treating current subfertility Unable to speak or read the Dutch language</criteria>
