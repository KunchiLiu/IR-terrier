	<brief_title>Nicotine Gum Recovery After Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main hypothesis of this study is that use of nicotine gum after colorectal surgery will accelerate recovery of bowel function. Eligible patients include all patients undergoing segmental small bowel or large bowel resection with a planned primary anastomosis, planned removal of the nasogastric tube at the end of the surgery, and administration of clear liquids on post-operative day one. Patients who have an ileostomy or colostomy created will be excluded. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to one of three groups: nicotine gum, regular gum, or no gum. Patients randomized to nicotine gum or regular gum will chew the gum three times a day for 1 week. The main outcome measure is time to first bowel movement or flatus.</detailed_description>
