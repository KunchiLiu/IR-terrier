	<brief_summary>This is a prospective interventional study to assess laboratory testing which will identify the microbial cause of pneumonia. This, in turn, will allow targeted antimicrobial agent selection for patients with community acquired-pneumonia (CAP). Hypothesis: 1) To determine if Targeted strategy is non-inferior to Empiric therapy with respect to outcome endpoints. 2) To assess the use of innovative POC tests allows targeted narrow-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. 3) To determine if Targeted strategy is superior to Empiric therapy in patients with viral pneumonia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microbiology Testing With the Aim Of Directed Antimicrobial Therapy For CAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted at five academic medical university sites with 7 hospitals. Empiric therapy is defined as selection of antibiotic therapy based on the 2007 ATS-IDSA guidelines in which broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended, and microbial cause is uncertain</detailed_description>

	<criteria>‚óè Adult patients greater than age 17 years who are initially evaluated in the ED with symptoms of CAP. This includes those who will be treated as outpatients and those admitted to the hospital (both ward and ICU). The definition of CAP is as follows: Presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. (Initial reading may be performed by the ED physician but has to be confirmed by board certified radiologist for inclusion in the study). At least 2 of the following: new onset of cough, productive sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever &gt; 380C, abnormal chest auscultation, WBC &gt; 12,000 cells/mL. Able to provide informed consent Read, signed, and dated informed consent document Available for followup for the planned duration of the study Patients with underlying immunosuppressive illness (HIV, neutropenia, asplenia, transplant recipient, cystic fibrosis, receipt of immunosuppressive medications including corticosteroids, (equivalent of prednisone &gt; 10 mg) cancer chemotherapy, or antitumor necrosis factor agents. Patients residing in longterm care facilities</criteria>
