	<brief_title>An Efficacy Study of Paliperidone for the Prevention of Relapse in Participants With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by a chance), placebo-controlled, and parallel-group study of paliperidone ER tablets. The study will consist of 6 phases: 14 days of screening phase, 8 weeks of open-label run-in phase (participants will be flexibly dosed with paliperidone ER once daily in a dose range of 3 mg to 12 mg), 6 weeks of stabilization phase (participants will continue to receive the fixed dose of paliperidone ER), double-blind (DB) phase of various length (participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either paliperidone ER or placebo and this phase will be completed after 86 relapse events are observed or if the study is positive at the interim analysis), 6 months of open-label extension (participants who experience a relapse event or who remain relapse free for the entire duration of the double-blind phase and participants who are enrolled at the time the study is terminated, will be eligible for this phase. All participants will be treated with paliperidone ER and safety and tolerability information will be collected during this phase) phase and 6 months of follow-up phase (participants who withdraw during the DB phase for any reason other than relapse will be followed for 6 months or until they experience a relapse). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
