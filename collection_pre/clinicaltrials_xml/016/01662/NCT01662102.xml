	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of consolidation treatment Zevalin® versus maintenance treatment with Rituxan® on progression-free survival (PFS) following response induction with chemotherapy plus rituximab in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab or Zevalin - Efficacy Trial of Therapeutic Alternatives (RoZetta)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multicenter and randomized study. Patients will be registered after response induction (PR/CR) to R-chemotherapy. Patients achieving either a PR or CR following R-chemotherapy will be eligible for randomization to either consolidation with 90Y-ibritumumab tiuxetan followed by observation for 24 months, or rituximab maintenance for 24 months. After the observation/maintenance period, patients will be followed for 5 years. This study is designed to be similar to the ZAR2007 study (EUDRACT No. 2007-006601-25) carried out by PETHEMA in Spain. It is expected that Spanish centers will contribute up to 230 patients; centers in the US and elsewhere will contribute the remaining 254 patients. The same randomization procedure will be used in both studies. The total sample size for the combined studies will be 484 randomized patients. Assuming that PFS will follow an exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate, with a 36 months uniform accrual period and an additional follow-up time of 60 months after the last patient is randomized, 242 patients per arm (484 total) will be necessary to observe 131 PFS events in the combined study.</detailed_description>
