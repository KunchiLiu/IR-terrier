	<brief_title>A Retrospective Chart Review of Three Medifast Weight Control Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Portion-controlled meal replacements by themselves have been shown to be an effective weight control strategy in overweight and obese individuals. The addition of medical supervision has been shown to result in greater weight loss than meal replacements alone. MWCC provides this added support through individual weekly counseling sessions. Thus, the investigators plan to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of the MWCC Jump Start (Medifast's 5 &amp; 1) Plan on the following indices: weight loss, anthropometric changes, and reduction in common markers of coronary heart disease.</detailed_description>
