	<brief_summary>Sevoflurane can abolish movement or adrenergic response to noxious stimulus. In order to investigate the effect of sevoflurane on cerebral electrical activity, we determined the MAC of sevoflurane inducing isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG) in 50% of the subjects (MACie) in middle aged subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimal Alveolar Concentration of Sevoflurane Inducing Isoelectric Electroencephalogram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients received sevoflurane for anesthesia induction and maintenance at preselected concentrations according to an 'up and down' design, with 0.2% as a stepsize. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane, tracheal intubation was facilitated with cisatracurium. After a steady-state period of 30min without surgical stimulation, the state of isoelectric EEG was considered as significant when a burst suppression ratio of 100% last for more than 1 min. The haemodynamic responses to skin incision and the vasopressor requirement to maintain cardiovascular system were also analysed according to the EEG state.</detailed_description>
