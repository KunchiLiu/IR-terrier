	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether healthy older adults, aged 65 to 80 years, consuming a probiotic each day for three weeks will have improved immune strength and digestive health. It is hypothesized that older adults consuming the probiotics will see a shift in their microbiota towards the "healthy" bacteria resulting in a greater proportion of immune cells, decreased inflammation, and better digestive health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover design with two 3-week interventions and a 5-week washout period in between. Thirty-six participants will be enrolled. With informed consent, the daily questionnaire will be administered and a baseline stool sample will be obtained during the week before the start of each intervention period. Blood and saliva will be collected on the first and last day of each intervention period to assess immune function. A final stool sample will be obtained in the last week of the intervention period. Nutritional status, which can impact immune function, will be assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, Block Fiber Screen, and the Block 2005 Food Frequency Questionnaire. Daily questionnaires will record intake of the probiotic or placebo, level of stress, hours of sleep, visits to the physician, new medications, number of stools, etc. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Response Scale, which records gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation, over the past week will be completed at baseline and weekly during the interventions and the week following the interventions.</detailed_description>
