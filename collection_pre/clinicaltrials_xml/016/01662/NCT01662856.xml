	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the application of Fibrin Sealant Grifols provides a measurable benefit when compared to hemostasis achieved through conventional surgical technique (suture) and by standard hemostatic action, such as mechanical pressure through manual compression. This study has a Preliminary Part (I) in which all subjects are treated with Fibrin Sealant Grifols and a Primary Part (II) in which subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Fibrin Sealant Grifols or manual compression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Hemoglobin (Hgb) â‰¥ 8.0 g/dL at Baseline (within 24 hours prior to surgical procedure). Require elective (nonemergency), primary, open (nonlaparoscopic; nonendovascular) peripheral vascular surgery. Require one of the following peripheral vascular procedures involving proximal endtoside arterial anastomosis utilizing coated or uncoated Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts: a) Femoralfemoral bypass grafting, b) Femoralpopliteal bypass grafting, c) Femoraldistal bypass grafting, d) Ilioiliac bypass grafting, e) Iliofemoral bypass grafting, f) Iliopopliteal bypass grafting, g) Aortoiliac bypass grafting, h) Aortofemoral bypass grafting, i)Axillofemoral bypass grafting, and j) Upper extremity vascular access for hemodialysis. A target bleeding site can be identified. Target bleeding site has moderate arterial bleeding. Undergoing a reoperative procedure. Undergoing other vascular procedures during the same surgical session (stenting and/or endarterectomy of the same artery are allowed). Have an infection in the anatomic surgical area. Have a history of severe (e.g. anaphylactic) reactions to blood or to any bloodderived product. Have previous known sensitivity to any Fibrin Sealant Grifols, heparin, or protamine component. Females who are pregnant or nursing a child at Baseline (within 24 hours prior to surgical procedure). Have undergone a therapeutic surgical procedure within 30 days from the screening visit. Target bleeding site cannot be identified. Target bleeding site has mild or severe arterial bleeding. Occurrence of major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the planned surgical procedure. Intraoperative change in planned surgical procedure, which results in subject no longer meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criteria.</criteria>
