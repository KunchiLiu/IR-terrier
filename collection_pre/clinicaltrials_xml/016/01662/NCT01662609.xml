	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) can detect early stage pre-cancerous or cancerous changes in the pancreas in patients at high-risk for the development of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic refers to the use of an instrument called an endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video camera and light on the end. Ultrasound refers to an imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce pictures. EUS in this research study is a method of combining endoscopy and ultrasound imaging to obtain high quality images of the pancreas.</brief_summary>
