	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: The following inclusion criteria apply at Visit 0: 1. All subjects must sign an informed consent consistent with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICHGCP) guidelines prior to participation in the trial and conducting any study procedures 2. Male or female subjects 40 years of age or older. 3. Hospitalization for a primary diagnosis of acute COPD exacerbation for =14 days. Determination of accuracy of admission diagnosis will be at the discretion of the investigator. 4. Patient reported hospital length of stay and discharge date (confirmed with hospital discharge summary/hospital records; however, medical record confirmation may occur following randomization). The following inclusion criteria apply at Visit 1: 5. Discharged from the hospital =10 days from date of randomization. 6. All subjects must have a diagnosis of COPD (P1201205), and have documented airway obstruction with a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7(See Section 5.1.2, Pulmonary Function Testing). The diagnosis of COPD can be made at Visit 1 if no PFT data available within the past 12 months. 7. Subjects must be current or exsmoker with a smoking history of =10 packyears: Packyears = Number of cigarettes/day x years of smoking 20 cigarettes/ pack 8. Subjects must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the HandiHaler® device (Appendix 10.1) and from a metered dose inhaler (MDI). Exclusion criteria: The following exclusion criterion applies at Visit 0: 1. No more than 30 days of therapy with any longacting inhaled anticholinergic over preceding 3 months prior to discharge from the hospital, and no therapy with any long acting anticholinergic post discharge (no use between hospital discharge and randomization) or any other restricted concomitant medications The following exclusion criteria apply at Visit 1: 2. Presence of a significant disease (in the opinion of the investigator) which may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or may influence the subject's ability to participate in the study for up to 2 years. 3. A documented history of myocardial infarction during the hospitalization preceding randomization. Subjects being stable with a history of cardiac stents are permitted. 4. Any unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or change in drug therapy during the last year. 5. Subjects with asthma (subject treated for asthma in the last 2 years, history of childhood asthma is permitted), cystic fibrosis, clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary thromboembolic disease or known active tuberculosis. 7. Malignancy for which the subject has undergone resection, radiation, chemotherapy or biological treatments within the last two years or is currently on active radiation therapy, chemotherapy or biological treatment. Subjects with treated basal cell carcinoma and noninvasive squamous cell skin carcinoma are allowed. 8. Hospitalization for cardiac failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV) during the hospitalization preceding randomization. 9. Known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose, or any other components of the HandiHaler® or MDI inhalation solution delivery system. 10. Known moderate to severe renal impairment as judged by the investigator. 11. Known narrow angle glaucoma as judged by the investigator. 12. Significant symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladderneck obstruction. Subjects whose symptoms are controlled on treatment may be included. 13. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragm or sub dermal implants e.g., Norplant®) for at least three months prior to and for the duration of the trial. 14. Significant alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12 months. 15. Previously randomized in this study or currently participating in another interventional study. 16. Visual impairment that as judged by the investigator does not allow the subject to independently read and complete the questionnaires and eDiary. 17. Any significant or new ECG findings at Visit 1 as judged by the investigator, including, but not limited to signs of acute ischemia, arrhythmia. 18. Treatment with any restricted pulmonary medication. 19. Residing in an assisted living facility.</criteria>
