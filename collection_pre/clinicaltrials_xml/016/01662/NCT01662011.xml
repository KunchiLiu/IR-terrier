	<brief_summary>Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a new mode of mechanical ventilation that delivers ventilatory assist in proportion to neural effort. It was a controlled randomized single-center prospective study in order to explore the efficacy of this new mode of mechanical ventilation after corrective open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Application of Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist to Children After Congenital Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To evaluate the effect of the patient-ventilator interaction in children underwent open-heart surgery when ventilated with NAVA, compared with conventional mechanical ventilation. 2. To verify the benefits of NAVA in improving the gas exchange and hemodynamics after biventricle repair for CHD.</detailed_description>
