	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether deep brain stimulation of the basolateral nucleus (BLn) of the amygdala, on both sides of the brain, can safely reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans whose condition has not improved despite extensive treatment with currently available medication and psychotherapy interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Deep Brain Stimulation of the Amygdala for Treatment-Refractory Combat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this pilot feasibility study, combat veterans whose PTSD has been associated with severe symptomatic suffering and functional impairment, despite treatment with all currently available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, will be recruited from clinics at a large, academically affiliated VA facility. An extensive screening over an extended baseline by the study psychiatrist and neurosurgeon will be conducted using standard interviews and clinical rating scales. Eligible subjects are required to have a cohabiting significant other willing to participate in safety and function monitoring throughout the study. After successful completion of baseline eligibility requirements, comprehensive neuropsychological testing will be performed, as will structural MRI and FDG PET/CT of the amygdala, insula and medial Prefrontal cortex. PET/CT will be performed and analyzed by a nuclear medicine specialist collaborator familiar with this type of imaging research. Six consenting subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will then receive bilateral basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BlnA) implantation of Medtronic Activa Primary Cell (PC) implantable deep brain stimulator systems (purchased through the VA Merit Review Grant) by functional neurosurgeons specialized in the procedure. This will be done during a 3-4 day inpatient stay on the VA Greater Los Angeles Neurosurgical Service. After a month of weekly safety monitoring with stimulators off, subjects will be will be hospitalized for 1 day on the Neurology Service's electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry unit, under the care and supervision of an epilepsy specialist neurologist who is a co-investigator in the study, for stimulator initiation. Stimulator settings will be adjusted by the study clinical neurophysiologist while patients are monitored by the study neurologist and psychiatrist. Only stimulator settings that do not cause epileptiform discharges, or potentially significant adverse psychiatric or medical (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate) changes will be used over the subsequent long-term follow-up. After the EEG telemetry safety check, subjects will be randomized (3/3) to either have their stimulators turned on then (Week 0), or 3 months later (week 12). This staggered onset double-blind design has been used in other DBS trials in psychiatry. After week 0, for the next 2 years, subjects will be followed at regular intervals (weekly for 5 months, then monthly for 7 months, then quarterly for 12 months) by a psychiatrist, neurosurgeon, neurologist and neurophysiologist who will conduct an extensive battery of psychiatric and neurological testing (including periodic EEG recordings), as well as significant other interviews, while stimulator settings are adjusted based on standardized rating scale outcomes and adverse effects so as to optimize treatment outcome. The principal study hypothesis is that the symptomatic and functional benefits of chronic stimulation will outweigh the risks and adverse-effects, and that symptomatic improvement will be greater, without unacceptable adverse effects, in subjects with week 0, compared to week 12 stimulator initiation. Neuropsychological testing will be repeated after 6 months of stimulation to assess changes in cognitive function. Functional neuroimaging with PET/CT will be repeated after a year of stimulation to assess changes in the activity of brain regions known to function abnormally in PTSD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male aged 2565 years. Able to give informed consent in accordance with institutional policies and participate in the 2year followup, involving assessments and stimulator adjustments. Patients must be stable on their current psychotropic medication for a period of 2 months before implantation and agree to not increase dosages or add any new medications for the first 6 months of the study, unless medically necessary. Chart diagnosis of chronic and treatmentrefractory PTSD as the principal psychiatric diagnosis and cause of distress and social/occupational impairment. Confirmation of PTSD as the primary psychiatric diagnosis by the study psychiatrist via clinical interview and CAPS. Confirmation of combat trauma exposure via military record review and a Combat Exposure Scale score &gt; 9. Minimum 5 year total illness duration, with no 6 month period of clinical remission during the 5 years prior to entry in the study. Clinical record documentation of nonresponse to at least 2 of the following antidepressants, alone or in combination, at maximally tolerated FDA recommended doses for ≥ 6 months: sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline, desipramine, clomipramine, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine. Antidepressant trials must include at least one SSRI and one SNRI or TCA at maximally tolerated FDA recommended doses for a minimum of 3 months. A minimum 3 month trial of prazosin at 10 mg per day or, if less, maximally tolerated FDA recommended doses, unless considered contraindicated based on comorbid medical conditions or concomitant medications. Trial of at least 3 months of one of the following: lithium, divalproex sodium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, bupropion either alone or in conjunction with one or more of the agents in #8 and # 9 above. 6 months of continuous individual psychotherapy, conducted at least twice monthly for minimum 45 minute sessions, and consisting of a) cliniciandefined cognitivebehavioural psychotherapy directed toward reducing conditioned fear symptoms of PTSD; b) cognitive processing psychotherapy for PTSD; c) prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD (imaginal, in vivo, and/or virtual reality); or d) Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy for PTSD including a trauma exposure component, with chart documentation of inadequate benefit despite concerted effort. Other forms of individual or group psychotherapy are permitted but not required for inclusion. (Patients who are unable to complete 6 months of psychotherapy may be included if the cause of treatment cessation was that the risks of further treatment, including intense psychological suffering, outweighed the potential benefits of continuing the treatment). All evidence based psychotherapy for PTSD (cognitive behavioural, cognitive processing, prolonged exposure, eye movement desensitization) has been completed a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment. Minimum baseline CAPS17 of 85 at entry, with a) scores of at least 4 (combined frequency and severity) on at least one symptom from each cluster (intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal); b) score of 5 or more on CAPS17 items 4 or 5 (intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity on exposure to a reminder of the traumatic event); and c) no questionable validity (QV) rating greater than 1 on any CAPS item.
