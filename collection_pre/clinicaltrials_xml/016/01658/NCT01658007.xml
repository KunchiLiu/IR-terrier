	<brief_summary>The investigators want to learn about treating relapsed/refractory lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma with a drug called sirolimus. The investigators are using sirolimus along with other cancer drugs that are often given to patients with relapsed leukemia and lymphoma. The main purpose of this study is to determine if sirolimus can be given safely in combination with standard drugs used to treat relapsed lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Of Sirolimus Plus Multiagent Chemotherapy For Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You will receive the drug sirolimus in addition to standard chemotherapy drugs. Just like your original cancer treatment, relapsed leukemia/lymphoma treatment is divided into different parts. You will get sirolimus during the first two parts: 1. Re-induction: We give chemotherapy drugs to try to put your cancer back into remission, meaning that no cancer cells are found in the bone marrow samples (if you have leukemia) or on imaging studies (if you have lymphoma). From start to finish, this part of therapy lasts 35 days. On this study, you will take the drug sirolimus daily in addition to the normal re-induction chemotherapy drugs. You will swallow liquid sirolimus and you must take it with food. You will take sirolimus three times on the first day and two times each day after that during re-induction. Altogether, this is the schedule for re-induction: - Sirolimus by mouth starting 7 days before standard re-induction starts, and continuing every day through day 28 - Mitoxantrone by vein on days 1 and 2 - Vincristine by vein on days 3, 10, 17 and 24 - Dexamethasone by vein or by mouth on days 1-5 and 15-19 - PEG-asparaginase* on days 3 and 17 - IT Methotrexate given in spinal fluid on day 1 (all patients) day 8,29 (if no cancer found in spinal fluid) - IT Triples given in spinal fluid on days 8,15,22,29 (if cancer found in spinal fluid) (If you have an allergic reaction to PEG-asparaginase, you may be given 6 doses of Erwinia L-asparaginase instead) 2. Consolidation: We give drugs to continue to kill cancer cells in your body and prevent them from coming back. From start to finish, this part of therapy will last 63 days (it could be longer if we have to interrupt your treatment because you have low blood counts, and you need to wait for them to come up). On this study, you will take the drug sirolimus daily in addition to the normal consolidation chemotherapy drugs. You will take sirolimus three times on the first day and two times each day after that during consolidation. Altogether, this is the schedule for consolidation: - Sirolimus by mouth starting 7 days before consolidation starts, and continuing every day through day 56. - Cyclophosphamide by vein on days 1 and 29 - Cytarabine by vein or under skin on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, 36-39 - 6-mercaptopurine by mouth on days 1-14, 29-42 - PEG-asparaginase* by vein on days 15 and 43 - Vincristine by vein on days 15 and 43 - It Methotrexate in spinal fluid on Days 1 and 29 3. After you complete re-induction and consolidation, your doctor will determine the next steps of your treatment. This will depend on how you are doing and it will be up to you and your doctor. It will not be part of this study. This research only includes the re-induction and consolidation portions of treatment (1 and 2, above). If you have already done re-induction, you can enter the study for consolidation only. In addition to all the regular tests and procedures done to check on your cancer during this study, we will also take additional blood samples to monitor the levels of sirolimus in your blood (in order to adjust your dose) and we will also take blood samples to find certain markers in your blood that might indicate that the sirolimus is doing what it is supposed to do.</detailed_description>

Those enrolling postinduction for the consolidation block must have cleared the CNS of blasts at the time of enrollment on this study. (See Appendix I for method of evaluating traumatic lumbar punctures.) Performance status Karnofsky &gt;/= 50 for patients &gt; 10 years of age OR Lansky &gt;/= 50 for children &lt;/= 10 years of age (see Appendix II). Oral medication Patient must be able to consume oral medication in the form of solution or have nasogastric tube placed for administration of medication. Prior Therapy Patients who relapse while receiving standard ALL maintenance chemotherapy will not be required to have a waiting period before entry onto this study. Patients who relapse on therapy other than standard ALL maintenance therapy must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study, unless deemed stable and irreversible by the investigator. Recovery is defined as a toxicity grade &lt; 2 as defined by the Common Toxicity Criteria Version (CTCAE) 4.0, unless otherwise specified in the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria. Cytotoxic chemotherapy: At least 7 days must have elapsed from prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen before initiation of treatment with sirolimus on this trial, including administration of treatment dosing of corticosteroids (physiologic replacement for adrenal insufficiency is allowed) Hydroxyurea: patients with peripheral blasts may receive hydroxyurea until the first dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy for cytoreduction. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 14 days after the last dose of a longacting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for shortacting growth factor. Biologic (antineoplastic) agent: At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair. Immunotherapy: At least 6 weeks since the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines. Monoclonal antibodies: At least 3 halflives since prior therapy with a monoclonal antibody.

Organ Function Requirements Adequate Renal Function Defined as: Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt;/= 70ml/min/1.73 m2 or A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating GFR (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child length and stature data published by the CDC. Adequate Liver Function Defined as: Total bilirubin &gt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age SGPT (ALT)&lt;/= 5x ULN. Fasting serum cholesterol &lt;/=300 mg/dL AND fasting triglycerides &lt;/=300mg/dL.

If one of these agents must be given, sirolimus dosing will be decreased by 80% and trough levels monitored every other day for the first week and then weekly per protocol. Calcineurin inhibitors: Must be off of tacrolimus and/or cyclosporine for at least 2 weeks prior to entry on this study Additional medications that interact with CYP3A4: See Appendix III of the protocol for medications to be avoided while receiving sirolimus. Patients should be off these medications at least 2 weeks prior to entry on this study. If the medication is deemed essential and cannot be discontinued, sirolimus dosing will be adjusted following discussion with the study pharmacologist, Dr. Vinks, depending on the degree of expected interaction. Levels should be monitored every other day during the first week, then weekly per protocol.</criteria>
