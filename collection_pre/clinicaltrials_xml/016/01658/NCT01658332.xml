	<brief_summary>TITLE : Circulating tumor cells identification in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (CIRCUBRONCH) BACKGROUND : Circulating tumor cells identification is a new field of research in oncology, and some studies have been conducted with success on breast and prostate cancer. Nearly 80% of lung cancers are diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV). Circulating tumor cells identification and monitoring these cells after treatment could help the clinicians to detect relapse or be a prognostic factor. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Circulating tumor cells identification, and monitoring in advanced stage lung cancers (IIIB and IV). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Predictive value of the monitoring of circulating tumor cells on the therapeutic response. Prognostic value of identification of circulating tumor cells at the time of diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN : This study is a prospective, monocentrique trial analyzing the identification of circulating tumor cells in stage IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers. Duration of the inclusions: 54 months. Duration of the study: 66 months. PROCEDURES : Detection of circulating tumor cells with CellSearch system (Veridex), and a cut-off of 5 cells/7,5 ml of blood. SAMPLE SIZE : 200 patients STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Detection of circulating tumor cells is predicted in 20% of stage IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers included in this study. The cut-off is 5 circulating tumor cells per 7,5 ml of blood.</brief_summary>
