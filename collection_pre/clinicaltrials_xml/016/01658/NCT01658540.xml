	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of the Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) technology for the treatment of the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) ischemic obstructive vascular disease in patients presenting with long lesions. As secondary aim this study is going to explore treatment effect on a number of procedural and clinical endpoints in order to collect information to design a future comparative effectiveness study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented ischemic, symptomatic arterial disease in the femoralpopliteal arteries according to Rutherford Category 2, 3 or 4; Target lesion consists of a single solitary or multiple adjacent de novo or restenotic lesions (noninstent) with diameter stenosis ≥ 70% by visual estimate and cumulative lesion length ≥ 15 cm; Target vessel is the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery (above the knee); Life expectancy &gt;1 year in the Investigator's opinion; Written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Given the observational nature of the study, no studyspecific but only clinical exclusion criteria will apply: Patient unwilling or unlikely to comply with FU schedule; Administration of local or systemic thrombolytic therapy within 48 hours prior to the index procedure; Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, aspirin, other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies, and/or paclitaxel; Additional planned cardiac or peripheral percutaneous or surgical intervention including CABG within 30 days following the study procedure; 15 cm long inflow lesion (≥50% DS) or occlusion (any length) in the ipsilateral Iliac artery; Failure to successfully treat &lt; 15 cm long inflow lesion in the ipsilateral Iliac artery</criteria>
