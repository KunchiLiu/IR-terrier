	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II study in 2 stages, evaluating BEZ235 plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) after failure of mTOR inhibitor therapy. Study design: This was a Phase II, two-stage, multicenter study, where Stage 1 was a single arm, open label design and Stage 2 was planned to be a randomized, double-blind study. However, at the end of Stage 1, the futility was met and hence the Stage 2 was not initiated.</brief_summary>
