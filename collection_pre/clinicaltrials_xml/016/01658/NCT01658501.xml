	<brief_summary>Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to define the dose response of Glymera as measured as the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) following 20 weeks of once-weekly dosing. Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are to: - Describe incidence, severity, and duration of reported gastrointestinal side effects of Glymera compared to active comparator; - Compare change from baseline in HbA1c following 20 weeks of dosing compared to placebo and active comparator; - Compare change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) following 20 weeks of dosing compared to placebo and active comparator; - Describe the frequencies of adverse events in the treatment groups; and - Describe the above endpoints for the following subgroups of subjects according to baseline type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapy: diet and exercise only, metformin only, sulfonylurea only, or metformin and sulfonylurea combination therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive; Body mass index ≤45 kg/m2; Diagnosed with T2DM with HbA1c of ≥7.0% and ≤11.0% and treated with diet and exercise alone, or with stable doses of metformin alone, sulfonylurea alone or metformin and sulfonylurea. Currently taking or have taken within the last 6 months nonoral antihyperglycemic agents (eg, insulin, Byetta®, Bydureon®, or Victoza). Shortterm use of insulin within this period will not be cause for exclusion if insulin was used during the treatment of an acute intercurrent illness; Known allergy to or serious adverse effect caused by an approved or investigational glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor analog/agonist; Unstable cardiovascular disease; History of weight loss surgery or other gastrointestinal surgical procedures that could possibly interfere with the mechanism of action of GLP1 receptor agonists; Based on contraindications/warnings identified with other GLP1 receptor agonists, subjects will be excluded if they have: History, symptoms, or signs of pancreatitis or severe gastrointestinal disease (ie, gastroparesis) or Personal or family history of medullary thyroid tumors or history of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome Type 2; Clinically significant renal and/or hepatic dysfunction; Pregnant or lactating female subjects.</criteria>
