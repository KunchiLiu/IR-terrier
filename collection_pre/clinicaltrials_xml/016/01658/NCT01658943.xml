	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well selumetinib and Akt inhibitor MK2206 work compared to modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX) therapy in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. Selumetinib and Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet know whether selumetinib and Akt inhibitor MK2206 are more effective than oxaliplatin and fluorouracil in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib and Akt Inhibitor MK2206 or mFOLFOX Therapy Comprising Oxaliplatin and Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with the combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate (selumetinib) and MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) compared to those treated with mFOLFOX. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with the combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 compared to those with mFOLFOX in this patient population. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with the combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 compared to those treated with mFOLFOX. II. To assess objective tumor response in the subset of patients with measurable disease (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with the combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 compared to those treated with mFOLFOX. III. To bank tissue and blood for future translational medicine studies. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1-2 and 15-16 (mFOLFOX). ARM II: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and selumetinib PO daily on days 1-28. In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; patients with endocrine or neuroendocrine tumors, lymphoma of the pancreas, or ampullary cancer are not eligible Patients must have distant metastatic disease; patients with macroscopic residual disease postresection as the only site of disease are not eligible; patient must not have clinically significant ascites (defined as requiring paracentesis) or have brain metastases Patients must have received one line, and no more than one line, of prior gemcitabinebased chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer and must have documentation of metastatic disease progression while on this treatment; documented disease progression must occur within 42 days of the last treatment; OR For patients who received one line of gemcitabinebased chemotherapy for treatment in the adjuvant setting, recurrence to a metastatic site must be documented by imaging studies within 6 months of completing chemotherapy; chemoradiation as part of adjuvant treatment is acceptable; if the patient received one line of adjuvant gemcitabinebased treatment and had disease recurrence after 6 months of completing chemotherapy, patients will only be eligible after failing one additional line of gemcitabinebased chemotherapy used to treat the metastatic disease Patients must have measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease; xrays, scans. or physical examinations for assessment of measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration; xrays, scans, or other tests for assessment of nonmeasurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form Patients must have completed systemic therapy at least 14 days prior to registration, any surgical procedure must have been performed at least 14 days prior to registration, and radiation therapy must be completed at least 7 days prior to registration; patients must have recovered to =&lt; grade 1 from any of the effects of prior therapies or procedures Patients must not plan to receive concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, agents known to prolong corrected QT (QTc) interval, or agents known to be strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) or cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) Patient must not have received prior treatment with fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX), FOLFOX, oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, phosphoinositide3kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, or protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitors Zubrod performance status of 01 Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL Patients must have adequate kidney function as evidenced by at least ONE of the following: Serum creatinine =&lt;
