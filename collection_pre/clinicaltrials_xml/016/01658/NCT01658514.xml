	<brief_summary>This study evaluated how a single dose of delayed-release metformin (Met DR) behaves in subjects with normal kidney function, mild kidney dysfunction, moderate kidney dysfunction, or severe kidney dysfunction. The safety and tolerability of Met DR was also examined. In addition, this study compared the behavior of a single dose of Met DR with that of extended-release metformin (Met XR) and placebo in subjects with the varying levels of kidney function described above.</brief_summary>
