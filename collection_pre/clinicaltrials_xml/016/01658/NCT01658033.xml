	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Plus Modified FOLFOX6 Regimen as the Salvage Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthracyclines and taxanes are the most frequently used agents for breast cancer,both in adjuvant and in first-line metastatic settings.For the patients who do not respond or relapse early after the administration of a taxane or anthracycline regimen,it is clearly needed to explore new combinations and schedules of drugs.Oxaliplatin has shown very promising activity in MBC either in monotherapy or in combination with 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) with or without leucovorin (LV). Avastin is a target therapy with proven efficacy in the treatment of MBC. Avastin plus FOLFOX regimen showed synergetic effet and been used as the standard trial in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Based on the above reason, we initiate this phase II study to evaluate efficacy and safety of avastin plus modified FOLFOX6 regimen in HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients.</detailed_description>
