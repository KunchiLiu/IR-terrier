	<brief_title>Clinical Trial on Remote Ischemic Preconditioning and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CSV constitutes an important type of ischemic stroke due to a generalized hypo-perfusion of brain. Few treatment methods are available except some beneficial effect shown with nimodipine. The potential treatment effect of RIPC on protection of brain from cerebral small vessel disease has not been investigated. The investigators designed this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to examine (1) whether RIPC has a beneficial effect on brain lesions of CSV, and (2) whether RIPC can protect patients of CSV from cognitive deterioration. There are 2 arms in this trial: One arm is RIPC treatment, the other one is sham RIPC treatment. Brain lesions will be quantified by volumetric MRI, and Xe-CT will be used to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion. Cognitive function will be evaluated by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).</detailed_description>
