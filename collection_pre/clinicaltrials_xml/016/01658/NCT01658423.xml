	<brief_title>Maturity and Motor Fitness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators examined the issue in adolescent boys (n = 107) aged from 13.0 to 13.9 years. The maturity status was assessed using a self-assessment of stage of pubic hair based on the criteria of Tanner. Body composition and maximal voluntary knee extension torque (KET) were determined using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer and a static myometer, respectively. Sprint velocity was measured by a non-motorized treadmill. Jump height was calculated from the following equation; g × (flight time)2 × 8 × 10-1. The flight time during jumping was measured by a matswitch system.</detailed_description>
