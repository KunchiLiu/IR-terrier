	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle dysfunction impairs exercise capacity, quality of life and prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study was to evaluate effects of Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) plus quadriceps muscle training (NMES group) and sham NMES plus quadriceps muscle training (control group) on muscle function, exercise capacity, health related quality of life, activities of daily living, and self-efficacy in patients with COPD who are eligible and able to participate in endurance training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation as an Adjunct to Exercise Training in Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle dysfunction is common and impaires exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Exercise training is the main component of the treatment of COPD. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is successful in COPD patients who are unable to perform exercise training. The NMES has positive effect on peripheral muscle function, exercise capacity and breathlessness in activities of daily living in COPD patients who had an abnormal body composition or who were too dyspneic to leave their home. A nonrandomized uncontrolled study has shown that application of NMES at home for improved exercise capacity in patients with better-preserved muscle mass. Evidence from a preliminary study without applying sham NMES revealed that NMES applied as complementary to ambulatory respiratory rehabilitation program increased quadriceps strength, quality of life and six minute walk distance in severe to very severe patients. Despite documented benefits of NMES in COPD patients, the place of NMES as an adjunct to pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients who were able to do regular endurance and strength training on is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of NMES plus quadriceps muscle training (NMES group) and sham NMES plus quadriceps muscle training (control group) on muscle function, dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, health related quality of life, activities of daily living, and self-efficacy in patients with COPD who are eligible and able to participate in endurance training.</detailed_description>
