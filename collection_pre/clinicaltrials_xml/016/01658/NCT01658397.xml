	<brief_summary>In this study, we will be studying the effects of acute calorie deprivation (a 10-day fast) on bone marrow fat, other fat stores and bone parameters. We will be measuring changes in bone marrow fat using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and will use MRI to measure subcutaneous and visceral fat depots. Our hypothesis is that levels of bone marrow fat will increase after an acute fast.</brief_summary>
