	<brief_title>Assessment of Esophageal Motility With Transnasal Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal manometry is a gold standard for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorder. However, esophageal manometry can not detect non-occulsive contraction. Endoscopic evaulation of esophageal motility is difficult becausea swallowing is nearly impossible during endoscopy. Simplified trans nasal endoscopy (E.G. ScanTM, IntroMedic Co.,Ltd.)composed with dysplay system,controller,and disposable probe with compact size. The esophageal motor function will be assessed with both esophageal manometry and simplifed trnasnasal endoscopy in patients with esophageal motility disorder (such as achalasia) and healthy volunteer. The results of simplifed trnasnasal endoscopy is compared with the results of esophageal manometry.</detailed_description>
