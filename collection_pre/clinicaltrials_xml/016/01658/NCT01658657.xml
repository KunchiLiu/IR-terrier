	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of plasma renin activity-guided therapy for determining hypertension treatment. Plasma renin is an enzyme in your blood that can be measured to determine your hypertension subtype. Once the subtype is known, doctors can prescribe specific medications to target your specific hypertension subtype. This study will investigate whether targeting the specific hypertension subtype helps to achieve blood pressure control sooner and with fewer medications compared to a standard fixed dose combination therapy.</brief_summary>
