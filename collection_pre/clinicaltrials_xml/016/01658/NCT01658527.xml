	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized phase II open label trial is to determine the anti-tumor activity of TAK-700 (Orteronel) as compared to bicalutamide in terms of clinical progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients who failed 1st line treatment with LHRH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) agonists or surgical castration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma Metastatic disease in bone or other lesions documented by imaging. Abnormal 99mTcbone scan imaging must be confirmed by Computed Tomography (CT) Scan or Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) Progressive disease following 1st line androgen deprivation therapy with LHRH (luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone) Agonists or surgical castration. Recommendations of Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) WHO (World health organization) performance status ≤ 2 Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks Adequate bone marrow function (Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1500/μL; platelets 100,000/μL) Castrate serum levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute Adequate hepatic function: Bilirubin: total bilirubin 1.5 Upper limit of Normal (ULN) Asparate aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases or ≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present Patients of reproductive potential should use adequate birth control measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for at least 4 months following the last study treatment. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those that result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP (International conference on HarmonizationGood Clinical Practices), and national/local regulations Exclusion criteria Cardiac function: Screening calculated ejection fraction (Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) scan, or by echocardiogram) must be ≥ 50% No history of myocardial infarction, unstable symptomatic ischemic heart disease, ongoing arrhythmias of Grade &gt; 2 thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or symptomatic cerebrovascular events), or any other cardiac condition (e.g., pericardial effusion restrictive cardiomyopathy) within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug Chronic stable atrial fibrillation on stable anticoagulant therapy is allowed Absence of New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure Absence of Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities of: Qwave infarction, unless identified 6 or more months prior to screening and QTc interval &gt; 470 msec No uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy defined as blood pressure &gt;160/90 mmHg at 2 separate measurements no more than 60 minutes apart during the Screening visit Prior radiotherapy but only for lymph nodes is allowed Prior or concomitant therapy: No intake of narcotic analgesia for bone pain No prior treatment with nonsteroidal antiandrogens, within 6 months prior to randomization No anticancer therapy or treatment with another investigational agent within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization No prior therapy with TAK700, ketoconazole, abiraterone, aminoglutethimide or MDV3100 Patients taking bisphosphonates or denosumab are eligible if they have received a stable dose for 4 weeks or more prior to randomization. (These treatments may then be continued on study) No known hypersensitivity to compounds related to TAK700 or to TAK700 excipients (refer to Investigator's brochure) No known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the GI absorption or tolerance of TAK700, including difficulty swallowing tablets No prior history of adrenal insufficiency No prior history of malignancies other than prostate adenocarcinoma (except for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), or the patient has been free of malignancy for a period of 3 years prior to first dose of study drug No known active chronic hepatitis B or C, lifethreatening illness unrelated to cancer, or any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with participation in this study No drug or alcohol abuse Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial</criteria>
