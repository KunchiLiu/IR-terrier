	<brief_summary>The intent of this project is to execute a high-quality double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the H-Wave® device with a commonly used TENS device with a sub-therapeutic electrocurrent device. This study will provide a definable level of evidence for treatment efficacy, and provide a basis for evidence-based recommendation for or against utilization for these two modalities. The results for H-Wave® device, if positive, could significantly impact morbidity by providing a non-invasive, non-pharmacologic treatment for symptomatic relief, and reduce overall disability and health care costs associated with chronic low back pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Electrotherapies for Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>H-Wave® Device Stimulation (Intervention A) plus usual care, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (Intervention B) plus usual care, and sham electrotherapy plus usual care (control). Each treatment arm will have identical participants enrolled (n=38 per arm) of with the same number of visits and investigator contact time. Eligible participants will be allocated through computerized randomization utilizing a stratified permuted-block randomization employing random block sizes. Allocation is concealed. Participants and assessors will be blinded. Participants will not be told what types of electrotherapy devices are being studied, only that there are different types, and that they may be randomized to receive a sham device. Patients will be instructed on the use of the device they received to perform daily home therapy. Subjects will be assessed at week 1, 4, 8 and 12 for the primary and secondary outcomes measures. Compliance to treatment will be measured through an electronic meter on each of the devices, as well as by patient diary. Patients will be allowed to receive usual care from their own health care provider, with the exception of invasive procedures or surgery. Results will be analyzed by intention to treat methods.</detailed_description>
