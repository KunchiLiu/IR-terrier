	<brief_summary>This pilot study is designed to determine the relationship between intra-myocellular lipids and muscle contractility in fibers from obese and non-obese older adults. Obese participants are being recruited for an on-going weight loss intervention study and this application seeks approval to recruit and enroll a lean comparison group of non-obese older adults. The primary goal of this study is to characterize the contractile properties of single muscle fibers and whole muscle in healthy, non-obese individuals under the same recording conditions the investigators used for the obese population to begin to determine whether fat infiltration accounts for diminished force.</brief_summary>
