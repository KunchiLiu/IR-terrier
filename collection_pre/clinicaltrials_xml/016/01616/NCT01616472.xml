	<brief_summary>The study is designed to assess the association between steroid exposure and five potentially steroid-related adverse events within a cohort of individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Study objectives are to quantify the fraction of the risk of new (i) diabetes, (ii) hypertension, (iii) cataracts, (iv) osteoporosis and (v) avascular necrosis that is attributable to cumulative corticosteroid exposure in SLE patients. The study will consist of five matched case-control analyses nested within the Hopkins Lupus Cohort. Cases will be incident SLE cases who have developed one of the case outcomes (diabetes, hypertension, cataracts, osteoporosis with fracture or vertebral collapse or avascular necrosis). Controls will be matched to cases on time since SLE diagnosis. The primary exposures to be assessed are cumulative dose of steroid (g) and cumulative duration of exposure to steroids. The extent of the risk associated with steroids will be explored through modeling of the relationship and through calculation of attributable risks of exposure (number of cases associated with the highest exposure quartile of each primary exposure).</brief_summary>
