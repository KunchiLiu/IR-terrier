	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluated the usefulness of the Glidescope(GVL) compared with direct laryngoscopy in patients whose airway management are anticipated difficult (C&amp;L grade ≥3) by comparing the laryngoscopic view. Also, the investigators compared the effectiveness of smaller-size blade of GVL (GVLs) with standard blade of GVL selected by patient's weight (GVLw) in the same patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GlideScope®Video Laryngoscope for Difficult Intubation: Implication of the Size of Blade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We assumed that smaller sized GVL can slide more angulated along the tongue, so the tip of a blade can be placed more anterior and cephalad. The angle of camera would be optimized by inserting the blade further with the blade tip directed toward the larynx. This optimization may be more remarkable with smaller blade because it can be inserted with rotation. Furthermore, the location and the angle of camera are different according to GVL blade size. Considering that patient with difficult airway has hypognathia and more cephalad larynx, it may be helpful with smaller sized GVL (GVLs) rather than GVL selected by weight (GVLw) for improvement of laryngoscopic view in patients with difficult airways. We hypothesized that GVLs can provide better laryngoscopic view than GVLw and DL in patient with difficult airway.</detailed_description>
