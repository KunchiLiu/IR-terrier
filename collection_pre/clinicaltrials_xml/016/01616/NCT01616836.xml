	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the best method of pain control that will help with rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Currently, the best method for pain control after TKA appears to be continuous femoral nerve block (FNB) where a small tube is placed beside the nerve that provides sensation to a large part of the knee and local anesthetic infused after surgery causing numbness to the surgical site. A single injection method also exists and may provide similar benefits. Both methods require training and can result in side effects such as temporary weakness (while the local anesthetic is still working) that can inhibit rehabilitation. A newer method injecting local anesthetic into the joint after surgery (Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA)) is becoming common, does not cause weakness and can be done quickly at the end of surgery. It is unknown if the pain control provided by LIA is as good as that of FNB. This study will compare the femoral nerve block, continuous femoral nerve block and LIA technique to determine which provides better pain relief after TKA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind study. Patients will be randomized using a computer-generated sequence to one of three groups: Group 1: Continuous femoral nerve block group (cFNB) Group 2: Single injection femoral nerve block group (sFNB) Group 3: Local infiltration analgesia group (LIA) Inclusion criteria: Patients between the ages of 18 and 85 having primary tri-compartmental total knee arthroplasty. Exclusion criteria: Allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study medication (see below), inability to walk independently prior to TKA, inability to comprehend French or English, use of major tranquilizers, ASA 4 or 5, BMI &gt; 40, opioid tolerance (opioid consumption &gt; 30mg oral morphine or equivalent per day), pregnancy</detailed_description>
