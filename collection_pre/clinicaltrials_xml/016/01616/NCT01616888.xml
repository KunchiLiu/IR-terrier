	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon for SFA In-stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the lower extremities can cause claudication, pain in the legs or feet and slowly wounds that can affect patients' quality of life and increase the risk of leg amputation and death. Both conventional balloon angioplasty (CBA) alone and CBA plus bare metal stents are the current primary endovascular therapy to treat PAD. However, exaggerated neointimal hyperplasia leading to in-stent restenosis is associated with CBA. Paclitaxel coated balloons have been recognized to be safe and effective for the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis, which the investigators hypothesize to be applicable in femoropopliteal cases.</detailed_description>
