	<brief_summary>Vocal cord injuries occur not only during tracheal intubation, but also during surgery and during removal of tracheal tube. Volatile anesthetics increase neuromuscular block of muscle relaxants. Thus, the investigators tested the hypothesis, that sevoflurane would cause less vocal cord injuries than a total intravenous anesthesia with propofol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laryngeal Injuries After Removal of the Tracheal Tube: A Comparison Between Sevoflurane and Propofol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volatile anaesthetics increase neuromuscular block of neuromuscular blocking drugs. We tested the hypothesis, that sevoflurane would cause less vocal cord injuries than an intravenous anaesthesia with propofol. Sixty five patients were randomly assigned to the SEVO group (anaesthesia with sevoflurane) or TIVA group (anaesthesia with propofol). Vocal cord injuries were examined by stroboscopy before and 24 and 72 h after surgery; hoarseness was assessed up to 72 h.</detailed_description>
