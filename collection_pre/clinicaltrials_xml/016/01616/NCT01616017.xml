	<brief_summary>Cardiac output (CO) is an important hemodynamic variable in the management of critically ill patients. The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) requires invasive techniques with potential complications and there is increasing interest in less invasive methods of measuring CO. This study is designed to compare CO values from PAC thermodilution (COTD) and ultrasound dilution (COUD).</brief_summary>
