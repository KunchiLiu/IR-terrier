	<brief_summary>The NCRI Adult ALL sub-group propose to collaborate with the Dutch/Belgian group HOVON to carry out a prospective, non randomised multi-arm study (including a choice of regimen intensity) to investigate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of a standardised therapy protocol for patients ≥ 60 years old with de novo ALL. The overall aim is define a basic standard of care upon which trials of novel therapies will be based in future. The design of the study will enable collection of a comprehensive dataset regarding the clinical outcome, Complete Response Rate (CR) and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) response rates in a previously completely uncharacterised population, thus providing the essential platform for designing future randomised advanced phase studies in which new therapeutic approaches and novel therapies can be prospectively investigated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will 1. establish baseline expectations for Event Free Survival (EFS), Overall Survival (OS), MRD responses and quality of life measures for older patients of all ages and pre-morbid states; 2. disclose how best to use knowledge of pre-morbid characteristics to apply the appropriate intensity of therapy in order to balance the best disease related outcomes against quality of life; 3. establish national standards of care for this patient group; 4. provide the essential platform for careful design of future randomised advanced phase studies of new therapeutic approaches and agents.</detailed_description>
