	<brief_summary>The healing of full thickness skin defects treated with a split thickness skin graft (STSG) is frequently associated with excessive scarring and contraction. The psychological burden of poor cosmesis of these scarred regions as well as functional problems due to skin tightness and decreased joint mobility cause a very significant morbidity in these patients. Application of a dermal substitute underneath the split skin may improve the quality of the scar. Glyaderm is a dermal substitute derived from human skin and due to the elastin in this substitute it will contribute to a long term improvement of pliability and function and a better esthetic outcome. The main objective is to evaluate the difference in scar quality, after skin restoration of full thickness defects treated with Glyaderm® and STSG versus STSG alone. Secondary objectives are: to evaluate the percentage of Glyaderm® take before application of autografts, to compare healing time and percentage of autograft survival and bacterial load in full thickness defects treated with Glyaderm® and STSG versus STSG alone, and to conduct a concurrent cost-effectiveness and health related quality of life study (i.e. cost utility analysis). The study is an interventional, prospective, randomized and controlled interactive web based, study in a multicentre setting. Patients with full thickness burn wounds or full thickness skin defects will be evaluated before enrolment. A total of 120 patients will be included. All included patients will undergo full thickness removal of the burned skin or adequate debridement of all necrotic tissue. The wounds of the patients will be covered with glycerol preserved allografts for wound bed preparation. At the second operation, 5-7 days after the first operation, the allografts are removed. If the wound bed is not suitable for grafting, additional wound bed preparation with allografts is required until the wound bed is satisfactory. If the wound bed is suitable for grafting, the patient is randomized to the Glyaderm® group or the control group. The wounds of the patients randomized to the Glyaderm® group are covered with Glyaderm®. After 6-8 days the wounds are finally covered with a thin STSG. In the control group, the wounds are immediately covered with a thin STSG. Up to one year after complete wound closure, patients are followed-up for scar evaluation and quality of life.</brief_summary>
