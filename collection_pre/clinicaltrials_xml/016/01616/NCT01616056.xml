	<brief_title>Bandage Lenses in Treating Patients With Ocular Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the symptom improvement after 2 weeks of therapy with bandage lenses. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To confirm short-term safety within 1 month after bandage lenses. II. To determine improvement in ophthalmologic examinations after bandage lenses. III. To explore the use of optical coherence tomography as an objective measure of corneal inflammation. OUTLINE: Patients wear bandage lenses continuously for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
