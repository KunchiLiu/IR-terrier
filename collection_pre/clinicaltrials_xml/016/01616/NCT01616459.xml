	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two formulations of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine (2830929A and 2830930A) administered as 3-dose primary vaccination during the first 6 months of life followed by a booster dose in the second year of life. To comply with the routine infant immunisation program, the licensed GSK Biologicals DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa) vaccine will be co-administered in infants with the pneumococcal study vaccines.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity of the two formulations of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2830929A (11-valent vaccine or 11Pn vaccine) and 2830930A (12-valent vaccine or 12Pn vaccine), when administered as 3-dose primary vaccination during the first 6 months of life followed by a booster dose in the second year of life, when compared to immune responses to the licensed vaccines Synflorix™ and Prevnar 13™, and to assess the reactogenicity and safety of these two same investigational formulations when administered according to this schedule. To comply with the routine infant immunisation program, the licensed GSK Biologicals DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa™) vaccine will be co-administered in infants with the pneumococcal study vaccines.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LARs) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including 6 to 12 weeks (4290 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination. In addition, the first pneumococcal and DTPaHBVIPV/Hib vaccination should be given in accordance with the official national recommendations for the immunisation schedule of infants. Written informed consent obtained from the parents/LAR(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born after a gestation period of at least 36 weeks. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid (except MenCTT in Spain) or CRM197 and not foreseen by the study protocol during any time of the study period, or of any other vaccines not foreseen by the protocol in the period starting from 30 days before each dose and ending 30 days after each dose of vaccine(s), with the following exceptions: Licensed influenza vaccines are always allowed, even if concomitantly administered with the study vaccines. Licensed rotavirus vaccines are allowed if administered at least 7 days before or after each dose of study of vaccines. Licensed MenCTT vaccine is allowed in Spain and should be concomitantly administered with the study vaccine at around 2, 4 and 1215 months of age. In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g. a pandemic) is organised by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunization program, that vaccine can be administered at any time during the study period provided it is licensed and used according to its Summary of Product Characteristics or Prescribing Information and according to the local governmental recommendations. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product . Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness, including Kawasaki's syndrome. History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including conditions such as hypotensivehyporesponsive episodes, encephalopathy and any convulsions (afebrile and febrile). Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during study period. Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, H. influenzae type b. Previous vaccination against S. pneumoniae. History of or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio, H. influenzae type b disease. Any medical condition which might interfere with the assessment of the study objectives in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
