	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Cyclosporin in Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study on ten children using Cyclosporin-A (CSA) microemulsion to treat idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), with normal renal function, who achieved complete remission with CSA. The objective is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of CSA in INS during remission and relapse of the disease. The PK profile of CSA was evaluated with the 12-hour area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-12) using seven time-point samples. This procedure was done on each patient during remission and relapse with the same CSA dose in mg/kg/day. The AUC0-12 was calculated by trapezoidal rule. All PK parameters and the resumed 4-hour area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-4) were correlated with AUC0-12. This study is very important because the cyclosporin is a nephrotoxic drug with narrow therapeutic window.</detailed_description>
