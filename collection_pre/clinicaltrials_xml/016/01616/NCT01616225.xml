	<brief_summary>This study (the "Adjuvant Growth Hormone Study") is being done to see the effects of adding Growth Hormone (GH) during fertility treatment (also called in vitro fertilization or IVF). Growth Hormone is a protein that your body normally produces. Growth Hormone can act on several different organs, including the ovaries, where eggs are made. From evidence gathered from studies done by fertility doctors over the years, researchers believe that women who have not become pregnant through IVF in the past might have better results if they go on a course of Growth Hormone during the IVF treatment. However, more research needs to be done to confirm whether adding Growth Hormone is beneficial and also to find out the best time to start Growth Hormone treatment during IVF. We hope that our Adjuvant Growth Hormone study will help answer these questions.</brief_summary>
