	<brief_summary>DTRAX Graft is used to relieve nerve pressure in the neck in order to provide relief for Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease. This study is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of the graft, and to find out whether or not it provides better results or faster healing than traditional ways of performing surgery for Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease.</brief_summary>

Subject is a prisoner. 10. Subject is pregnant. 11. Subject abuses alcohol or drugs. 12. Subject has a cervical spinal condition other than symptomatic cervical disc disease requiring surgical treatment at the involved level. 13. Subject has insulin dependent diabetes. 14.
