	<brief_summary>It is well-known that 20-25% of patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction will develop acute heart failure during their hospitalization. Currently, the investigators have no reliable parameter for prediction of evolving acute heart failure in such a group of patients. As a result, the investigators have no way of preventing acute heart failure. Treatment of these patients only begins after appearance of clinical signs of acute heart failure. Lung impedance monitoring may be a good non-invasive parameter for prediction of evolving acute heart failure. This study will attempt to address whether preemptive lung impedance-guided therapy may prevent the development of overt acute heart failure and improve their clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
