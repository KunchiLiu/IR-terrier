	<brief_summary>This study will test the effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy (using the VAC Prevena device, KCI Canada Inc.) applied to the saphenous vein harvest site after Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). When initiated immediately after surgery, this intervention may decrease the incidence of wound infection and non-infectious wound complications. It may decrease wound discomfort and improve mobility and functional recovery of the leg.</brief_summary>
