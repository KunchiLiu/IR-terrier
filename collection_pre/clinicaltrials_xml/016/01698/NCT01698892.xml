	<brief_summary>Bronchoscopy is a technique which currently allows the investigation of many respiratory diseases (infections, neoplasia, inflammation…) as well as endobronchial therapeutic procedures. Good flexible bronchoscopy diagnostic practices suggest the use of anxiolytic premedication before endoscopy, but practices concerning the use of sedation further to the completion of the endoscopy are very heterogeneous. We thus propose to compare, during a randomize, controlled trial, respiratory tolerance to I.V. versus sublingual sedation in two groups of patients indergoing bronchoscopy</brief_summary>
