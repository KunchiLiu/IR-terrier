	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the seroconversion rate and the cellular immune response after vaccination against hepatitis B virus in patients with lymphoproliferative syndrome like chronic lymphocytic leukemia stade A and follicular lymphoma without of treatment criteria.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rituximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the B-cell CD20. It is an indispensible drug for the treatment of B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome which induced immunosuppression. So, the infectious complications increase. Reactivation of hepatitis B virus is one such complication that can lead in asymptomatic hepatitis to death. Prevention of hepatitis B reactivation is recommended like using nucleoside analog for patients with chronic hepatitis B or occult hepatitis and vaccination against virus for seronegative patients. The published data about efficacy of hepatitis b vaccination in onco-haematology are rare. therefore, we carried out a prospective study to assess efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in patients with lymphoproliferative disorder.</detailed_description>
