	<brief_summary>This study is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to explore the effect of early treatment with Onabotulinumtoxin A in patients with acute complete motor spinal cord injury (SCI) on the development of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). A total of 20 patients will be randomized to intra-detrusor injection of 300 U Onabotulinumtoxin A in 30 ml NaCl 0.9 % or placebo with 30 ml NaCl 0.9 %. Bladder biopsies will be obtained in the same procedure. The treatment will be repeated after three months. All included patients will be evaluated with urodynamic examinations. Follow-up is 12 months after the first treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is development of NDO.</brief_summary>
