	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether a culturally sensitive self-management (SM) intervention, compared to an education only control, will reduce all-cause hospital days in patients with mild to moderate heart failure and household income less than $30,000 per year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Congestive Heart Failure Adherence Redesign Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the CHART research study is to assess the value of a novel multi-level intervention for low-income patients recently hospitalized with heart failure relative to providing education alone (both strategies are described in detail in the Intervention section below). The investigators refer to their novel intervention strategy as 'Enhanced Training' and their education-only strategy the investigators refer to as 'Enhanced Education'. These two strategies of participant follow-up will be assessed and compared by analyzing patient's all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year follow-up period (the investigators note that, for patients with heart failure, the average number of such all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year period has tripled over the past 25 years). The Enhanced Training strategy aims to improve patient receipt of evidence-based therapy by: 1) activating patients using a culturally sensitive approach that might better resonate with the investigators predominantly urban, African-American and Hispanic, target population; 2) providing timely and useful information to the primary care provider; and 3) promoting effective communication between patients and their primary care provider. The Enhanced Education strategy is less intrusive and aims to provide patients and primary care providers with appropriate educational materials via mail. The primary aims of this research study are to determine if Enhanced Training and/or Enhanced Education will improve: patient adherence to drug therapy and salt restriction, health care provider adherence to evidence-based guidelines, and patient functional capacity and quality of life. Secondary aims will include assessing impact of the interventions on CRP and BNP, which are two key biomarkers of heart failure progression.</detailed_description>
