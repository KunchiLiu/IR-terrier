	<detailed_description>In the setting of uteroplacental insufficiency, there is little that can be done to increase blood flow through the uterus and placenta. Historically, women with growth restricted fetuses or oligohydramnios have been placed on bed rest. Unfortunately, this treatment modality has met with only limited success. Cardiologists have long recognized the simple act of making a fist or otherwise occluding blood flow through a limb dramatically increases a person's peripheral vascular resistance. If maternal peripheral resistance can be increased, perhaps the increased differential between the maternal peripheral vascular resistance and that of the uteroplacental unit will increase flow through the uterus and placenta.</detailed_description>
