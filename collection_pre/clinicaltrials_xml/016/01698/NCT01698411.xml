	<brief_summary>Several epidemiological studies in large cohorts suggest a strong association between sleep duration, complaint of insomnia and risk of hypertension.These findings suggest an important role of sleep quality in development of hypertension. Principal limitations of these studies are the cross-sectional study design, self-report sleep duration and poor measurement of blood pressure. The investigators propose to study an insomniac population with complete evaluation of quality and quantity of sleep, associated to complete hemodynamic measurement of hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Influence of Sleep on Hemodynamic Parameters in Patients With Sleep Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension and sleep disorders is a cross sectional study realised in an adult cohort with chronic complain of insomnia. In our study, sleep duration is evaluated by complete evaluation of quality and quantity of sleep: one night PSG, associated with sleep agenda during 3 weeks, actigraphy, and several sleep questionnaires. We join to this sleep evaluation, a complete hemodynamic evaluation with: path way velocity and central BP obtained by tonometry, ambulatory BP measurement (ABBM), and self- BP measurement. The primary objective of this epidemiological study is to show an increase risk of hypertension when sleep duration is less than 7 hours, with objective measurement of sleep duration and hypertension. Secondary objectives are to evaluate role of complain of insomnia in the risk of hypertension, and to determine cardiovascular risk in insomnia with hemodynamic explorations.</detailed_description>
