	<brief_summary>Multiple models of replacement tubes for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy are available in the market, however durability is variable. In a prospective randomized study, five commercial devices available in the market will be tested in 20 consecutive patients each. Tube performance will be observed during 6 months and durability will be assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves as well as Cox regression analysis.It is hypothesized that tube design and material will influence outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple models of replacement tubes for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy are available in the market, however durability is variable. In a prospective randomized study, five commercial devices available in the market will be tested in 20 consecutive patients each,in patients submitted to long-term outpatient nutritional support. Tube performance will be observed during 6 months and durability will be assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves as well as Cox regression analysis.It is hypothesized that tube design and material will influence outcome.This study is important because tube dysfunction and unscheduled changes are expensive troubles that disrupt the nutritional protocol and are responsible for multiple inconveniences to the patient and the caretaker.</detailed_description>
