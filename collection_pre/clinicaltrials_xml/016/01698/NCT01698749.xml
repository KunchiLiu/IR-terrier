	<brief_summary>This study is undertaken to determine the effect of intravitreal long acting dexamethasone implant,(Ozurdex®)in patients with diabetic macular edema.Diabetic macular edema is important cause of visual impairment in patients with diabetes mellitus. Focal/ grid laser photocoagulation is the standard of care in its management. Several adjuncts including intravitreal corticosteroids, Pegabtanib Sodium ,Ranibizumab, Bevacizumab, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, laser photocoagulation have been tried. Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide (TA), a water insoluble steroid, has been shown to reduce the retinal thickness and improve the visual acuity. However, recurrence of macular edema in patients who receive intravitreal TA is a major concern as the patients need multiple repeat injections because of its short half life. A more potent steroid, dexamethasone has also been tried as an alternative to TA for macular edema; however, its short half life of only 3 hours prevents its clinical application. In search for the ideal corticosteroid preparation, a Dexamethasone Posterior Segment Drug Delivery System (Dexamethasone DDS - Ozurdex®, Allergan Inc, Irvine, California) was recently developed. Promising results have been shown in certain patients with retinal vein occlusions, uveitis receiving this intravitreal drug delivery system with improvement in visual acuity. The present study introduces a novel concept of using Ozurdex ® implant in patients with diabetic macular edema.</brief_summary>
