	<brief_summary>In this 3-phase study, following an initial small-scale (phase 1) feasibility trial, the aim of phase 2 of the project is to investigate whether a community-based, 12-month intervention for overweight and obese preschool children 2-6 years of age and their families will be effective in reducing the participants' degree of overweight (BMI z-score) and in improving quality of life. In the final phase (phase 3), participating children will be randomized to either receiving a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention during the first 6 months (treatment arm), or 6 months later (control or wait list arm), in order to generate more robust effectiveness data. Participants will receive an additional free 6-month YMCA membership while participating in the study.</brief_summary>
