	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if using a diabetes management technology system, including a tablet computer, to track diabetes care and communicate with a clinician coach (a doctor or nurse from the Joslin Clinic) makes starting and adjusting insulin easier and safer for people with type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: The use of a diabetes management technology system with a clinician coach helps more individuals starting basal insulin achieve better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia compared with standard clinical practice at Joslin Diabetes Center.</brief_summary>
