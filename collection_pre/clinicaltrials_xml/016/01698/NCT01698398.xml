	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between working capacity (peak oxygen consumption) and pump speed of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs)in heart failure patients. The hypothesis is that it is possible to increase peak oxygen consumption by incrementally increasing CF-LVAD pumpspeed during exercise. The study population will consist of severe heart failure patients with CF-LVADs treated at The Heart Centre of Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet.</brief_summary>
