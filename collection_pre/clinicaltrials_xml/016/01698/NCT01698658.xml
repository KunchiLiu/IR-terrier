	<brief_title>Ultrasound Tomography Using SoftVue in Diagnosing Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the in-vivo imaging potential of SoftVue through 3-dimensional (3-D) breast imaging. II. Acquire data for SoftVue evaluation from a cohort of 100 women receiving standard ultrasound (US) evaluation as follow-up to mammographic or palpable abnormalities and construct reflection, sound speed and attenuation images with SoftVue. III. Evaluate the ability of SoftVue to detect dominant breast findings (i.e. major normal landmark architecture) or masses previously identified with standard diagnostic evaluation (palpation, mammography, standard US) using standard clock position and radial distance measurements from the nipple. IV. Conduct tomographic (i.e. slice-by-slice) comparison of SoftVue with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings from a subgroup of 50 patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo ultrasound tomography using SoftVue. Some patients also undergo MRI of the breast.</detailed_description>
