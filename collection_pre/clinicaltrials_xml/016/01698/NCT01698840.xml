	<brief_summary>Transitional formulas (22 kcal/oz) are recommended for infants less than 35 weeks gestation at birth. However, few data are available related to follow-up of infants receiving these formulas who were 28-34 weeks gestation at birth. Primary hypothesis: Provision of supplemental vitamin D to a transitional formula will lead to higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels and no infant with a serum 25-OHD less than 20 ng/mL when assessed at approximately 52 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Born at 28 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks PMA and 10002250 g birth weight. Currently 34 0/7 to 38 6/7 weeks postmenstrual age at time of consent. Born at Texas Children's (including Pavilion for Women) or Methodist campus hospitals or transferred within 48 hours of birth. Care expected to be provided at one of these institutions until discharge home. Any initial feeding will be permitted, but expected to transition to primarily (80% of feeds or up to 2 breast milk feeds per day) infant formula by 38 6/7 weeks PMA or hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Able to tolerate 22 kcal/oz transitional formula and receive a volume of at least 130 mL/kg/day total feeding volume. No longer receiving any form of mechanical ventilation or diuretics. Low flow nasal cannula (&lt; Â¼ LPM) will be permitted if it is anticipated this will be discontinued before hospital discharge. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) requiring daily use of diuretics beyond 38 6/7 weeks PMA (or hospital discharge, whichever comes first) and &gt; 22 kcal/oz concentration formula beyond 38 6/7 weeks PMA. Major congenital anomalies, history of proven Stage 2 or above NEC, or severe feeding intolerance. Caloric density greater than 22 kcal/oz. Higher order multiples (However, twins are acceptable. Twins will be randomized together. Only data from 1 twin picked at random will be used in the final analyses.)</criteria>
