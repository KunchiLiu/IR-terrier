	<brief_summary>Hyperbilirubinemia is reported to be a positive predictor in diagnosing perforated appendicitis. Therefore we analysed the diagnostic accuracy of serum bilirubin in discriminating between perforated and simple/no appendicitis. Methods: All consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy for suspected appendicitis from May 2009 to August 2011 were analysed. Primary endpoint was the diagnostic accuracy of serum bilirubin levels to detect perforated appendicitis.</brief_summary>
