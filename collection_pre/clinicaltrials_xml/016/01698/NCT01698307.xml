	<brief_title>Enhanced Algorithm for Crohn's Treatment Incorporating Early Combination Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. During disease exacerbations, pharmacological or surgical intervention is usually needed to re-establish remission. Ideally, strategies should be employed to maintain patients in long-term remission while minimizing exposure to corticosteroids and reduce therapy-related toxicity. Nevertheless, in reality many patients with CD do not receive effective therapy and their disease often remains active, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and complications from either the underlying disease or corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
