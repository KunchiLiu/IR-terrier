	<brief_title>Effect of Epidural Anesthesia on Pancreatic Perfusion and Clinical Outcome in Patients With Severe Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High mortality in severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is linked to necrosis of the gland. Animal studies showed that epidural anesthesia (EA) restores pancreatic microcirculation and decreases the severity of AP. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety of EA, its effect on pancreatic perfusion and clinical outcome of patients with AP.</detailed_description>
