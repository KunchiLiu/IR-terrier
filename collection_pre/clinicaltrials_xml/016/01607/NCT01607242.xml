	<brief_title>Impact of Total Thyroidectomy on Voice and Swallowing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Voice and swallowing alterations are frequently reported after thyroidectomy, even in the absence of nerve injury. These impair quality of life. Purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of total thyroidectomy on vocal and swallowing function. Patients will be assessed using the Greek- version of Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and a questionnaire developed by the authors regarding swallowing symptoms. Furthermore they will undergo flexible laryngoscopy for evaluation of laryngeal mobility.</detailed_description>
