	<brief_summary>Certain genetic factors can affect a patient's potential sensitivity to therapeutic drugs and other agents. There is a factor called ISG15 which might help doctors better identify patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors may be more sensitive to the drug called Irinotecan. This factor is elevated in roughly 30% of NSCLC cases. Irinotecan is an agent that inhibits the enzyme called topoisomerase I that is involved in cell growth, and it has been FDA approved for 17 years for another type of cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of this trial is to demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of targeted irinotecan chemotherapy in NSCLC patients whose tumors display a specific phenotype that is associated with increased sensitivity to this drug, ISG15H.</detailed_description>
