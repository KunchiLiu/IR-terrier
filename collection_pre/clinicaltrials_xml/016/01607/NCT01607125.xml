	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Vortioxetine 20 mg/day will lead to changes in neural activity (BOLD signal), as measured using fMRI, in brain areas associated with executive functioning and memory during cognitive task performances compared to placebo in subjects remitted from depression and in controls, and to explore if Vortioxetine will lead to improved cognitive performance in the absence of depression.</brief_summary>
