	<brief_title>A Study to Compare Capillary and Venous Whole Blood and Plasma Concentrations of Five Antipsychotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time), single-center study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 cohorts (groups) defined by the antipsychotic drug (aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone or paliperidone). Antipsychotics are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Participants will enter the investigational site in the morning of Day -1 and stay until the morning of Day 2. Participants will return to the study site for subsequent assessments as per study's schedule. The total study length for a participant is approximately 26 days, except for participants receiving aripiprazole for whom the total study length is approximately 39 days.</detailed_description>
