	<brief_summary>Rationale: Cognitive deficits are a core feature in schizophrenia. Conventional treatments (antipsychotic medication and psychological treatments) have limited effects so cognitive remediation programs were designed to alleviate the problems. Interventions typically involve a variety of exercises in a paper and pencil or a computerized format with a growing number of specialized computer programs now being developed. However, many of these programs lack specificity which does not allow an individual's specific needs to be addressed. More targeted interventions might increase the effects of therapy so RECOS - COgnitive REmediation for Schizophrenia - was developed to fit this gap. Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing patients aged 18 to 45 years suffering from schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR. RECOS will be compared to an already validated program (CRT). 220 patients will be randomized as follows : - Arm 1 : RECOS (42 h) - Arm 2 : CRT (42 h) The recruitment is performed by psychiatrists in Lyon, Paris, Clermont-de-l'Oise, Niort, Bordeaux, Ville-Evrard and Lausanne.</brief_summary>
