	<brief_title>The Effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation on Pain During Venous Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred patients were allocated randomly to two groups: In the active TENS group TENS was delivered via two electrodes on the venous cannulation site (radial side of the wrist of dominant forearm) 20 min prior to venous cannulation and control group received placebo (no current) TENS. Venous cannulation with a 22 gage cannula was performed. During venous cannulation the pain intensity (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) was measured. Any side effects during study periods were recorded</detailed_description>
