	<brief_summary>No former studies have done long-term evaluation on patients reconstructed with hamstrings graft, the use of Howells tibial guide and transtibial drilling of the femoral graft tunnel. The investigators aim to evaluate clinical, radiographic and subjective outcome at a minimum of 10 years after surgery. According to former published studies on alike methods, the use of transtibial drilling of the femoral graft tunnel causes an increased rotational instability of the knee. The investigators aim to map the clinical stability of this group as well as evaluating the general outcome at the long-time horizon.</brief_summary>
