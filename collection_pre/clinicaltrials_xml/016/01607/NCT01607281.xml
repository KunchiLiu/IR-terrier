	<brief_summary>The study is designed to determine anaesthetists ability to locate the right internal jugular vein(IJV) and left IJV using a landmark technique. Initially, a questionnaire was completed detecting previous user experience. An ultrasound probe, using the midpoint as an 'imaginary needle', was placed on the neck of a healthy volunteer and the image recorded. Both anaesthetist and volunteer were blinded to the screen until the image was stored. Anaesthetists were grouped into senior or junior by the total number of IJV canulation experience. The success rate is going to be measured as pass or fail.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Ability of Anesthesiologists Identifying Internal Jugular Vein Bilaterally by Anatomic Landmarks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesiologists are usually qualified in internal jugular vein canulation by using anatomic landmark technique. The anatomy of right IJV and left IJV may differ each other. The hypothesis is that the anatomical difference between right and left IJV may give rise to false puncture of especially left IJV by using anatomical landmark technique.Although USG is available, most of the experienced anesthesiologist does not prefer to use USG for IJV canulation due to different reasons.In addition to this anesthesiologists are generally preferring right IJV canulation, thus they are inexperienced in left IJV canulation. So especially during left IJV canulation,not by anatomical landmark technique but by USG will be recommended for anesthesiologists.</detailed_description>
