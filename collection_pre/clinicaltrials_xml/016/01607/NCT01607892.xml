	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out more information relating to the highest dose of KCP-330 that can be given safely and side effects it may cause, to examine how the body affects KCP-330 concentrations in the blood (pharmacokinetics or PK), to examine the effects of KCP-330 on the body (pharmacodynamics or PDn) and to obtain information on its effectiveness in treating cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Malignancies that are refractory to or intolerant of established therapy known to provide clinical benefit. Patients must not be candidates for antitumor regimes known to provide clinical benefit. 2. All patients must have evidence of progressive disease on study entry.Previously untreated patients who are not chemotherapy candidates on Arm 2 may have advanced disease (without clear progression). There is no upper limit on the number of prior treatments provided that all inclusion criteria are met and exclusion criteria are not met. Exclusion Criteria 1. Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other anticancer therapy ≤2 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1 and mitomycin C and radioimmunotherapy 6 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1. 2. Patients with active graft versus host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. At least 3 months must have elapsed since completion of allogeneic stem cell transplantation except for patients with AML, where at least 2 months must have elapsed; 3. Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for HCV RNA or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen); 4. Patients with active CNS malignancy. Asymptomatic small lesions are not considered active. Treated lesions may be considered inactive if they are stable for at least 3 months. Patient with malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without CNS symptom may be included. 5. Significantly diseased or obstructed gastrointestinal tract or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea. 6. Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline (within 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1). 7. Macular degeneration, uncontrolled glaucoma, or markedly decreased visual acuity. 8. In the opinion of the investigator, patients who are significantly below their ideal body weight.</criteria>
