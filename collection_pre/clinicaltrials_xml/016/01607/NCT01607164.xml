	<brief_summary>This study is pilot testing a self-help automated Website (similar to a self-help book) designed to help individuals to learn methods to manage their mood. The methods are cognitive-behavioral skills found effective in the treatment of depression when provided by live therapists. The purpose of the study is to determine the number of individuals who will visit the site, use the site, and respond to online surveys reporting their mood levels while using the site, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after starting to use the site. The investigators want to eventually examine whether learning these methods online would help prevent depression.</brief_summary>
