	<brief_summary>Though TTM is ubiquitously used in the neuro-intensive care unit, there is limited experience with the use of TTM after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most devastating type of stroke. TTM may be a an intervention to improve patient outcomes. This trial addresses the safety and tolerability of a protocol of ultra-early TTM after ICH/IPH and may be the basis for future larger clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Feasibility Study of Targeted Temperature Management After ICH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morbidity and mortality from intra-cerebral/intra-parenchymal hemorrhage (ICH/IPH) are important public health problems. As the most common etiology of ICH/IPH is hypertension, this places a large proportion of the population at risk. In 2011 The American Heart Association (AHA) estimated that in the US, there were 610,000 new stroke cases of which 10% were ICHs, and many required long-term health care. ICH/IPH is associated with the highest morbidity and mortality and only 20% of patients regain functional independence. Temperature modulation to hypothermia (T, 32-34Â°C) has been associated with modulation of physiopathologic processes associated with inflammatory activation and degradation of blood-brain barrier after all types of brain injury. Currently, there are no therapies to specifically target ICH/IPH. To this end, novel strategies that go beyond control of glucose, blood pressure, and intra-cranial pressure, aimed at reducing the enlargement of the hematoma and "swelling" surrounding it, could be "the new frontier in the management of ICH/IPH". Since the early resuscitation phase in the Neuro-ICU represents the greatest opportunity for impact on clinical outcome after ICH/IPH, it also appears to be the most promising window of opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating novel therapies.</detailed_description>
