	<brief_summary>Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and Proportional Assist Ventilatory Plus (PAV +) are new modes of mechanical ventilation that delivers ventilatory assist in proportion to the electrical activity of the diaphragm for NAVA and to patients efforts for PAV +. The goal of this trial is to compare oxygenation,ventilator comfort, patients -ventilator asynchronies, and sleep pattern between NAVA and PAV+.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"NAVA-PAV" Study: a Cross-over Comparative Study of 2 Advanced Modes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients will be enrolled. They will be ventilated with PAV+ and NAVA for one day, each in a randomized crossover order. The oxygenation,ventilator comfort, patients -ventilator asynchronies, and sleep pattern will be compared.</detailed_description>
