	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted in a respiratory specialist institute in Japan, with standardized techniques and data assurance checks to optimize data quality. The licensed dosage and administration of Adoair in Japan will be applied in this study. Each subject will receive treatment options in a randomized blinded fashion. Subjects will be randomized following a 4-week wash-out phase to take either Adoair 50/250mcg twice daily or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADOAIR250 Anti-inflammatory Effects in Japanese Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group, 12-week-treatment study in Japanese patients with COPD. At Visit 1, patients confirmed to be fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion criteria will start the 4-week run-in period. During the entire study period, including the run-in period, the only drug allowed to use in addition to the study drug will be oxitropium (short-acting anticholinergic drug) as relief medication. At the end of the run-in period (Visit 2), subjects eligible for randomisation will be evenly randomised to one of the following two treatment groups and start the 12-week treatment period. - ADOAIR®250 one inhalation twice daily from the DISKUS inhaler - Placebo one inhalation twice daily from the DISKUS inhaler Study completers will be defined as subjects who have completed all examinations, assessments, and study procedures in the study period, including the run-in period and the follow-up period. At completion/discontinuation of the treatment period, subjects will be switched to appropriate COPD treatment at the discretion of the investigator (or subinvestigator).</detailed_description>
