	<criteria>men and women between 1859 years of age Acute illness (infection, recent surgery, trauma). pregnancy pacemaker or defibrillator We would like to standardize the procedures and measurements in the adult population first. Older adults are excluded because by including older adults at this time, we would need to increase the sample size because we believe older adults have greater fluctuations in hydration due to medications, diet, and comorbidities.</criteria>
