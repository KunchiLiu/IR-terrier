	<brief_title>Effect of Remifentanil on Postoperative Cognition Function in Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of two different analgesic methods (Fentanyl vs Remifentanil) during major abdominal surgery on postoperative cognitive status of patients. In particular, whether there is a correlation between type of anesthesia and the appearance of postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD), including type of anesthesia and levels of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and investigate whether there is an association between presence or absence of POCD and cytokines levels</detailed_description>
