	<criteria>All subjects must satisfy ALL the following criteria at study entry: Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female subject aged 20 years and above at the time of screening. Written informed consent obtained from the subject at screening. Subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes documented within the past five years, according to the criteria specified by the American Diabetes Association or currently taking any form of antidiabetic intervention documented by the investigator; or control subjects with no diagnosis or documented history of diabetes, and HbA1c less than 6.5%, as determined by laboratory screening tests. Normal renal function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/min, estimated through the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKDEPI) equation, as determined by laboratory screening tests. Seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antiHBs antibodies and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti HBc), as determined by laboratory screening tests. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of screening and at Visit 1, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for two months after completion of the vaccination series. The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If ANY exclusion criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs within 6 months of the study entry or planned administration at any time during the study period. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol starting from 30 days before each dose of vaccine and ending 30 days after each dose, with the exception of the inactivated influenza vaccine which is allowed at any time during the study if administered at a separate site. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a protocolspecified noninvestigational product. Any previous complete or incomplete vaccination against hepatitis B since birth. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including HIV infection, based on medical history and physical examination. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, including latex. Advanced heart failure or any other severe clinical condition that significantly reduces the subject's life expectancy. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Any history of alcohol or drug abuse in the past 5 years.</criteria>
