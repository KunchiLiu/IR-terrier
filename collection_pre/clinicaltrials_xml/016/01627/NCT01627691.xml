	<brief_title>REPRISE II: REpositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve Through Implantation of Lotus™ Valve System - Evaluation of Safety and Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subject is ≥70 years of age Subject has documented calcific native aortic valve stenosis Subject has a documented aortic annulus size between ≥19 and ≤27 mm based on preprocedure diagnostic imaging Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis with NYHA Functional Class ≥ II Subject is considered high risk for surgical valve replacement Heart team assessment that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement. Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures, and provides written informed consent. Subject, family member, and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable of returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits. Subject has a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve. Subject with an acute myocardial infarction within 30 days of the index procedure Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect prior to study enrollment. Subject is on dialysis or has serum creatinine level &gt;3.0 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L. Subject has a preexisting prosthetic heart valve (aortic or mitral) or a prosthetic ring in any position. subject cannot have more than moderate mitral, aortic or tricuspid regurgitation Subject has a need for emergency surgery for any reason. Subject has a history of endocarditis within 12 months of index procedure or evidence of an active systemic infection or sepsis. Subject has echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation. Subject has low Hgb, platelet count or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or low white blood cell count. Subject requires chronic anticoagulation therapy and cannot tolerate concomitant therapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel/ticlopidine Subject has active peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleed within the past 3 months, other bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse transfusions. Subject has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately premedicated, or has known hypersensitivity to aspirin, all thienopyridines, heparin, nickel, tantalum, titanium, or polyurethanes. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to noncardiac, comorbid conditions based on the assessment of the investigator at the time of enrollment. Subject has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Subject has any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days prior to the index procedure (except for pacemaker implantation which is allowed). Subject has untreated coronary artery disease. Subject has documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%. Subject is in cardiogenic shock or has hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic support or mechanical support devices. Subject has severe peripheral vascular disease or symptomatic carotid or vertebral disease. Narrow Femoral artery lumen precludes the use of either Lotus device size, or severe iliofemoral tortuosity or calcification that would prevent safe placement of the introducer sheath. Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, etc.). Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached its primary endpoint. Patient has preexisting untreated conduction system disorder that requires new pacemaker implantation.</criteria>
