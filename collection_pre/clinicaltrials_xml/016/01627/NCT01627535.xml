	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies optical imaging in assessing activity during surgery in patients with brain tumors. New procedures, such as optical spectroscopy, may help doctors maximally remove brain tumors and minimize damage to normal brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of Intraoperative Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy in Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To develop the instrumentation to achieve real time processing and display of intraoperative 2-dimensional optical imaging and spectroscopy (i2DOS) maps in the operating arena. II. To examine the timing and spatial involvement of human cortex intraoperatively to different stimuli using i2DOS. OUTLINE: Patients undergo i2DOS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Neurosurgical patient population in the City of Hope brain and spinal tumor neurosurgical programs that have been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Only lucid patients qualified to consent to neurosurgical procedure will be approached for participation in this study. We do intend to enroll subjects with potentially terminal brain tumors. Due to the potential benefit of intraoperative mapping, we are not planning to exclude these subjects. Patients with any type of brain tumor will be eligible for participation. All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. There are no exclusion criteria except for individuals without a brain tumor and the location of the craniotomy. If the exposed area of brain is not compatible with peripheral stimuli or volitional activity the subject cannot be enrolled. Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study.</criteria>
