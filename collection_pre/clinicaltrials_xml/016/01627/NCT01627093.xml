	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, information will be collected from your medical records that is related to your personal medical history, diagnosis, and the treatment you received or are scheduled to receive for head and neck cancer. The information from your medical record will be collected at least 1 time, however, the study doctor may collect additional information from your medical records at any time in the future for the purposes of this study. You will complete 5 questionnaires before your treatment begins, at each visit during your treatment, and again at all follow-up visits related to your treatment. It should take about 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires each time. The questionnaires may be performed in person by mail, by phone or by secure electronic methods. The research coordinator will notify you via telephone, mail or via electronic notification approximately 2-3 weeks after the questionnaire is sent to remind you and also give you the option of performing the survey by other means. All information that is collected for this study will be stored in a password-protected computer and database at MD Anderson for use in future research related to cancer. Your medical record information will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your medical record information. Only the researcher in charge of the password-protected computer and database will have access to the code numbers and be able to link your medical record information back to you. This is to allow medical data related to your medical record information to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your medical record information from the password-protected computer and database will not be able to link any information back to you. Length of Study: After you sign this consent form, your active participation in this study will be over. Your medical record information may be collected indefinitely. This is an investigational study. Up to 375 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
