	<brief_summary>Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)and prehypertension (borderline high blood pressure) are at higher risk for developing high blood pressure and heart disease. The purpose of this study is to test whether PTSD patients have exaggerated increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and adrenaline levels during different forms of stress, that might predispose them to developing high blood pressure and heart disease. This study will also evaluate whether regular sessions of slow breathing that is guided by a device (RESPeRATE) improves blood pressure, heart rate, and adrenaline levels during stress in patients with PTSD and prehypertension.</brief_summary>
