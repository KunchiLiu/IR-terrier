	<brief_title>Continued Ventilation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass is well known to induce a strong anti-inflammatory response. Studies had been shown that the contact of blood components with artificial surfaces, the surgical trauma, endotoxemia and a reperfusion injury are in part responsible for the seen immunological affect after surgery. The purpose of this study is to test the effect of continued mechanical ventilation during surgery on a blood marker called soluble ST2 in patients sera. Soluble ST2 acts as a decoy receptor of IL-33 and has anti-inflammatory effects. Elevated soluble ST2 concentrations are reported in patients with acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, congestive heart failure and elevates soluble ST2 levels are associated with adverse outcome.</detailed_description>
