	<brief_title>Adjuvant Intraarterial Chemotherapy Following Surgery to Treat Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For locally advanced bladder cancer patients, tumor relapse rates after radial cystectomy were even as high as 50%-62%.Five-year disease-specific survival and OS rates in the organ-confined disease (defined as ≤pT3a) were 78.9% and 68%, respectively. For the non-organ-confined disease (defined as pT3b or higher), the rates were about 36.8% and 30.3%, respectively.Systemic chemotherapy can only prolong survival for up to 14.8 months, although with multiple severe adverse effects, such as neutrocytopenia, infection/sepsis, renal dysfunction, mucositis, or gastrointestinal toxicity. Additionally, the mortality rate associated with systemic chemotherapy was about 1%-4%.Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine if adjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy with GC was able to reduce the systemic drug toxicities and yield a better clinical outcome.</detailed_description>
