	<brief_summary>The study develops software for motion analysis and assessment of cardiac function for cardiac images. Cardiac catheterization ventriculography of several randomly selected patients were taken from our hospital's PACS system. The investigators remove the patient information on the images, and use the image for motion analysis and assessment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study develops software for motion analysis and assessment of cardiac function for cardiac images. Twenty patients who have both cardiac catheterization ventriculography and cardiac echo studies will be randomly selected. Cardiac catheterization ventriculography of the selected patients were taken from our hospital's PACS system. The investigators remove the patient information on the images, and use the image for motion analysis and assessment. The results will be compared and correlated with their cardiac echo, which could validate the clinical usefulness of the software.</detailed_description>
