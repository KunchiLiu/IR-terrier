	<brief_summary>The long-term objectives of this research are to develop effective treatments to reduce unplanned pregnancy and Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for a highly under-served population in great need. This trial will evaluate a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention designed to improve contraceptive use and decrease STIs for girls involved with the justice system for both those who do and do not want a pregnancy. Those interested in becoming pregnant will be counseled in the risks associated with teen pregnancy and what it means to have a healthy pregnancy and raise a child. The investigators will utilize Title X programs in Rhode Island to provide reproductive health services in the community. The investigators will recruit 250 girls from juvenile probation and randomize them to two interventions: two sessions of personalized MI combined with one session of skill building or three sessions of Didactic Educational Counseling (DEC), both delivered individually by trained counselors. CAMI is based on the principles of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and on MI, an empirically supported counseling technique designed to enhance readiness to change targeted behaviors. The DEC provides didactic information about contraception, STI prevention and abstinence, and is intended to control for the effects of assessment and attention.</brief_summary>
