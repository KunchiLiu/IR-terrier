	<brief_summary>The investigators will investigate the clinicopathological features of chronic hepatitis B patients with severe exacerbation selected by uniform criteria, and treated with early introduction or reintroduction of corticosteroids and anti-allergenic therapy, in order to clarify the benefits and limitations of the effects of corticosteroids and anti-allergenic therapy for amelioration of clinically severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B. The investigators also observe the immune index in the change before and after the treatment, in order to searching for some prognostic index.</brief_summary>
