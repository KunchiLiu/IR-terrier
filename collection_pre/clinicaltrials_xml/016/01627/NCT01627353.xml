	<brief_summary>The study is a blinded randomized clinical trial, comparing policies of high volume preemptive wound infiltration with a specific anesthetic cocktail versus standard of care (no wound infiltration and routine anesthesia) for post operative pain management after hysterectomy. Morphine use and pain will be measured during index admission, and pain will also be measured six weeks postoperatively. The study will be conducted at a single site, Rockyview General Hospital.</brief_summary>
