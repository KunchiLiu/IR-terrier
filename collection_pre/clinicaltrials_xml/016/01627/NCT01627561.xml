	<brief_summary>The current study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix when administered according to a 2-dose schedule with or without co-administration of GSK Biologicals' MMR and DTPa vaccines in 4-6 years old female subjects as compared to the standard 3-dose schedule in 15-25 years old female subjects, the population in which the clinical efficacy has been demonstrated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 Vaccine (GSK-580299) in Healthy Female Children 4-6 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in a partially blinded manner: - The study will be single-blind for the HPV_2D and MMR_DTPa groups up to the Month 12 visit due to the difference in the visual appearance of the study vaccines. Between Month 12 and study conclusion (Month 36), the study will be open with respect to HPV_2D group. - The study will be open with respect to the HPV_2D CO group as subjects in this group will be receiving two vaccines co-administered at each scheduled vaccination visit. - The study will be open with respect to the HPV_3D group as subjects in this group will be receiving three injections.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A female between, and including, 4 and 6 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to enrolment in the study. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Subjects who received four doses of DTP vaccine (i.e., three doses in the first year of life and a fourth dose in the second year of life) according to the schedule applicable in the participating countries. Subjects who received a first dose of MMR vaccine according to the schedule applicable in the participating countries. Child in care. Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of another HPV vaccine during the study other than that foreseen in the protocol. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s). Administration of routine meningococcal, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, inactivated influenza and/or poliomyelitis vaccines up to 8 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s) is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine(s), or planned use during the study period. History of any reactions or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccines, including latex and/or obvious allergic reactions to neomycin (a history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication), egg protein, etc. (e.g. hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock subsequent to egg ingestion). Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Previous administration of MPL or AS04 adjuvant. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine(s) or planned administration during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive subject. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of seizures or serious neurological disorder, which, according to the judgment of the investigator, precludes administration of any of the study vaccines. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests, which in the opinion of the investigator precludes administration of the study vaccine(s). Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal setting. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Enrolment can be deferred until condition is resolved. Previous administration of the fifth dose of DTP vaccine and/or the second dose of MMR vaccine or planned administration of DTP vaccine and/or MMR vaccine outside the study (during the study period from Day 0 to Month 12). History of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps and/or rubella. Known exposure to diphtheria or household exposure to pertussis within 30 days prior to vaccination with DTPa. Known exposure to measles, mumps and/or rubella 30 days prior to vaccination with the MMR study vaccine. Confirmed or suspected tuberculosis. Severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis or severe Arthustype hypersensitivity reactions) following the administration of previous dose(s) of DTP or MMR vaccines. Hyperpyrexia (≥ 40.5°C) within 48 hours of administration of previous doses of DTP or MMR vaccines. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting more than 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of administration of previous doses of DTP vaccine. Collapse or shockinglike state (hypotonichyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of administration of previous doses of DTP vaccine. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or bleeding disorders. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose(s). (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.)</criteria>
