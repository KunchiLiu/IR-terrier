	<detailed_description>To reduce bleeding, hepatectomies are performed with low central pressure (CVP) combined with extrahepatic control flow. This management can lead hemodynamic instability and reduction in oxygen delivery so an advanced monitoring should be used. This study analyzes hemodynamic changes, in patients undergoing liver resection, through the Vigileo/FloTrac system.</detailed_description>
