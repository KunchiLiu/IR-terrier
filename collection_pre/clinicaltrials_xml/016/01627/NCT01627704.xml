	<brief_summary>Compare the response rate after 6 months of hormone treatment (or a major change in hormone treatment) in metastatic breast cancer, according to the uptake of FES in metastatic lesions taking-up FDG on PET/CT at baseline. Hypothesis: best response rate will be observed in patients with all metastases taking up FES prior to treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective: Compare the response rate after 6 months of hormone treatment (or a major change in hormone treatment) in metastatic breast cancer, according to the uptake of FES in metastatic lesions taking-up FDG on PET/CT at baseline. Secondary objectives: - evaluate diagnostic performance of FES PET/CT - determine whether FES PET/CT is able to detect metastases that are not visible on FDG PET/CT. This point may constitute a direct benefit for the patient - precise the nature of discordant FES/FDG foci - validate and improve the interpretation criteria for FES PET/CT - confirm the perfect tolerance</detailed_description>
