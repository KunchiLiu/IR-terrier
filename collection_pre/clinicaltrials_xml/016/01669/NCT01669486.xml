	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to find the best system for assessing the pain of critically ill patient in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). At first the investigators assess the sedation of the patient with the scale sedation-agitation scale (SAS) or the delirium with the confusion assessment method, if the patient is too sedated or delirious the investigators consider him unable to use the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). The investigators compare two different scales Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) which include no verbal items. Each items has been evaluated in three different moments: before, during and after the nurses' care. The investigators compare the scales between them. Then, every time the investigators value the score of these scales with the self-report of patients with the VAS scale (when it is possible) and finally with the physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate). In the end, the investigators compare two different classes of patient: the surgical and medical one. The investigators search for some differences in the perception of the pain between these two classes.</brief_summary>
