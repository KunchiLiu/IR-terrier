	<criteria>Patients aged 1875 yrs with acute respiratory failure due to ARDS or pneumonia fulfilling standard criteria for endotracheal intubation Severe and progressive hypoxemia, i.e. PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg or SaO2 &lt; 90% on O2 &gt; 10 l/min not tolerating noninvasive ventilation, or PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 not improving or deteriorating on noninvasive ventilation, or Respiratory distress and hypoxemia not fulfilling the criteria above with clinical impression of the ICU attending that intubation and mechanical ventilation are mandated Patient considered eligible by at least two investigators of this study Patient does not fulfill the inclusion criteria Uncontrolled malignancy Severe and untreatable coagulation or bleeding disorders (INR &gt; 2,0; aPTT &gt; 60s, Platelet count &lt; 50.000/Âµl, all after substitution) Stroke within the past 3 months Uncontrolled sepsis or septic shock Multiorgan failure involving &gt; 2 organ systems Norepinephrine dose &gt; 1 mg/h Hyperdynamic circulation, indicated by cardiac index &gt; 4.0 l/min/m2 (measured by PiCCO or SwanGanz catheter), or SvO2 &gt; 80% Cardiac pump failure, indicated by echocardiography (EF &lt; 40%), PiCCO or Swan Ganz catheter (CI &lt; 2,5 l/min/m2 despite adequate volume management), or SvO2 &lt; 50% (provided Hb &gt; 9,0 g/dl and SaO2 &gt; 90%), or the need for inotropes (dobutamine, epinephrine, levosimendan) Clinical or echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular dysfunction APACHEII score15 &lt; 25 Other conditions suggesting that the patient would benefit from intubation and mechanical ventilation Severe neurological disorders Estimated mortality due to severity of acute and/or underlying illness &gt; 50%</criteria>
