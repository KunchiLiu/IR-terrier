	<brief_summary>A randomised crossover trial of anti-hypertensive medication dosing regimen in effective blood pressure control. To investigate whether there is a difference in 24 hour blood pressure (BP) control when antihypertensive medications are taken in the morning compared with the evening. The identification of any significant difference could lead to more effective therapeutic management of arterial hypertension, which in turn would result in a reduced cardiovascular burden, lower costs and a better quality of life for hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
