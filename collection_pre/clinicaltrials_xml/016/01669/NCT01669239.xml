Subjects with other nonmammary malignancies must have been diseasefree for at least 5 years Known or suspected hypersensitivity reaction to any investigational or therapeutic compound or their incorporated substances Presence of CHF or LVEF &lt; 55% Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease, including cerebrovascular accident (&lt; 6 months before enrollment), unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months before enrollment, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg), or highrisk uncontrolled arrhythmias Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, active peptic ulcer disease, or uncontrolled epilepsy Active uncontrolled infection at the time of enrolment History of significant comorbidities that, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with the conduction of the study, the evaluation of response, or with informed consent Use of any investigational agent or participation in another therapeutic clinical trial concurrently or in the previous 30 days before the enrollment Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use acceptable contraceptive measures Inability or unwillingness to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the investigator or designee</criteria>
