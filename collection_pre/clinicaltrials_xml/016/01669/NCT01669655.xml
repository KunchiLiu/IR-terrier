	<detailed_description>The objectives of this study are (1) to characterize plasma lutein levels in breastfed infants in an Asian population where lactating mothers have diets habitually high in lutein and (2) investigate how blood lutein levels in breastfed infants vary according to lutein content of the mothers' milk in such a population.</detailed_description>
