	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the bone mineral density in male and female patients with HIV infection according to age groups. This will enable a practical approach to screening for osteoporosis and the management and prevention of fragility fractures in people with HIV. In addition, all risk factors commonly associated with fragility fractures and osteoporosis are collected, as is HIV drug history. Hence, as secondary outcomes, the associations with reduced bone mineral density can be ascertained.</brief_summary>
