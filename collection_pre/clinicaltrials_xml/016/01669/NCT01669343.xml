	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine how key patient factors, including body size affect how well letrozole suppresses circulating estrogen levels. This study has two components: (1) Part A - an observational phase to evaluate the impact of vitamin D and obesity on estrogen suppression in post-menopausal women already receiving letrozole treatment, and (2) Part B - an interventional phase for women with body mass index (BM) &gt; 25 kg/m2. If BMI or other patient factors reduce the effectiveness of letrozole, modifications to treatment recommendations and studies to test higher dosing of letrozole may be needed to maximize the benefit of this treatment and minimize the risk of the breast cancer coming back.</brief_summary>
