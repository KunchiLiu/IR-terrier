	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of an additional intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide in bulky advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-line Intraperitoneal Cisplatin and Etoposide Chemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory trial is to compare the efficacy of sequential chemotherapy, intraperitoneal chemotherapy followed by intravenous chemotherapy, versus intravenous chemotherapy alone in the first-line therapy for ovarian cancer.</detailed_description>
