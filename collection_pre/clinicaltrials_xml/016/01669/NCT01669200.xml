	<detailed_description>Twenty eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study that will consist of a baseline visit followed by six post-baseline visits. The control and placebo groups will each be comprised of ten subjects randomly assigned to the groups. The assessments at baseline will include concomitant medications, vital signs, height, and weight. In addition, subjects will complete a medical history questionnaire, and receive group instruction on incorporation of the study products into the diet from a registered dietitian. Study products will be dispensed at each visit in excess of requirements, and re-issued at every visit after measurement of the remaining product that subjects will be instructed to bring to every visit. The post-baseline study visits will include body weight and vital sign measurements, concomitant medications, dispensation of study products, group instruction by a registered dietitian, and an assessment for adverse events. Between study visits the subjects will receive a telephone call from the study coordinator to encourage compliance with the diet, and to ask about any adverse events. The study visits will conclude at week 24. The psychological tests conducted by clinicians at screening will be repeated during the cognitive testing visit.</detailed_description>
