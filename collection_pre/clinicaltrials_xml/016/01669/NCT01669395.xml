	<brief_title>Severe Heart Failure and Homebased Rehabilitation - An Intersectoral Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 400,000 Danes live today with heart disease. Disease severity is crucial for patients quality of life. Patients with severe heart disease often struggle with everyday life, characterized by reduced physical capacity, tendency to depression and anxiety to perform everyday activities that may provoke symptoms. A large proportion of patients who are offered cardiac rehabilitation deselect that offer. Of the patients who do participate, more than 50% stop the rehabilitation ahead of time. A large group of patients with severe heart failure and classified in NYHA Class III and IV, deselect the offer because of lack of energy to participate in cardiac rehabilitation or is when specified by a medical assessment discharged from the hospital without the offer of training or any other form of rehabilitation. The offer of rehabilitation for patients with severe heart failure is lacking as it is today. This study assesses the effectiveness of an early home based rehabilitation program that complements the general psycho-social support, symptom-oriented and preventive medical treatment that these patients always have the option to get.</detailed_description>
