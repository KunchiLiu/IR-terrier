	<brief_title>Mechanisms Underlying the Sleep Promoting Effect of Cherry Juice Standardized to Its Proanthocyanidin Content</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of 4 visits - 1 screening visit and 3 treatment visits. Screening visit will consist of a fasting chemistry panel, a health questionnaire, an Insomnia Severity Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Fatigue Severity Scale. Ten subjects passing screening will take for 2 weeks between dinner and bedtime in a blinded and balanced order: 1. Eight ounces of cherry juice standardized to its proanthocyanidin content in the morning and 8 ounces of cherry juice standardized to its procyanidin content 1-2 hours before bedtime for 14 days; 2. A similar amount of placebo juice with the same timing for the cross-over. There will be a 2-week washout between each of the treatment periods. Subjects will be scheduled for two overnight PSGs, one at the end of each two-week treatment period. On the morning following each test the insomnia severity index and other questionnaires will be repeated. The order of the placebo juice and cherry juice will be random and balanced.</detailed_description>
