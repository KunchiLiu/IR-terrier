	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective, multicentric cohort study of patient cases with cT1-3, N0 early breast cancer, who previously had intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay with a complete axillary dissection. The aim of the present study is to assess the intraoperative positive SLN total tumor load (TTL) obtained from the OSNA assay and to determine whether this TTL predicts non-SLN metastasis in patients with clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer.</brief_summary>
