	<brief_title>BIBF 1120 in Bevacizumab Resistant, Persistent, or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer patients with platinum-resistant and refractory disease have the lowest response rates to relapse chemotherapy: various chemotherapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, docetaxel, platinum, etoposide, ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine are available but result in response rates of 7-40%. Unfortunately, relapse therapy is not curative and treatment is only palliative. Recently two phase II trials demonstrated that anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in women with recurrent disease had response rates ranging from 16-24% with an acceptable toxicity profile. However, resistance can develop to VEGF inhibition. Therefore other novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as BIBF 1120, should be evaluated in the treatment of ovarian cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma w/ histologic documentation of the original primary tumor via the pathology report: serious, endometrioid, mucinous, or clear cell adenocarcinoma undifferentiated, mixed epithelial or transitional cell carcinoma Brenner's Tumor adenocarcinoma NOS Had treatmentfree interval following response to bevacizumab (CR, PR, or SD) of &lt; 6 months, or have progressed during treatment w/ a bevacizumabcontaining therapy Measurable or detectable disease. Measurable is defined by RECIST 1.1. Each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest xray. Lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI. Detectable defined as no measurable disease but either ascities/pleural effusion or solid/cystic abnormalities that don't meet RECIST 1.1 both within the setting of CA125 &gt;2xULN Those with measurable disease must have at least one "target lesion" to assess response as defined by RECIST 1.1. Tumors in a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions Must have a ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 Free of active infection requiring antibiotics. Exception: uncomplicated UTI Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be d/c at least a week prior to registration. Hormone replacement therapy is permitted Other prior therapy directed at malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be d/c at least 3 weeks prior to registration; 4 weeks if prior therapy was w/ bevacizumab Prior therapy must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound. This initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, highdose therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment. Allowed, to receive, but not required to receive, 2 additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following: Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinumbased regimen for management of primary disease), must have a platinumfree interval of less than 12 months, or have progressed during platinumbased therapy, or have persistent disease after a platinumbased therapy. Patients must NOT have received any noncytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease other than bevacizumab. Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen. Must have adequate: Bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcl, equivalent to (CTCAE v4.0) grade 1. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl. Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Renal function: creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Hepatic function: Bilirubin should be w/in normal limits (CTCAE v4.0, grade 1). ALT/AST, should be ≤ 1.5 x ULN (CTCAE v4.0, grade 1). For patients w/ liver metastases, ALT/AST should be ≤ 2.5 x ULN; Alkaline phosphatase should be ≤ 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE v4.0, grade 1) Neurologic function: Neuropathy ≤ CTCAE v4.0, grade 1 Blood coagulation parameters: PT w/ international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 x ULN &amp; a PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN (or an inrange PTT if on a stable dose of therapeutic heparin). Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin or alternative anticoagulants (other than warfarin)) are acceptable. Signed informed consent &amp; authorization permitting release of personal health information Negative serum pregnancy test if of childbearing potential prior to study entry &amp; use of effective form of contraception until 3 months after receiving last drug treatment Patients may have undergone a major or minor surgical procedure as long as: &gt; 28 days prior to the first date of study therapy Core biopsy or IV Port placement greater than 7 days prior to the first date of study therapy Previous treatment w/ BIBF 1120. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Received radiation to more than 25% of marrowbearing areas History of other invasive malignancies, w/ the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present w/in the last five years. Received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis OTHER THAN for treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer w/in the last 5 years. Prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor OTHER THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer or localized breast cancer w/in the last 5 years. A history of abdominal or trachealesophageal fistula, or gastrointestinal perforation A history of intraabdominal abcess w/in 6 months of enrollment Serious, uncontrolled, concomitant disorder(s) such as diabetes mellitus Patients w/ clinically significant cardiovascular disease including: uncontrolled hypertension: systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg/diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg; unstable angina or who have had a myocardial infarction w/in the past six months prior to registration; congestive heart failure; cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (doesn't include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation); grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease (at least brief (&lt;24 hours) episodes of ischemia managed nonsurgically &amp; w/o permanent deficit. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone factor. o Granulating incisions healing by secondary intention w/ no evidence of fascial dehiscence or infection ARE eligible but require weekly wound examinations.
