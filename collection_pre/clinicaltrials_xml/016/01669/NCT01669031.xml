	<brief_summary>Unreliability and visual field variability is a known problem with automated perimetry in both developing and developed country settings. This study will look at the effects of a computer program that allows new patients to practice the visual field exam before taking the actual exam. Our hypothesis is that the intervention group will have less variability as measured by mean deviation between exams and greater reliability as measured by the standard unreliability indexes of false positive rate, false negative rate, and fixation losses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial on Visual Field Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3 study visits. Visit 1: Baseline visit for consent, getting baseline data and finally randomizing the patient. Those randomized to intervention get their first session of simulated visual field (2 per eye) on a regular computer for training purposes. Visit 2: 1 to 2 days after baseline. The intervention group gets 1 practice test per eye. Then both groups get a regular automated visual field Visit 3: 1 to 2 weeks after baseline. The intervention group gets 1 practice test per eye. Then both groups get a regular automated visual field. Study Ends, patient gets seen by the patient.</detailed_description>
