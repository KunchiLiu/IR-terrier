	<brief_summary>Patients (UK only) at least 6 months post stroke, with upper limb deficits, may enroll. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups - a group implanted with a device that allows pairing VNS with rehabilitation and a group that only receives rehabilitation (no implant). Patients have two baseline evaluations, one evaluation after implant but before initiation of treatment, and then six weeks of rehabilitation or rehabilitation + VNS, followed by post acute therapy evaluations at 1, 7, and 30 days after the 6-weeks of treatment. The intent is to assess safety and provide preliminary effectiveness information for VNS for upper limb functional improvement after stroke. Implanted patients may receive longer-term treatment and follow-up after the acute study.</brief_summary>
