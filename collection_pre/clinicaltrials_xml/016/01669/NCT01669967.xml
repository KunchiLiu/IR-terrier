	<brief_summary>Pain as a result of nerve injury (neuropathic pain) is a particularly severe form of chronic pain. Common examples of neuropathic pain are pain due to diabetes and shingles. There is good evidence that an intravenous infusion of lidocaine (local anesthetic) is useful for the management of neuropathic pain in the short term - up to six hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Intravenous (IV) Lidocaine in the Management of Chronic Neuropathic Pain of Peripheral Nerve Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the role of intravenous lidocaine in the relief of neuropathic pain over four weeks following infusion compared to a salt water infusion. If we can show that intravenous lidocaine provides sustained benefit for up to one month, this will be a major advance in the management of individuals suffering from neuropathic pain.</detailed_description>
