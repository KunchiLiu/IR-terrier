	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate if serological parameters such as "extracellular Serum-Tryptase (ST)" and "eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP)" are useful for the diagnosis and surveillance of the eosinophilic esophagitis (EE).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Serological Markers for Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is chronic inflammatory and immunological disease. The diagnosis of EE is based upon large numbers of eosinophils in the esophagus on histopathologic examination (&gt; 20 eosinophils per high powered field in at least one specimen) despite acid suppression with a Proton-Pump-Inhibitor (PPI) for at least two weeks. There are no diagnostic serological markers for EE so far, so that the purpose of the study is to investigate serological markers which are established in other allergic diseases.</detailed_description>
