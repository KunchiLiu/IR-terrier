	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis that treatment with Erythropoietin (EPO) combined with Human Erythropoietin (HUO) therapy will result in hematologic improvement in thalassemia intermedia patients. Second is to determine whether any of the following correlate with improved hematologic response: A decrease in hemolysis, as assayed by a decrease in LDH, compared to baseline levels,baseline Erythropoietin levels,baseline hemoglobin levels and baseline reticulocyte counts (or % circulating nucleated erythroblasts/100 WBCs). Goal: The aim is to assess the possibility of steady increase of hemoglobin levels in thalassemia intermedia patients by at least 1g/dl above baseline levels during therapy using Hydroxyurea and Erythropoietin, growth evaluation,quality of life (QoL) and decline transfusion requirements during study period. Also to report and compare adverse events with other published data regarding.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine whether any of the following correlate with improved hematologic response: A decrease in hemolysis, as assayed by a decrease in LDH, compared to baseline levels,baseline Erythropoietin levels,baseline hemoglobin level and baseline reticulocyte counts (or % circulating nucleated erythroblasts/100 WBCs). To assess the possibility of steady increase of hemoglobin levels in thalassemia intermedia patients by at least 1g/dl above baseline levels during therapy using Hydroxyurea and Erythropoietin, growth evaluation , quality of life ( QoL ) and decline transfusion requirements during study period. Also to report and compare adverse events with other published data regarding. THE following criteria are used when including the patient in the study: Patients with thalassemia intermedia.Diagnosis based on genetic mutations, hemoglobin electrophoresis and characteristic clinical data at presentation. Patients requiring different transfusion requirements and not transfusion dependent.Patients having a baseline hemoglobin of less than or equal to 6-8g/dl.Patients with normal renal and liver function.</detailed_description>
