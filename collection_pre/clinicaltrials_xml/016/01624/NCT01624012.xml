	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare if a new noninvasive ventilation mode (NIV NAVA) is better in noninvasive ventilation of premature infants than currently used Nasal Continuous Airway Pressure (ncpap), and if NIV NAVA gives real benefits for patients or not. The investigators study hypothesis is that with NIV NAVA the invasive ventilation is more synchronous with patient, which will lead to a decrease in need of inspired oxygen.</brief_summary>
