	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study which will test the safety and feasibility of hypothermia treatment as adjunct therapy to conventional treatment of hyperammonemic encephalopathy (HAE) in neonates versus conventional treatment (dialysis, nutritional therapy, and ammonia scavenging drugs) only. The endpoint of the pilot study will be reached when either 24 patients have been enrolled and no serious adverse events were observed, when no patient has been enrolled in 5 years, or when serious adverse events occur which are clearly linked to the use of hypothermia. These would be serious complications not seen in patients on conventional therapy (dialysis , nutritional therapy, ammonia scavenging drugs) for HAE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study For Hypothermia Treatment In Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy In Neonates And Very Young Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with neonatal onset Urea Cycle Disorders or Organic Acidemias develop hyperammonemia (high ammonia levels) and fall into coma often causing brain damage. For these children to be able to benefit maximally from available long-term treatment and solid organ transplant, outcome of the neonatal onset crisis must be improved. Animal experiments and small clinical trials have indicated that hypothermia protects the brain during hyperammonemia. This pilot study investigates whether adjunct hypothermia therapy in addition to standard of care treatment is feasible and safe in babies with high ammonia levels in coma.</detailed_description>
