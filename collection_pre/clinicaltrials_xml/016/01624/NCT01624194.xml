	<brief_summary>Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by core deficits in social behavior and communication, and the presence of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum which affects an estimated 1 in 88 children in the United States. At present, pharmacotherapies target only associated features of autism, with no effective drug treatments for the social impairments. Several lines of evidence now suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) may be an effective treatment for the core social deficits in autism. Here we will test the effects of twice daily intranasal OT (24 IU) over a 4-week period for enhancing social deficits in male and female children aged 6-12 years with autism. This research has high potential to lead to the development of more effective treatments and earlier interventions for children with autism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors including attachment bonds, emotion recognition, eye gaze to social cues, and memory for social information. Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism, and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder. The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information. Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning, but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness. We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose (24IU) and following a 4-week period of OT (24IU BID) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years. The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior, as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) after the 4-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration. Research in a small study sample (N=13) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT. Thus, we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables (i.e., pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample. On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received. They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing. By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial, all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray. We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period. Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician.</detailed_description>
