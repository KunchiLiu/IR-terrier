If male, participants are surgically sterile or compliant with a highly effective contraceptive regimen during and for 6 months after the treatment period Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued a clinical trial involving an anticancer investigational product, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research Had therapeutic radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study therapy Have received necitumumab or any other monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) as the most recent prior treatment Have documented and/or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases Have a clinically relevant abnormality on the ECG, preventing an accurate measurement of the QT interval Have current clinicallyrelevant coronary artery disease or uncontrolled congestive heart failure Have medically uncontrolled angina pectoris, or has experienced myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the first dose of study therapy Have an implantable pacemaker or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator Have received sotalol within 10 days prior to the first dose of study therapy Have a history of risk factors for ventricular tachycardia or Torsades de pointes, history of fainting, unexplained loss of consciousness, or convulsions Have a history of heart failure, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, or hypomagnesia Have any evidence of conduction abnormality (eg, increased QRS complex) Have congenital long QT syndrome Have a prolonged QTc interval mean on pretreatment ECG Have a heart rate &lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 100 bpm at rest Are using a medication that is known to prolong the ECG QT interval, or have received a medication known to prolong the ECG QT interval within 14 days prior to first dose of study therapy Have a known allergy / history of hypersensitivity reaction to any of the treatment components, including any ingredient used in the formulation of necitumumab, or a known history of severe (Grade 34) hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody Have an ongoing or active infection (requiring treatment), including active tuberculosis or known infection with the human immunodeficiency virus If female, are pregnant or breastfeeding Have a history of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders, including dementia, seizures, or bipolar disorder</criteria>
