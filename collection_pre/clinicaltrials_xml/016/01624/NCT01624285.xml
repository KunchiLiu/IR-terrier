	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) is a safe and effective treatment option for preventing liver cancer in high risk patients following liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is a treatment option for liver cancer patients, but despite transplantation, the liver cancer can recur in the new, transplanted liver. It is not known whether sorafenib is effective in preventing cancer recurrence in high risk patients following liver transplantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Following a Liver Transplant in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Two-year recurrence free survival (RFS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. One-year recurrence free survival. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Safety. IV. Impact of drug-drug interactions (i.e. immunosuppression agents). V. Impact of biomarkers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], protein-induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II [PIVKA II]). VI. Effects of therapy on wound healing. VII. Impact of hepatitis C viral recurrence. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID. In both arms treatment continues for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with one of the following on explant: microvascular/macrovascular invasion, tumor outside of Milan criteria, poor tumor differentiation; patients with macrovascular invasion on explant pathology will be stratified * Additionally, the following will be included ** Patients with elevated surrogate markers (AFP &gt; 500 or PIVKA &gt; 400) pre transplant and with biopsy proven HCC prior to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) or on explant Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 02 Patients with a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks Patients must have completed prednisone taper within 6 weeks post OLT Patients must be enrolled between 6 to 12 weeks post OLT Cadaveric donors only (no living donor liver transplantation [LDLT] or donor after cardiac death transplantation [DCDT]) No sorafenib prior to inclusion in the study Platelet count &gt;

postmenopausal women (defined as no menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to undergo a pregnancy test Patients (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug; the definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate Patient must be able to swallow and retain oral medication Patient must exhibit the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent regarding the study and alternative treatments Significant ongoing immunologic rejection based on pathology and clinical diagnosis (from time of transplant until randomization) Use of T cell depleting agents for prevention or treatment of rejection at any point prior to or after enrollment in the study Patient with documented evidence of metastatic disease 100% tumor necrosis on explant pathology Use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors prior to transplant and as posttransplant immunosuppression Use of alemtuzumab Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) or donation after cardiac death transplant (DCDT) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence at the time of randomization Use of direct acting antivirals for HCV recurrence Requirement of retransplantation for primary non function Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;

patients surviving a cancer that was curatively treated and without evidence of recurrence for more than 3 years before randomization are allowed Presence of a nonhealing wound, nonhealing ulcer, or bone fracture Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, study drug classes, or excipients of the formulations given during the course of this trial Any malabsorption condition Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Inability to comply with the protocol and/or not willing or not available for followup assessments Patients with fibrolamellar HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, and combined HCCcholangiocarcinoma Any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable for trial participation Prior use of any systemic chemotherapy for HCC Prior use of systemic investigational agents for HCC Prior use of rafkinase inhibitors (sorafenib), VEGF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors or farnesyl transferase inhibitors Use of biologic response modifiers, such as granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF), will not be permitted within 3 weeks prior to study entry; GCSF and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity, such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the discretion of the investigator; however, they may not be administered to prevent a dose reduction;
