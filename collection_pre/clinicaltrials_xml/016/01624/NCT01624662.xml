	<criteria>Men or women aged 18 years and older Women must be practicing an effective method of birth control (eg, prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, doublebarrier method [eg, condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel], or male partner sterilization) before entry and throughout the study, or be surgically sterile (have had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation at least 1 year before screening) or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy, or be postmenopausal (spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 1 year). Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (BhCG) or urine pregnancy test (depending on local regulations) at the screening visit Must have bilateral nasal polyposis with a grade of 1 to 3 in each of the nasal cavities as determined by the Lildholdt scale score measured by nasoendoscopy at both screening and baseline visits Must have at least moderate symptoms of nasal congestion/obstruction as reported by the subject for the 7 day period preceding the screening visit At the baseline visit (Day 1), must have a morning score of at least 2 (moderate) on nasal congestion/obstruction recorded on the subject diary for at least 5 of the last 7 days of the 7 to up to 14 day runin period Must demonstrate an ability to correctly complete the daily diary during the runin period to be eligible for randomization Subjects with comorbid asthma or COPD must be stable with no exacerbations (eg, no emergency room visits, hospitalizations, or oral or parenteral steroid use) within the 3 months before the screening visit. Inhaled corticosteroid use must be limited to stable doses of no more than 1,000 μg/day of beclomethasone (or equivalent) for at least 3 months before screening with plans to continue use throughout the study. Must be able to cease treatment with intranasal medications including, but not limited to, intranasal steroids, intranasal sodium cromolyn, nasal atropine, nasal ipratropium bromide, inhaled corticosteroids (except permitted doses listed above for comorbid asthma and COPD) at the screening visit Must be able to cease treatment with oral and nasal decongestants and antihistamines at the screening visit Must be able to use the OptiNose device correctly; all subjects will be required to demonstrate correct use of the placebo device at screening, Visit 1. Must be capable, in the opinion of the investigator, of providing informed consent to participate in the study. Subjects must sign an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study. Women who are pregnant or lactating Have complete or nearcomplete obstruction of the nasal cavities Inability to achieve bilateral nasal airflow for any reason including nasal septum deviation Inability to have each nasal cavity examined for any reason including nasal septum deviation Nasal septum perforation Has had more than 1 episode of epistaxis with frank bleeding in the month before the screening visit Have evidence of significant baseline mucosal injury, ulceration or erosion (eg, exposed cartilage, perforation) on baseline nasal examination/nasal endoscopy History of more than 5 sinonasal surgeries for either nasal polyps or nasal/sinus inflammation (lifetime) History of sinus or nasal surgery within 6 months before the screening visit History of any surgical procedure that prevents the ability to accurately grade polyps Have symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at screening or baseline and/or, based on time of year, would anticipate onset of symptoms within 4 weeks of randomization Current, ongoing rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound rhinitis) Have significant oral structural abnormalities, eg, a cleft palate Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis History of ChurgStrauss syndrome or dyskinetic ciliary syndromes Purulent nasal infection, acute sinusitis, or upper respiratory tract infection within 2 weeks before the screening visit. Potential subjects presenting with any of these infections may be rescreened 4 weeks after symptom resolution Note: Subjects who are taking prophylactic antibiotics will be allowed to enter the study as long as they intend to continue the antibiotics for the duration of the study. Planned sinonasal surgery during the period of the study Allergy, hypersensitivity, or contraindication to corticosteroids or steroids Allergy or hypersensitivity to any excipients in study drug Exposure to any glucocorticoid treatment with potential for systemic effects (eg, oral, parenteral, intraarticular, or epidural steroids, high dose topical steroids) within 1 month before the screening visit; except as noted in inclusion criteria for subjects with comorbid asthma or COPD Have nasal candidiasis Have taken a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor within 14 days before the screening visit. History or current diagnosis of any form of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (ie, &gt;21 mmHg) History of intraocular pressure elevation on any form of steroid therapy History or current diagnosis of the presence (in either eye) of a cataract Any serious or unstable concurrent disease, psychiatric disorder, or any significant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator could confound the results of the study or could interfere with the subject's participation or compliance in the study A recent (within 1 year of the screening visit) clinically significant history of drug or alcohol use, abuse, or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's participation or compliance in the study Positive urine drug screen at screening visit for drugs of abuse, with the exception of prescribed medications for legitimate medical conditions Have participated in an investigational drug clinical trial within 30 days of the screening visit Employees of the investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study center, as well as family members of the employees or the investigator</criteria>
