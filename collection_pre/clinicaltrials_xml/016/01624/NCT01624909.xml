	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attacks pose a serious health risk to men and women, however little information is available about how evidence-based therapies are incorporated appropriately into routine clinical practice in China. In addition, basic data and evidence about safety and efficacy of treatment for AMI is limited. By consecutively recruiting AMI patients in 40 hospitals of different levels, this study will examine various real-life factors, that may affect patients recovery after a heart attack. Practical guidelines and risk model for AMI patients will be established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes in future finally.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>China PEACE-Prospective AMI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major concern in public health globally, as well as in China, and AMI is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Remarkable variations of resources available and health system performance have been noted, however little information is available about how evidence-based therapies are incorporated appropriately into routine clinical practice in China. In addition, basic data and evidence about safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of treatment for AMI during long-term recovery is limited. Practical and applied knowledge from large unselected population is needed to guide practice and policy for quality improvement and cost reduction. This study will enroll patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AMI consecutively in 20 tertiary hospitals and 20 secondary hospitals scattered all over China. At study entry, participants will be interviewed during their index hospitalization, to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests, medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted from medical records by well trained professional abstractors. At 1 month, 6 month, and 12 month after discharge, participants will return to the clinic for follow up visits, a face-to-face interview will be conducted to get information about clinical events, symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care during the recovery period. At 1-Month and 12-Month follow-up visit, blood and urine sample will be collected. Participants' blood samples will be stored for future biologic and genetic studies. This study will examine various real-life factors that may affect patients recovery after a heart attack, including patients' characteristics and treatment measures. Practical guidelines, quality evaluative system, and risk model for AMI patients will be established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes in future finally.</detailed_description>
