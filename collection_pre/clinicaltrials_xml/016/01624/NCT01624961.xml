	<brief_title>Controlled Human Malarial Infection by Intravenous Injection of Plasmodium Falciparum Sporozoites in Non-Immune Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TÜCHMI-001 is a single center, open label, randomized and controlled human pilot study to optimize controlled human malaria infection(CHMI) administered by PfSPZ Challenge. Volunteers will be inoculated with PfSPZ Challenge. Controls will receive the PfSPZ Challenge by ID administration. The remaining volunteers will receive the PfSPZ Challenge by IV administration. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults aged between 18 and 45 years. Safety and infectivity data will be collected for each of the regimens and dose-levels. Volunteers and clinical investigators will not be blinded to group allocation, however laboratory investigators processing blood films and samples for PCR analysis will be blinded to group allocation.</detailed_description>
