	<brief_title>Slowing HEART diSease With Lifestyle and Omega-3 Fatty Acids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: This is a randomized, parallel study design with a usual care control group. 278 subjects with coronary heart disease (CHD) are being randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention (exercise and nutrition counselling geared toward weight loss with omega-3 supplementation) or standard of care (139 in each arm). Multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) is performed at baseline to quantitate the amount of noncalcified and calcified coronary plaque and again at 30 month follow-up to determine if there has been a change in the volume of noncalcified or total plaque. The primary endpoint is change in coronary noncalcified plaque volume during the 30 months of intervention between active and standard of care. Hypothesis: Percent change in progression of coronary plaque volume will be less for the active lifestyle intervention compared to standard of care. Secondary endpoints include plasma levels of inflammatory markers, lipids and measures of insulin sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include testing the hypothesis that targeting inflammation with lifestyle will be associated with: 1. Change in total plaque volume per patient. 2. Improvement in the metabolic syndrome assessed by measures of waist/hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipid profiles (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL), and abdominal adiposity quantitated by computerized tomography. 3. Reduction of mediators of inflammation in the circulation including CRP, PAI-1, serum amyloid A, MMP-9 and fibrinogen, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-a and IL-1b, the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, increase in adiponectin and reduction in serum nitrotyrosine as a marker of oxidative stress. 4. Reduction of insulin resistance assessed by fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). 5. Reduction of inflammation in the liver associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a newly recognized component of the metabolic syndrome, and reduction of fatty liver quantitated by computerized tomography and levels of AST and ALT as markers of liver inflammation related to NASH. 6. Comparison of rates of addition of anti-hypertensive, diabetic, or lipid lowering medication. 7. Comparison of numbers of persons with metabolic syndrome who progress to diabetes between groups. 8. Comparison of numbers of persons who regress from ATPIII metabolic syndrome criteria. 9. Investigation of the relationship between vitamin D status and coronary calcification, as well as with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), beta-cell function (HOMA-%beta), and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, known to be related to CVD risk. 10. Determination of whether baseline vitamin D levels predict clinical response to the lifestyle intervention, and whether hypovitaminosis D is associated with plaque progression.</detailed_description>
