Subject is participating (or intends to participate) in another drug or device clinical trial that may influence the data that will be collected for this study Subject has previously undergone a spinal cord stimulation trial or is already implanted with an active implantable device(s) to treat their pain (Implantable Pulse Generators (IPGs), implantable drug pump, etc.) or pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator Patient is a woman who is not using adequate contraception, is pregnant or breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant during the course of the study (a urine pregnancy test must be performed within 28 days prior to the Trial Lead Insertion Visit in women of childbearing potential and the test result documented)</criteria>
