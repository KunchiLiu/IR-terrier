	<brief_summary>In the current study, the investigators propose to measure the five domains of social cognition identified by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) as relevant to individuals with psychosis (i.e., theory of mind, attribution style, emotion recognition, social perception, and social knowledge). The investigators will also explore the association between different domains of social cognition and outcomes relevant to psychotic disorder (e.g., symptomatology, social functioning, and vocational functioning).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There is growing evidence that individuals with longstanding psychotic disorders suffer from deficits in social cognition (i.e., the cognitive skills needed to successfully navigate social interactions). However, to date, there have been few attempts to measure multiple components of social cognition within the same population of individuals with psychosis. Thus, the interrelationships between various aspects of social cognition remain unclear. In the current study, the investigators propose to measure the five domains of social cognition identified by NIMH as relevant to individuals with psychosis (i.e., theory of mind, attribution style, emotion recognition, social perception, and social knowledge). The investigators will also explore the association between different domains of social cognition and outcomes relevant to psychotic disorder (e.g., symptomatology, social functioning, and vocational functioning).</detailed_description>
