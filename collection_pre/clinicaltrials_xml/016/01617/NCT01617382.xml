	<brief_title>Register With Patients in Which Hyperthermic Intra-Peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) Was Performed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To register the follow-up data of patients who, because of a peritoneal surface malignancy, will undergo cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. In this surgical intervention, the abdominal cavity is macroscopically cleared of tumor, by removing all visible tumor nodules, and is subsequently rinsed with hyperthermic (heated) chemotherapy, aiming to destroy all residual invisible tumor cells that might have stayed behind after the debulking. The eventual aim of this procedure is to improve the prognosis/survival of patients with malignancies localized on the peritoneal surface.</detailed_description>
