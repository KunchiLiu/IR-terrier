	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of hyperbilirubinemia following major cardiac or thoracic aorta surgery, and to determine the clinical impacts of the hyperbilirubinemia on postoperative mortality and morbidity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperbilirubinemia After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receiving elective cardiac or thoracic aorta surgery will be monitored for the development of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia. Collection of data will include patient baseline demographic characteristics, laboratory and echocardiographic findings, procedural factors of the surgery, and early postoperative variables. Serial postoperative liver function testings will be done during the hospitalization. Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia is defined as serum bilirubin level of 3mg/dL.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged over 18 years who are scheduled to undergo elective major cardiac or thoracic aorta surgery. Major cardiac surgery includes coronary artery bypass grafting, pericardiectomy and corrections of cardiac diseases using cardiopulmonary bypassing (valve surgery, tumor excision, arrhythmia surgery, heart transplantation, ventricular reconstruction, pulmonary thromboembolectomy, and atrial or ventricular septal defects closure). 1. univentricular or oneandhalf ventricle repairs 2. presence of known liver cirrhosis or hepatic cancer 3. history of liver transplantation 4. Genetic diseases that affects bilirubin metabolism (i.e. Gilbert syndrome) 5. preoperative bilirubin level of 3mg/dL or more.</criteria>
