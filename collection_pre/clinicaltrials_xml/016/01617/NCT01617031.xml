	<brief_title>Aspirin Twice Daily in Diabetic Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have previously demonstrated that there was a time-dependant efficacy of aspirin on platelet function. In this study, we investigate platelet function (fundamental research) according to the delay since last aspirin intake (12 vs 24 hours)in a population of diabetic patients with previous Coronary Artery Disease routinely treated with aspirin. In order to eliminate any variation linked to a cumulative dose effect of aspirn, platelet function is assessed 24 hours after a single 150 mg aspirin intake or 12 hours after a 75 mg aspirin intake given twice per day (corresponding to the same total dose of 150 mg /day). Light transmission aggregometry triggered by arachidonic acid 0.5mg/mL (LTA-AA) is the main endpoint of the study (intensity and velocity of agregation following exposure to arachidonic acid 0.5 mg/ml).</detailed_description>
