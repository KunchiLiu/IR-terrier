	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of simvastatin and L-carnitine coadministration versus simvastatin, L-Carnitine monotherapy on liver enzymes ( AST,ALT ) and liver elasticity in NASH patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of disease ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) to cirrhosis. Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. They occupy a portion of the binding site of HMG CoA, blocking access of this substrate to the active site on the enzyme. A reduction in intrahepatic cholesterol leads to an increase in LDL receptor turnover that results from an enhanced rate of hepatic LDL receptor cycling. On the other hand recent studies have implicated several important cellular processes and signaling pathways that are affected by abnormal lipid metabolism, resulting in specific biochemical, histological, and clinical changes associated with NAFLD. Maybe statins, as lipid lowering agents, and through their effect in reduction of intrahepatic cholesterol, can affect the abnormal lipid metabolism in NASH. L- carnitine, can improve the outcome of NASH, because it reduces lipid levels, limits oxidative stress, and modulates inflammatory responses . It performs a number of essential intracellular and metabolic functions, such as fatty acid transport, detoxification of potentially toxic metabolites, regulation of the mitochondrial acyl-Co A / CoA ratio, and stabilization of cell membranes. It has a pivotal role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane.</detailed_description>
