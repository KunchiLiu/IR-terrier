	<brief_summary>Objective: To monitor and evaluate the change of intracranial hemodynamics and MCA stenosis after 24-week atorvastatin treatment using CEUS, CTA and DSA. Study design: Total 30 patients (60 arteries) will be enrolled in this study, who had MCA infarction within 6 months prior to screening, and has not received any statins treatment before stroke. Eligible patient will receive atorvastatin 40mg treatment for 24 weeks. Hemodynamics changes and MCA stenosis will be evaluated using CEUS at baseline, 3-month,and 6-month. MCA stenosis, bloodstream velocity, as well as clinical symptoms will be assessed at each visit and compared to baseline.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cerebral infarction resulted from medially and heavily narrow MCA is determined by the three-type screen method .For the first screen cerebral infarction patients of MCA area who has the stroke or TIA history In 6 months are determined by the clinic stroke measure table,transstadial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) carotid ultrasonography and skull CT. For the second the MAC area infarction and vessel narrow are determined by the skull magnetic resonance (MRI) and magnetic resonance vessel imaging (MRA) and the MCA trend bloodstream dynamics feature and narrow extent Are observed by the strengthened ultrasonography (CEVS) For the third, The MCA narrow extent is measured by the DSA test which is currently regarded as a gold standard and /or by the CTA .The atorvastatin 20mg Treatment is given to the patients who all use the antiplatelet medicine The clinic symptom improvement MCA narrow extent and bloodstream velocity are dynamically observed visited and analysed respectively at the basic line 3 and 6 months after treatment</detailed_description>
