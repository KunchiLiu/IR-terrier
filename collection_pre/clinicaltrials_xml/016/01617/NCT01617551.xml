	<brief_summary>Catheter based renal denervation (CRD) in humans represents a promising new treatment of resistant hypertension. CRD is currently investigated as a treatment option in patients with resistant hypertension defined as at least 3 antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic) in a randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter trial in Denmark (ReSet). In ReSet, patients are randomized to either CRD or a sham procedure with 6 months follow up. The mechanisms by which CRD reduce blood pressure are only partly understood and the interaction between renal sympathetic nerves and nitric oxide (NO) has not been investigated in humans. To Study the interaction between NO and renal sympathetic nerves, we designed the present substudy, where the effects of NO-inhibition on renal, hemodynamic and hormonal variables are studied before and after CRD.</brief_summary>
