	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to compare, in a group of at-risk individuals, the role of three dietary patterns on indices of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk: a) the recommended Korean pattern; b) the typical American diet, based on national dietary intake surveys; and c) the 2010 DGA diet pattern. A secondary aim will be to assess the effects of each diet on intestinal microbiota and on inflammatory biomarkers.</brief_summary>
