	<brief_summary>The aim of the project is to investigate the effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formed in food during the cooking process as well as AGEs formed naturally in the human body, on insulin sensitivity and risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that i) food content of AGEs is lower using boiling and steaming cooking methods and that ii) AGEs formation in the body is lower at low dietary intake of certain sugar forms.</brief_summary>
