	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase II trial comparing azacitidine monotherapy with combined azacitidine and vorinostat in patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or high risk myelodysplastic syndromes ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Study of Azacitidine Versus Azacitidine With Vorinostat in Patients With AML or High Risk MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is a common haematological malignancy. As a result of improvements in myelosuppressive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, the outcome of children and young adults with AML has improved substantially in the past three decades. By contrast there has only been limited progress in the development of new treatments for older adults in whom long term survival is less than 20% at present. There is an urgent need to develop more effective treatment options for the treatment of AML and high risk MDS in older adults. Accumulating evidence suggests that Azacitidine is a potentially important treatment modality in newly diagnosed, relapsed/refractory AML and high risk MDS. Phase II trials in AML and MDS demonstrate increased clinical activity of azacitidine when combined with a HDACi. However no randomised trials have yet examined the important question of whether concurrent HDACi administration increases the clinical activity of Azacitidine. Vorinostat is a new HDACi which shows significant clinical activity in combination with Azacitidine in patients with AML and MDS. We therefore propose a randomised trial of azacitidine compared with azacitidine and vorinostat combination therapy in older adults with newly diagnosed, relapsed, refractory AML or high risk MDS ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. This will represent the first randomised trial, addressing whether there is a clinical benefit to be gained from combining treatment with azacitidine with a HDACi in patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, refractory AML or high risk MDS for whom limited therapeutic options currently exist.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults with AML (except Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL)) as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Classification or patients with high risk MDS categorised as INT2 or high risk according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) who are deemed ineligible for intensive chemotherapy on the grounds of age or comorbidities with ONE of the following disease status: i) Newly diagnosed OR ii) Relapsed Disease: patients must have achieved a previous morphological CR and show evidence of recurrent disease OR iii) Refractory Disease: patients who have failed to achieve a morphological CR with previous therapy Patients are able to receive treatment as outpatient Adequate renal and hepatic function as defined in the Protocol Patients have given written informed consent ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 Patients with greater than class III NYHA cardiac impairment Blastic transformation of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia Prior allogeneic/autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant Pregnant or lactating women Adults of reproductive potential not willing to use appropriate, effective, contraception during the trial and for specified amount of time afterwards Patients who have received prior histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) treatment as antitumour therapy. (Patients who have received HDACi treatment for other indications e.g valproic acid for epilepsy may enrol after a 30day washout period) Previous antitumour therapies, including prior experimental agents or approved antitumour small molecules and biologics, within 30 days before the start of protocol treatment. (Patients receiving antitumour therapies to control blood counts may enrol into the trial) Patients who have received prior treatment with demethylating agents such as 5azacitidine or decitabine Patients with contraindications to receiving azacitidine or vorinostat such as hypersensitivity, patients unable to have a subcutaneous injection or swallow oral capsules Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial, and/or viral infection including known active HIV or known viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis Any comorbidity that could limit compliance with the trial</criteria>
