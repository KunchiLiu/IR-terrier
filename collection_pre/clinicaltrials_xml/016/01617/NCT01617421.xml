	<brief_summary>Background: - People with arthritis should be active. Regular exercise leads to less pain, more energy, improved sleep, and better day-to-day function. Yet arthritis is one of the most common reasons people give for limiting activities. - Yoga for arthritis has been studied before. However, few studies have included minorities. Making changes to yoga classes based on language and culture may help people use yoga to care for their arthritis symptoms. Researchers want to see if minority populations with arthritis will come to and benefit from yoga classes. Objectives: - To see if yoga classes designed for people with arthritis will be acceptable to minorities with arthritis. Eligibility: - Adults at least 18 years of age who are enrolled in the Natural History of Rheumatic Disease in Minority Communities study. - Participants will have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. - Participants will be able to speak and read English or Spanish. Design: - The total study period covers 10 weeks. - The first study visit will include an initial questionnaire about health and arthritis. Participants will also have a physical exam. - Participants will have yoga classes twice a week for 8 weeks. The classes will be 1 hour long each. - After completing the yoga classes, participants will complete another questionnaire about their health. They will have a final physical exam. - Follow-up contact will be made 3 months after the end of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yoga as Self-Care for Arthritis in Minority Communities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Arthritis is the most common cause of disability, and is associated with activity limitation, work disability and significant health care costs. Approximately 50 million US adults have doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics have worse arthritis impact despite having the same or lower prevalence of arthritis compared to non-Hispanic whites. People with arthritis who exercise regularly have less pain, more energy, improved sleep and better day-to-day function. Yet, arthritis is one of the most common reasons for limiting physical activity. Improving health quality for people with chronic disease requires patients to take responsibility for their own care. Self-efficacy enhancing interventions may enable individuals to undertake self-care activities that improve physical and mental well-being. Attention is now being focused on complementary and integrated non-pharmacologic self-care approaches. Yoga is among the top 10 complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities. Stretching, strength, posture, balance, and the ability to adjust pace and intensity are important safety components for patients with arthritis, all of which yoga encompasses. Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Yoga users are predominately white, female, and college educated. In a descriptive study of patients enrolled in the Natural History of Rheumatic Disease in Minority Communities protocol only 4.6% were doing yoga. These disparities may be related to cost, access, and cultural beliefs. There are few studies that examine yoga in minority populations; none of these address arthritis. Study Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis. Secondary Objective: To determine the appropriateness of specific physical and psychosocial measures for this population, and intervention with a focus on physical function and patient reported measures. Tertiary Objective: To determine the feasibility of using computerized self-interview (with assistance) to capture baseline and final status. Eligibility: Adult patients (18 years or older) enrolled in the Natural History of Rheumatoid Disease in Minority Communities protocol with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Design: A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a study based on a yoga intervention for arthritis in minority communities. Assessments will be made from a convenience sample of 20 RA/OA participants and 5 SLE participants undergoing an 8-week program of yoga classes consisting of 60-minute sessions, twice a week. The yoga classes are designed especially for people with arthritis.</detailed_description>
