	<brief_summary>Alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). Primary Objective of the study: To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after 24 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab in comparison with placebo on LDL-C at other time points - To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab</brief_summary>
