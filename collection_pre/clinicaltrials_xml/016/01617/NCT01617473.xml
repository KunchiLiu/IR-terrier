	<brief_summary>The use of peripheral blood stem cells(PBSCs) is rapidly growing in the allogeneic transplantation setting as an alternative to bone marrow (BM).It was found that the use of PBSCs is associated with faster hematologic recovery but have yielded differing results regarding the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and relapse. The study hypothesis: transplantation of mobilized PBSC to haploidentical donor with standard-risk leukemia had comparable engraftment and non-relapse mortality to mobilized BM combined with PBSCs</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Mobilized Blood/Marrow Versus Blood Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The donors were primed with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) injected subcutaneously for five consecutive days. In the trial group, the PBSCs were harvested on the fourth and fifth day;in the control group, the bone marrow cells were harvested on the fourth day and the PBSCs were harvested on the fifth day.</detailed_description>
