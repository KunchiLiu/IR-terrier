	<brief_summary>Central nervous system (CNS) invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a fatal complication in immunocompromised patients. Confirming the diagnosis is rarely accomplished as invasive procedures are hampered by neutropenia and low platelet count. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures or galactomannan (GM) regularly yield negative results thus suggesting the need for improving diagnostics. Therefore the performance of an established Aspergillus-specific nested PCR in CSF samples of immunocompromised patients with suspicion of CNS IA will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central nervous system (CNS) invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a fatal complication in immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies. Confirming the diagnosis is rarely accomplished as invasive procedures are impaired by neutropenia and low platelet count. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures or galactomannan (GM) regularly yield negative results thus suggesting the need for improving diagnostic tools. Therefore the performance of an established Aspergillus-specific nested PCR assay in CSF samples of immunocompromised patients with suspicion of CNS IA will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
