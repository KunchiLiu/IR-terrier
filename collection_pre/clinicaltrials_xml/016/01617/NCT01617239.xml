	<brief_title>Clinical Study for Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Virosomal influenza vaccine is usually administered intramuscularly as a single 0.5 mL dose. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different doses and vaccination schedules. A total of 84 healthy adults aged 18-50 years will be randomized (1:1:1) into 3 treatment groups: subjects of group 1 will receive a standard dose (0.5 mL) at Days 1, 29, and 57; subjects of group 2 will receive a double dose (1.0 mL) at Day 1 and a standard dose (0.5 mL) at Day 57; subjects of group 3 will receive a triple dose (0.5 mL) at Day 1. Local and systemic solicited adverse events up to Day 4 after each vaccination will be documented. To assess the subjects' humoral and cellular immune response against homologous and heterologous virus strains, blood will be drawn from each participant at baseline (Day 1), at the 4 subsequent monthly visits (Months 1 to 4) and at Month 12.</detailed_description>
