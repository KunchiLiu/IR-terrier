	<brief_title>Therapeutic Efficacy of Tiludronic Acid on Inner Ear Involvement in Advanced Otosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Otosclerosis is a bone dystrophy localized to middle and inner ears with unknown etiology. It principally concerns adult patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Women present with this disease 2 times more frequently than men. Family cases are observed in 50% with a dominant autosomal transmission and low penetrance (40%). In its early stages, the disease is mainly located at the stapediovestibular joint leading to its ankylosis and a conductive hearing loss. In its advanced stages, the lesions extend around the cochlea and vestibule, induce a sensorineural hearing loss which can progress to severe and profound deafness, and prolonged balance disorders. On CT-scan, disease foci show a demineralization. Their density is inversely correlated to the hearing loss. In early stage, hearing function is currently rehabilitated by conventional hearing aids or surgery. In advanced forms, cochlear involvement is not accessible to surgery, and rehabilitation is insured by he hearing aids or cochlear implants. Vestibular dysfunction is dealt with by physiotherapy or symptomatic treatment. Drugs with anabolic activity in bone, such as sodium fluoride and etidronate (first generation bisphosphonate, Didronel ®), appear to reduce the hearing loss and to increase the radiological density of disease foci. However, their efficacy is low and poorly documented. Their effect on vestibular function is unknown. Moreover, ototoxicity has been reported for etidronate. New biphosphonates such as tiludronic acid (Skelid ®) have a significantly more potent inhibition of bone resorption and do not have an ototoxic effect. They have been used for the treatment or the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and in Paget's disease with mild to moderate adverse effects in the majority of cases.</detailed_description>
