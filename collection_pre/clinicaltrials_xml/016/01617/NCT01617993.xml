	<brief_title>Eeva™ Continued Access Study: Assessing the Usability of Eeva in a Clinical Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the use of Eeva by IVF laboratory staff during routine procedures. The fertilized eggs will be placed in an Eeva dish and the development of the embryos will be monitored by the Eeva system in a standard incubator. On day 3 of embryo culture, Eeva blastocyst prediction data will be printed from the system to be used to assist the embryologist in selecting the best embryo(s). The performance of the system will be summarized and the user feedback from the embryologists will be collected.</detailed_description>
