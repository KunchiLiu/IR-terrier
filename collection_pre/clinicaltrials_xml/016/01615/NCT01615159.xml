	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to assist the general public in achieving and maintaining the currently recommended sodium intake of 1500 mg/day through a reduced sodium intervention that emphasizes spices and herbs. The investigators hypothesize that after four weeks of eating a controlled diet, individuals will acclimate and adhere to a reduced sodium intake of 1500 mg/day and their taste preferences will change. The investigators also hypothesize that individuals in a low sodium behavioral intervention will maintain greater adherence to a dietary sodium intake of â‰¤ 1500 mg/day than individuals in a self-directed control group.</brief_summary>
