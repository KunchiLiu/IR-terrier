	<brief_summary>Sucrose is the most used sweetener in beverage and foods in Denmark. Other sweeteners with other composition and amount of carbohydrates could be of interest in order to decrease the glucose and insulin responses after intake of a sweetened beverage/food. Malt extract has a sweet flavor but contains a different composition and amount of carbohydrates together with a small amount of protein compared to sucrose. Malt extract may therefore be a better alternative than sucrose as a sweetener due to a lower increase and more sustained blood glucose level. This could be of interest in relation to diabetes and appetite regulation but this is yet to be investigated. Thus the objective is to investigate the effect of malt extract vs. sucrose on: 1. 3-hour change in the concentration of glucose and insulin 2. 3-hour change in subjective appetite sensations (Visual Analogue Scales, VAS scores) 3. Ad libitum energy intake Design: 20 men will participate in the 2-way, randomized, double-blind crossover study. The test drinks is isocaloric with 75 g carbohydrates Test drinks: malt extract solution and sucrose solution (10%) Three-hour subjective appetite ratings and blood samples will be assessed every half-hour. Subsequently, the subjects will served an ad libitum lunch</brief_summary>
