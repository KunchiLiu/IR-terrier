	<brief_summary>Previous animal studies have found that resveratrol supplementation significantly increased aerobic capacity. The investigators conducted a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study to assess whether resveratrol could provide similar benefits in humans. All participants were assigned to two 4-week treatment periods, with a 2 week washout in-between. During one period, volunteers in received resveratrol and during the other period, they received identical-appearing placebo. The primary outcome of interest was change in exercise capacity, as measured by change in exercise duration on constant load exercise testing and change in aerobic capacity (peak VO2) on incremental exercise testing. Secondary outcomes were tolerability and side-effects associated with resveratrol.</brief_summary>
