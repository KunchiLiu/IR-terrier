	<brief_summary>In menstruation an effective shedding of the endometrial lining occurs. Both progesterone and estrogen levels fall sharply at this time. During medical abortion the endometrial shedding is sometimes ineffective causing an incomplete abortion which may cause prolonged bleeding or require surgical intervention. In medical abortion a progesterone antagonist is used as treatment but the estrogen levels are not targeted. The investigators wish to explore whether addition of letrozole or trilostane which target estrogen levels can lead to a more effective shedding of the endometrial lining.</brief_summary>
