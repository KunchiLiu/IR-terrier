	<brief_summary>The study is designed to find out more about how mood and the nervous system affect the body's immune system. The investigators plan to study this in people who have been identified by their physician as being at-risk for the development of heart failure. There will be approximately 525 individuals participating in this study at UCSD and at the VASDHS. Individuals who will be asked to take part in this study will have a functional or structural heart problem apparent on an echocardiogram, or a previous heart attack, but no symptoms of heart failure. Some individuals will only complete one assessment (consisting of psychological questionnaires and interview, walk test, blood draw, and body measurements), whereas others deemed "high-risk" on the basis of a laboratory test, will be asked to complete that same assessment every 6 months for the duration of the study.</brief_summary>
