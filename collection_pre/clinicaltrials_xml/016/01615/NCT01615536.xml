	<brief_title>The Role of Canine Fossa Trephination in the Severely Diseased Maxillary Sinus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic sinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps and thick mucin in the sinuses adversely affects results from endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) because failure to clear the disease leads to ongoing inflammation and symptoms. In particular a subset of CRS patients with thick eosinophilic mucin (EMCRS) develop recurrent symptoms and require further surgeries. ESS techniques for the maxillary sinus requires a WMA in the side wall of the sinus and the use of curved debrider instruments to clear the polyps. Sometimes this doesn't provide access to the inferior/floor and anterior/front aspects of the maxillary sinus due to the fact that the maxillary sinus is on the side of the nasal cavity at an angle. The CFT through the front wall of the sinus was developed years ago as an alternative approach to improve access to these areas. Both techniques are acceptable standard treatments and which one is initially used to address the maxillary sinus currently depends on surgeon preference. The role of CFT has been studied by Sathanatar et al (Laryngoscope 2005) and Lee et al (Laryngoscope 2008) which provided conflicting results. Differences in their study patients and methodology could explain the different outcomes. Hence this study is proposed to clarify the role of CFT in patients with extensive maxillary sinus disease to see whether initial use of CFT is more helpful than WMA in the severely diseased maxillary sinus with polyps and mucin. Findings from this study may improve surgical outcomes for CRS patients in the future.</detailed_description>
