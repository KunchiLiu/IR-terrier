	<brief_title>Daratumumab in Combination With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed and Relapsed-refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is conducted in two parts. The dose escalation portion of the trial (Part 1) participants are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of daratumumab in combination with Len/Dex in 28 day treatment cycles. Part 2, the cohort expansion part of the trial, will further explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or the maximum tested dose) of daratumumab as determined in Part 1.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(Part 1) Have relapsed multiple myeloma after receiving a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 prior lines of therapy and be eligible for treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Len/Dex) (Part 2) Have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for multiple myeloma Be older than or be 18 years of age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (02) Provide signed informed consent after receipt of oral and written information about the study and before any studyrelated activity is performed Have previously received an allogenic stem cell transplant Have received autologous stem cell transplant within 12 weeks before the first infusion Have received antimyeloma treatment, radiotherapy, or any experimental drug or therapy within 2 weeks before the first infusion Have discontinued lenalidomide due to any treatmentrelated adverse event or be refractory to any dose of lenalidomide. Refractory to lenalidomide is defined as either, participants whose disease progresses within 60 days of lenalidomide, or participants whose disease is nonresponsive while on any dose of lenalidomide. Nonresponsive disease is defined as either failure to achieve at least an minimal response (MR) or development of progressive disease (PD) while on lenalidomide</criteria>
