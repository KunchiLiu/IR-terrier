	<brief_summary>A common practice for preparation for surgical abortion after 19 weeks gestation is the placement of multiple sets of osmostic dilators 1-2 days prior to the procedure. The investigators aim to study the addition of mifepristone as an adjunct to cervical dilation prior to abortion between 19-24 weeks gestation, and its potential to minimize the number of painful procedures and time in clinic (or away from work/home) that multiple sets of dilators can require. The investigators hypothesize that one set of dilators with mifepristone will result in similar procedure times and decreased "total" time as two sets of dilators.</brief_summary>
