	<brief_summary>In this study, typical cases of blood stasis syndrome of coronary heart disease are selected, by using microRNA chip, cDNA microarray and other bioinformatics technologies to filter and verify related miRNA and its target gene of Coronary Heart disease. Meanwhile, intervene by Xuesaitong soft capsules to investigate related miRNA and its target gene of Coronary Heart disease.</brief_summary>
