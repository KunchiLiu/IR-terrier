	<brief_title>EnSite NavX-Guided Coronary Sinus Mapping During CRT Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective(s): To determine the feasibility of CS mapping with NavX during Biventricular Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (BiV ICD) implantation. Inclusion Criteria: - Subject is between the age of 18 and 75 years - Subject is willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent - Subject is able to fulfill study requirements - Meet the conventional criteria for implant of a BiV ICD, including; LVEF of ≤35%, QRS ≥ 120 ms and NYHA III-IV - Have persistent CHF symptoms despite contemporary CHF medical therapy - Stable and optimal medical therapy (stability is no changes in past 3 months). - Documented history of ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Exclusion Criteria: - Have any standard device exclusions including tricuspid valve prosthesis/ replacement. - Have a positive urine or serum pregnancy test (if female and of childbearing potential) - Be currently participating in an IDE or IND study.</detailed_description>
