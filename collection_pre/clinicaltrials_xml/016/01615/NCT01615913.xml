	<brief_summary>This study is to explore the optimization of anti‐onychomycosis patch with various formulation contents (three patch groups: 3%, 6% and 8% of terbinafine (contains 3‐mg, 6‐mg and 8‐mg/patch terbinafine, respectively) combined with fixed 2% ketoconazole (contains 2‐mg ketoconazole/patch) and its safety profile.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing the Treatment of Toenail Onychomycosis Using a New Transdermal Patch Combined With Terbinafine/Ketoconazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to explore the optimization of anti‐onychomycosis patch with various formulation contents (three patch groups: 3%, 6% and 8% of terbinafine (contains 3‐mg, 6‐mg and 8‐mg/patch terbinafine, respectively) combined with fixed 2% ketoconazole (contains 2‐mg ketoconazole/patch) and its safety profile. At least 18 patients (age: 20 to 75 years old) with one or two feet toenails infected simultaneously need to complete the whole study. Patients will be assigned to one of patch groups. The patients with only one infected toenail will also apply one patch on other foot with uninfected toenail. The patch will be applied on the foot on the dorsal site and leave it there for two consecutive days. Totally six patches will be used for each week. The duration of therapy will be 24 weeks. The patients' blood sample and toenail clippings will be collected every 8 weeks and will be analyzed as well as the safety profiles. The most appropriate patch formulation will be selected on the drug content residues in toenail. The safety profile will be also presented and discussed with various anti‐onychomycosis patch formulations.</detailed_description>
