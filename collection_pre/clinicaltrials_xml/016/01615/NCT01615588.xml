	<brief_summary>Five high methylglyoxal (460-667 mg/kg) Manuka honey samples were selected from different geographical locales around the North Island of New Zealand and tested for glycaemic index (GI) in 10 healthy volunteers in a single-blinded, randomised study. Participants were fed honey containing 25g of available carbohydrate in 200 ml water and the blood glucose responses measured (area under the curve; AUC) and compared to that of 25 g of available carbohydrate from glucose.</brief_summary>
