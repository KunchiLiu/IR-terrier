	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety of transplanting lungs obtained from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) that have been ventilated (attached to a breathing machine or ventilator to deliver oxygen) and perfused with a lung perfusion solution (Steen solution™, made by Vitrolife). This ventilation and perfusion will be done outside the body (ex-vivo) in a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (the kind of device used routinely during most heart surgeries). The purpose of performing ex-vivo perfusion and ventilation is to learn how well the lungs work, and whether they are likely safe to transplant.</brief_summary>
