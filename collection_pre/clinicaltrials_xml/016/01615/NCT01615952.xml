	<brief_summary>Blockade of the brachial plexus using a supraclavicular approach provides excellent anesthesia for upper extremity surgery. The most serious complication specific to this block is pneumothorax. Subsequent modifications of this block including the use of ultrasound have lowered the risk from 6% to &lt;1%. Case reports remain and authors have described certain factors and strategies to reduce this risk. Most texts and journals describe the patient in a supine or semi-sitting position during the block. At the investigators institution the investigators perform the block in a semi-sitting position to facilitate needle tip visibility with ultrasound. The investigators plan to obtain ultrasound anatomic measurements in three different positions (supine, semi-sitting, sitting) using patients consented for supraclavicular nerve blocks.</brief_summary>
