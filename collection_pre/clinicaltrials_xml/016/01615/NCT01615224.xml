	<brief_summary>Missed abortion is a condition where the fetus has perished but the miscarriage is not expelled. Women often present at a routine ultrasound or with a slight brownish discharge. Traditionally this condition has been treated with curettage or vacuum aspiration. Lately, medical treatment has become more common due to less risk of infection and other complications. The routine medical treatment is 800mcg of misoprostol administered vaginally. We wish to examine of repeated doses of 400mcg misoprostol after the initial 800mcg vaginal misoprostol increases efficacy of the treatment.</brief_summary>
