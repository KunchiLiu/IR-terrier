	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women and is the most common endocrine syndrome.PCOS is associated with infertility, risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The elevated insulin characteristic of PCOS is likely to play a major role in its symptoms. restricted calorie High protein diet and mediterranean diet may improve insulin sensitivity and therefore lower androgen production in women with pcos women.the purpose of this study is to determine which diet is more effective in improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Mediterranean Diet and High Protein Diet in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous syndrome affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by elevated circulating insulin, reduced insulin sensitivity, infertility, hyperandrogenism, and a multitude of symptoms that result in a decreased quality of life. The elevated insulin characteristic of PCOS is likely to play a major role in its pathogenesis by reducing insulin sensitivity and stimulating excess androgen production hence causing an hormonal imbalance. Low calories diets have shown to improve pcos symptoms but the optimal diet for all pcos women is still unknown. In this study, our purpose is to compare two lowering insulin restricted calories diets in order to find the optimal diet for improving metabolic and endocrin outcomes in pcos women we will also investigate which diet has the best long lasting compliance.</detailed_description>
