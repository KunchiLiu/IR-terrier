	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis is that plastic bags used in combination with WHO thermoregulation care will reduce the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight and full term infants when compared to routine WHO thermoregulation care alone. Part I is for preterm/low birth weight infant with or without plastic head cover used during resuscitation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Use of Plastic Bags to Prevent Neonatal Hypothermia-Part I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia during the first hour after birth in preterm/low birth weight infants randomized to receive WHO thermoregulation care and a plastic bag (without drying) covering the torso and lower extremities (control group) or WHO thermoregulation care and a plastic bag (without drying) covering the torso, upper and lower extremities, and a portion of their head (intervention group). The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken initially within 15 minutes of birth and later at 1 hour after birth as the infant is removed from the plastic bag. Seizures, hyperthermia, room temperature, and death will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With an estimated baseline hypothermia rate of 41% and a 21% absolute risk reduction (51% relative risk reduction), a sample size of 182 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence interval of 95%.</detailed_description>
