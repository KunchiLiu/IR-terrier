	<brief_title>Collagen Crosslinking for Keratoconus - a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keratoconus is a noninflammatory, asymmetrical, progressive corneal ectasia caused by biomechanical instability of the corneal stroma. Treatment modalities are primarily glasses or contact lenses. It has been estimated that one out of five patients will progress to such an extent that a corneal transplant is necessary to regain useful vision. Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is a treatment modality that intends to halt progression of keratoconus. This study investigates the efficacy av CXL in stabilizing the cornea in keratoconus by means of a randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants are eligible for inclusion if progressive keratoconus is confirmed and the inclusion criteria are met. Follow-up after inclusion is at 1 week (treatment group), 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Pre- and post-inclusion examinations include measurement of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), best spectacle corrected distance visual acuity (BSCDVA), Scheimpflug-topography and slitlamp examination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Keratoconus diagnosis determined clinically and topographically (KISA% index) Significant progression is defined as change (increase) of Kmax by at least 1D from baseline at 6 months and/or change (increase) of SimKast by at least 1D from baseline at 6 months. Kmax is defined as the steepest radius of curvature (either the maximum simulated Kreading or the maximum Kreading in the 3mm zone or the 5mm zone) of the anterior corneal surface that progressed the most during 6 months observation Ability to stop contact lens (rigid and soft) wear at least two weeks prior to next exam Signed written informed consent Age &lt; 18 years Pregnancy Breast feeding History of corneal surgery History of ocular herpes simplex infection Minimal corneal thickness &lt; 300 micrometers Recurrent corneal erosions Other corneal (e g endothelial) or conjunktival diseases Neurodermatitis Severe forms av atopic disease Collagenoses, autoimmune or other systemic disease Systemic treatment with high doses of steroids Severe scarring och striae of the cornea Relative exclusion criteria: Kmax &gt; 58D Minimal corneal thickness &lt; 400 micrometers (a modified CXLtreatment will be used swelling the cornea before UVillumination treatment).</criteria>
