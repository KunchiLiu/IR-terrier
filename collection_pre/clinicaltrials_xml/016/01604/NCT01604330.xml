	<brief_title>Baclofen for the Treatment of Alcohol Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid 'B-receptor' agonist, has long been used to treat spasticity from neurological diseases, at a dose of 30-90 mg/day. It appears today to be a promising but controversial candidate for treating alcoholic patients (Enserick, 2011) by reducing or even suppressing their craving to drink. A few case reports (Ameisen, 2005; Bucknam, 2007; Dore et al., 2011) and a retrospective study (Rigal et al, 2012) suggest that some patients might respond favorably to baclofen at higher doses than 90 mg/day. This is a randomized controlled trial versus placebo testing such doses. An extraction of patients DNA and a genetic analysis will be done after the end of the trial. In a gene candidate approach, the association of several genes with the efficiency of the treatment and its side effects, based on the literature, will be investigated using micro-array technology.</detailed_description>
