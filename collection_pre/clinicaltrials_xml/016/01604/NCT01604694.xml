	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block for Analgesia After Abdominoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine if TAP block have an analgesic effect in post operative period of abdominoplasty this study was made versus placebo: one group of patients will have a TAP block of levobupivacaine, the second group will have a TAP block with placebo before the surgery. Patient follow up includes data collected before surgery (at pré anesthesic visit and just before surgery) and data collected immediately after surgery (at post operative time) and at distance of the surgery (15 days and 3 months after the surgery). The principal aim is to show if TAP block have an analgesic effect in post operative period after abdominoplasty. To answer this question we will compare opioid intake during the two days after the surgery between the two groups.</detailed_description>
