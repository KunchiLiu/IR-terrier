	<brief_summary>The aim of the ETPOS study is to describe differences in transfusion habits throughout Europe and to correlate these habits to perioperative outcome parameters. Special focus is put on the number of PRBCs (packed red blood cells) transfused and the ratio of PRBCs to other blood products or coagulation factors in the operating room. Furthermore the motivation of physicians to transfuse PRBC and blood products in the operating room will be investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Transfusion Practice and Outcome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In European patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery receiving at least one PRBC(packed red blood cells) during their surgery it is proposed to: 1. Evaluate evidence of differences in the standard of peri-operative transfusion care in different healthcare systems within Europe, and the use of blood conserving techniques. 1. Evaluate the ratio of transfusion of PRBC to blood products in the operating room 2. Evaluate which factors determine transfusion of PRBC (is it patient's haemodynamics / haemoglobin threshold/ pressure from the surgeon / acute brisk bleeding / else) and blood products (ratio to PRBC / POC (point of care) monitoring/ per protocol/ else) in the operating room 2. Evaluate whether there are factors in transfusion therapy that are associated with outcome (in-hospital mortality and unplanned admission to ICU(Intensive Care Unit).)</detailed_description>
