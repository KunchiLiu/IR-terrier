	<brief_summary>The primary research goals of this application are to characterize social factors including health literacy and numeracy skills of CKD patients and examine associations with knowledge, self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and clinical outcomes, and to examine the impact of an efficient interactive educational intervention to facilitate patient-provider communication. The investigators will accomplish these goals by executing a cluster-randomized controlled trial and performing detailed analysis of baseline measures. The specific aims of this study are: Specific Aim 1: Determine the association of social factors with patient kidney knowledge, self-efficacy, participation in self-care behaviors, and clinical outcomes in moderate to advanced CKD. Hypothesis: In patients with CKD, low health literacy and numeracy is common and associated with older age, non-white race, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic (income) status, less kidney knowledge, lower self-efficacy of self-care, and less adherence with medication and diet self-care recommendations. Low literacy/numeracy is also associated with higher blood pressures, more proteinuria, and more severe dysfunction of renal clearance. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of a tailored literacy-sensitive educational tool used cooperatively by physicians and patients to improve self-care and outcomes in CKD. Hypothesis: Utilization of a concise literacy-sensitive physician-delivered educational tool will be feasible and associated with higher patient kidney knowledge, self-efficacy of self-care and greater adherence to medication and nutrition recommendations compared to usual care.</brief_summary>
