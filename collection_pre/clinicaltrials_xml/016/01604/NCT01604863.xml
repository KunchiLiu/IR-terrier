	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of HGS1036 when used in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic regimens paclitaxel plus carboplatin, cisplatin plus etoposide, or docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of HGS1036 in Combination With Chemotherapy in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of 3 regimens each containing 2 dose levels of HGS1036 and full dose chemotherapy. Patients will be treated in sequence with HGS1036 at planned dose levels of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg. Patients who demonstrate stable disease or better may continue to receive HGS1036 until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient requests discontinuation of study treatment, or the Investigator feels further treatment is not in the patient's best interest. After discontinuation of HGS1036, subjects will be followed for 30 days after the last dose of HGS1036 for safety. The end of study will be defined as 1 year after the last subject begins treatment of HGS1036. Any subject still receiving HGS1036 at this pre-defined end of study, may continue to receive HGS1036, but the only study assessments required will be for safety.</detailed_description>
