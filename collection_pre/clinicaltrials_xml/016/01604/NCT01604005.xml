	<brief_title>PIT: Prophylactic Irradiation of Tracts in Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesothelioma is a rare form of cancer affecting the protective lining that covers many of the body's internal organs. The most commonly affected areas are the lungs and internal chest wall. In the UK over 2300 patients are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year and the numbers are increasing. As part of the diagnosis and treatment of mesothelioma, patients may undergo a procedure which involves inserting a thin tube into the chest wall enabling an internal examination and for any biopsies or samples of fluid to be taken. These procedures can result in the development of skin lumps or nodules along the tract created by inserting the tube. To try and reduce the risk of these nodules developing in the tract or at the site of the scar, radiotherapy can be given to the chest wall at the site of the tract after the procedure has been performed; this type of radiotherapy is known as prophylactic irradiation of tracts or PIT. Although many hospitals already give patients this type of radiotherapy treatment to the chest wall we still do not know if the treatment works. This trial has been designed to answer the question about the effectiveness of PIT radiotherapy. If PIT is found to be effective in preventing or delaying the development of these skin nodules then it can be offered to all patients as part of their treatment. However, if we discover that PIT is not effective this will save patients from undergoing ineffective treatment and having to spend time making unnecessary extra visits to hospital</detailed_description>
