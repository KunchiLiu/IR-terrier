	<brief_summary>Persistent detrusor overactivity (DO) after transurethral prostatectomy results in symptomatic failure in more than one third of the patients. Storage symptoms are major complaints in the early postoperative period after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP). To investigate the effect of DO in the patients with Benign Prostatic Obstruction (BPO), the investigators evaluated the changes in the storage symptoms following HoLEP in conjunction with the prescription of the anticholinergic drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Review a Comprehensive Case Database of HoLEP Procedure Performed by a Single Surgeon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty men with urodynamically proven BPO underwent HoLEP at our hospital. All patients were evaluated preoperatively with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Continence Society male questionnaire short form (ICS-SF), 3-day frequency - volume charts (FVC), transrectal ultrasonography, and uroflowmetry with postvoid residual urine volume. The patients were divided into two groups; BPO without DO (Non-DO group) and BPO with DO (DO group). We assessed the patients postoperatively at 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
