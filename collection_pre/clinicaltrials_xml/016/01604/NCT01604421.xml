	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis is that plastic bags used in combination with WHO thermoregulation care will reduce the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight and full term infants when compared to routine WHO thermoregulation care alone. Part II is for preterm/low birth weight infant with or without plastic head cover used from 1 hour after birth until discharge or 24 hours after birth to assist with temperature regulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Use of Plastic Bags to Prevent Neonatal Hypothermia-Part II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to limited resources, hospitals in the developing world struggle to provide sufficient incubators and to maintain climate-controlled nurseries. Therefore, premature low birth weight infants continue to be at an increased risk of hypothermia throughout their hospitalizations. This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight infants randomized to receive WHO thermoregulation care (control groups) or WHO thermoregulation care and a plastic bag covering their torsos and lower extremities (intervention group) starting at one hour after birth and continued to discharge or 24 hours after birth, whichever occurs first. The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken one hour after birth, every subsequent 3-4 hours, and at discharge or 24 hours after birth when infants will be removed from the plastic bags. Seizures, hyperthermia, room temperature, and death will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With an estimated baseline hypothermia rate of 50% and a hypothesized 20% absolute risk reduction (40% relative risk reduction), a sample size of 182 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence interval of 95%.</detailed_description>
