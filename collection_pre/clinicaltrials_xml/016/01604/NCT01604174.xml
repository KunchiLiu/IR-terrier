	<brief_title>Interactive Virtual Telerehabilitation After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are distributed into two treatment groups: 1) Group I (control): standard clinical protocol of TKA rehabilitation consisting of 1-hour sessions for 10 days; and 2) Group II (IVT): 1-hour IVT sessions for 10 days (5 sessions under a therapist's supervision to verify the absence of medical complications + 5 sessions performed at home). The IVT is an interactive virtual software-hardware platform that facilitates the development of remote rehabilitation therapy for multiple diseases. Patients receive information required to perform exercise and the therapist remotely monitors the patient's performance. For the purpose of this trial, the IVT system was designed for lower limb motor recovery in patients undergoing TKA.</detailed_description>
