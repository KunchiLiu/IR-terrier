	<brief_summary>Inflammation is reported as one of the most recent hypotheses to explain BPH. Recent published works pointed out that urine and serum markers could be used for detection of prostatic inflammation. The aim of the study is to assess the activity on inflammation biomarkers (serum and urine inflammation markers) of Permixon® 160 mg hard capsule and Tamsulosine Arrow LP in the treatment of urinary symptoms related to BPH. The potential links between serum and urinary markers of inflammation and BPH clinical symptoms at baseline and on treatment will be explored.</brief_summary>
