	<brief_title>Effect of CPP-ACP Paste on Dental Caries in Primary Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 6th National Oral Health Survey in Thailand 2006-2007 reported that 3-year-old children who resided in central part have the highest dental caries prevalence of 69.8 percent with dmft affecting 3.63 teeth on average. Fluoride is widely accepted as the most effective tool to caries prevention for initial caries lesions. Current best practice recommends twice-daily tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste for dentate children. CPP-ACP can bolster the effects of fluoridated toothpaste alone to prevent caries.Currently, almost all clinical trials have investigated the effectiveness of CPP-ACP containing products in dental caries prevention and enhancing remineralization of initial carious lesion in the permanent dentition of young adolescents. There are no clinical studies of the effect of a CPP-ACP containing product to prevent dental caries in the primary dentition of young children.</detailed_description>
