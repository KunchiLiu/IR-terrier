	<brief_summary>Research questions: Pilot study research questions: Primary: 1)Can we recruit a sufficient number (i.e., at least 60 patients over 9 months) and retain a sufficient proportion of both men and women (i.e., at least 80% at 2, 4, or 6 months post-randomization) with advanced cancer in all 3 trial arms to allow completion of a full study in 4 years?; 2)Is MMi acceptable: to a general ACP? to both men and women?; Secondary: 1)Is it feasible to complete the intervention in 3-4 weeks? 2)How long is it feasible to test MMi effects: 2, 4 or 6 months post-randomization(retention rate=80%)? 3)Which recruitment strategies are most helpful? 4)What sample size is needed for a full study? Full-study research questions: Primary: Does adding the MMi to usual care (experimental group or EG) enhance meaning in life among newly diagnosed ACP, compared with those receiving usual care plus meetings with an empathic non-professional visitor (i.e., attention-control group or AC) or usual care alone (UC), at x months post-randomization? (time determined in pilot) "Meaning in life" (primary outcome) is defined as the belief that one's life has significance and purpose (i.e., global meaning) and "newly diagnosed ACP" is defined as the 6 months after first occurrence of, progression toward, or recurrence of stage III or IV cancer (TNM classification system). Secondary: In our future full-study, we plan to evaluate MMi effects on secondary outcomes such as existential wellbeing (MQOL existential wellbeing) and posttraumatic growth (Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory). We also plan to test a theoretical model where sense of meaning in life has a protective (moderating) effect on tertiary outcomes such as physical QoL (MQOL physical subscale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), and overall QoL (MQOL Total) in EG patients. Methodology: RCT pilot study with 60 newly diagnosed ACP (stages III or IV) within 2 months of referral and 6 months of randomization, assigned randomly to: (1) EG, (2) AC, or (3) UC. Patients will complete self-report questionnaires (including outcome measures, as well as sociodemographic and medical variables) at 2, 4 and 6 months post-randomization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of the Meaning-Making Intervention (MMi)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>See above</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1) Diagnosed with advanced cancer (stage III or IV TNM classification system; 117); first occurrence, progression or recurrence) of any type of solid tumour &lt;2 months at referral and &lt;6 months at randomization. 2) Willing to participate in weekly MMi or AC sessions. 3) &gt;18 years. 4) Alert and capable of giving free and informed consent. 5) Able to speak and read English or French. Exclusion Criteria: 1) Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score &lt;60 (rated by referring oncologists/nurses or Research Coordinator (RC)) or expected survival &lt;6 months according to clinical judgment. 2) Currently receiving radiotherapy (Rx) treatment (although these patients can be reassessed after Rx). Patients will only be included in the study when they have recovered from severe sideeffects from Rx and when they feel they can participate in the study. Severe sideeffects are defined as a score of 3 or 4 on any of the sitespecific toxicity markers of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Common Toxicity Criteria or with more than 3 markers with a score of 2 (moderate sideeffects), as evaluated by the treating physician (in consultation with the radiotherapist. 3) Suicidal. Present a score of â‰¥2 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suicide item (item #9), administered by the RC or RA during the consent meeting. 4) Known diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 5) Planning a trip within 2 months that would interrupt delivery of the MMi or AC.</criteria>
