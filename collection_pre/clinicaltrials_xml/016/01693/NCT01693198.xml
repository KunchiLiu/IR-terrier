	<brief_summary>People swimming or surfing in lake Kineret , sometimes complain of nasal stuffiness , sneezing and itching .Typically, it happens during or immediately after contact with the lake`s water . The symptoms are compatible with immediate allergic reaction. Previous reports suggested a connection between similar symptoms and contact with different cyanobacteria (living in fresh water lakes). In this study we intend to prove the mechanism of these reactions. To prove the exact allergen that causes allergic rhinitis allergists perform skin tests with different suspected allergens. Likewise, we would like to perform skin tests to different proteins extracted from cyanobacteria collected in lake Kineret.</brief_summary>
