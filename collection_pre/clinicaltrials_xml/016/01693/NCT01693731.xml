	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as Arimidex, Aromasin or Femara affect a woman's oral health and oral health related quality of life. Patients, dental professionals and medical oncologists will benefit from a greater understanding of the best oral care follow up practices of breast cancer survivors using aromatase inhibitors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Health in Breast Cancer Survivors on Aromatase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary This cross-sectional prevalence study seeks to investigate the incidence and severity of oral health changes, specifically of periodontal conditions, among breast cancer survivors and the ways in which these outcomes affect their quality of life. Secondary - To determine the prevalence and severity of oral conditions in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer using adjuvant AI therapy as compared to postmenopausal women not using adjuvant AI therapy. - To determine if adjuvant AI therapy use is associated with greater alveolar bone loss or increased levels of bone turnover biomarkers in postmenopausal women with cancer undergoing adjuvant AI therapy compared to postmenopausal women not receiving AI therapy. - To determine the oral health-related quality of life among postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant AI therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal as defined by NCCN (any of the following) Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age equal to or greater then 60 years of age Age less then 60 and amenorrheic for 12 or more months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifen or ovarian suppression and FSH and estradiol in the postmenopausal range If taking tamoxifen or toremifen and age less then 60y, then FSH and plasma estradiol level in postmenopausal ranges Informed consent Individuals capable of consenting and self administering the survey instrument Dentate At least 15 teeth present. AI users: Diagnosis of BCa Histologic confirmed diagnosis of BCa: Stage 0, I, II, or III with no evidence of metastatic disease. Treatment AI as clinically indicated (AI may be anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole) &gt; 1 month. Subjects may have had prior tamoxifen or raloxifene. Subjects may have had chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Must be within the first year of consecutive AI therapy. If a subject started AI, discontinued, then restarted, they will be accepted into the study. Controls: No Diagnosis of cancer. Patients must not have a diagnosis of any cancer (Not including a history of localized thyroid or skin cancer). Medical history Metastatic BCa (AI treated group: fully resected locally recurrent disease is permitted if the patient has been rendered without evidence of disease). Significant psychiatric illness/social situations that would preclude completion of questionnaire. Medications Chronic medications known to affect the periodontal status (calcium antagonist, anticonvulsives, immunosuppressives (&gt; prednisone 7.5mg daily). NSAIDS and bisphosphonates are permitted. Premedication Conditions that require antibiotic therapy will be evaluated on a casebycase basis. (Patients taking prophylaxis for joint replacements will not be excluded.)</criteria>
