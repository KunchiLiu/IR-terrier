	<brief_title>Validation of Non-invasive Hemoglobin (SpHb) Measurement in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several surgical procedures require haemoglobin monitoring due to possible blood loss and the need of blood transfusion. The standard for monitoring hemoglobin (Hb) is the measurement of blood samples. The novel technique of non-invasive continuous measurement of Hb using Pulse CO-Oximetry may allow measuring Hb without obtaining blood samples. This new technique has not been tested yet in children undergoing anesthesia for elective surgical procedures. In this study the investigators compare the non-invasive Hb measurement with Masimo® technology (SpHb) with the standard Hb measurement using ABL-800 Flex (BGA) and Siemens Advia (labHb, reference method) before the children undergo the surgical procedure.</detailed_description>
