	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria include: 1. Adults 3085 years of age 2. Diagnosis of either ocular hypertension or primary openangle glaucoma in both eyes 3. Not receiving medication for IOP, or able to stop such medication for a washout period and the duration of the study without significant risk of adverse consequences related to glaucomatous disease 4. Elevated IOP (≥ 24 and ≤ 34 mm Hg at 8 AM and ≥ 21 and ≤ 34 mm Hg at 10 AM on Screening Two visit and Baseline visit in one or both eyes off treatment Exclusion Criteria include: 1. Uncontrolled intraocular hypertension defined as &gt;34 mm Hg at either of the screening/baseline visits (after a washout phase in those subjects who were currently receiving ocular hypotensive therapy). 2. Receiving more than one medication for IOP at time of screening. 3. Central corneal thickness of less than 500 µm or greater than 620 µm. 4. BCVA worse than 20/200 in either eye 5. Significant visual field loss (ie, mean deviation &gt; 10 db or field loss within 10 degrees of fixation), a new field defect, or progression of an existing field defect in either eye during the year preceding the study. 6. Acute angleclosure glaucoma or appositional or very narrow anterior chamber angle in either eye.</criteria>
