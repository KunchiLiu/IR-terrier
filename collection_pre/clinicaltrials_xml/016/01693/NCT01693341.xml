	<brief_title>A Caregiver-mediated Intervention Improves the Functional Ability of Home-living Chronic Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the hospital, most rehabilitation units are like sheltered workshops and the therapists work with stroke patients in well-designed, but non-home-like, environment to improve the stroke patient's functional ability. After returning home, stroke patients face new challenges and also need to assume more responsibility for daily activities. Without continuing rehabilitation training or proper support, the patients can easily fall into a sedentary lifestyle and lead to declines in functional ability.However, providing home-based exercise by therapists directly would increase the health care cost and may not be practical for chronic stroke patients. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine whether a caregiver-mediated, home-based intervention program is effective for improving stroke patients' functional ability and social participation.</detailed_description>
