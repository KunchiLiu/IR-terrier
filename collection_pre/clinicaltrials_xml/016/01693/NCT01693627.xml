	<brief_summary>A randomised, comparative, prospective, single-blinded trial of two hip prosthesis: 1. Marathon cemented all-poly acetabular cup(Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana), Corail uncemented femoral stem(Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana), 32mm Alumina Biolox Forte femoral head(Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana) and 2. Pinnacle/Marathon uncemented cup(Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana), Corail uncemented femoral stem(Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana), 32mm Alumina Biolox Forte femoral head(Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana) There will be a further in-group randomisation to a Corail femoral stem with or without a collar, creating a number of 4 study-groups in total. The aims of the study are: - To compare polyethylene wear and migration of the moderately cross-linked Marathon polyethylene in a cemented version(Marathon) and in an uncemented cup(Pinnacle/Marathon) - To evaluate micromigration and periacetabular bone mineral density of the 2 cups using radiostereometry(RSA) - To evaluate the migration patterns and proximal femoral bone density changes around the Corail stems with and without a collar</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age under 70 years with primary or secondary arthritis of the hip, aseptic necrosis of the femoral head, acute hip fracture or sequelae after hip fracture. Active malignant disease, rheumatoid arthritis or other generalised autoimmune arthritic disease, BMI &gt; 35, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, 0 chronic or recurrent infection, liver disease, Paget's disease, dementia or lack of compliance for other reasons, uncompensated cardiac or pulmonary disease(ASA class 3 or 4). Prosthesis in the contralateral hip does not exclude the patient, but only one hip in each patient can be included in the study.</criteria>
