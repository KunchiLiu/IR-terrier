	<brief_title>Functional Outcome Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The choice of graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) remains controversial. Despite the need for outcome studies comparing bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) with semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (STG), few studies have evaluated functional outcomes. The objective of the current study was to compare hop performance and jump landing strategy in soccer players with higher level sports activities after ACLR using either BPTB or STG and controls.</detailed_description>
