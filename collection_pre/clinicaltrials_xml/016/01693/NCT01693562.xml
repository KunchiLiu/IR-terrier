	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, first-time-in-human study with a standard 3+3 dose-escalation phase in subjects with advanced solid tumors followed by an expansion phase in patients with advanced solid tumors. An exploration cohort has been added to determine the safety using Q4W dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study to Evaluate MEDI4736</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of MEDI4736 (a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM, and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in adult patients with solid tumors. A dose exploration cohort will look at the safety profile of Q4W dosing of MEDI4736.</detailed_description>
