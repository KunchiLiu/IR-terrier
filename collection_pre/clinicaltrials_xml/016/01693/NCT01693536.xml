	<brief_summary>A randomised controlled trial to test if offering three visits to a dietician + two visits to a physiotherapist over six months + a home sphygmomanometer, will result in a reduction in sodium intake and an increase in fitness in people over 75yrs. Volunteers were enrolled from Oct 2008 to July 2009.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Primary Care Change Elderly Physical Activity and Salt Intake? An Australian Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is evidence that both sedentary lifestyle and high sodium diets contribute to cardiovascular disease and possibly dementia among the elderly. There is a need to show that minimal intervention can reduce sodium intake and increase fitness in the elderly. Finland has shown that five dietician visits/year could change diet in respect to fat and fibre. In Australia the National Health Insurer (Medicare) funds five allied health visits/year for those with chronic disease, hence our use of this model. This is consistent with WHO guidelines for a national approach using existing health infrastructure. The elderly (75-95yrs) were chosen as this group is thought most difficult to change behaviour and has a higher incidence of dementia.</detailed_description>
