	<brief_summary>The aim of this research is to assess whether Contingency Management is effective in improving treatment adherence in substance use disordered (SUD) patients with comorbid PTSD. Although Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE) is the gold standard treatment for PTSD, the few studies of this treatment in substance users have shown poor adherence. Contingency Management is a well-established approach that could be used to enhance adherence to PE. From a consented sample of 125 opioid-dependent and methadone-treated patients at Addiction Treatment Services, an intent-to-treat sample of 62 patients with co-occurring current PTSD will be offered PE. Half of the 62 participants will be randomly assigned to a Prolonged Exposure with Contingency Management (PE+CM) condition that provides monetary-based incentives for attending the PE therapy sessions. The comparison condition will be assigned to a Prolonged Exposure (PE) condition without the attendance incentives intervention. The PE sessions will be scheduled once per week for 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up. Groups will be compared primarily on adherence to the PE schedule, improvement in PTSD symptoms, and rates of drug use (urine specimens, self-reported use). The study's three primary aims are to 1) Evaluate the efficacy of adding voucher-based attendance incentives to PE for PTSD to increase adherence in SUD patients in a methadone treatment program; 2) Evaluate the efficacy of adding voucher-based attendance incentives to PE for PTSD to reduce PTSD symptoms in SUD patients; and 3) Evaluate the effect of PE for PTSD on rates of drug use in SUD patients.</brief_summary>
