	<criteria>1. Patient has a histologically confirmed diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 2. Patient has relapsed or refractory disease and received at least one prior therapy. 3. Patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma has received or is ineligible for autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. 4.
