	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well ipilimumab works in treating patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cervical cancer that has come back or that has spread to other areas of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Human Papilloma Virus-Related Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of ipilimumab in eligible patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. II. To assess the antitumor activity of ipilimumab in eligible patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer via assessment of objective response rates (ORR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the antitumor activity of ipilimumab through secondary endpoints including of disease stabilization and progression free survival (PFS). II. Assessment of antitumor activity of ipilimumab using immune-related response criteria (irRC) III. Assessment of the predictive value of baseline C-reactive protein. IV. Assess the biologic responses of exposure to ipilimumab via correlative studies involving analysis of lymphocyte subsets and assessment of cervical cancer-antigen specific T cells anti-tumor response. V. Evaluation of archival tissue with regard to markers of immune population in correlation with clinical stage and response to treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving objective response or stable disease continue to receive maintenance therapy comprising ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer of squamous, adenocarcinoma or mixed histology type not suited to definitive localized therapy; HPV status will be confirmed for all patients following enrollment Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt; 10 mm with computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam Previous therapy: Patients may have undergone surgery and/or received definitive radiation or chemoradiation for localized disease in the past Radiation treatment with curative intent (radical chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy) must have been completed &gt;= 3 months prior to enrollment Note: patients who completed palliative radiation therapy 2 weeks before start of ipilimumab are allowed as long as this does not affect measurable disease Patients must have been exposed to platinum chemotherapy either as part of definitive chemoradiation OR as first line systemic treatment for metastatic disease Patients MAY have received up to two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent disease; patients with metastatic disease at first presentation MUST have received one platinum based line of chemotherapy All chemotherapy must have been completed &gt;= 4 weeks prior to enrollment with radiologic evidence of radiological disease progression Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Leukocytes &gt;= 3.0 x 10^9/L Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits (except in Gilbert's syndrome) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) =&lt; upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine &lt; 1.25 ULN OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 as calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula All radiology studies must be performed =&lt; 3 weeks prior to the start of therapy Subjects with treated and asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible; patients that received palliative radiation (for brain metastases) are eligible if they have been asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks with use of maintenance steroid therapy, and last received radiation at least 4 weeks prior to start of therapy Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document Ongoing prior toxicities related to previous treatments must be recovered to =&lt; grade 1 at the time of registration (with the exception of alopecia or skin depigmentation) Patients are willing to undergo tumor biopsy pretreatment (within 14 days prior to registration) and posttreatment (within the first week of cycle 2 onset); patients who consent but have tumor that is not amenable to safe biopsy will be allowed to enter the trial/continue therapy as per protocol if this has been addressed and permission is granted from the lead consortium principal investigator (PI) prior to registration continuation of treatment Patients who have had chemotherapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to enrollment (&lt; 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) or who had radiation therapy with curative intent &lt; 3 months prior to enrollment (&lt; 2 weeks for palliative radiation therapy) or those who have not recovered (=&lt; grade 1) from adverse events related to previous treatments are excluded Patients with a history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or other cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) agonists or antagonists, antiprogrammed death 1 (PD 1) antibody, cluster of differentiation (CD)137 agonist or other immune activating therapy such as antiCD 40 antibody are excluded Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Autoimmune disease: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]); central nervous system (CNS) or motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. GuillainBarre syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis, multiple sclerosis) Patients requiring immunosuppressive agents, unless required for treating potential immune related adverse effects; steroids at their lowest effective dose in patients with radiated brain metastases is permitted Patients with known immune impairment who may be unable to respond to antiCTLA 4 antibody Any other prior malignancy from which the patient has been disease free for less than 3 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of any site or any other cancer History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ipilimumab Patients requiring systemic steroids are excluded; narcotics should be used with caution Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections should be excluded Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ipilimumab Patients with active or chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have raised viral loads or uncontrolled disease are ineligible; those patients however who exhibit minimal viral loads with good control whilst on stable antiviral regimen may be considered if they meet all other eligibility criteria</criteria>
