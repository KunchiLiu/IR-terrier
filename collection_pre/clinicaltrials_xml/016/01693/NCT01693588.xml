	<brief_summary>High levels of postoperative pain are associated with an increased risk of lung and heart complications, are the most common reason for delayed discharge or for unexpected hospital admission after ambulatory surgery, and are responsible for prolonged recovery after inpatient surgery. Furthermore both neuropathic pain and post surgical pain inhibit weight gain and may have an impact on the patient's nutrition post operatively. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodality pain management protocol on postoperative neurosurgical pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Multimodality Pain Management Protocol on Postoperative Neurosurgical Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the long-standing recognition of postoperative pain as both prevalent and undertreated, 20% to 30% of all surgical patients continue to experience moderate to severe postoperative pain. High levels of postoperative pain are associated with an increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, are the most common reason for delayed discharge or for unexpected hospital admission after ambulatory surgery, and are responsible for prolonged convalescence after inpatient surgery. Furthermore both neuropathic pain and post surgical pain inhibit weight gain and may have an impact on the patient's nutrition post operatively. Finally, high levels of postoperative pain have also been associated with an increased risk of chronic pain. Therefore, the aggressive treatment of postoperative pain may be particularly important in influencing patient outcomes, inadvertent readmissions, and propensity for developing chronic pain.</detailed_description>
