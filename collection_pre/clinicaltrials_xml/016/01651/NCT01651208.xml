	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of a phone based motivational interviewing among minority populations who received a coronary stent can improve adherence to antiplatelet agents from approximately 51% to 66% (15 percentage point increase) at 12 months post stent placement when compared to a mailed educational DVD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Adherence to Post PCI Antiplatelet Therapy in Minority Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Other aims are: 1) Improve the self reported adherence of antiplatelet medications 2) Identify specific barriers for the use of post PCI anti-platelet therapy among minority populations enrolled in Humana by administering a short survey at the baseline recruitment call and at the 12 month follow up call, 3) identify predictors of never filling an anti-platelet therapy prescription post PCIS. Inclusion criteria: We will include black or Hispanic patients having coronary stenting using the following codes for bare metal or drug eluting stents: ICD-9 procedure codes (36.06) or (36.07), MS-DRG codes 247-249 or CPT codes 92980, 92981, C1984 G0290, G0291. The identification period will last approximately 10 months. Primary Outcome: Medication Possession ratio as a dichotomous variable (appropriate/not appropriate adherence) and as a continuous variable Secondary outcomes: Self reported adherence by 4- item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4) Barriers to appropriate adherence Predictors of adherence</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We will identify prospectively all subjects who undergo coronary stenting using the following codes for bare metal or drug eluting stents: ICD9 procedure codes (36.06) or (36.07), MSDRG codes 247249 or CPT codes 92980, 92981, C1984 G0290, G0291 We will select subjects identified as Black or Hispanics by a validated algorithm that uses the Medicare race code, geocoding techniques and the Spanish Surname list. 1. Lack of medical files to document stent placement. 2. Not receiving informed consent. 3. Subjects with contraindications for antiplatelet therapy</criteria>
