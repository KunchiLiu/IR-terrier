	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-8457 + Methotrexate (MTX) in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) therapy. The primary hypothesis of this study is that among participants with active RA, MK-8457 100 mg twice daily (BID) + MTX will be superior to placebo + MTX as measured by the change in Disease Activity Score 28 C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MK-8457 in Participants With Rheumatoid Arthritis (MK-8457-010)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Base Study, participants were to receive blinded MK-8457 100 mg + MTX or matched placebo + MTX for up to 24 weeks. At Week 12 and 18, efficacy evaluation was conducted to assess eligibility for early escape, defined as &lt;20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts. Participants who completed the Base Study and those eligible for early escape could enroll in the 76-week Safety Extension in which participants were to receive open-label MK-8457 100 mg BID + MTX. All participants must have been treated with MTX for at least 3 months prior to Screening and have been receiving a stable dose of MTX for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. In addition, each participant must have either failed treatment with 1 or 2 anti-TNF-α therapies or was intolerant to anti-TNF-α therapy prior to Screening. For participants who failed therapy, the treatment with anti-TNF-α therapies must have been for at least 3 months.</detailed_description>
