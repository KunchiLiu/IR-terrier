	<brief_title>Effects of Meditation Awareness Training on Psychosocial Functioning in Prison Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Western practitioner settings, Buddhist principles are increasingly being used in the treatment of a wide range of mental health issues. However, there is a dearth of high quality research examining the effects of Buddhist-derived interventions (BDIs) on mental health in forensic settings. The purpose of this study is to assess the salutary effects and acceptability of a secularised group-based eight-week BDI known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) against relevant predictors of adaptive psychosocial functioning and mental health in violent offenders. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be employed structured with reference to CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 guidelines. English speaking adult males (aged 18-65 years) serving indeterminate prison sentences for offences of instrumental violence at a category B prison will be invited to receive MAT on a voluntary basis. Computer-generated numbers will be used to randomly allocate prison participants (n=102 - based on statistical power calculations) to either an intervention or 'treatment as usual' (TAU) control condition. Measures will be taken pre- and post-intervention and at three-month follow-up to assess maintenance effects.</detailed_description>
