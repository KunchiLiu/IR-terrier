	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate the capacity of the auto-questionnaire of quality of life, VQ11, to follow the evolution of patients with COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in stable state (without exacerbation in the previous 6 weeks) (3 months +/-15 days) during the implementation of a LABD (Long-acting bronchodilator) treatment. The main objective is to compare the total Score of the VQ11 auto-questionnaire before and after LABD. A decrease of 5 points of the total score mimicking an improvement in the quality of life linked to health, specifically in the COPD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation of the VQ11 auto-questionnaire of quality of life in pneumology investigation, during the implementation of a long-acting bronchodilator treatment of patients with COPD. Two visits per patient are planned: V1: After complete information and collection of the written consent, the pulmonologists ask the patients participating in the study to fill out the VQ11 questionnaire, 2 visual analogical scales concerning the dyspnoea and the physical activity, the short IPAQ version and the respiratory questionnaire of the Saint Georges hospital. RFE (respiratory functional exploration) is also realized during this medical exam. V2 (3 months after the treatment setup, at day90 ± 15): the pulmonologists ask the patients participating in the study to fill out the VQ11 questionnaire, 2 visual analogical scales and Likert scales concerning the dyspnoea and the physical activity, the short IPAQ version and the respiratory questionnaire of the Saint Georges hospital. RFE (respiratory functional exploration) is also realized during this medical exam. Inclusion period : 6 months; Study participation period / patient : 3 months; Complete study duration : 9 months</detailed_description>
