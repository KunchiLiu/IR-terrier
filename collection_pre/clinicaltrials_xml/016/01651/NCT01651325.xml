	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study of Multiple Doses of Isavuconazole and Single Dose of Dextromethorphan in Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will check-in on Day -1 and remain confined to the clinical unit until Day 13. On the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of dextromethorphan. On Days 6 and 7, subjects will receive isavuconazole three times daily (TID) administered approximately 8 hours apart. On Day 8 through 12, subjects will receive isavuconazole once daily (QD).
