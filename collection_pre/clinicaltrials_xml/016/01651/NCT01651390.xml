	<brief_summary>To determine in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) whether percutaneous coronary intervention - in patients with in-stent restenosis in either bare metal stents or drug eluting stents - with the Pantera Lux balloon is angiographically non-inferior to percutaneous intervention with the Orsiro stent 6 months post-procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of the Pantera Lux Balloon Versus the Orsiro Stent in Patients With In-stent Restenosis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical investigation is an international, multi-center, randomized controlled trial with angiographic follow up at 6 months. Clinical follow ups will take place at 6, 12 and 18 months. Up to 210 subjects will be block randomized 2:1 to receive the Pantera Lux balloon or the Orsiro stent and will be stratified according to diabetic status at screening.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject has provided a written informed consent 2. Subject ≥ 18 years 3. Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive functional study, stable or unstable angina pectoris or documented silent ischemia 4. Subject eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention 5. Subject acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery 6. Subject with an instent restenotic lesion* in either a bare metal stent or drug eluting stents (Mehran class I, II, III, IV Mehran et al. Circulation 199; 100: 18721878). *Target lesion 7. Subjects with a maximum of 2 target lesions. In case of 2 target lesions, both lesions must be either in bare metal stents or drug eluting stents, and must treated during the same session with the same type of device as per randomization outcome, e.g. drug eluting stent. 8. Target reference vessel diameter (visual estimation): ≥ 2.0 and ≤ 4.0 mm 9. Target lesion length (visual estimation): ≥ 6.0 and ≤ 28.0 mm 10. Target lesion stenosis (visual estimation): &gt; 50 % and ≤ 100 % 11. Target lesion in a native coronary artery 1. Planned (staged) interventional treatment in the same vessel(s) as the target lesion(s) within 30 days pre and/or post BIOLUX RCT index procedure. 2. Evidence of acute STsegmentelevation myocardial infarction within 48 hours prior to index procedure according to the universal definition of myocardial infarction 3. Subjects with acute cardiac decompensation or acute cardiogenic shock 4. Subject with a life expectancy of less than 18 month 5. In the investigators opinion subject who will not be able to comply with the follow up requirements 6. Impaired renal function (excluded are subjects in need of dialysis or subjects with a creatinine level ≥ 221 µmol per liter (2.5 mg per deciliter) within 72 hours of the intended treatment) 7. Thrombus in the target vessel 8. Target lesion located in left main coronary artery 9. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% 10. Known allergies to: acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, heparin, contrast medium, sirolimus or similar drugs (i.e., ABT 578, biolimus, tacrolimus); CoCr, PLLA, silicon carbide 11. Subject is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., inhaled steroids are not excluded) or has known lifelimiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not including diabetes mellitus) 12. Subject currently enrolled in other investigational device or drug trial in which primary endpoint has not been reached 13. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during the time of the study 14. Previously enrolled in this trial</criteria>
