	<brief_title>An Open Label Placebo Study to Assess the Inhalation Profile in Asthmatic Patients Using the Nexthaler® Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the inspiratory flow profile through the NEXThaler® device in adult asthmatics with varying degrees of disease control. The study plan foresees one visit at clinic. At Visit 1, after the signature of the informed consent form, the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be checked and the lung function parameters will be evaluated. If the subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be instructed to use the NEXThaler®. The patients will subsequently inhale through the device and the inspiration profile will be measured. A total of 40 asthmatic adults (≥18 years), 20 with controlled stable disease and 20 with partly controlled or uncontrolled disease according to GINA guidelines (2011), will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of controlled, partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma according to GINA guidelines (2011) A cooperative attitude and ability to use DPIs and to be trained in the proper use of the NEXThaler® as confirmed by the activation of the training device BAM Significant seasonal variation in asthma or asthma occurring only during episodic exposure to an allergen or a chemical sensitizer History of near fatal asthma (e.g. brittle asthma, hospitalisation for asthma exacerbation in Intensive Care Unit) Diagnosis of restrictive lung disease Significant unstable medical history of and/or treatments for cardiac, renal, neurological, hepatic, endocrine diseases, or any laboratory abnormality indicative of a significant underlying condition, that may interfere with patient's safety, compliance, or study evaluations, according to the investigator's opinion.</criteria>
