	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of 9vHPV (9-valent HPV vaccine, V503) in 16- to 26-year old men and women. The overall goal is to bridge 9vHPV efficacy findings in young women to young men based on the demonstration of similar immunogenicity and safety profiles. The primary hypothesis is that 9vHPV induces antibody responses at 4 weeks postdose 3 in heterosexual males that are non-inferior to antibody responses in young women.</brief_summary>
