	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of using bivalirudin instead of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR). The primary hypothesis of BRAVO 3 was that bivalirudin would reduce major bleeding compared with heparin in TAVR procedures. Results for all participants enrolled into the randomized trial (BRAVO 3) are presented.</brief_summary>
