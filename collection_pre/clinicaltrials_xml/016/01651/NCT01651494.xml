	<brief_summary>This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of a single dose (20mg) of Influenza Antiviral DAS181-F04 for 3 days. The group of nine subjects will be randomly assigned to DAS181 or placebo at 2:1 ratios. Subjects will be admitted to the inpatient clinic at a minimum of the night prior to first dose. The subjects will stay in the inpatient clinic for the duration of dosing and one day after dosing, they will be required to come back for follow-up visits on study days 4, 6, 9, 16 (+/-1 day), 32 (+/-3 days), and 90 (+/-10 days). The safety parameters will include abnormal laboratory values, adverse events and clinical observations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The subjects will receive a single-dose treatment of DAS181-F04 or placebo at a targeted delivered dose of 20mg each day for three days. The subjects will be evaluated on the day before the initial dose (Day -1) and randomly assigned to DAS181-F04 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Subjects will be evaluated prior to dosing on Days 0, 1 and 2. Additional follow-up evaluations will occur one day after completion of dosing (Day 3) and on Days 4, 6, 9, 16 (+/-1 day), 32 (+/-3 days) and 90 (+/-10 days). The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of DAS181-F04 encapsulated dry powder compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the pharmacokinetic and immunologic profile of DAS181 encapsulated dry powder dose to dose and compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation using a DPI in healthy adults. A total of 9 subjects, healthy male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45 years will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 ratio, wherein 6 subjects will receive the active drug and 3 subjects will receive placebo. Subjects may be replaced if a subject withdraws within 7 days (Day 9) after receipt of the final study drug dose.</detailed_description>

Blood pressure within normal limits (systolic 86 140mmHg; diastolic 50 90 mmHg) and heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute. Chest Xray shows no clinically significant abnormalities. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be greater than 80% predicted; note: only one baseline value for FEV1 can be used to support inclusion criterion.

Negative screening tests for: marijuana, cocaine metabolite, amphetamines, opiates, PCP, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and ethanol. Subjects with the following laboratory criteria within provided range (see Appendix B): Hemoglobin White blood cell (WBC) and platelet count Alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Serum glucose; note: if a nonfasting glucose is performed and is abnormal, a fasting glucose measurement may be obtained in its place; if this is within the provided range, then subject may be enrolled. Serum creatinine Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen Urine glucose and blood tested by dipstick urinalysis are negative. Urine protein tested by dipstick is negative or trace. Menstruating females failing inclusion due to positive urine dipstick blood may be retested following cessation of menses. Female subjects must be postmenopausal (one year or greater without menses), surgically incapable of childbearing, or agreeable to practicing abstinence or utilizing two effective methods of birth control during the study period and for 12 weeks after study product administration. Acceptable methods may include: Intrauterine device Spermicide Barrier contraception Hormonal contraception A female subject must have had a negative serum pregnancy test during the screening visit and a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of drug dosing. If male, agrees to use medically accepted form of contraception from time of enrollment to 12 weeks after study product administration. Agrees not to drink alcohol or participate in strenuous physical activity or exercise from 24 hours prior to Day 1 through the Day 6 followup visit. Have received any investigational drug or vaccine within 30 days prior to study drug dosing or have had a serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to any drug.

Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Have been on a liquid protein diet in the last month. Are allergic to lactose. Have sickle cell disease. Have used any prescription or nonprescription drugs, excluding hormonal contraception, within 7 days prior to admission unless approved by the site PI or subinvestigator. Subjects must be willing to refrain from taking nonstudy medication and herbal supplements during the study through Day 32 except those approved by the site PI or subinvestigator. Existence of any surgical, medical or laboratory condition that, in the judgment of the site PI or subinvestigator, might interfere with the safety, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug. Subjects with current or a previous history of respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, emphysema, or anaphylaxis) requiring acute or chronic medication, as determined by the investigator through medical history evaluation and physical examination.
