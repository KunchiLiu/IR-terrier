	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a peer mentor model in a mixed race population of poorly controlled diabetic Veterans. Also, the study aims to assess the effects of becoming a mentor on those who originally were mentees. It is expected that participants in the peer mentoring arms (Arm 2 and 3) will have improved glucose control regardless of race or ethnicity at the end of the intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are: (1) test the long-term effectiveness of a peer mentor model on improving glucose control, blood pressure, LDL levels, diabetes mellitus quality of life, and depression scores in a mixed race population of poorly controlled diabetic Veterans; (2) test the effectiveness of using former peer mentees as peer mentors as a means of creating a self-sustaining program; and (3) and test the effects of becoming a mentor on those who were originally mentees given a growing literature that being a mentor is good for your health. Secondary objectives include: (1) in those randomized to being a mentee, explore mentor characteristics associated with improved HbA1c. This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. Outcomes to be measured include glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, direct LDL, diabetes quality of life and depression. The trial has two phases. In phase one, patients with poorly controlled diabetes are randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring. In phase two, poorly controlled diabetics are randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring from former mentees. Former mentees from phase 1 are also randomized such that they will have a 50% chance of becoming a mentor.</detailed_description>
