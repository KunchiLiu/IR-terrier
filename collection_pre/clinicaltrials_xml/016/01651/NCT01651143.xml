	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate safety and tolerability of 8-week oral administration of SAR100842 in patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of SAR100842 in patients with systemic sclerosis as measured by disease related biomarkers and Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor signaling markers in blood and skin; - To explore the effect of SAR100842 on skin thickness in patients with systemic sclerosis as measured by the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS); - To explore the effect of SAR100842 on quality of life as measured by the Scleroderma Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ); - To document long term safety of SAR100842 during the extension part.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for systemic sclerosis with diffuse cutaneous involvement and &lt;36 months since the onset of the first systemic sclerosis manifestation other than Raynaud's phenomenon and have a Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) â‰¥ 15 and an area of definite involvement of the dorsal forearm that is considered amenable to repeated 4mm skin biopsies. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with high dose or unstable low dose immunosuppressive drugs, cytotoxic, antifibrotic or glucocorticoids drugs at least 4 weeks prior to screening 2. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 3. Gastrointestinal involvement preventing oral administration of study drug 4.
