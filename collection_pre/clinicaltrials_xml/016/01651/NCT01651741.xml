	<brief_title>Effects of Seaweeds Combined With Probiotics on Intestinal Function of Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kimchi is one of the the typical and main foods in Korea. Seaweed is one of the important ingredient of Kimchi and has been known to have antiinflammatory, anticoagulant and antiadhesive effects. As seaweeds are fermented in order to make Kimchi, it can encourage beneficial probiotics to grow and lead to preventing digestive problems such as constipation and diarrhea. In this trial, we are going to investigate the effect of combination of seaweeds and probiotics on intestinal function of healthy subject by evaluating intestinal microbiota. The trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-arm study. Forty patients with normal intestinal condition will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups consisting of Seaweed with real probiotics or Seaweed with placebo probiotics. The assigned treatments will last for 4 weeks and the follow-up period will be 2 weeks. Four weeks of administration of seaweeds and probiotics is expected to increase the amount of beneficial microbiota and reduce that of harmful microbiota in intestine. we will also use questionnaires such as K-GSRS (Korean Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale), WHOQOL (The World Health Organization Quality of Life) - BREF and Assessment of bowel function scores (frequency, consistency, ease of passage - based on Bristol stool scale) to assess the change of digestive symptoms and the quality of life.</detailed_description>
