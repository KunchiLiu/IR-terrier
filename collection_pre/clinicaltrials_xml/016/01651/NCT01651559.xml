	<brief_summary>This is a two-center study aimed to assess the efficacy of Dead Sea Minerals in alleviating symptoms of Psoriasis Vulgaris, in 50 patients undergoing phototherapy. A bilateral left right comparison will be made, after using the study product and the placebo, for 8 weeks, twice daily, on each of the body sides (left right). In addition to the clinical evaluations, skin biochemistry will be studied using non-invasive techniques. The latter will be correlated with the clinical results of the patients. These will serve for future development of diagnostic assays and personalized therapies.</brief_summary>
