	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of intratracheal administration of two different single doses of CHF 5633 in preterm neonates with RDS in terms of adverse events, adverse drug reactions, hematology and biochemistry values, the incidence of major neonatal morbidities including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality.</brief_summary>
