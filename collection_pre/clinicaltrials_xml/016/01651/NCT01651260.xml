	<brief_summary>Endotracheal intubation is the translaryngeal placement of a tube into the trachea via the nose or mouth. Endotracheal tubes must be securely fixed to prevent movement, which may result in accidental slippage of the tube into a mainstream bronchus or into the pharynx. Hollister Incorporated is assessing the functionality and performance of an endotracheal tube securement device.</brief_summary>
