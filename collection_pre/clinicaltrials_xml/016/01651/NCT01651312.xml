	<brief_summary>The study aims to assess the routes and the extent of metabolism and excretion of YM178 after a single dose of 14C-radiolabeled YM178 administered as a drinking solution in healthy male volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Systemic Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism and Excretion Routes of YM178 in Man, After Administration of Radio-labeled YM178</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Four subjects are studied in one group. Each subject stays in the clinic for 6 days, and receives a single oral dose of 14C-labeled YM178. Blood, plasma, urine, feces and expired air are collected for 96h after dosing. If 14C-radioactivity quick counts show that radioactivity in urine or feces is above acceptable limits (ie. &gt; 50 dpm/ml in urine; &gt;75 dpm in 400 mg feces) on day 5, subjects are requested to stay in the clinic until the levels decrease. If, after 3 days, radioactivity is still &gt; 50 dpm/ml in urine and/or &gt;75 dpm in 400 mg feces, urine and/or feces is collected at home, until the amount of radioactivity decreases.</detailed_description>
