	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to find out the effects of a drug called panobinostat (LBH589) when given to people like you with multiple myeloma in combination with the drugs lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The safety of this combination of drugs will also be studied. Your physical state, changes in the state of your multiple myeloma, and laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us decide if panobinostat combined with dexamethasone and lenalidomide is safe and effective. This goal of this study therefore is to determine the activity of the combination of panobinostat thrice weekly every other week, lenalidomide, and weekly dexamethasone in a similar group of subjects. The doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone will be that which is approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma and you will take each drug at a specific frequency over a 4 week (28 day) period. This period is called a "study cycle".</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II, Single-Center, Oral Panobinostat in Combination With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma (MM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug, panobinostat, is made by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Panobinostat has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and thus is considered an experimental drug in this research study. Panobinostat is not available to you "on the market" (available for you to buy). It is only available in clinical trials for patients like you with your medical condition. Panobinostat is a drug that may slow down the growth of multiple myeloma or kill multiple myeloma cells by blocking certain enzymes (proteins produced by cells). Panobinostat has shown effects against cancers such as multiple myeloma in laboratory studies and in studies using animals; however, it is not known if this medicine will show the same activity in humans. As of 31st December 2009, a total of 1116 patients have already received treatment with panobinostat. Unlike panobinostat, lenalidomide (Revlimid©) and dexamethasone are approved by the FDA and are already available for purchase on the US market. Clinical trials have shown that lenalidomide, especially taken with dexamethasone, produces positive clinical responses with manageable side effects when given to subjects with multiple myeloma. In this study, subjects will take panobinostat capsules, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone all orally. The purpose of this combination is to interfere with the cancerous cells in multiple and different ways as each of these drugs acts differently on cancer cells. By combining the drugs and giving them at the same time, it might be possible to slow the progression of your disease, rather than if study drugs were given separately. Researchers have combined laboratory studies on animals with this drug combination and the combined effect has been shown to be worthwhile to justify clinical trials in humans.</detailed_description>
