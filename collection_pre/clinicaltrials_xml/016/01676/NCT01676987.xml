	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose, single-capsule budesonide(400µg)-formoterol(12µg) combination, in comparison with budesonide alone, both delivered via a dry powder inhaler, in 181 patients with uncontrolled asthma.This was Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III, parallel clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of a Fixed-dose, Single-capsule Budesonide-formoterol Combination in Uncontrolled Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the age of the patients ranged from 18 to 77 years. After a run-in period of 4 weeks, during which all of the patients received budesonide twice a day, they were randomized into one of the treatment groups for 12 weeks, twice a day.
