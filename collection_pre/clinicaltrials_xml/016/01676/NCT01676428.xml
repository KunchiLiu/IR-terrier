	<brief_summary>This is a "proof of concept" study, to assess the feasibility of introducing a novel high-precision radiotherapy technique called "stereotactic radiosurgery" (SRS) or "stereotactic body radiotherapy" (SBRT) for the treatment of kidney cancers in Australia. This study aims to invite 20 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 10 patients with isolated adrenal metastases from non-small cell carcinoma who are either medically inoperable, high risk for surgery, or decline surgery to participate. In cohort of patients with renal cell carcinoma, both patients with primary disease only, and those patients who have limited metastases (≤5) will be eligible. Besides technical feasibility of delivering this treatment, this study will be to assess efficacy, toxicity and tumour response using a novel imaging biomarker called diffusion weighted-MRI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FASTRACK is a 2 -cohort, non-randomised prospective feasibility study. Anticipated total duration of accrual is approximately 24 months, with all patients expected to complete all protocol treatment and imaging within a further 3 months. The trial will close after the last patient has completed his/her last protocol related follow-up visit (at 12 months post-treatment). Cohort 1: patients with renal cell carcinoma within the kidney Cohort 2: patients with solitary adrenal metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma The investigational treatment will be prescribed the covering isodose, ensuring that 99% of the PTV is covered by 100% of the dose (D99=100%). It is anticipated that most treatments should be highly conformal. Treatment must be delivered with at least six (6) non-opposing conformal megavoltage photon beams. It is anticipated that a typical range of beam numbers would be 8 to 12, comprising of at least 6 co-planar beams and 1-2 non-coplanar beams. No cytotoxic chemotherapy is allowed within 3 weeks or concurrently with respect to the investigational treatment. Consultation with the treating radiation oncologist is strongly recommended if chemotherapy is to be considered after the investigational treatment and before documented disease progression, to prevent unforeseen combined toxicities. Targeted agents (such as sunitinib) are exempt from this recommendation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years old All patients must have radiological diagnosis or biopsy confirmed diagnosis of either: 1. Cohort 1: renal cell carcinoma with a single lesion within kidney, or with primary kidney tumour intact and no more than 5 documented metastases, or 2. Cohort 2: single adrenal metastases with extra‐adrenal disease controlled ECOG performance of 0‐2 inclusive. Either medically inoperable, technically high risk for surgery or decline surgery. Informed consent. Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks of commencement of treatment, or concurrently with treatment. Delivery of targeted agents (such as sunitinib) are allowable only when at least 7 days separate the delivery of the proposed agent and the delivery of the stereotactic radiotherapy.
