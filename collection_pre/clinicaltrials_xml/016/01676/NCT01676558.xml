	<brief_summary>Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Korea. Although there is standard therapy, which is called 'R-CHOP', many obstacles to use aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as old age, poor performance status, refractoriness, and relapsed disease still remains. So we investigate the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using 131I-rituximab in refractory or relapsed patients with DLBCL.</brief_summary>
