	<brief_summary>Multi-center, dual cohort (randomized and single vessel) study designed to demonstrate feasibility, initial safety and performance of the Kips Bay Medical, Inc. eSVS® Mesh as an external vein support device for use over saphenous vein grafts during coronary artery bypass surgery. In the Randomized Cohort, each study subject will receive a SVG without Mesh (control) and a SVG with the eSVS Mesh (treatment). In the Single Vessel Cohort, each study subject will receive one SVG with the eSVS Mesh.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Randomized Cohort: Requires CABG surgery with a SVG to the right coronary artery (RCA) system AND the left circumflex artery (LCX) system with a ≥ 70% stenosis in each of the two systems. Single Vessel Cohort: Requires CABG surgery with a SVG to the RCA system or the LCX system with a &gt; 70% stenosis in the system. Medial sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during surgery. Both saphenous vein graft length are adequate for planned intervention, vein outer diameter is between 3.6 mm and 7.0 mm and double wall thickness less than 1.4 mm. Agreement to postprocedure followup contact and testing (including followup coronary angiogram). Concomitant nonCABG cardiac procedure. Prior cardiac surgery (does not include percutaneous procedures). Cerebrovascular or transient ischemia attack within 30 days of the CABG procedure. Age &gt; 85 years. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%. Creatinine &gt; 133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) prior to CABG procedure or on chronic dialysis. STEMI within 7 days or total CK &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal prior to the CABG procedure. Both enrolled grafts will feed nonviable myocardial territory. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease (&gt; 70%) distal to either of the enrolled target coronary arteries. Randomized Cohort: By visual estimate, the target coronary artery diameter of both the right coronary system and left circumflex system must be within 1.5mm of each other. Planned endarterectomy of the target coronary artery.</criteria>
