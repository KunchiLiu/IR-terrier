	<brief_title>Chemokine Mechanisms in Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pelvic pain is the hallmark of patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), a non-bacterial category of prostatitis that is a significant source of morbidity in American men. The cause of CPPS is unknown and there is a lack of convenient biomarkers for diagnosis of this syndrome. This project will examine the expression of biomarkers in expressed prostatic fluid from adult men with and without a diagnosis of CPPS. Thus our specific aim is to validate the use of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha and mast cell tryptase as biomarkers for CPPS in humans and correlate their levels with CPPS symptoms.</detailed_description>

Agreed to participate in Study procedures. Participant is at least 18 years of age. Participant reports a response of at least 1 on the pain, pressure or discomfort scale (SYMQ, Question #1). Participant reports pain or discomfort in any of the 8 domains of the Male Genitourinary Pain Index (MGUPI) (items 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d). These CP/CPPS symptoms been present for the majority of the time during any 3 months in the previous 6 months. Participant has an ongoing symptomatic urethral stricture. Participant has an ongoing neurological disease or disorder affecting the bladder or bowel fistula. Participant has a history of cystitis caused by tuberculosis, radiation therapy or Cytoxan/cyclophosphamide therapy. Participant has augmentation cystoplasty or cystectomy. Participant has a history of cancer (with the exception of skin cancer). Participant has current major psychiatric disorder or other psychiatric or medical issues that would interfere with study participation (e.g. dementia, psychosis, upcoming major surgery, etc). Participant diagnosed with unilateral orchialgia, without pelvic symptoms. Participant has a history of transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), balloon dilation, prostate cryosurgery, or laser procedure. Control group exclusion criteria In addition to the exclusion criteria listed above additional criteria for control subjects are as follows. 1. In the past year, symptoms of discomfort or pain in the pelvic region for extended periods of time. 2. Volunteers who have had a urinary tract infection with a urine culture value of &gt;100,000 CFU/ml within the past three months. 3. Volunteers treated with intravesical chemotherapy or BCG. 4. Volunteers who have had any of the following sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma or trichomonas. 5. Volunteers with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, but not irritable bowel syndrome)</criteria>
