	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To compare the 24-hour glycemic profile in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) between a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus at steady state Secondary Objectives: - To compare the change of Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), Self-monitoring plasma glucose (SMPG) and Postprandial Plasma Glucose (PPG) between the 2 treatments; - To compare the efficacy of the 2 treatments on glycemic control in glycemic parameters (1,5-anhydroglucitol and hemoglobin A1c (glycosylated hemoglobin; HbA1c)); - To compare the occurrence of hypoglycemia between the 2 treatments; - To assess the safety and tolerability of a new formulation of insulin glargine.</brief_summary>
