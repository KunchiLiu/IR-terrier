	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two surgical methods of adrenalectomy. One is called PRA(posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy), which is performed through 3 or 4 holes at patient's back. The other is LA(laparoscopic adrenalectomy) which is performed through patient's abdominal cavity after making 3 or 4 holes in the abdomen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Posterior Retroperitoneoscopic Adrenalectomy and Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1992, transabdominal LA(laparoscopic adrenalectomy) has been a standard method of adrenalectomy. This traditional method has been used widely because this procedure provides wide view of the whole abdomen which is familiar to surgeons. But due to its unique location at retroperitoneum, adrenal is still not easy to approach. So various retroperitoneal approaches were designed and adjusted. Among those, PRA(posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy) has showed good outcomes in many institutes. PRA facilitates direct approach to kidney and adrenal gland, and so operative time can be shortened. But there has been no randomized controlled trial between these two methods. Therefore, as experienced surgeons in both methods, we want to practice this study.</detailed_description>
