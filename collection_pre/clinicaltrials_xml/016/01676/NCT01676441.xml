	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Principal investigator has performed a clinical trial using autologous MSCs in patients with cervical spinal cord injury. The results revealed the safety of autologous MSC. This Phase II, III single-center trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation direct to injured spinal cord site via laminectomy. After recovery from the operation, the subjects receive 4 weeks of physical and occupational therapy.</detailed_description>
