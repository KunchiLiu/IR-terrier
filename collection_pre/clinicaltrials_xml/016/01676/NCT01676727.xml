	<brief_summary>This study is intended to collect data regarding the clinical utility, safety and performance of the Medtronic CoreValve速 System for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) in patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis for which treatment via direct aortic access (DA) is selected. As part of the study analysis, resource utilization together with the Quality of Life questionnaires data will provide an important input into cost effectiveness analysis.</brief_summary>
