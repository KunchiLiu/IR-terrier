	<brief_title>Study of Dovitinib and Biomarkers in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purposes of this study are 1) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of dovitinib and 2) to prospectively estimate the prevalence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling alterations in patients with advanced non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced CRC who have progressed on anti-VEGF treatment. Additionally, the investigators will make exploratory initial observations of the relationship between FGF signaling alterations and the clinical activity of dovitinib. This trial is expected to provide key biologic information that will inform the clinical development of dovitinib and provide initial evaluation of the analytic characteristics of these potential predictive biomarkers of its efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer for which no potentially curative treatment options are available Any number of prior treatment regimens are allowed Immediate prior treatment regimen must have included an antiVEGF agent. Acceptable antiVEGF therapy includes bevacizumab, sunitinib, or sorafenib. For other antiVEGF therapies, contact the principal investigator. Last dose administered of bevacizumab must be at least 21days but not more than 56days from enrollment. Last dose of antiVEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor must be at least 7days but not more than 56days from enrollment. Willingness to consent to research biopsy Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria Available tumor site amenable to core needle biopsy as determined by the treating investigator. Any questions regarding suitability of site for biopsy will be adjudicated by the principal investigator.
