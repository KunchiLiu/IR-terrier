	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose (MTD)) of weekly dinaciclib in combination with every 3 week pembrolizumab in patients with advanced breast cancer. Once this is defined, a 20 patient dose expansion will be performed at this MTD in patients with metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable triple negative breast cancer, to evaluate the efficacy of combined dinaciclib and pembrolizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b Dose De-escalation Trial of Dinaciclib With Pembrolizumab for Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label phase Ib trial of weekly dinaciclib in combination with every 3 week pembrolizumab in patients with advanced breast cancer. Any number of prior therapies is allowed. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks at a fixed dose of 200 mg IV. Dinaciclib will be administered D1 and D8 of a 21 day cycle by 2-hour intravenous infusion. In phase 1, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dinaciclib monotherapy in solid tumors is 12 mg/m2. The starting dose level of this study will be dinaciclib 12 mg/m2 in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV as no overlapping toxicities are expected. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window is 21 days (1 cycle). The dose of dinaciclib will not be escalated beyond the 12 mg/m2 starting dose level, but dose de-escalation will occur if necessary following a 3+3 design. The primary objective is to define the maximum tolerated dose of dinaciclib when given weekly in this combination and schedule. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Once a MTD for dinaciclib is defined, a 20 patient dose expansion will be performed at the MTD in patients with metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable triple negative breast cancer. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the preliminary efficacy of this combination using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. Exploratory studies characterizing and correlating PDL-1 (programmed death ligand-1) and MYC (myelocytomatosis oncogene) overexpression with clinical response will be performed. Tumor biopsies are optional in the dose escalation cohort, but mandatory in the dose expansion cohort unless otherwise specified.</detailed_description>

Female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test βhCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) within 72 hours prior to first doses of study medication . If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. 9. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. 10. Patient has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent 11. Any number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is allowed 12. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates or RANKligand (Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor KappaB ligand) inhibitors is allowed Dose expansion phase 1. Histologically documented metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer that is Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) &lt;10% expression and does not overexpress HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) protein (IHC 0, 1+, or 2+and FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) &lt;2.0) 2. Patient must consent to a biopsy of a site of disease unless the only site of disease is lung/pleura, bone, or deemed unsafe by the principal investigator 3. Patient must have measureable disease 4. All other inclusion criteria per the dose escalation cohorts EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Both dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts 1. Patient who has had radiotherapy or hormonal therapy within 2 weeks, chemotherapy within 3 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C or bevacizumab), anticancer monoclonal antibody for direct antineoplastic treatment within 4 weeks, or who has not recovered from toxicity due to previous agents administered. If the patient has residual toxicity from prior treatment, toxicity must be ≤ Grade 1 (except for neuropathy and alopecia). 2.
