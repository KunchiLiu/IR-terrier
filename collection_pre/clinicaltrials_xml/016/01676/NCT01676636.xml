	<brief_summary>The SickKids-led research team is currently developing a prenatal micronutrient powder that will contain calcium, iron, and folic acid with different absorption characteristics. Once the powder is developed, it can be incorporated into various oral delivery vehicles. The overall effectiveness of a micronutrient program is highly dependent on the acceptance and regular consumption of supplements (i.e., adherence) by the targeted users. This is a study of the preference, acceptability, and palatability of 4 alternative delivery vehicles for the innovative prenatal multiple micronutrient supplement: traditional tablets, oral disintegrating tablets, unflavoured powder with a suspension agent, and flavoured powder with a suspension agent. This study will be conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study hypothesizes that that the formulation of the delivery vehicle will impact preference, acceptability, and palatability.</brief_summary>
