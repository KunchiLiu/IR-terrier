	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe, Oceania and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy of insulin degludec/liraglutide in controlling glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and OAD therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.09.0% (5375 mmol/mol) (both inclusive) Treatment with daily GLP1 receptor agonist at maximum dose according to local label (i.e. 1.8 mg once daily (OD) Victoza速 (liraglutide) or 10 microgram twice daily (BID) Byetta速 (exenatide)) or documented maximum tolerated dose (i.e. 1.2 mg OD Victoza速 (liraglutide) or 5 microgram BID Byetta速 (exenatide)) in combination with a stable daily dose of metformin (equal to or above 1500 mg or documented maximum tolerated dose) for 90 days or more prior to screening visit (Visit 1) BMI (body mass index) equal to or below 40 kg/m^2 Any use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (except for metformin, pioglitazone and sulphonylurea) for 90 days or less prior to screening visit (Visit 1) Use of any drug (except metformin,pioglitazone, sulphonylurea and GLP1 receptor agonist) which in the Investigator's opinion could interfere with the blood glucose level (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) Treatment with any insulin regimen (short term treatment due to intercurrent illness including gestational diabetes is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator) Screening calcitonin equal to or above 50 ng/l Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) Cardiovascular disorders defined as: congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIIV), diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris, cerebral stroke and/or myocardial infarction within the past 52 weeks prior to screening visit (Visit 1) and/or planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation procedures Proliferative retinopathy requiring acute treatment or maculopathy (macular oedema) according to the Investigator's opinion Subjects with a clinically significant, active (during the past 12 months) disease of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrinological (except for the type 2 diabetes mellitus), neurological, genitourinary or haematological system that in the opinion of the Investigator may confound the results of the trial or pose additional risk in administering trial products History of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis</criteria>
