	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to compare in a real-world setting the efficacy of traditional training (today's guideline, vigorously or moderate exercise) and amount of aerobic interval training (1-AIT) in reduction of risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome. The secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of traditional moderate training (today's guideline) and amount of aerobic interval training (1-AIT vs. 4-AIT) in improving aerobic capacity, cardiovascular function, skeletal muscle contractile function, skeletal muscle energy metabolism, left ventricle systolic and diastolic function at rest and right ventricular function. The investigators hypothesized that aerobic interval training would reverse features of the metabolic syndrome more than traditional training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study describes a randomized multicenter clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a 16-week program, with one year follow up of vigorously exercise defined from today's guidelines (performed as 4-AIT (4x4min aerobe interval training)) yields larger beneficial effects in reducing risk factors constituting the metabolic syndrome than continuously moderate intensity exercise (CME) defined from today's guidelines. Furthermore, the importance of the amount of aerobic interval training remains unclear and it is unknown how little "one can get away with" and still obtain substantial beneficial cardiovascular effects. Therefore, the investigators will also determine whether one bout of AIT (1-AIT (1x4min aerobe interval training)) can give beneficial effects compared to 4-AIT and CME. Evaluation criteria are risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome, aerobic capacity measured as peak oxygen uptake and compliance to intervention. Assessments will be made before and after the 16-week program, and at six month, and 1 and 3 years follow-up. Calculations based on previously results suggest a total number of 750 patients randomized 1:1:1 (250 in each group) to the three intervention groups is sufficient to detect larger beneficial effects with AIT with a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided test) and statistical power of 0.85 (primary endpoint is reduction in cardiovascular risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome).</detailed_description>
