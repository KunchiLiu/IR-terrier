	<brief_summary>To establish the efficacy of screening for anemia and treatment of mild anemia with iron and vitamins prior to THR and TKR as a means of increasing hemoglobin and reducing perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron and Vitamin Adminstration Prior to Joint Replacement to Prevent Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with mild anemia will be identified at preoperative clinic visit - Patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria - Eligible patients will have laboratory testing performed as follows: CBC, liver and kidney function tests, serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, serum folic acid, vitamin B12 and C-reactive protein - Patients will be assigned to a deficient group or non-deficient group depending upon laboratory hematinic values - Patients in the "non-deficient' group will be randomized using a computer-generated code to treatment or no treatment - Treatment will begin within 2 weeks of laboratory testing and 4-6 weeks prior to surgery. - Hematinic therapy will consist of oral ferric hydrochloride polymaltose 200 mg/d and folic acid 0.4 mg/d; sublingual vitamin B12 1000 µg three times a week - On the day of surgery laboratory testing will be performed as follows: CBC, kidney and liver function tests, serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, serum folic acid, vitamin B12 and C-reactive protein. - The same surgical team in each center will operate on all study patients and will be blinded to the preoperative hemoglobin - Routine postoperative management will be provided as determined by the treating physicians - Blood transfusion will be decided upon by a study physician at each center blinded to the patients' group assignment and preoperative hemoglobin - The primary outcome will be perioperative blood transfusion (from 24 hours prior to surgery until hospital discharge) - Secondary outcomes will be length of hospitalization, postoperative wound infection, walking ability across room at 30 days</detailed_description>
