	<brief_title>Comparison Between Losartan and Benazepril in Diabetic Hypertensive Patients Not Controlled by Amlodipine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction and vascular rigidity are two pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this relationship. Recent publications showed that both ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced) and ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) were capable of improving vascular stiffness and endothelial function, and that these effects occurred despite blood pressure reduction. This study main objective is to assess if ARB (losartan) effects are different from ACEi (benazepril) in endothelial function in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and blood pressure not controlled by amlodipine and its relationship to statin current use. Secondary analysis of vascular stiffness will be measured by pulse wave velocity and augmentation index. Echocardiographic parameters, such as indexes of diastolic function, will also be measured.</detailed_description>
