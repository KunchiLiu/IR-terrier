	<brief_summary>Protein-energy malnutrition and muscle wasting are a common finding among patients with liver cirrhosis. Its prevalence may range from 50-90% depending on the methods used for nutritional assessment. Even stable cirrhotic patients referred as Child A have muscle depletion and the majority of patients classified as Child C have significant depletion. Malnutrition has been shown to be related to several complications of cirrhosis Despite the importance of nutritional status in patient's outcome, there is no gold standard for nutritional assessment. Traditional techniques used in healthy subjects to assess nutritional status cannot be used in cirrhotic patients due especially to ascites and peripheral edema, and altered rates of biochemical markers due to liver failure. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis has emerged as a useful method to assess body composition and nutritional status especially in patients at the extremes of body weight (fluid overload, excess of adipose tissue, etc.). The aim of this study is to evaluate whether malnutrition assessed by bioelectrical impedance vector analysis is related to the development of hepatic encephalopathy</brief_summary>
