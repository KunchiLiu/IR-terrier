	<brief_summary>This was an open-label, non-randomised, single-dose study in 6 healthy male subjects. Subjects attended a screening visit within 28 days before drug administration. Subjects were admitted to the clinical unit on the morning of the day before dosing (Day -1) and received a single oral administration of study drug in a fasted state on Day 1. Subjects were resident in the clinic for up to 7 days after dosing; they could be discharged sooner if a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;95% was achieved, or if a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90% was achieved and &lt;1% was collected within 2 separate, consecutive 24 h periods. At specified times during the study period, blood samples were taken and urine and faeces were collected for PK analysis. Safety assessments were also performed.</brief_summary>
