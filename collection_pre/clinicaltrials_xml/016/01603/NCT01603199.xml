	<brief_summary>Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic cholestatic autoimmune liver disease with a progressive course that can lead to liver cirrhosis. There are few studies on dietary management in primary biliary cirrhosis and most of them have focused on micronutrients specifically vitamin D intake to prevent osteoporosis, and lipid control to prevent hyperlipidemia, but few recommendations have been made regarding a complete dietary approach. Fiber has been proven to increase the excretion of nitrogen products and consequently reduce its blood levels, and an adequate protein intake (1- 1.5 g per kg) has shown to decrease endogenous catabolism in cirrhotic patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a high-protein, high-fiber diet in the nutritional status of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
