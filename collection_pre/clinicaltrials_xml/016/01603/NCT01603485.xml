	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 3 different modified-release formulations of lersivirine and compare it to the PK of the immediate-release tablet. The effect of food on the PK of one of the modified-release tablets will also be assess along with the safety and tolerability of each treatment.</brief_summary>
