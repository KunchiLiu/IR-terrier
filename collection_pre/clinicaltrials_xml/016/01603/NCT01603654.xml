	<brief_summary>Adequate bowel cleansing is essential for effective colonoscopy. Acceptance of colon preparation affects the quality of colon cleansing. The study is aimed at comparing the efficacy, safety and acceptability of sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate (PMC) and low-volume PEG -ascorbic acid (PEG+ASC)in colon cleansing, and to identify predictors of poor bowel preparation.</brief_summary>
