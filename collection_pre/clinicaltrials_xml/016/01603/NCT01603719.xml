	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of an Infant Formula With Milkfat and Prebiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An experimental infant formula with added prebiotics (GOS) and with a higher content of palmitic acid esterified in beta-position is to be tested in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. The addition of prebiotics to an infant formula should favor growth of a beneficial bifidogenic intestinal flora and have positive effects on immunity, promote softer stool formation and short chain fatty acid content in the stools. Higher proportion of beta-palmitic acid esterified in 2nd position of the triglyceride should reduce formation of fatty acid-calcium soaps in the stools and promote calcium and fat absorption in the gut, therfor reduce symptoms of constipation and colics.</detailed_description>
