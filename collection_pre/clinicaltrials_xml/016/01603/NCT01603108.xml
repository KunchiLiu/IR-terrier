	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the administration of a poorly-absorbable antibiotic (rifaximin) for the first three months after liver transplant will reduce the amount of fibrosis (or scarring of the liver) in liver transplant patients with recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) by lowering serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a protein in blood that comes from the bacteria in intestines and may cause scarring in the liver. Approximately 60 subjects will participate in this study. Subjects will be part of the study for approximately 1 year post transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rifaximin to Prevent Recurrent HCV-Related Fibrosis After Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic liver infection and remains the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT). Although LT is a cure for cirrhosis of the liver, it does not always cure HCV infection or reinfection of post-transplanted liver. Post-LT recurrent HCV can lead to accelerated liver fibrosis. Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gut-derived bacteria has shown to be at elevated levels in patients with cirrhosis due to HCV compared to normal controls. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that LPS contributes to cause of liver fibrosis, specifically in patients with post-LT recurrent HCV, and this effect maybe modified with the poorly absorbed antibiotic, rifaximin, which alter the gut flora of the patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must provide written informed consent before any study assessment is performed Age â‰¥ 18 years Willing and able to sign informed consent Chronic HCV infection with viremia Listed for liver transplantation Demonstrate ability to take oral medications prior to randomization (post LT) Age &lt; 18 years old Unwilling/able to sign informed consent Cleared HCV infection (and therefore not at risk for recurrent HCV) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection Hepatitis B (HBV) coinfection Participation in another interventional clinical trial Females of childbearing (reproductive) potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and agree to use an acceptable method of contraception throughout their participation in the study Subjects with history of hypersensitivity to rifaximin, rifampin, rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components of rifaximin Subjects with history of tuberculosis infection or has received treatment for tuberculosis infection. If subject has previous positive test for tuberculosis antigen then they must have current negative chest xray to be eligible Subject has diarrhea and positive Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin via stool examination during Screening period. NOTE: Stool examination for C. difficile toxin will be performed on subjects who have diarrhea during the screening period. Results of stool tests should be confirmed as negative prior to randomization</criteria>
