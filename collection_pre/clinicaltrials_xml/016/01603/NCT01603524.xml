	<brief_summary>This proposal outlines the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of a new approach to integrating smoking cessation services into routine interactions with patients in the primary care setting using an adaptation of the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC). The OMSC aims to systematically identify the smoking status of all patients, provide brief cessation advice, and offer evidence-based cessation support to those interested in embarking on a quit attempt. This study will provide important new evidence to assist with the development of a more comprehensive cessation system in the province of Ontario and across Canada.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrating the "Ottawa Model" for Smoking Cessation Into Primary Care Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-component intervention has been designed to facilitate the uptake of the OMSC using best evidence regarding the integration of smoking cessation intervention into primary care practice. The secondary objective of the study is to examine the incremental value of providing tailored performance feedback to primary care practitioners when delivered as part of the OMSC intervention program.</detailed_description>
