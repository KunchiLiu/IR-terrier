	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, multiple dose, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of AV-203, an ERBB3 inhibitory antibody, administered once every 2 weeks via intravenous (IV) infusion in subjects with metastatic or advanced solid tumors. Once the RP2D is determined, patients with tumor types of interest will be evaluated in an expansion cohort at the RP2D for safety and anti-tumor activity.</brief_summary>
