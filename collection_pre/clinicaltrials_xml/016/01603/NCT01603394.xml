	<brief_title>Pilot Study Of Pregabalin And Prediction Of Treatment Response In Patients With Postherpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was stopped on 26 April 2013 due to feasibility issues (low enrollment) not safety. The overall risk-benefit of Lyrica has not changed at all due to termination of this trial. Only 9 of the 150 patients were enrolled into the trial, so we are unable to get adequate results from this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have pain present for more than 3 months after the healing of the herpes zoster skin rash. At screening (V1) and baseline (V2), subjects must have a score of &gt;=4 on the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain (1 week recall period). At baseline (V2), at least 4 pain diaries must be completed satisfactorily within the last 7 days and the average pain score must be &gt;=4. Subjects having other severe pain that may confound assessment or self evaluation of the pain due to PHN.
