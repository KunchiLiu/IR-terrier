	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections with increasing doses (up to 800 units) of Botulinum toxin type A into muscles of the leg and/or arm are safe and effective in treating patients with spasticity on one body side due to cerebral causes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Dose Titration Study of Botulinum Toxin Type A to Treat Spasticity in the Leg and Arm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A dose-titration approach will be used over three injection cycles, with a flexible observation period after injections of 12-16 weeks and a total duration of up to 48 weeks. Cycle 1 and 2: upper and/or lower limb to be treated; Cycle 3: upper and lower limb to be treated.</detailed_description>
