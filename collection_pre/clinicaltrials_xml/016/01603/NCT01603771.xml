	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether healthy, sedentary older adults have increased activation of specific brain areas, in response to exercise and cognitive training, in comparison to a control group, and whether improvements in psychometric test performance are related to increased activation of brain networks. Participants, between age 55-75 years will be recruited from an ongoing study of exercise and cognitive training, to undergo Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic imaging (fcMRI).</brief_summary>
