	<detailed_description>Recently, a new generation of OCT devices relying on spectral domain technology (SD-OCT) has been introduced and allows for higher-resolution imaging. Based on this technology we can identify variable changes at the retinal surface such as, retinal thickening with cyst formation, swelling in the inner and outer nuclear layers and subretinal fluid. The introduction of an eye-tracking mode has allowed a better insight into the development of retinal morphologic changes The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and structural morphology of PCME after successful uncomplicated cataract surgery in patients with previous pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and indocyanine green-assisted peeling of an epiretinal membrane and the internal limiting membrane (ILM).</detailed_description>
