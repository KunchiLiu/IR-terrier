	<brief_title>Effect of Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone on Pain, Swelling and Trismus After Third Molar Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Third molar surgery is often associated with significant post-surgical sequelae. The trauma caused to soft and bony tissue can result in considerable pain, swelling and trismus. Symptoms begin gradually having a peak 2 days after extraction. The use of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone can be a valuable tool when performing moderate to moderately severe oral surgical procedures. No clear consensus have emerged yet regarding patient selection, dosage, timing and type of administration of steroid. In this light, this clinical trial aim to compare the effect of preemptive dexamethasone and methylprednisolone to prevent pain, swelling and limitation in mouth opening following third molar extraction.</detailed_description>
