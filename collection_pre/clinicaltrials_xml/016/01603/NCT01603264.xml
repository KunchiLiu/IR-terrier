	<brief_summary>In this study, healthy male volunteers will receive a single intravenous administration of either PF-05280014 or trastuzumab (United States) or trastuzumab (European Union). During the course of the study, the pharmacokinetics will be assessed by sampling the levels of drug in the blood, and by comparing these levels among the different administration arms of PF-05280014 and the US-licensed and EU-approved trastuzumab products. Safety, tolerability, and immunologic response also will be evaluated throughout.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Trastuzumab</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Healthy male subjects (healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests). Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2 and a total body weight &gt; 50 kg (110 lbs). Male subjects must agree that they and their female spouse/partners will use adequate contraception (2 forms of birth control, one of which must be barrier method) or be of nonchildbearing potential. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within the normal range as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) within 8 weeks prior to randomization. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic or allergic disease, or clinical findings at screening excluding untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing. Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results. Previous exposure to a monoclonal antibody or current use of other biologics. History of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a therapeutic drug or benzyl alcohol. Use of prescription or non prescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
