	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the effect of minimal (MECC) versus conventional (CECC) extracorporeal circulation on perfusion characteristics and remote end-organ protection (lungs, brain, kidneys, liver, stomach, intestine), after elective coronary bypass grafting (CABG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Minimal Versus Conventional Extracorporeal Circulation in Coronary Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to investigate whether coronary surgery with MECC offers advantage over conventional CPB (CECC). In order to draw an evidence-based conclusion, the investigators aim to evaluate perfusion characteristics during coronary surgery with MECC and associated remote end-organ function. Improved end-organ protection translates into improved clinical outcome which greatly affects quality of life. This is the first study in the literature adequately powered to analyse organ pathophysiology during surgery with MECC and at the same time correlating common clinical variables with a detailed quality of life evaluation. Superiority of MECC could provide firm evidence towards widespread use of MECC in coronary surgery as standard of care.</detailed_description>
