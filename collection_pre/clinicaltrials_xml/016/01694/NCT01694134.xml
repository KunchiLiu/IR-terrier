	<brief_summary>The treatment of chronic low back pain is a major objective of public healthcare, because it causes an important number of sick leaves. A correlation between clinical observations and an inflammatory discopathy has been underlined, but there is currently any reference treatment. In this study, the main objective is to assess the efficacy of an intradiscal injection of corticoids versus local anaesthetic on the treatment of pain of patients with low back pain associated to a Modic I discopathy.</brief_summary>
