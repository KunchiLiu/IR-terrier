	<criteria>Sex: male or female Age: from 18 to 80 years Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors that have failed standard therapies (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and for which no curative options exist, including, but not limited to: NonSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma Malignant melanoma Esophageal carcinoma Head and neck carcinoma HLAA*24:02 MAGEA4 positive in the test by RTPCR on tumor tissue or immunohistochemistry of resected tissue of the patient. PS ECOG 0 or &lt;2 Laboratory tests results 7 days before the start of treatment: White blood cells: more than 3.0 × 109/L Platelets: more than 100 × 109/L Neutrophils: more than 1.5 × 109/L Hemoglobin: more than 80g/L Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase: less than 2.5 folds of the upper normal limit (ULN) Serum glutamicoxal (o) acetic transaminase: less than 2.5 × ULN Serum bilirubin: less than 1.25 × ULN Serum creatinine: less than 1.25 × ULN Pregnancy test: the test of women of childbearing period must be negative 7 days before the start of treatment Contraception: male and female subjects of childbearing period must adopt a reliable method of contraception before entry into this study until 30 days after stopping this study Informed consent: subject must have the ability to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent Patients with lifethreatening condition or complication other than their basic disease Pregnant or lactation. Patients both males and female with reproductive potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1 year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to registration Active systemic infections History of neoplasms: other neoplasms Medical history: active CNS disease, or congestive heart failure, or severe coronary artery disease, or cardiac arrhythmias, or concomitant corticosteroid therapy Metastasis: clinical symptoms of brain metastasis Other clinical trial: the subject received other clinical trial before this study Laboratory tests: the serum test of human immunodeficiency virus, or hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus was positive Compliance: poor compliance</criteria>
