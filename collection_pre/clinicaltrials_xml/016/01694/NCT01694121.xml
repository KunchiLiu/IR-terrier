	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21, in Boston, MA. A more larger scale, two-armed quasi-experimental controlled trial design will be used to test MEN Count among Black men recruited/enrolled from an STD clinic and other community-recruitment methods in Washington, DC. Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed quasi-experimental design will be conducted in which participants will receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.</brief_summary>
