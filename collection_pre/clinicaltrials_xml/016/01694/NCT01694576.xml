	<brief_summary>By this clinical trial, the investigators are trying to give an answer to such a question. Whether NPC patients staged N2-3M0 need adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and platinum after concurrent chemoradiation?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NPC Staged N2-3M0:Adjuvant Chemotherapy or Just Observation After Concurrent Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent research (Lancet Oncology 2012)shows that no survival benefits were achieved by adding adjuvant chemotherapy after concurrent chemoradiation in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. But in patients with even high risk of distant metastasis(staged N2-3M0),is adjuvant chemotherapy necessary?</detailed_description>
