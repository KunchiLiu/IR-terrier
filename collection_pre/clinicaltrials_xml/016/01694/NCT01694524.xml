	<brief_summary>Few studies dealing with the risk of infectious of nervous system and the utility of lumbar puncture and of emergent neuroimaging among patients with simple febrile seizure between 3 and 11 months age and with complex seizure has been reported. None of these studies was multicentric. Recommendations about management of these children are heterogeneous. The investigators aim to study by an observational retrospective multicentric study the rate of infectious of central nervous system among patients with a complex febrile seizure and among patients between 3 and 11 months age with simple febrile seizure.</brief_summary>
