	<brief_title>Depigoid Birch 5000 Longterm Study in Adults and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigation of the long-term efficacy and safety of Depigoid Birch 5000 according to the perennial treatment regimen in comparison to placebo in adult and adolescent patients with birch pollen-induced allergic rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis to show superiority vs. placebo. As the study includes adolescent patients it is run under an approved PIP. Total study duration per patient will be 5 years: 3 years of perennial treatment (application of study medication at intervals of 4-6 weeks) followed by a treatment-free observational phase of 2 years (seasons).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Availability of an appropriately signed and dated informed consent before any study specific examination, Clinical history of at least 2 years of seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis with or without intermittent asthma due to birch pollen allergy that has required repeated use of symptomatic treatment, Patients must have a minimum level of perception of symptoms from previous seasons defined as at least a moderate symptom level (i.e. a score of 2 on the 4pointLikert scale) in at least 2 symptom categories prior to randomization, Lung function ≥ 80% of the predicted normal value, IgEmediated sensitization has to be verified by: suggestive medical history, and specific IgE reactivity to birch pollen (CAPRAST ≥ 2), and a positive SPT to birch pollen at screening or within 1 months prior to the screening visit. An SPT is considered positive if it results in a wheal diameter of at least 3.0 mm Internet access so that patients can complete the eDiary daily via internet during all 5 pollen seasons covered by the study protocol. History of significant clinical manifestations of allergy as a result of sensitization against coallergies, particularly—but not limited to—grass or weed pollen and perennial allergens (e.g. house dust mites, cat or dog). History of anaphylactic reaction. Moderate or severe persistent asthma (GINA 3 or 4). Mild persistent asthma (GINA 2), according to the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines, necessitating treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids at a daily dose level of &gt; 400 µg budesonide dose equivalents. Lung function &lt; 80% of the predicted normal value (for PEF: highest result of 3 measurements). Acute or chronic inflammatory or infectious airway diseases including recurrent acute or chronic sinusitis. Chronic structural diseases of the affected organs (e.g. eye, nose, lung). History or presence of confirmed or potential diseases of the immune system including autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies of actual clinical relevance. Any disease that prohibits the use of adrenaline (e.g. hyperthyroidism). Atopic dermatitis with SCORAD &gt;30 in the past or at screening. Ongoing or past full courses of SIT against birch pollen within the last 5 years. Topical and systemic treatment with βblockers. Concomitant treatment with substances interfering with the immune system beginning 1 week prior to start of treatment. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 3 months prior to Visit 11. Immunization with vaccines within 7 days prior to Visit 11. Treatment with antihistamines for any reason other than allergic symptoms due to birch pollen allergy. Changed residence between geographical regions since the last birch pollen season or not staying in the geographical region during the predetermined birch pollen season. Nursing (lactating) women or women with a positive pregnancy test at the screening visit. Women of childbearing potential must be using highly effective contraception during participation in this clinical study. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence, or vasectomised partner.</criteria>
