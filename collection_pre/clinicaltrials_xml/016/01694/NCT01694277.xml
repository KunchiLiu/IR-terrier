	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Comparison to Sunitinib in Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour After Progression With Imatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract. Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding to the Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor. The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) joined by a juxtamembrane domain. It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells harbor a mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and tumour growth. Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs. Masitinib (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Imatinib is also a TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST. It might be associated with side effects and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate in the second line treatment of patients with GIST after progression with imatinib.</detailed_description>
