	<brief_summary>To investigate the possible mechanisms of pulmonary and systemic permeability change including cytokine, extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), and oxygenation parameters in patients with sepsis related acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EVLWI Exhibits Pulmonary and Systemic Permeability in Sepsis Related ALI/ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation is a prospective control study. Informed consents will be obtained from all patients or their surrogates prior to the procedure of EVLWI measurement and blood sampling for molecular measurement including cytokines. From July 2011 to June 2014, consecutive septic patients with ARDS in intensive care units (ICUs) will be enrolled at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan. EVLWI will be measured by PiCCO monitoring system. Serum cytokine such as endothelin-1, TNF-alfa, IL-6, Tie-1, Tie-2, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2,VEGF and thrombomodulin will be measured.</detailed_description>
