	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the effects of topical Vitamin D cream (Calcipotriene, also known as Dovonex) on the face and on the bacteria that cause acne. The information gained from this study may lead to new treatments for acne. In this study, Calcipotriene will be compared with a placebo, a cream that looks like Calcipotriene, but contains no active ingredients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Clinical Trial to Determine the Efficacy of Vitamin D for Acne Therapy"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, parallel group comparison of calcipotriene vs. placebo cream. Patients with acne will use calcipotriene or placebo cream 2x/day for 12 weeks and will be assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Each group will have 24 subjects as calculated by power analysis. Three additional subjects for each group will be recruited for possible dropouts and total of 27 subjects will be recruited for each group. Primary endpoint (lesion count) and secondary endpoints described in aims 3.2-3.4 will be determined. Lesion counts will be assessed by one of the investigator physicians or nurse practitioner. Adverse effects including irritation, dry skin, inflammation and worsening of the lesions will be noted at each visit. Photographs will be taken to aid in assessing the clinical changes.</detailed_description>
