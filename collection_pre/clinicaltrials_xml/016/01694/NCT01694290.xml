	<brief_summary>A common tool to cool people in the pre-hospital setting is the chemical ice pack. These are used by athletic trainers, EMS personnel, ER staff, and people in the prehosoital setting. The ability of these to cool a person has never been quantified, the efficiency and extent of cooling, as well as location of placement of ice packs is purely anecdotal. The purpose of this study is to determine whether strategically placed chemical ice packs will provide benefit to individuals subjected to heat stress.</brief_summary>
