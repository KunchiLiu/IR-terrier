	<brief_summary>The main purposes with this trial is to investigate the potential of MRI with diffusion and blood volume, flow in brain to diagnose and to measure treatment effects in patients with intracranial tumors, especially gliomas and metastases in a prospective trial, to evaluate the possibilities to individually adjusted treatment in this category of patients depending on treatment outcomes measured by MRI, to perform clinical follow up in connection with MRI to evaluate a correlation and to perform testing of cognitive ability before, during, and after treatment and to investigate if given treatment causes any decrease in the patients habitual state.</brief_summary>
