	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs are important regulators of many cellular functions but their expression profile in human vitreous is still unclear. Aim of this study is to investigate microRNA expression profile by PCR in human vitreous of patients with various vitreoretinal disorders and compare with that of patients with macular holes which are suggested to be similar to that of healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
