	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of two concurrent injections of AA4500 into the same hand in subjects with multiple Dupuytren's contractures with palpable cords followed 24 to 72 hours later by a finger extension procedure and compare the rate of occurrence of targeted serious adverse events (tendon rupture/ligament injury and anaphylaxis) to historical rates of the same in clinical studies and post-marketing commercial use. The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of two concurrent injections of AA4500.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Two Concurrent Injections of AA4500 in Adult Subjects With Multiple Dupuytren's Contractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology/Study Design: After all pre-injection procedures are completed on Day 1, eligible men and women will receive two concurrent injections AA4500 (AA4500/AA4500) into cord(s) affecting MP and/or PIP joints on the same or different fingers in the selected hand. A finger extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption will be performed (after administration of local anesthesia, if needed) 24 to 72 hours after injection in those subjects who do not have spontaneous disruption of their cord(s). Follow up visits for the evaluation of safety and efficacy will be required for all subjects 24 to 72 hours after injection, and on Days 15, 31, and 61. Upon completion of the day 61 follow-up visit (end of study visit), subjects who require additional treatment in the treated hand may receive up to three additional injections of AA4500 according to the XIAFLEX package insert. Subjects may receive up to a total of five injections and individual cords may receive up to a total of three injections. Subjects who require additional treatment will be followed for safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provide a signed and dated informed consent 2. Be a man or woman ≥ 18 years of age 3. Have a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease and have at least 2 fixedflexion contractures on the same hand that are ≥ 20º in PIP and/or MP joints in fingers, other than the thumbs, which are caused by palpable cord(s) suitable for treatment 4. Have a positive "table top test" defined as the inability to simultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top 5. Have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and before injection of study drug and be using a highly effective (ie, &lt; 1% failure rate) contraception method as judged by the investigator (eg, abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], hormonal [estrogen/progestin] contraceptives, or barrier control) for at least one menstrual cycle prior to study enrollment and for the duration of the study or be surgically sterile (if female of childbearing potential); or be a postmenopausal female (no menses for at least 1 year or hysterectomy). 6. Be able to comply with the study visit schedule as specified in the protocol A subject will be excluded from study participation if he/she: 1. Received surgery (fasciectomy or surgical fasciotomy) and/or needle aponeurotomy/fasciotomy on the selected joints to be treated within 6 months before administration of study drug 2. Has a chronic muscular, neurological, or neuromuscular disorder that affects the hands 3. Has a known systemic allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500 4. Has received any collagenase treatments (eg, Santyl® ointment and/or XIAFLEX®/XIAPEX®) within 30 days before injection of study drug in the hand selected for treatment 5. Is currently receiving or plans to receive anticoagulant medication or has received anticoagulant medication (except for ≤ 150 mg aspirin daily) within 7 days before injection of study drug 6. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study 7. Received an investigational drug within 30 days before injection of study drug 8. Is pregnant or intends on becoming pregnant during the study or is breastfeeding a child 9. Has any clinically significant medical history or condition(s), including conditions that affect the hands, that would, in the opinion of the investigator, substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in the protocol or compromise the scientific objectives of the study 10. Has jewelry on the hand to be treated that cannot be removed</criteria>
