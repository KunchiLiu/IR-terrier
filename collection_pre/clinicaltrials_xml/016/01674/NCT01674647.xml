	<brief_summary>A study for patients with abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) who need to undergo cardioversion (procedure to restore normal heart rhythm). The study will compare patients assigned randomly (like flipping a coin) to either Rivaroxaban or vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The study will measure common medical outcomes for this type of patient such as bleeding and stroke.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men or women aged &gt;= 18 years Hemodynamically stable nonvalvular atrial fibrillation longer than 48 hours or of unknown duration Scheduled for cardioversion (electrical or pharmacological) of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception when sexually active Severe, disabling stroke (modified Rankin score of 4 5, inclusive) within 3 months or any stroke within 14 days prior to randomization Transient ischemic attack within 3 days prior to randomization Acute thromboembolic events or thrombosis (venous/arterial) within the last 14 days prior to randomization Acute Myocardial infarction (MI) within the last 14 days prior to randomization Cardiacrelated criteria: known presence of cardiac thombus or myxoma or valvular atrial fibrillation Active bleeding or high risk for bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant therapy Concomitant medications: indication for anticoagulant therapy other than atrial fibrillation, chronic aspirin therapy &gt; 100 mg daily or dual antiplatelet therapy, strong inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and Pglycoprotein (Pgp) if used systemically Concomitant conditions: childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures, pregnancy, or breast feeding; hypersensitivity to investigational treatment or comparator treatment; calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 30 mL/minute; hepatic disease which is associated with coagulopathy leading to a clinically relevant bleeding risk; any severe condition that would limit life expectancy to less than 6 months; planned invasive procedure with potential for uncontrolled bleeding; inability to take oral medication; ongoing drug addiction or alcohol abuse Any other contraindication listed in the local labeling for the comparator treatment or experimental treatment Participation in a study with an investigational drug or medical device within 30 days prior to randomization</criteria>
