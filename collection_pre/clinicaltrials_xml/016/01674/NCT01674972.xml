	<brief_summary>The incretin effect is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), thus GLP-1 receptor agonists are used for the treatment of T2DM. Insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The incretin effect in patients with NAFLD has not been studied. The aim of this study is to quantify GLP-1 secretion in response to oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) in patients with NAFLD compared to healthy controls. The results of this study will expand the knowledge of the pathophysiology of NAFLD and serve as a rational for potential future treatment strategies.</brief_summary>
