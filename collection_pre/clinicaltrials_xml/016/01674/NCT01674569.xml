	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary biologic activity/efficacy of X-82 in patients with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by change from baseline in visual acuity, fluorescein leakage, retinal thickness and fibrosis, if detectable, based on fundus examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with AMD, as evidenced on fluorescein angiography (FA) and OCT. 2. No previous treatment with antiVEGF therapy or prior antiVEGF therapy with evidence of response to treatment and the need for additional treatment. 3. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA 20/32 to 20/320 in the study eye(s). 4. Adequate bone marrow function. 5. PT within the institutional upper limit of normal. 6. Adequate hepatic function. 7. Adequate renal function; serum creatinine. 8. Ability to swallow oral medication. 9. Age ≥ 50 years. 10. Willing and able to provide written informed consent, comply with the investigational study protocol and return for all study visits. 1. Previous treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT) within 4 months of screening in the study eye. 2. CNV due to causes other than AMD. 3. Geographic atrophy involving the foveal center in the study eye. 4. Any retinal vascular disease or retinal degeneration other than AMD in the study eye. 5. In the opinion of the investigator, any significant disease in the study eye that could compromise bestcorrected visual acuity. 6. Cataract surgery in the study eye within three months of screening. 7. Trabeculectomy or aqueous shunt or valve in the study eye. 8. Intraocular surgery in the study eye within three months of screening; Nd:YAG capsulotomy or laser iridotomy within 30 days of screening. 9. Inadequate pupillary dilation or significant media opacities in the study eye. 10. Use of any investigational agent or participation in any other clinical trial of an investigational agent or investigational therapy within thirty (30) days of baseline with the exception of subjects who are participating in the AREDS2 study. 11. Females of child bearing potential that are pregnant or not using medically acceptable contraception; males unwilling to take adequate contraceptive measures. Females that are breastfeeding are also excluded. 12. Serious allergy to or prior significant adverse reaction to fluorescein. 13. Undiagnosed acute illness first observed during screening or between screening and baseline, or severe concurrent medical conditions that, in the investigators judgment, represent a safety concern. 14. Severe cardiac disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or coronary artery revascularization, or arterial thrombosis within 12 months of start of study drug, inadequately controlled hypertension, or ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring ongoing treatment. 15. QTc ≥450 msec or subjects with a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes or other clinically significant ECG abnormalities as determined by the investigator. 16. Stroke or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of trial entry. 17. Clinically significant impaired renal or hepatic function. 18. Any major surgical procedure within one month of trial entry. 19. Presence of active gastrointestinal (GI) disease or other condition that will interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of X82. 20. Receiving treatment with anticoagulants other than 325 mg of aspirin per day. 21. Serious active infection, other serious medical condition or any other condition that would impair the ability of the subject to administer the investigational drug or to adhere to the study protocol requirements. 22. Presence of any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would prevent the subject from completing the study. 23. No herbal medications with the exception of bilberry are allowed within 7 days of start of study drug.</criteria>
