	<brief_summary>This study wants to determine the activity of a first-line treatment related to Thymidylate Synthetase (TS) Expression. Patients with the diagnosis of non-squamous advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung-Cancer (Stage IV) and without evidence of EGFR mutation may be enclosed in this clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TS Stratified Chemotherapy and VEGF Inhibition in Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Stage IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the screening procedure tumour specimens obtained by primary biopsy, will be analysed for EGFRmut and immunohistochemically for thymidylate synthetase (TS) expression. Employing the H-Score with a cut-off of 150, EGFR-wt patients will be stratified into a TS low (Stratum A) and TS high (Stratum B) group. This procedure is aiming to provide two equally sized strata. After stratification according to the TS expression level patients will be treated with a combination of Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Bevacizumab. Pemetrexed/Cisplatin/Bevacizumab will be administered for a maximum of 4 cycles. Patients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) will continue on maintenance therapy of Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Duration of treatment/patient: up to 1,5 years - Follow Up: at least 6 month - Planned number of patients: 146 treated patients</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological confirmed NonSmallCell lung cancer Tumor stage IV (UICC 7th Version) The following histological tumor types are eligible: Adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinomas with bronchioloalveolar differentiation) Large Cell carcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation Mixed Cell Carcinoma without small cell fraction and without predominant squamous cell fraction undifferentiated nonsmallcellcarcinoma No previous chemotherapy for stage IV NSCLC Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for NSCLC must be completed at least one year prior to study enrolment (from end of chemotherapy) No previous treatment with Pemetrexed or Bevacizumab Patients with prior radiation therapy may be eligible for this study if they meet the following guidelines: Previous radiation therapy is allowed to &lt;25% of the bone marrow (Cristy and Eckerman 1987), but should have been limited and must not have included whole pelvis radiation. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment (except for alopecia). Prior thoracic radiotherapy must be completed 30 days before study enrollment. Lesions that have been radiated cannot be included as sites of measurable disease unless clear tumor progression has been documented in these lesions since the end of radiation therapy. Palliative extrathoracic radiotherapy to preexisting lesions may continue on study; however, these lesions may not be included as sites of measurable disease. At least 4 weeks since last major surgery Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years ECOG ≤ 1 Adequate hematological laboratory parameters: Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dl Neutrophils ≥ 1.500 µl WBC ≥3.000 µl Platelets ≥100.000 µl Adequate hepatic laboratory parameters: Total Bilirubin ≤ 1,5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 x ULN AST(GOT) &lt; 2,5 ULN in patients without liver metastasis &lt; 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastasis ULN = (upper limit of normal) ALT(GPT) &lt; 2,5 ULN in patients without liver metastasis &lt; 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastasis ULN = (upper limit of normal) Adequate renal laboratory parameters: Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+ Patients discovered to have ≥ 2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24hour urine collection and must demonstrate &lt;1 g of protein in 24 hours Normal cardiac function defined by New York Heart Association NYHA Class I and Class II Electrocardiogram without significant signs of cardiac arrhythmias Provision of informed consent according to local regulatory requirements prior to any protocol specific treatment. Measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal at baseline. (Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic at least for 12 months to be considered of non childbearing potential) Women of child bearing potential to be willing to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy at least one month before study start. Examples: oral contraceptives (sole application of oral contraceptives is not sufficient), diaphragm pessary, intrauterine device (spiral), condom plus diaphragm pessary plus spermicide. Histological confirmed predominant squamous cell carcinoma Presence of activating EGFR mutations in exons 1821 Pregnancy or lactation period Have known central nervous system (CNS) disease, other than stable, treated brain metastasis. Stable, treated brain metastasis is defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and posttreatment brain imaging (CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Patients should be off corticosteroids for 1 week (7 days) at the time of the posttreatment brain CT/MRI. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, (stereotactic) radiosurgery (Gamma Knife, linear particle accelerator, or equivalent), or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician, and must have been completed &gt; 8 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1. Patients with signs of a fresh bleeding into one or more cerebral metastases or with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 8 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be excluded.
