	<brief_summary>This pilot study will test the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a novel approach to improve food choices by employees about what to eat for lunch. The intervention involves the testing of an on-line pre-ordering food program with nutritional information linked to a hospital cafeteria. In this study, the investigators use positive reinforcement of feedback and price discounts during the intervention phase, and then withdraw those components in order to assess the potential for changes to be retained after the study is over. The study draws on principles from the field of behavioral economics and behavioral change. The investigators test the effectiveness of the intervention with 30 employees (study participants) who are overweight or obese. Based on a recent screening of over 5600 Einstein employees, 66% of those screened were identified as either overweight or obese. There are 3 phases to the trial: baseline (P1), 4 week intervention, (P2) and tapering (intervention without reinforcement) (P3). Participants are randomized to one of two groups (intervention and wait-listed controls). Our primary hypotheses are that: 1. Participants will purchase lunches with fewer calories during the intervention compared to baseline. 2. Participants will purchases lunches with fewer calories in the tapering phase compared to baseline. Secondary hypotheses include that, compared with baseline, participants will order lunches with less fat. Changes in participant weight based on self selected goals, and in a measure of mindful eating will also be investigated. The investigators expect that participant adherence will be associated with improved outcomes compared to those who are less adherent.</brief_summary>
