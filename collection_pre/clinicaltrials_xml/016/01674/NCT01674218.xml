	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-period cross-over clinical study of PA-824 to evaluate the effect of PA-824 and of PA-824 plus moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc interval duration) in a total of 75 healthy male and female participants, aged 18 to 45 years. Moxifloxacin will be used as an active control. Participants will be blinded to the treatments they will receive. The study consists of a screening period up to 26 days; enrollment, 1 day; five in-patient treatment periods consisting of an admission day (except in the first treatment period, when the pre-dose day is the baseline), dosing day and two post-dosing days; an out-patient period of at least three days and not more than 10 days between treatment periods; and a final visit 7 - 14 days after discharge from the last treatment period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-period cross-over clinical study of PA-824 to evaluate the effect of PA-824 and of PA-824 plus moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc interval duration) in healthy male and female participants. Moxifloxacin will be used as an active control. Participants will be blinded to the treatments they will receive. The study consists of a screening period up to 26 days; enrollment, 1 day; five in-patient treatment periods consisting of an admission day (except in the first treatment period, when the pre-dose day is the baseline), dosing day and two post-dosing days; an out-patient period of at least three days and not more than 10 days between treatment periods; and a final visit 7 - 14 days after discharge from the last treatment period. During the study, the subjects will receive each one of the following five treatments: Treatment A: PA-824 placebo and moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment B: PA-824 400 mg plus moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment C: PA-824 1000 mg plus moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment D: PA-824 placebo plus moxifloxacin 400 mg; Treatment E: PA-824 400 mg plus moxifloxacin 400 mg. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of single-dose administration of PA-824 400 mg and 1000 mg versus placebo on the QTcI interval. A total of 75 randomized (in order to have at least 60 evaluable) healthy male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 45 years will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be 18 to 45 years of age (inclusive). Subject must be a healthy male or female volunteer as determined by medical history, physical examination, 12lead ECG and laboratory evaluations (hematology, clinical chemistries and urinalysis tests) within studydefined ranges at Screening. (See Appendix B for acceptable ranges of laboratory and vital signs assessments). Body Mass Index (BMI) must be between 18 and 30 kg/m^2 inclusive. Subject must be nontobacco/nicotine using (3month minimum). Subject must be Tuberculin Skin Test/Purified Protein Derivative (TST/PPD) negative (within the previous 1 year) at Screening. The TST/PPD may be omitted if the subject presents written evidence of having a negative test during the previous 12 months. Subject must be able to give voluntary written informed consent before any study related procedure is performed. If female, has no childbearing potential (as defined below) or agrees to avoid becoming pregnant from the day of screening through one week after the last dose by using one of the following acceptable methods of birth control in addition to the use of a barrier method (condom) by the male partner (even if vasectomized): 1. Hormonal contraceptives; or 2. intrauterine contraceptive device; or 3. diaphragm in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream, or foam; or 4. spermicide; or 5. abstinence. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as being postmenopausal for at least 2 years, status after bilateral tubal ligation for at least 1 year, status after bilateral oophorectomy or status after hysterectomy. If male, agrees to avoid fathering a child from the day of screening to three months after the last dose. All female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening, Enrollment (Day2) and at checkin for each treatment period. Subject agrees not to donate blood during the study and up to 14 days after the end of the last treatment period. Subject agrees to comply with all study requirements. A history of clinically significant acute illness (resolved within 4 weeks of screening) or history of cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained syncope or presence of cardiac, vascular gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, endocrine, oncologic, pulmonary, immunologic, or psychiatric disease or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Site Principal Investigator (PI), would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the study results.
