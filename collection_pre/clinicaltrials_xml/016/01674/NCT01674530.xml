For patients aged &lt; 50 years, documentation of the results of either a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy performed within the five years prior to dosing, showing no mechanical bowel obstruction or organic disorders of the large or small bowel. 7. For patients aged ≥ 50 years, documentation of the results of either a barium enema with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy performed within one year prior to dosing, showing no mechanical bowel obstruction or organic disorders of the large or small bowel. Main 1. Females who are pregnant, breast feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the proposed study period. 2. Patients of any age with evidence of weight loss, anemia, or rectal bleeding and without documentation of the results of either a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy performed during the 6 months prior to dosing. 3. Patients who have documented mechanical bowel obstruction (e.g., bowel obstruction due to tumor, hernia), megacolon/megarectum, or diagnosis of pseudoobstruction. 4. Patients with known or suspected organic disorders of the large or small bowel (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease) or constipation secondary to a documented cause (e.g., surgery, bowel resection) or acute hernia or with neurologic diseases or other diseases that cause motility problems for example Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury, etc. 5. Patients with a history of bowel resection. 6. Patients who are regularly using medications, which are known to cause constipation (anticholinergics, narcotics, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, colchicine, iron supplements, magnesium supplements). 7. Patients who are hospitalized for any gastrointestinal or abdominal surgical procedure during the three months prior to dosing. 8. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular, liver, lung, neurologic, renal or psychiatric disorder, or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (if laboratory values exceed 2X Upper Limit of Normal the approval of medical monitor should be taken into consideration before randomizing the patient). 9. Use of systemic antibiotics within four weeks prior to baseline. 10. Any current or planned significant change in diet during the study. 11. Participation in a study with any investigational medication within the past 30 days before screening for this study or previous participation in this study.</criteria>
