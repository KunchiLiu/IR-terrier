Positive SPT to olive pollen (wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm). 4. A positive specific IgE against olive pollen (≥Class 2; ≥0.70 KU/L) documented in the last 5 y 1. FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted value at screening after adequate pharmacologic treatment. 2. Uncontrolled or severe asthma. 3. A clinically relevant history of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis caused by an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed and sensitized. 4. History of severe asthma exacerbation or emergency room visit or admission for asthma in the previous 12 months. 5.

Previous treatment by other allergen concomitant IT or immunotherapy with Olea europaea extracts within the previous 5 years (initiation of subcutaneous immunotherapy is acceptable if treatment has been discontinued before reaching maintenance dose; for SLIT 3 months in the last 5 years is accepted). 9. History of anaphylactic shock due to e.g. food, insect venom, exercise or drug. 10. History of severe and recurrent angioedema. 11.
