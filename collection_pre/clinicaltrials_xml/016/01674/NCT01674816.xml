	<brief_summary>Problem: Currently, no system allows precise kinematic assessment of the knee and accurate guiding of orthopedic surgical actions in a minimally invasive fashion. However, such a system would prove useful in the clinical setting to improve the quality of surgical interventions at the knee. Hypothesis: A novel knee kinematic assessment and surgical guidance tool using 3D personalized imaging and minimally invasive bony fixation allows precise kinematic assessment and surgical guidance in the routine clinical setting. Objectives : - Demonstrating the capacity of the system to precisely measure 3D knee kinematics - Quantifying the reproducibility of the kinematic measurements - Measuring the impact of knee surgical procedures on knee kinematics - Assessing the correlations between measured articular kinematics and clinical results after knee surgery - Integrating the novel measuring system to the surgical flow of three knee surgical procedures - Quantifying the precision and reproducibility of the surgical actions guided by the system - Comparing the clinical results of surgeries guided by the system to those performed with the traditional technique</brief_summary>
