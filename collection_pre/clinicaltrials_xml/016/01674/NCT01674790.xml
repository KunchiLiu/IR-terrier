	<brief_summary>The objective of the 'Exploring potential synergistic effects of aerobic exercise and cognitive training on cognition after stroke' pilot trial is to investigate the combined effects of aerobic and cognitive training on cognition after stroke. This is to lay the groundwork for a larger RCT on the same topic. Twenty patients greater than 6 months post-stroke will be randomly assigned into one of four following treatment groups: (i) aerobic training (AEROBIC group), (ii) cognitive training (COGNITIVE group), (iii) aerobic exercise plus cognitive training (AEROBIC+COGNITIVE group); and (iv) non-aerobic range of motion (ROM) and unstructured mental activity (CONTROL group) (for group descriptions, please see detailed description below). We hypothesize that the combination of aerobic exercise and cognitive training will be more effective in improving cognition after stroke than either treatment on its own.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise: Body weight support (BWS) treadmill exercise at moderately high intensity (60-70% of heart rate reserve) using 15-30% BWS. An additional 6-10 min will be needed for warm-up and cool-down. Heart rate will be continuously monitored, and blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured periodically. Cognitive training: Computerized dual n-back training program that involves a working memory task, the difficulty of which adapts to the individual participant's performance. ROM exercise: Non-aerobic passive and active movement of upper and lower extremity joints performed with the subject lying on a plinth. RPE will be recorded every 5 minutes to ensure intensity remains low. Mental activities: Unstructured mental activity: such as listening to light novels on tape, which will be selected by the subject from a pre-determined list.</detailed_description>
