	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption, the metabolic pathways and the excretion of ibrutinib in healthy male adult participants after administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg to 140 mg (5 mg/mL solution) of unlabeled ibrutinib admixed with 14C ibrutinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Absorption, Metabolism, and Routes of Excretion of (14C) Radiolabeled Ibrutinib in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, single-dose study in healthy male participants. Six men will be enrolled to allow a minimum of 4 participants to complete the study. All participants will receive a single oral solution dose of 50 to 140 mg ibrutinib containing 1480 kBq (40 µCi) of 14C labeled ibrutinib, constituting a total radiation burden of approximately 0.916 mSv (ICRP risk category IIa). The duration of the study is approximately 73 days including screening period of 28 days, treatment period of 15 days, and follow-up period of 30 days. Safety will include adverse events, laboratory safety, 12 lead electrocardiogram, physical examination, and vital signs.</detailed_description>
