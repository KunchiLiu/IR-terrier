	<brief_summary>The success of in vitro fertilization is based mainly on uterine implantation embryo. An excessive uterine contractility may interfere with implantation by a movement of the embryo in the uterus. The inhibition of the uterine contractility may have a positive effect on success rate of in vitro fertilization. It is through parenteral injection of glucagon and its spasmolytic effect on various smooth muscles and thereby on the uterine muscle, at the time of embryo transfer, the investigators intend to improve the pregnancy rates obtained after IVF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Glucagon on Uterine Contractility at the Time of Embryo Transfer in in Vitro Fertilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women will have a cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and follow the standard protocol established by the clinic ovo or the fertility clinic of CHUM. On the day of embryo transfer, the investigators will administer 1 mg of Glucagon or placebo intramuscularly 10 minutes before the embryo transfer. The uterine contractility will be measured by ultrasound before and after injection to document the impact of Glucagon on it and we will proceed to embryo transfer.</detailed_description>
