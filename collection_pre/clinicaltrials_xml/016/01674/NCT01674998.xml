	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if safe, simple and non-invasive tests such as an electrocardiogram (EKG), a smell test, or a blood test could be used to identify neurological disorders before typical symptoms occur. Researchers believe that early identification of these disorders could lead to treatments to prevent, delay, or slow the development of one of more of these diseases. Some people with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) may go on to develop Parkinson's disease or another related neurological disorder, but many do not.</brief_summary>
