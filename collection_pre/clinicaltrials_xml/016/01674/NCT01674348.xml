	<detailed_description>It is a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multi-centre, two-staged, fixed-design study of P2202 in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled with a stable dose of metformin or sulfonylurea or both. This study will consist of accrual in Stage I (n=56/arm, which is 70% of the total sample size required), followed by an interim analysis on completion of the treatment period, to aid further decisions on accrual and dose selection in Stage II of the study, and completion of Stage I.</detailed_description>
