	<brief_title>Mortality and Risk Factors in Patients With Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: a Multicentric, Observational, Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ACPE is a common cause of presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Early recognition of high-risk patients could help in better locating human and technical resources and in deciding adequate treatment and site of care. The investigators planned a real life, multicentric, prospective, web-based observational study performed in Italian Emergency Departments. The investigators enroll consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Department with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, that is defined as all the following: respiratory distress, bilateral rales and congestion on chest X-ray. Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings are collected on admission and during hospitalization to evaluate mortality and risk factors related to mortality.</detailed_description>
