	<brief_summary>Lower back pain is one of the most common conditions affecting humans. Lower back supports are a common device used in order to alleviate the pain. All the available back supports are wrapped around the lower back and abdomen and act as static support devices. "The hug" is a new dynamic back support where the participant actively improves his/her posture and strengthens the muscle of the lower back. This trial compares both devices and their effect on reducing lower back pain.</brief_summary>
