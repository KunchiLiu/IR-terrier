	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic colon surgery has been performed widely. As a minimal invasive approach, single incision (Embryonic NOTES) colon surgery has been attempted. However, there are not sufficient evidences for single incision colon surgery in colon cancer. The investigators are researching the efficacy and safety of single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy in sigmoid colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Single Incision (Embryonic NOTES) Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After several randomized clinical trials, laparoscopic colon surgery has been performed widely. As a minimal invasive approach, single Incision (Embryonic NOTES) colon surgery has been attempted. Several studies reported the feasibility of single incision colon surgery.However, there are not sufficient evidences for single incision colon surgery, especially in colon cancer. The investigators are researching the efficacy and safety of single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy in sigmoid colon cancer. Harvested numbers of lymph node will be assessed for the efficacy and postoperative morbidity and mortality will be assess for the safety.</detailed_description>
