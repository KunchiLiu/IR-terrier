	<brief_summary>After rectal excision, the rate of anastomotic leak and abscess is higher than after colic surgery. In order to limit and avoid the risk of pelvic sepsis after rectal excision, a prophylactic pelvic drainage is usually used. If current data have confirmed the uselessness of drainage in colic surgery, the question stay in abeyance in rectal surgery. This practice had never been evaluated in patients with rectal excision and low anastomosis (patients with a high risk of pelvic sepsis)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After rectal excision, the rate of anastomotic leak and abscess is higher than after colic surgery. In order to limit and avoid the risk of pelvic sepsis after rectal excision, a prophylactic pelvic drainage is usually used. If current data have confirmed the uselessness of drainage in colic surgery, the question stay in abeyance in rectal surgery. This practice had never been evaluated in patients with rectal excision and low anastomosis (patients with a high risk of pelvic sepsis) The aim of the study is to assess the impact of pelvic drainage vs. non pelvic drainage on risk of pelvic sepsis after rectal excision for cancer with infraperitoneal anastomosis. The principal objective is to compare the rate of pelvic sepsis until 30 days between the 2 groups of patients who had a rectal excision with and without pelvic drainage. It is a randomized clinical trial of superiority, multicentric, without blinding, in 2 parallel groups with ratio (1:1): distribution of the number of patients in the groups.</detailed_description>
