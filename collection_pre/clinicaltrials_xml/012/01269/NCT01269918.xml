	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized blinded clinical trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either a remifentanil or dexmedetomidine infusion for general anesthesia. The anesthesia team will know the result of randomization at induction. Data will be gathered by research personnel who will be blinded to the anesthetic method used. Patients will be blinded to the anesthetic they receive till they are discharged from the PACU when they will have the option to be unblinded. The Data Safety and -Toxicity Committee will review all serious adverse events and toxicity reports as well as annual reviews.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Remifentanil and Dexmedetomidine for Craniotomy Perioperative Hemodynamics and Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anesthesia for craniotomy presents a unique challenge to the anesthesiologist. Anesthesia for neurosurgical procedures should provide optimal surgical conditions while maintaining appropriate cerebral oxygen supply and stable systemic hemodynamics. (1) It is important to prevent patient response to noxious stimuli during the procedure like pinning, drilling of the bone, opening and manipulation of the dura etc., avoid coughing and bucking during surgery and during extubation thus necessitating a deeper level of anesthesia and analgesia. At the same time it is desirable to have the patient fully awake toward the end of the surgery in order to facilitate neurologic evaluation. Management of the above presents a challenge during induction, maintenance and extubation and also during multiple critical stages of surgery Fear of the side effects of analgesic drugs frequently leads to the under-treatment of post-craniotomy pain. (2) Nevertheless, this pain continues to be commonly observed, is frequently severe, and, if unrelieved, may cause distress for the neurosurgical patient and serious complications for the operative brain. (2) There is a need for larger trials to delineate safety and efficacy of analgesic therapies with a focus on short- and long-term outcomes.</detailed_description>
