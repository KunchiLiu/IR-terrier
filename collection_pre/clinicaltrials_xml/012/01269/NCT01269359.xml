	<brief_summary>Modern orthopedic and spine surgeons strive towards minimizing surgical exposure and towards increased precision in the placement of implants. This trend requires an increased use of fluoroscopic guidance, which leads to increased exposure of the patient, surgeon and the operating room staff to radiation. Robotic assisted spine surgery is routinely performed in the authors' institution for a variety of indications such as degenerative conditions, trauma, tumors , infections and deformity correction11. The objective of this study is to compare the radiation exposure time during robotic guided vertebral body augmentation to the published results for similar surgeries.</brief_summary>
