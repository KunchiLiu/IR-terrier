	<brief_summary>Multifocal-electroretinoram (ERG) and microperimetry are objective criteria to asses retinal function. No information besides visual acuity exist for the development of retinal function during the course of wet AMD during therapy with Lucentis. The aim of our study is to evaluate the value of multifocal-ERG and microperimetry as an sensitive tool and early predictor of recurrence of the disease. The second goal will be to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of an adequate therapy on retinal function using microperimetry and multifocal-ERG during the course of wet AMD.</brief_summary>
