	<detailed_description>Participants will be evaluated for biological and genetic risk factors for nutritional and metabolic adverse effects associated with SGAPs (second generation antipsychotics) during 4 visits over 12 weeks. Participants will also be evaluated at month 6, 9, and 12. This study does not involve treatment for participants. Treatment of subjects enrolled in this study will be determined by their clinician and will remain unaffected by participation in this observational minimal risk study. All participants were prescribed risperidone (Risperdal) for the duration of study participation and doses ranged from 0.25mg to 6mg daily for 52 weeks.</detailed_description>
