	<brief_summary>Critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of bleeding on account of coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction, frequent liver dysfunction and invasive procedures.In patients at high risk of bleeding, anticoagulation restricted to the circuit (regional anticoagulation) has been advocated as the method of choice.However, citrate anticoagulation may have many metabolic consequences, such as metabolic alkalosis due to citrate metabolism into bicarbonate, and in patients with liver disease, metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia may occur.Implementation of citrate-based regional anticoagulation with frequent monitoring of acid-base and electolytes is also more challenging for the nurses and does not eliminate the need of a low-dose systemic anticoagulation for thromboses prophylaxis in most of the patients. Citrate-based regional anticoagulation is therefore mainly advocated only for patients at high-risk of bleeding. The investigators plan to implement an open-label randomized control trial assessing the effectiveness of citrate-based regional anticoagulation in critically ill patients with AKI and with a special emphasis on the safety profile of this treatment in patients with severe liver failure.</brief_summary>
