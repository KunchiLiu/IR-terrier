	<brief_summary>A number of different therapeutic approaches to treat lateral epicondylitis have been tested partly in randomized trials, such as polidocanol sclerosing injections, botulinom toxin A injections, braces, surgery and topical NO patches. One study indicates that patients with lateral epicondylitis (lateral elbow tendinopathy) have poorer elbow proprioception in contrast to healthy controls (Juul-Kristensen B, et al., J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2008;17(1 Suppl):72S-81S.) Based on a suggested poorer elbow proprioception in lateral elbow tendinopathy, The investigators hypothesize that a dedicated proprioceptive intervention might be able to reduce pain and improve function. As such a RCT is planned with two intervention arms with proprioceptive training using the Flexi-Bar vibration device (www.flexi-bar.co.uk) +/- the XCO-Trainer (www.xco-trainer.co.uk) over twelve weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators sought to evaluate the clinical effects of either a vibration training using the Flexi-Bar vibration device (www.flexi-bar.co.uk) +/- the XCO-Trainer (www.xco-trainer.co.uk) in a randomized trial among patients suffering lateral elbow tendinopathy (lateral epicondylitis). Primary outcome measure of this clinical trial is pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10) before and after 12 weeks of training. Secondary outcome parameters involve DASH score before and after, grip strength (JAMAR), vibration and two-point discrimination (mm).</detailed_description>
