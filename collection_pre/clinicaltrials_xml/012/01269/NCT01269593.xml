	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how a new drug, named PUH71, accumulates in the different parts of the body &amp; inside tumors and how long PUH71 lasts in the blood, when given to study participants in tiny amounts. The results of this study will help researchers (1) plan how they will use PUH71 as an experimental new drug (at much-higher doses) for the treatment of cancer, in clinical trials; and (2) know whether PUH71 might be used as a drug for detecting tumors with scanner machines.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with solid malignancy, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myeloma, and/or lymphoma (histology confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology) Disease is measurable or evaluable as defined by RECIST (1.1 or original version) or other tumor response criteria from an MSKCC IRBapproved clinical research protocol. This does not apply to patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm. The presence of active myeloproliferative neoplasm will be determined by applicable disease specific diagnostic criteria and patient assessment by the patient's oncologist and trial investigators (eg, manifestations of active MPN such as splenomegaly, abnormal blood counts, etc). Age between 1890 Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing age (1155 years) and/or lack childbearing potential No breastfeeding Previous allergic reaction to contrast medium. Hypersensitivity to iodide products. Known hyperthyroidism Hepatic: Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN Albumin &lt; 2 g/dl GGT &gt; 2.5 x ULN IF Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN. Renal: Creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min. Positive serum pregnancy test for females Acute major illness (e.g., infection, unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)</criteria>
