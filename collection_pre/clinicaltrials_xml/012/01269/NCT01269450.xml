	<brief_summary>Working hypothesis and aims: To investigate whether progesterone treatment affects the incidence of preterm labor compared to placebo, among women with 2nd trimester bleeding. The participants will be allocated through randomization to a study or control group. Women in the study group will receive micronized progesterone 200 mg (Utrogestan, company) with an intra-vaginal tablet once daily while the control group will receive placebo. Both women and medical staff will be blinded to group allocation. Treatment will commence on the day of inclusion to the study, but not before 16 weeks and will continue until 36 weeks gestation. Data will be collected after the conclusion of pregnancy regarding the maternal and neonatal outcome.</brief_summary>
