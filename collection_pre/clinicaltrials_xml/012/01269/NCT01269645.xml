	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this project is to examine the impact of providing cancer patients with audiovisual information about clinical trials on attitudes towards clinical trial participation. It is hypothesized that patients provided these materials will have more favorable attitudes toward clinical trial participation compared to patients not provided these materials. Participants will be randomized to either: (1) an intervention condition in which they will be asked to view a short video and read an accompanying brochure about clinical trials developed by the investigative team; or (2) a control condition in which they will be asked to read the National Cancer Institute's brochure entitled "Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies." Self-report data will be collected at two timepoints: 1) in person following study enrollment, but before receipt of material related to intervention assignment (baseline/Time 1), and 2) by telephone interview between 7 and 28 days following study enrollment (follow-up/Time 2). In addition, data will also be collected from medical records six weeks after study enrollment.</brief_summary>
