	<detailed_description>Biphentin methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release capsules is provided in multiple strengths of 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg to be administered once daily. Once daily dosing is intended to provide treatment for the substantial day. For current analog classroom study each eligible subject will be optimized at 15, 20, 30, or 40 mg in a timeframe of five weekly periods. In the sixth week each subject will be randomized double-blind to receive either active comparator at the optimized dose or placebo comparator treatment. The first classroom session will be held at the end of the week, when efficacy measurements including SKAMP and PERMP tests will be administered. At the beginning of the following week, the subjects will be crossed-over to the corresponding active comparator or placebo comparator treatment. The second classroom session will be held at the end of the second double-blind week, when the same efficacy measurements will be administered. Various safety and tolerability, and quality of life assessments will be conducted.</detailed_description>
