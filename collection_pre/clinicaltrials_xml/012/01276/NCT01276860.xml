	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea results in decreased attentiveness and response times in patients. The objective of this study is to quantify these consequences in pediatric OSA patients using an already established tool for examining the results of sleep deprivation and fragmentation: psychomotor vigilance testing. PVT has been used in children, but has not been studied in pediatric OSA patients. This study aims to employ PVT along the normal course of diagnosis and treatment of pediatric OSA patients in our clinical practice at Arkansas Children's Hospital. The investigators hypothesize that pediatric OSA patients will exhibit decreased PVT scoring when compared to children without OSA, and that PVT can be used to diagnose and monitor treatment outcomes in these patients.</brief_summary>
