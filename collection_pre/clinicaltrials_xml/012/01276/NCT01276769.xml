	<brief_summary>This study is to compare the effective of Paclitaxel combined with Epirubicin and Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin in the neoadjuvant treatment for TNBC. And the investigators hypothesized that paclitaxel combined with carboplatin is more sensitive to TNBC compared with Paclitaxel plus Epirubicin,this study will also have a look into the relation of BRCA1 mutation and sensitive to carboplatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Study of Neoadjuvant Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin/Epirubicin Treatment in Triple-negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is know that triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) is more aggressive than non-triple negative breast cancer in both pathological features and clinical prognosis,and there is no standard chemotherapy regimens especially for TNBC. NCCN guidelines recommends Paclitaxel or Epirubicin based regimens as the preferred regimens both for the adjuvant chemotherapy and the treatment of Recurrence and Metastatic breast cancer.The combination of these two drugs is considered as a strong arrangement and therefore,is common used in Triple negative breast cancer patients because of its poor prognosis. According to the results of some retrospective studies, platinum-based chemotherapy regimens showed a promising sensitive to Triple negative breast cancer patients compared with regimens without platinum. This study is to compare the effective of Paclitaxel combined with Epirubicin and Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin in the neoadjuvant treatment for TNBC. And the investigators hypothesized that paclitaxel combined with carboplatin is more sensitive to TNBC compared with Paclitaxel plus Epirubicin,this study will also have a look into the relation of BRCA1 mutation and sensitive to carboplatin.</detailed_description>
