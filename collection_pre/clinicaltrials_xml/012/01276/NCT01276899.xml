	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter translational study to understand therapeutic resistance in patients undergoing standard chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer. In the neoadjuvant setting, biopsy tissue samples from primary tumor will be collected and banked before the start of chemotherapy and after the completion of the treatment (post-chemotherapy and at the time of surgery). In the metastatic setting, tissue samples from metastatic lesions will be collected and banked before the start of chemotherapy and at the time of tumor progression. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn before treatment initiation (baseline) and at different time points during treatment. All samples will be stored in the Biological Resource Repository.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Identify Molecular Mechanisms of Clinical Resistance to Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanisms of resistance have been studied for many years in various experimental models. However, many drugs that are highly effective in experimental models at overcoming resistance have been either ineffective or marginally active in preliminary clinical studies. Thus after decades of study, most reviews of anti-cancer drug resistance still focus largely on experimental models, which may not reflect resistance in humans. However, recent studies have demonstrated that clinical resistance occurs in primary and metastatic tumors that may have undergone significant molecular evolution due to treatment effects and the selection of clones as recently shown in breast cancer. Triple negative breast cancer is a subtype that carries a poor prognosis and a high incidence of early metastatic recurrence. Furthermore, no target therapy is efficacious up to now in this subtype. Thus, identification of mechanisms of resistance to available therapies and prediction of tumoral response to various treatments could help in the management of patients affected by this particularly aggressive type of breast cancer. The goals of this study are two-fold. First, to build a biobank of blood and tissue specimens, prior to starting chemotherapy and at a determined time-point (surgery or progression of disease), from patients undergoing the chemotherapeutic treatments in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. Second, to use cutting-edge molecular techniques available in several Quebec research centers, to carefully compare these pre and post treatment samples to identify "molecular factors of resistance". The discovery of these factors will help oncologists in triaging patients to receive the most beneficial therapy by recognizing when not to give particular treatment and will be essential for reducing the potential for harmful side effects and for avoiding the extremely high cost of modern treatments when they can be predicted to be ineffective.</detailed_description>
