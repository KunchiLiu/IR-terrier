	<brief_summary>The disruption of the pancreatic duct seems to be a major cause pseudocyst formation and persistence in patients suffering from acute/chronic pancreatitis. No prospective randomized studies have been conducted on the influence of pancreatic duct stenting for the patients` benefits and recurrence rates. The aim fo this study is therefore to evaluate prospectively in a randomized, controlled fashion in patients wit pancreatic pseudocysts, wether pancreatic duct stenting of a disrupted pancreatic duct is beneficial in terms of quicker clinical recovery and avoidance of recurrence of pancreatic pseudocysts.</brief_summary>
