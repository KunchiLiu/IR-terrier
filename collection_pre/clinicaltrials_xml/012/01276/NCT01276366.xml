	<brief_summary>Last thirty years, many research was performed concerning pain in the newborn. These investigations showed us the negative effects of pain in the neonatal period. Our research concerns the choice of analgesics for the premature newborn during a heel lance. Newborns with a gestational age of 32-37 weeks are randomly assigned over three groups. They can receive breastfeeding, during the heel lance, a bottle with supplemental breast milk or sucrose. The primary objective of the Amphia Premature Infant Pain study, is to investigate whether there is a difference in PIPP-scores in premature newborns who undergo a heel lance, receiving breast milk or sucrose. Our hypothesis is that the PIPP-score will be lower in newborns receiving breast milk compared to sucrose. And the investigators presume that breast feeding has the same analgesic effect as giving supplemental breast milk.</brief_summary>
