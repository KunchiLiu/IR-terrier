	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of cilengitide when given together with paclitaxel weekly in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread nearby or to other areas of the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Cilengitide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to the stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cilengitide together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weekly Doses of Cilengitide and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cilengitide and paclitaxel at weekly dose schedule. (Cohort I) II. To describe the toxicities associated with cilengitide and paclitaxel. III. To describe any antitumor activity of cilengitide and paclitaxel at weekly dose schedule. IV. To characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of cilengitide and paclitaxel with the proposed schedule and correlate PK parameters to clinical outcome. (Cohort I) V. To examine the effect of cilengitide and paclitaxel on circulating cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (Cyr61) using a novel "sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)" and to correlate this effect with clinical response. (Cohort II) VI. To evaluate the information obtained through use of items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in Phase I studies. VII. To determine if tumor tissue expression of alpha v beta 3 (αvβ3) and CYR61 correlate with therapeutic response to cilengitide with paclitaxel. (Cohort II) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cilengitide. Patients receive cilengitide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days* 1, 8, and 15 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Some patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.</detailed_description>

7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential including women within 2 years of postmenopause Known standard therapy for the patient's disease that is potentially curative or definitely capable of extending life expectancy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Any of the following prior therapies: Chemotherapy =&lt; 21 days prior to registration Mitomycin C/nitrosoureas =&lt; 42 days prior to registration Immunotherapy =&lt; 14 days prior to registration Biologic therapy =&lt; 14 days prior to registration Prior investigational therapy =&lt; 28 days prior to registration Full field radiation therapy =&lt; 28 days prior to registration or limited field radiation therapy &lt; 14 days prior to registration Full field radiation encompasses the entire area of known disease involvement and surrounding uninvolved but atrisk areas, e.g. subtotal nodal (mantle and upper abdomen) or total nodal irradiation Limited field radiation is restricted to treating only the known areas of clinical disease, e.g. involvedfield therapy for lymphoma Major surgery (i.e., laparotomy) =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration; minor surgery =&lt; 2 weeks prior to registration; Note: insertion of a vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery in this regard Unresolved toxicities from prior therapy with the exception of alopecia that have not resolved to =&lt; grade 1, unless the patient has a chronic, stable =&lt; grade 2 toxicity that would not interfere with the evaluation of the study agents New York Heart Association classification III or IV Central nervous system (CNS) metastases or seizure disorder;

oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational (utilized for a nonFood and Drug Administration [FDA]approved indication and in the context of a research investigation) Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the use of corticosteroids) including patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm Other active malignancy =&lt;
