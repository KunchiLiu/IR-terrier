	<brief_summary>The study objective: - To evaluate the response and survival rates after treating stage III cervical cancer with retinoic acid and interferon-α combined with radiotherapy in the study group. - To evaluate the response and survival rates after treating stage III cervical cancer patients with concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy in the control group. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of retinoic acid, interferon-α and radiation therapy compared with concomitant chemo-radiation therapy. - To determine if there is an immune response to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) by estimating serum IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies against E7 proteins of HPV types 16 and 18 before and after treatment. The study hypothesis: - The response rates and survival rates of retinoic acid and interferon-α combination with radiation will be better than chemo-radiation to treat stage III cervical cancer. - Treatment with the retinoic acid, interferon-α and radiation combination therapy will be less toxic and better tolerated than chemo-radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Cervical Cancer Trial in India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 200 women with confirmed diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer, stage III, will be recruited into the study. The patients will be recruited from the Gynecologic Oncology Department of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute that registers more than 600 cases of cancer of the cervix per year. Computer-generated numbers will randomize patients into the two treatment arms. This trial is designed to treat stage III cervical cancer patients with concomitant immunotherapy (with cis-retinoic acid and interferon-α) and radiotherapy in the study arm. Cancer of the uterine cervix is the second most common cancer among women worldwide and is the cause of the largest number of cancer-related deaths among women in the developing countries. In India, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer among women (126,000 new cases, 71,000 deaths in 2000), accounting for more than a quarter of the global burden of cervical cancer (471,000 new cases and 233,000 deaths).1,2 In contrast, in the U.S., although, there were only 12,200 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,100 deaths in 2003, the United States spends $5 billion per year screening and treating cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. Advanced cervical cancer is relatively rare in the developed world because of routine PAP testing. However, in a developing country like India, because of the absence of any population based cervical cancer screening programs (HPV testing, PAP smears), nearly 80% of the patients are initially detected at stage III or higher. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy administered along with surgery and radiation is the recommended treatment for advanced cervical cancer in the US and other developed countries.</detailed_description>
