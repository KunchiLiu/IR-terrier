	<brief_summary>The protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encodes a lymphoid-specific phosphatase (LYP) which is an important downregulatory factor of T cell activation. A PTPN22 polymorphism, C1858T, was found associated with T1DM in different Caucasian populations. In this observational case-control study, we aimed at confirming the role of PTPN22, C1858T polymorphism in T1DM predisposition in a Greek population.</brief_summary>
