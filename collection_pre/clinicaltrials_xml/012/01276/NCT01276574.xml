	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine, whether there is clinical benefit of using fdg-PET/CT (F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography/computed tomography)compared to contrast-enhanced CT in primary treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) - Objectives - the impact of preoperative PET/CT compared to CT on EOC stage definition - to compare the value of preoperative PET/CT, CT and laparoscopy in intra-abdominal tumour assessment. Laparotomy findings evaluated by surgeon and histopathologic results serve as the reference standard. - to compare serum markers HE4(human epididymis protein 4) and CA125 (cancer antigen 125) with FDG-PET/CT and CT in treatment response evaluation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary treatment of EOC - Methods - All the patients will undergo FDG-PET/CT prior surgery, after possible neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 4 weeks after completion of primary platinum-based chemotherapy. - CA125 and HE4 levels are measured pre-operatively and with every chemotherapy cycle.</brief_summary>
