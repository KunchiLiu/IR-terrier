	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating vasomotor and other symptoms associated with menopause as acupuncture is generally practiced in the "real world" setting and to obtain a comprehensive assessment of use patterns and symptom relief over time. This study will allow us to determine treatment patterns recommended by practicing acupuncturists, adherence to these treatments, and the effectiveness of different treatment patterns for reducing hot flashes. Results of this study will provide meaningful information to women in terms of number and frequency of acupuncture treatments likely to be needed to reduce hot flashes.</brief_summary>
