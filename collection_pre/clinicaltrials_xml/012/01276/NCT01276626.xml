The patients will be treated with probiotic or placebo for 6 weeks. Their mood, memory, general well-being and bowel symptoms will be assessed before, at the end of the treatment and 4 weeks later. Brain activation pattern, changes in gut bacteria, metabolic profile and inflammatory markers will be also measured.</brief_summary>
