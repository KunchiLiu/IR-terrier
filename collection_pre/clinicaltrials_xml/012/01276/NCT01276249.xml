	<detailed_description>The Aptus Endosystems STAPLE International Post-Market Registry is intended to expand the clinical knowledge base by including 'real world' subjects. All subjects diagnosed with a qualifying AAA suitable for elective endovascular repair, who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the registry, are eligible for enrollment and should be offered informed consent to participate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient ≥ 18 years old 2. Patient has given written informed consent 3. Patient has a life expectancy &gt; 1 year 4. Patient is willing to comply with followup evaluations 5. Patient's AAA meets at least one of the following criteria: ≥ 4.5cm in diameter Increased in size by 0.5cm in last 6 months Maximum diameter exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an adjacent normal aortic segment Saccular aneurysm larger than 3cm in maximal diameter 6. Patient has a proximal aortic neck diameter measured inner wall to inner wall between 19mm and 29mm 7. Patient has a proximal aortic neck length of at least 12mm 8. Patient has a patent iliac or femoral artery that allows endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with 16Fr (5.3mm) or 18Fr (6.0mm) delivery system. 9. Patient has bilateral iliac artery distal fixation site ≥ 10mm in length with an internal diameter between 9mm and 20mm 1. Patient is participating in a concurrent clinical study which may confound STAPLEInternational Registry results 2. Patient has a symptomatic AAA 3. Patient's AAA has a proximal aortic neck angle that is &gt; 60 degrees between the infrarenal neck and the long axis of the aneurysm 4. Patient has irregularlyshaped plaque that would inhibit sealing stent apposition 5. Patient has aortic mural pathology that is ≥ 2mm in thickness over ≥ 50% of the circumference of the proximal fixation site 6. Patient has an active, or known history of, bleeding diathesis or hypercoagulable condition 7. Patient has a contraindication to any materials to which he or she will be exposed during the EVAR procedure (i.e., Fortevo Endograft or HeliFX EndoAnchor System materials, contrast agents) 8. Patient has a genetic connective tissue disorder (e.g., Marfan's or EhlersDanloe Syndromes)</criteria>
