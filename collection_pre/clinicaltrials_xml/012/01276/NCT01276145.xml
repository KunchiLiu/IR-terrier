	<brief_summary>Subjects in this study have recently had or are scheduled for a coronary angiography as part of their normal, routine medical care. This procedure uses x-ray imaging to see the inside of the heart's blood vessels. This research study will evaluate the possible relationship between erectile dysfunction and vascular disease (diseases of the veins). In order to look at this possible relationship, subjects will complete a questionnaire which will ask questions regarding their sexual activity. Additionally, we will gather information from their medical records and take extra images during the coronary angiography procedure.</brief_summary>
