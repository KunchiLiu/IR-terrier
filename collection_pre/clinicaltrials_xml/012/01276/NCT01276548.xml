	<criteria>1. Subjects who aged 18 years or older 2. Subjects whose written informed consent was obtained complying with the local regulatory requirements prior to their participation in the trial 3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic epithelial cancer of the exocrine pancreas. Highquality contrastenhanced CT scanning is required to evaluate resectability. Measurable disease is not required. 1. Subjects who have received prior radiation therapy (XRT) for pancreatic cancer unless progression was documented after XRT and 6 weeks have elapsed between completion of XRT and start of trial medication. 2. Subjects who have had systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, for pancreatic cancer. However, prior use of chemotherapy, e.g. 5FU or capecitabine, for radiation sensitization is allowed. If gemcitabine was given in the adjuvant setting, only subjects relapsed with cancer after 6 months of completing the last dose of gemcitabine can participate in the trial. 3. Subjects who have had a major surgery within 2 weeks prior to the screening/baseline visit</criteria>
