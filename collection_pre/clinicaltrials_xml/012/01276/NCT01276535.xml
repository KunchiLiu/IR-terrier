	<brief_title>Study of the Use of Low Level Laser Therapy to Reduce Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne is a chronic inflammatory disorder plaguing the sebaceous follicle, and debate still remains over what truly initiates lesion formation. Experts agree that an increase in androgen production plays a significant role in the onset of acne. Androgens promote the increase in size of sebaceous glands and stimulate sebum production. The simple act of sebaceous gland stimulation via androgens could ultimately promote the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1α) without propionibacteria even being present. The synthesis of IL-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines including prostaglandins occurs via the inducible enzyme known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Studies analyzing the pathogenesis of mucositis have identified COX-2 as an important contributor to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus a major contributor to the progression of the disorder itself. Recent evidence indicates that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is able to significantly diminish the expression of COX-2, resulting in the reduction of inflammation. The ability to modulate the COX-2 pathways via LLLT is believed to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α and IL- α) present in acne-prone skin.</detailed_description>
