	<brief_summary>Subjects in this study have recently had or are scheduled for a (percutaneous coronary intervention) PCI as part of their normal, routine medical care. This procedure should restore the blood flow in the vessels of the heart. Recent studies have shown that stable patients who undergo PCI and are discharged home after 4 hours of observation do not suffer any more complications compared to patients who stay in the hospital overnight. In addition, studies suggest that patients express increased satisfaction at being discharged after 4 hours. The University of Chicago is one of the first US medical centers to institute a formal program of same-day discharge after PCI. This study will seek, through a analysis of medical information and satisfaction questionnaires, to assess whether this particular same-day discharge program can improve patient satisfaction and preserve patient safety.</brief_summary>
