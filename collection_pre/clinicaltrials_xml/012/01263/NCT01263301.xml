	<brief_summary>Subclavian steal phenomenon is normally observed in patients with stenosis of subclavian artery proximal to orifice of vertebral artery(V0). However, uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis using vascular access in the arm or forearm may also develop dialysis associated steal syndrome(DASS).For patients with symptomatic subclavian steal phenomenon, the treatment for these two groups is different. The investigators want to see if the investigators can use noninvasive duplex examination instead of invasive conventional angiography to do the differential diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differential Diagnosis for the Causes of Subclavian Steal for Patients With Vascular Access in the Forearm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carotid duplex is widely used for diagnosis of subclavian steal syndrome. We have a patient who suffered from acute brain stem stroke after receiving hemodialysis for months. He has DM related uremia and the vascular access is in the forearm. Subclavian steal was found on duplex in the same arm for hemodialysis. We used standard cuff test for diagnosis of subclavian steal by carotid duplex examination. Accidentally, we found the flow of subclavian artery was back to normal when the cuff is on that stops the flow. We want to see if this phenomenon can be used to serve as a differential diagnostic tool for differentiation of subclavian steal caused by stenosis of subclavian artery or due to DASS.</detailed_description>
