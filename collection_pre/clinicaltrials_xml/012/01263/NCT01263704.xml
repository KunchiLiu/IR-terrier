	<brief_summary>This single arm, open-label study will assess the safety and efficacy of low dose fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in combination with standard dose MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) as primary therapy in elderly patients (&gt;/= 65 years) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients will receive six 28-day cycles of treatment with Mabthera/Rituxan (375 mg/m2 intravenously [iv] Day 0 of cycle 1, 500 mg/m2 iv Day 1 of cycles 2-6), fludarabine (12.5 mg/m2/d iv Days 1-3, cycles 1-6) and cyclophosphamide (150 mg/m2/d iv Days 1-3, cycles 1-6). Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 months, with a 30-month follow-up period.</brief_summary>
