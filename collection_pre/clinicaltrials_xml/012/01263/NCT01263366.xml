	<brief_summary>This study, a nonrandomized open-label Phase I safety and exploratory study, will evaluate the safety of topical norepinephrine in post-surgical breast cancer patients who are undergoing radiation therapy. The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or decrease the severity of the radiation dermatitis experienced by these patients.</brief_summary>
