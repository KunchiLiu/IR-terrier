	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Alogliptin Used in Combination With α-glucosidase Inhibitor in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. In Japan, α-glucosidase inhibitors are widely used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because alogliptin has a different mechanism of action compared to α-glucosidase inhibitors, the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alogliptin combined with an α-glucosidase inhibitor in type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled blood glucose while taking a α-glucosidase inhibitor and receiving diet and/or exercise therapies. To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the concomitant use of alogliptin and an α-glucosidase inhibitor, subjects who participated in the present study could enter a long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-003 (NCT01263509) that was planned separately.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Had been receiving a stable dose and regimen of an αglucosidase inhibitor for the last 4 weeks or longer before the start of the screening phase (Week 8) and during the screening phase. Had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of 6.5% or more and below 10.0% 4 weeks after the start of the screening phase (Week 4). Had HbA1c differences within 10.0% at the start of the screening phase (Week 8) and 4 weeks after the start of the screening phase (Week 4) from the HbA1c value at the start of the screening phase. Was receiving a specific diet therapy and an exercise therapy (if any) for the last 4 weeks or longer before the start of the screening phase (Week 8). Had received any antidiabetic drug other than αglucosidase inhibitors within the last 4 weeks before the start of the screening phase (Week 8) or during the screening phase.</criteria>
