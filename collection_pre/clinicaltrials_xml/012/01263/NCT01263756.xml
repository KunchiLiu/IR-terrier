	<brief_summary>The proposed pilot study will begin to assess whether driving impairments are included in the functional deficits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). This will be completed by obtaining data on velocity, collision risk, and visual attention of subjects with ASDs who drive in a simulator. The study includes 2-3 visits for the screening period (approximately 6 hours of assessments) and one driving simulation visit (approximately 2.5 hours). The investigators expect to enroll 20 adolescents and adults (ages 16-50, inclusive) who have been identified as having an ASD from a prior diagnosis or participation in community conferences for individuals with ASDs.</brief_summary>
