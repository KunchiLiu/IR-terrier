	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to establish the accuracy of a new device designed specifically to record and detect cough episodes. Cough is an important defense mechanism of the respiratory tract. The presence of chronic cough may indicate the presence of underlying diseases, including reflux. Despite the increased number of patients suffering from cough in the ENT and GI practice, to date, there has been no method/device to objectively assess the frequency of cough episodes in a given patient. PULMOTRACK-CC, manufactured by KarmelSonix (Haifa, Israel), has recently introduced an innovative device that is able to record cough episodes and then automatically detect and count them with the help of a specific software program. This study will assess the accuracy of this novel cough monitoring and counting technology and validate potential clinical use in patients with chronic cough.</brief_summary>
