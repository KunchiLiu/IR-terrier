	<brief_summary>Health-promoting effects of physical exercise are well-investigated especially for endurance activities. However, for different individuals, positive effects have different sizes, even non-responders are observed. Other forms of training, such as strength training and interval training, are less well investigated. Therefore, a comparative longitudinal training study is warranted to examine differences of preventive effects (outcome measures: ergometric descriptors of physical performance, established risk factors and prognostic factors for cardiovascular diseases) of continuous endurance training, interval training and strength endurance training. In a second stage, the observed non-responders will perform a different type of training (cross-over). It is expected, that besides a comparative general efficacy evaluation of the three training types, improved recommendations for optimized individualization of training parameters can be formulated.</brief_summary>
