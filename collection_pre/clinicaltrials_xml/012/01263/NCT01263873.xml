	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if there are differences related to ease of intubation reported by clinicians who use the Parker Flex-Tip® endotracheal tubes(ETT)compared to the standard Mallinckrodt® (ETT). The problem is two (ETTs), the Parker Flex-Tip® and the Mallinckrodt®, are currently available for use in operative suites for intubation, but few studies have compared these devices with each other. Two research questions to be answered in the study are 1. Is there a difference in the ease of intubation when the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT) is used when compared to the standard Mallinckrodt® (ETT)? and 2. Are there differences in the number of successful intubations when comparing the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT) and the standard Mallinckrodt® (ETT)? The hypotheses are the use of the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT) will demonstrate: 1. Fewer seconds to intubate the trachea. 2. Higher self-reported ease of placement scores and 3. Fewer redirections to intubate the trachea. The number of successful intubations is expected to be the same in both arms of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are not many different types of (ETT)s with different ends or tips. The standard (ETT) by Mallinckrodt® is a disposable polyvinyl chloride plastic tube that has one hooded Murphy tip eye at the end of the tube. The Murphy tip eye is to help with ventilation and air passage if the main end is occluded with mucus or a foreign body. Another type of (ETT) is the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT), which has a soft flex-tip that is configured to pass easily through the airway anatomy and has two Murphy tip eyes. Currently there are no published data comparing the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT) with standard Mallinckrodt® (ETT) when the GlideScope® is used. The data are limited concerning the ease of intubation when using the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT). The study is a two-factor randomized block intervention study design. Subjects assigned to the first group will be intubated using the standard Mallinckrodt® (ETT). The subjects assigned to the second group will be intubated using the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT). Randomization will be accomplished using the sealed envelope technique. There are six anesthesia providers who will be using ETTs to intubate. A block design will be used to make sure each anesthesia provider receives the same number of patients randomized to the Mallinckrodt and to the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT)s.</detailed_description>
