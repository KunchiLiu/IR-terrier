	<brief_summary>To determine if the way local anesthetic, or numbing medication, is delivered through a tiny tube next to the nerves that go to the thigh affects the strength and sensation in the thigh.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Catheter Tip Location Relative to the Femoral Nerve on Sensory and Motor Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim: Research study to test the hypothesis that differing the location of the perineural catheter tip during a continuous femoral nerve block (anterior vs. posterior) impacts quadriceps muscle strength. These results will help define the optimal perineural catheter tip location relative to the femoral nerve used for continuous peripheral nerve blocks and help guide both clinical care and future research in this clinically-relevant area.</detailed_description>
