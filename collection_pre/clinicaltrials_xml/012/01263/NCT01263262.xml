	<brief_summary>Does the use of chlorhexidine scrub prior to cutaneous surgery on the face increase the chances of toxicity to the eyes or ears? In addition, does the us eof chlorhexidine scrub on the face prior to cutaneous surgery decrease the chances of a post-operative wound infection?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intent of this proposed prospective observational cohort study is to determine if there is a difference in the incidence of corneal toxicity and/or ototoxicity in study subjects undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) on the face if a povidone-iodine preparation is used pre-operatively as compared to a chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation. It has recently been found that the use of a chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation is superior to the use of a povidone-iodine preparation in preventing post-operative surgical-site infections (SSI) in patients undergoing clean-contaminated surgery. However, the use of chlorhexidine on the face has previously been associated with corneal toxicity and ototoxicity. This study will help to further define previously reported risks of corneal toxicity and ototoxicity associated with the use of a chlorhexidine solution on the face.</detailed_description>
