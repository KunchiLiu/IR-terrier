	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is designed to investigate the performance of SENSIMED Triggerfish® during 24-hour continuous IOP fluctuation monitoring, defined as the number of valid recording intervals over the 24-hour period. The investigation will recruit male and female patients older than 18 years and diagnosed with glaucoma and treated with tafluprost in both eyes. 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be considered enrolled in the study upon signature of informed consent. A screening visit and one 24-hour IOP fluctuation monitoring session during a 36-hour hospitalisation, are planned for each patient.</brief_summary>
