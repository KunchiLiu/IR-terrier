	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to confirm that LY2216684 is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 in vivo using theophylline as a probe substrate for the enzyme. Since LY2216684 has been observed to increase heart rate in some healthy subjects, this study will also assess heart rate when co-administered with theophylline.</brief_summary>
