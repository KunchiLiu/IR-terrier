	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationships of alogliptin, once daily (QD) to an α-glucosidase inhibitor, three times daily (TID), to determine the optimal clinical dose for type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, participants in the present study could enter a long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-001 (NCT01263496) that was planned separately.</detailed_description>
