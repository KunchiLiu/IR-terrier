	<brief_summary>Treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis include surgical and non-surgical approaches. For most people, the decision depends on how bothered they are by their symptoms and how they feel about having surgery. Since individuals with the same clinical presentation may feel differently about their symptoms and how they view the benefits and harms of their options, there is no agreed upon "best"treatment. It has been shown that, for "preference-sensitive" decisions like this one, decision aids (tools that pair balanced, evidence-based information regarding treatment options with values clarification) improve patients'knowledge and realistic expectations, lower decisional conflict, increase patient involvement in decision making, decrease the number of undecided, and increase agreement between values and choice.1 The Spine Center, in collaboration with the Center for Shared Decision Making (CSDM) at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), has been providing patients with decision aids (DAs) for several years. Hypothesis: Patients identified as having low literacy and/or high decisional conflict after viewing a video decision aid will show greater resolution of their decisional conflict, higher decision self-efficacy and less decision regret if a coaching intervention is paired with a video decision aid. Decision support in the form of coaching develops patients'skills in preparing for a consultation and deliberating about their options.2 A study of women with abnormal uterine bleeding showed that pairing coaching with a DA helped patients clarify their values and preferences, reduced costs, and increased long term satisfaction.3 The investigators plan to assess the impact of coaching in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who are referred to the CSDM for a video decision aid about their treatment options. The investigators are also interested to learn whether screening for low literacy and high decisional conflict can identify a subgroup of patients who are more likely to benefit from coaching.</brief_summary>
