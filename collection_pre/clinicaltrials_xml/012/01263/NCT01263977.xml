	<brief_summary>Septic shock and multi-organ failure are among the most frequent causes of death in the ICU. Patients with septic shock require early implementation of hemodynamic therapy to keep the duration of shock state and with it microcirculatory disturbances as short as possible. In the septic shock guidelines by the american association SCCM the diagnosis of volume status is based on filling pressures, like CVP. Some studies show, that the CVP depends not only on the intravascular volume, but also on the right ventricular compliance, pulmonary vascular resistance as well as intrathoracic pressure. The aim of the Study is to evaluate if the duration of septic shock can be reduced through algorithm driven volume therapy orientated to thermodilution based volume parameters (GEDI and ELWI)</brief_summary>
