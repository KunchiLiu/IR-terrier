	<brief_title>Validation of Stroke Volume Measurement by a New Noninvasive Hemodynamic Monitoring System (NexFin)in Comparison to Different Invasive Procedures as Picco2, FloTrac and TEE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In high risc patients undergoing orthopedic surgery an extended cardiopulmonary observation improves patients safety and postoperative outcome. Therefore invasive procedures as Picco2-system, FloTrac and transesophageal echocardiography (tee) have the advantage to measure or calculate stroke volume. Disadvantage of this treatments is the need for a vascular access with all its complications. In this study the stroke volume measured by a new noninvasive finger cuff system (NexFin) should be validated in comparison to invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems as Picco2-system, FloTrac and tee.</detailed_description>
