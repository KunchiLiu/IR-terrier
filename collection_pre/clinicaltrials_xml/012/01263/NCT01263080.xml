	<brief_title>Evaluation of Mirtazapine and Folic Acid for Schizophrenia:</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of mirtazapine plus antipsychotic potentially offers considerable benefit for patients with schizophrenia. Folic acid is a promising adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia that may also provide benefits for patients with other mental disorders. Furthermore the effects of folic acid may be affected by genotype. The trial will investigate the effects of adding mirtazapine and the effects of adding folic acid to treatments for schizophrenia. At randomisation, patients will be separately randomised to mirtazapine or placebo and to folic acid or placebo. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial trial with 12-week follow-up.</detailed_description>
