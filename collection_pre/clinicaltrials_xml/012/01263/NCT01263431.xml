	<brief_title>Comparison Between Excisional Hemorrhoidectomy and Haemorrhoidal Dearterialisation With Anopexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excisional haemorrhoidectomy is burdened by severe postoperative pain. For this reason less painful treatments have been developed, such as Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation and stapled anopexy. Both techniques seem to be safe, causing little postoperative pain. A combination of the two techniques could possibly treat both bleeding and prolapse with minimal discomfort</detailed_description>
