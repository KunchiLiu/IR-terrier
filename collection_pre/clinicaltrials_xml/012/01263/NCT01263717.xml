	<brief_summary>HIV-infection and its treatment are often associated with an increase in belly fat, as well as abnormal cholesterol and problems metabolizing sugar. People with HIV infection and increased belly fat often have decreased growth hormone (GH) levels. Low GH levels may contribute independently to increased belly fat and to increased cardiovascular risk through effects on sugar metabolism, inflammation, and other mechanisms. Tesamorelin, a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue, has been shown to to reduce belly fat in patients with HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation. However, the effects of tesamorelin on fat accumulation in the liver and muscle, sugar metabolism, and cardiovascular health are not yet known. The current study is designed to determine the effects of tesamorelin treatment on fat accumulation in the muscle and liver, insulin sensitivity and sugar metabolism, and markers of cardiovascular health including blood vessel thickness (carotid intima media thickness [cIMT]) and markers of inflammation in the body. The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will decrease fat accumulation in the liver and muscle and will decrease markers of inflammation, with either neutral or beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
