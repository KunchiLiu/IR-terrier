	<brief_title>Study of Resistance Strengthening Versus Ambulation Post-Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals post liver transplantation are significantly muscle wasted due to chronic liver disease. Current Usual care only involves progressive ambulation. Resistance exercise targeted at the lower extremities are anticipated to increase muscle strength in the muscles that extend the hip, extend the knee, and plantar flex the ankle more than seen with the usual care ambulation. The anticipated increases in strength should improve functional performance of activities such as standing from a chair, walking, and climbing stairs. The improvement in strength and functional performance should improve an individuals quality of life.</detailed_description>
