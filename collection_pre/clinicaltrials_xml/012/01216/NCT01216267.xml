	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to compare several methods for measurement of Chromogranin A in their ability to serve as a marker for disease activity in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Further, in a subgroup, we will determine if taking a proton pump inhibitor affects Chromogranin A levels.</brief_summary>
