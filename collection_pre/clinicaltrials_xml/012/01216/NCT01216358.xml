	<brief_summary>The objectives of this prospective, descriptive study are to: 1. generate estimates of the incidence, prevalence, persistence, clinical impact and attributable risk of migraine due to hormonal contraception (HC) use; and 2. identify predictive factors for clinically significant changes in headache attributable to HC use. The investigators hypothesize that: 1. Most women with pre-existing migraine will have no significant change from baseline headache frequency or clinical impact attributable to HC at 3 months following initiation; a minority will report clinically significant worsening or improvement 2. The incidence of headache and migraine in HC users will not be significantly different from their incidence in NHC users 3. There will be identifiable risk factors for development or worsening of headache/migraine in the minority of HC users where that occurs.</brief_summary>
