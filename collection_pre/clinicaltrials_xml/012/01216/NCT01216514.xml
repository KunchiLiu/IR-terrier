	<brief_summary>Factors forecast Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) remain at present essentially on clinical factors (extension of the disease, achievement of the perianal ring, requirement of surgery, treatment by immunomodulatorsâ€¦). All IBD specific immunological or serological markers showed only a diagnostic role for indefinite colitis (hemorrhagic Rectocolitis vs Crohn Disease) but were never able to be considered as predictive elements of adults IBD evolution. Among the most used, the presence of ANCA's antibody and ASCA allows to separate hemorrhagic rectocolitis (ANCA + / ASCA-) from Crohn disease (ANCA-/ASCA +) and their combination present an average sensibility about 85 % and a 85 % specificity. However, 8 other antibody types were recently isolated and estimated individually during IBD in particular during child Crohn diseases (anti-OmpC, anti-I2, anti-CBir1, anti-glycans (ALCA, AMCA and ACCA) anti-Goblet cells and albicans Candida's specific anti-mannan). These complementary assays improve significantly the reliability of the diagnosis. However, if the use of these new markers has an indisputable diagnostic role, their predictive role in the evolution of IBD was estimated at the adult's only rarely during Crohn diseases. Consequently, the investigators suggest realizing an exhaustive analysis of all these new immunological markers to define, if their association can have an interest in the differentiation of stable (or little evolutionary) and unstable (or quickly evolutionary) clinical forms.</brief_summary>
