	<brief_summary>Stress-related disorders are among the most prevalent and expensive medical consequences of participation in military operations. Omega-3 fatty acids EPA/DHA derived from fish oil are known to benefit both neuronal development in the young, and cognition and mood in various populations. It is possible that soldiers receiving Omega-3 EPA/DHA will exhibit significantly higher cognitive performance, better affect/mood state, and less combat stress symptomatology compared to the placebo after 12 weeks of supplementation. A goal would be to reduce the prevalence of combat stress injuries in military personnel.</brief_summary>
