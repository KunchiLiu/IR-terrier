	<detailed_description>The CARRYING ON for heart failure (HF) study is a national, prospective, post market interventional, multi-center, open-label, pilot trial designed in two phases. The purpose of the study is to assess a short term (6 months follow-up - Phase 1) and a long term period (24 months follow-up - Phase 2), incidence of pre-specified clinical and arrhythmic events in patients with a low ejection fraction (EF) that are hospitalized for acute cardiac decompensation. A previously implanted Reveal® XT device will be used to collect heart rhythm information.</detailed_description>
