For female patients of childbearing age: Presence of a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to day 0. The patient agrees to use effective contraception if procreative potential exists. Use of reliable means of contraception (e.g. hormonal contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical barrier, abstinence) for subjects of reproductive potential (males and females) is required during study treatment and for 3 months following last dose of study drug History of myocardial infarction, angina or cerebrovascular accident related to atherosclerosis. Pulmonary disorder (e.g. FEV1 or DLCO ≤ 70% upper expected).

Has other existing serious medical conditions that could adversely affect the ability of the patient to be treated in accordance with the protocol. Any condition, therapy, or medical condition, which, in the opinion of the attending physician could represent a risk for the patient or adversely affect the study objectives.
