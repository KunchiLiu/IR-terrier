	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency (ID) affects up to 25% of Swedish infants and severe ID is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems. To avoid this, iron supplements or iron-fortified infant foods are recommended for infants. However, the optimal iron dose and mode of delivery have not yet been established. This is a concern as excessive iron intake may impair growth and increase morbidity in iron-sufficient infants. Previous studies have suggested that iron-fortified foods may have different effects than iron supplements. In this study, the investigators will investigate whether the mode of iron administration (supplementation vs. fortification) and the amount consumed (high intakes vs. low intakes) affect iron absorption, iron utilization, and zinc absorption in healthy term non-iron-deficient 6-month-old infants.</brief_summary>
