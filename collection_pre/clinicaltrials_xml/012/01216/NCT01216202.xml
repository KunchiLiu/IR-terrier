	<brief_summary>Preoperative radiotherapy and pelvic surgery is recommended to many patients with rectal cancer. For men there are theoretical reasons to believe that the treatment may effect hormone levels, spermatogenesis, sexual function and wellbeing. To address these questions a longitudinal observational study was initiated where patients can choose to take part in one, two or three parts of the study. The three different parts are blood tests, questionnaires and semen samples.</brief_summary>
