	<brief_title>Effect of Dexlansoprazole on Bone Homeostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research on drugs that affect bone homeostasis have shown changes in levels of bone formation and resorption biomarkers. This study will evaluate the effect of dexlansoprazole on bone homeostasis by assessing changes in biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption. This study will also assess changes in bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan and other markers of bone homeostasis. The study will consist of a 12-week screening period, a 26-week treatment period with a total of 5 visits during the treatment period and a follow-up visit at Week 52 for bone mineral density assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Is postmenopausal female in general good health with a body mass index of ≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2. Must have biochemical markers of bone formation, procollagen type 1 Nterminal propeptide and bonespecific alkaline phosphatase, and bone resorption, crosslinked βCterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and urine Ntelopeptide within normal postmenopausal female ranges. Has not taken proton pump inhibitor medications within 6 months prior to screening and agrees to refrain from taking them through the last dose of study drug, except studysupplied dexlansoprazole or esomeprazole. Has parathyroid hormone or thyroid stimulating hormone levels outside of the reference range at Week 12 and has 25OHD level &lt;32 ng/mL at Week 2. Has baseline bone mineral density by dualenergy xray absorptiometry defined as a Tscore lower than 2.0 at the total hip, spine, or femoral neck based on Caucasian reference values. Has a disorder strongly associated with osteoporosis Has a history of lumbar laminectomy, vertebroplasty, vertebral deformity or severe lumbar scoliosis that interferes with measurement or performance of the dual xray absorptiometry . Has a history or clinical manifestations of uncontrolled or significant metabolic, hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic, hepatic, renal, urologic, immunologic, or psychiatric disorder as determined by the investigator which may affect the ability of the subject to participate or potentially confound the trial results. Has family history of genetic bone disorders.</criteria>
