	<brief_summary>The outcome of treatment of chronic hepatitis B is determined by viral and host interaction, thus the combination therapy of immunomodulator (PEG-IFN) and potent antiviral drug (entecavir) should improve the response rate. In addition, the simultaneous assessment of viral and host genetic factors associated with SVR may help to identify predictors of treatment outcomes, which will in turn significant reduce the cost/effect of therapy</brief_summary>
