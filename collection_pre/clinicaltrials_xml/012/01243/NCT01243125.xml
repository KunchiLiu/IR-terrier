	<brief_summary>NVC-422 is a topical, non-antibiotic, fast-acting, broad-spectrum anti-microbial, which exhibits the potential to prevent the growth of urinary pathogens, including Proteus and others. The use of a catheter irrigation solution that can prevent biofilm formation and encrustation leading to blockage may keep the catheter patent longer, resulting in fewer catheter changes, potentially lower incidence of UTIs, and better patient quality of life. The study population will include male and female spinal cord injury (SCI) and other neurogenic bladder patients with chronic indwelling transurethral urinary catheters who have a recent repeated history of urinary catheter encrustation and/or blockage. Subjects will receive two treatment regimens: one treatment regimen with NVC-422 sterile irrigation solution and one treatment regimen with sterile saline irrigation solution. Each treatment regimen will consist of a total of 8 treatments, with a washout period between treatment regimens.</brief_summary>
