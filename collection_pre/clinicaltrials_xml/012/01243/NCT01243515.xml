	<brief_title>Comparison of a Non-Invasive Central Venous Pressure Device and Physical Examination in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The estimation of central venous pressure (CVP) is part of routine clinical examination. Central venous pressure is the indication of the pressure in the right atrium of the heart and it can be measured by determining the height of the blood column in the internal or external jugular vein. Clinical use of CVP has a wide range of applications including diagnosis of heart failure, pleural effusion, hypervolemia, hypovolemia, and sepsis. The standard clinical method for attaining CVP non-invasively is the physical examination of jugular venous pulse (JVP). The JVP provides a useful estimate of the CVP. It is often difficult to identify the internal jugular vein to determine the JVP. The internal jugular vein is deep and adjacent to the carotid artery and pulsations derived from the artery may obscure the subtle venous pulsations. Manoeuvres to differentiate carotid pulsation and jugular pulsation are helpful in identifying the internal jugular vein, however determining the JVP based on the internal jugular vein examination is difficult. Examination of the external jugular vein to determine JVP is an appealing alternative. The external jugular vein is easier to visualize and studies have demonstrated that this is a reliable method that correlates highly with catheter measured CVP.</detailed_description>
