	<brief_summary>Calorie restriction extends life span and prevents aging-related diseases in several species. Odorants from live yeast restrain the beneficial effects of calorie restriction in Drosophila Melanogaster. The investigators hypothesize that visual and odorous food stimuli impact the neuroendocrine and metabolic response to starvation in healthy humans. In this randomized cross-over intervention study 12 healthy, young men will fast twice for 60-hours in the presence or absence of food-related visual and odorous stimuli. At baseline and on the last morning of each intervention an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed. During the OGTT blood is sampled and hypothalamic neuronal activity is measured by functional MRI.</brief_summary>
