	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, two-part study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination treatment with dalotuzumab + MK-2206, dalotuzumab + MK-0752, or dalotuzumab + MK-8669 (ridaforolimus). The study will determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed after administration of each of the combinations at various doses and define the maximum tolerated dose of each combination. Preliminary anti-tumor activity of these combinations, in two groups of participants having selected tumor biomarkers, will be assessed: one group with metastatic or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer and one group with metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. The dalotuzumab + MK-8669 and dalotuzumab + MK-2206 arms will be enriched with female platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer participants. The dalotuzumab + MK-0752 arm will be enriched with metastatic or recurrent wild-type kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) colorectal cancer participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must not have any medical conditions that may impact compliance with the protocol, limit interpretation of study results, or pose an unacceptable medical risk. Participant must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (EGOG) Performance Scale. Participant is able to swallow capsules and has no condition that will preclude swallowing and absorbing oral medications on an ongoing basis Participant has no history of a prior malignancy with the exception of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; basal cell carcinoma of the skin; adequately treated localized prostate carcinoma with prostatic specific antigen (PSA) &lt; 1.0; or has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease for five years, or is deemed at low risk for recurrence by his/her treating physician. Participant has at least one measurable metastatic or recurrent lesion according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Part A: Participant must have a histologicallyconfirmed metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor that has failed to respond to standard therapy, progressed despite standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or participant is not a candidate for standard therapy, or is unwilling to undergo standard therapy. There is no limit on the number of prior treatment regimens. Part B: A female participant assigned to the dalotuzumab + MK2206 or dalotuzumab + ridaforolimus treatment arms must have histologicallyconfirmed metastatic or recurrent platinumresistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has failed to respond to standard therapy, progressed despite standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or participant is not a candidate for standard therapy, or is unwilling to undergo standard therapy. Participants may have received any number of prior treatment regimens. A participant assigned to the dalotuzumab + MK0752 treatment arms must have histologicallyconfirmed metastatic or recurrent wildtype KRAS colorectal cancer that has failed to respond to standard therapy, progressed despite standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or participant is not a candidate for standard therapy, or is unwilling to undergo standard therapy. Participants may have received any number of prior treatment regimens. Participant agrees to provide archival tumor tissue sample or undergo biopsy for analysis of gene expression levels. Participant has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy (including monoclonal antibodies) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) or who has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier, or major surgery &lt;4 weeks earlier. Participant is currently participating or has participated in a study with an investigational compound or device within 28 days, or 5X halflife of the investigational compound (excluding monoclonal antibodies), whichever is longer, of initial dosing on this study. Participants previously treated with a monoclonal antibody will be eligible to participate after a 28 day washout period. Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded. Participant has significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIIV heart failure, unstable angina, or a myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Participant is known to have diabetes that is poorly controlled Participant is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children during the study Participant is known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive Participant has active Hepatitis B or C infection Participant has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion Participant requires treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than prescribed corticosteroids at stable doses for at least two weeks prior to the first dose of study drug Participant requires treatment with medication(s) that strongly or moderately induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 Participant is using growth hormone or growth hormone inhibitors Participant requires treatment with therapeutic warfarin</criteria>
