	<brief_summary>Nanotechnology is the controlled generation and manipulation of matter in dimensions less than 100 nm. Silver has been used for its bactericidal properties. The investigators propose to study the American Biotech Laboratory 32 ppm silver solution over a 14-day period in human volunteers to determine the toxicity and to quantify cytochrome P450 enzyme effects of this solution.</brief_summary>
