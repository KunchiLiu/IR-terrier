	<brief_summary>The treatment of cancer is increasingly aimed at molecular targets derived from studies of the oncogenes and tumor suppressors known to be involved in the development of human cancers. The increased specificity obtained from these new targeted treatments has developed over the past many decades. From the use of general cytotoxic agents such as nitrogen mustard in the 1940s, to the development of natural-product anticancer drugs in the 1960s including the Vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines there has been improvements in cancer chemotherapy. Early in the development process drugs were used that were found to be more cytotoxic to cancer cells than normal cells. Later developments included the use of specific monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins targeted to cell surface receptors. In addition, as our knowledge of molecular biology increased, specific agents that inactivate kinases in growth-promoting pathways were used to treat cancer. These newer more targeted approaches have improved the response rate in cancer and reduced side effects of anticancer treatment but have not yet resulted in cures for the majority of patients with metastatic disease. There are general broad classifications of chemotherapeutic drug effects. One of the earliest and still most utilized are the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Tracer PET in Early Phase Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can probe various aspects of tumor biology using a variety of radio-labeled imaging agents also called "tracers". Oncologic PET imaging has seen a dramatic rise in clinical utilization over the past decade for cancer detection, staging, and evaluating residual or recurrent disease following therapy. These clinical scans use the tracer [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which accumulates in cells in proportion to glucose (GLUT) transporter and hexokinase activity. FDG provides a measure of tissue glucose metabolism. Concurrent with this clinical growth, a number of other PET tracers have received significant attention in research for a variety of imaging targets. Of special interest are the tracers 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and [15O]water (H215O). The uptake, retention/washout, and ultimate biodistribution of these tracers are each related to different functional or molecular processes. As such, each can be used to probe a different aspect of tumor biology: FLT directly assesses tumor proliferation and H2O quantifies tumor perfusion. This companion clinical study is designed to obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessments using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 50 evaluable patients (those patients who had baseline and follow-up PET imaging) with various forms of malignancy and at approximately 28 days (day 25 -32). Overview of the PET Tracers FDG, FLT, and H2O The use of more specifically targeted imaging agents, such as PET radiopharmaceuticals, has great potential for overcoming the limitations of standard anatomic imaging in malignancy Hypotheses to be Tested: The driving hypothesis for the overall line of research is that multiple PET imaging biomarkers can provide improved image-guided personalized care of patients with various malignancies receiving investigational therapies and recently approved therapies at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI). The term "personalized care" is used here to broadly include the prediction of tumor behavior prior to the start of therapy, tumor surveillance, prognostication, and eventually individualized assignment of patients to conventional, aggressive, or investigational therapies early in their clinical courses. This pilot project will obtain initial data on the value of these PET biomarkers for such image-guided personalized care. Specific hypotheses to be tested include: - HYPOTHESIS I: Dynamic single-scan PET imaging provides biologically relevant functional assessments of effect early in the course of therapy when compared to standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)metrics of response. A composite standardized uptake value (SUV) will be constructed from all the PET tracers applied to each individual. Subjects with &lt;35% decrease in composite SUV with be classified as "progressing by PET", and subjects with â‰¥ 35% decrease in composite SUV will be classified as "non-progressing by PET". - HYPOTHESIS II: Multi-tracer PET biomarkers, obtained in conjunction with a novel therapeutic, are better able to predict tumor aggressiveness than conventional radiographic imaging. This will include better prediction of time to progression (TTP) and patient survival - HYPOTHESIS III: Characterization of multiple aspects of tumor function (glucose metabolism, proliferation, and perfusion) at baseline and after therapy provides new insight into tumor status that can eventually guide selection of the most appropriate therapy. Sufficient statistical power is expected to be obtained under this companion protocol to validate the experimental imaging evaluations in hypothesis I. Hypotheses II and III will be exploratory and provide insight into valuable information to be uses in subsequent multi-tracer PET studies. Data regarding these three hypotheses will be obtained in this work by studying the correlation of PET imaging biomarkers with clinical outcomes and available tumor biologic information. Clinical Rationale: This companion clinical study is designed to obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessments using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 50 evaluable patients (those patients who had baseline and followup PET imaging) with various forms of malignancy and at approximately 28 days (day 25-32), after institution of the therapeutic drug various primary therapeutic clinical trials. The proposed PET imaging companion studies will be used in patients receiving investigational or recently approved therapies. The investigational therapies and recently approved therapies will vary and the appropriate companion PET imaging studies will be used to assess the most relevant therapeutic effect.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Eligible Adult patients currently meeting inclusion criteria and will be treated with an investigational or recently approved therapeutic agent at HCI. 2. Patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this research study. 3. Patients must document their willingness to be followed for a period of time. For the purposes of imaging data analysis this will ideally be for at least 12 months after completing the investigational or recently approved therapy, however this may not always be possible. 4. All patients must sign a written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines. 5. Female patients who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile will undergo a serum pregnancy test prior to baseline and the subsequent set of multitracer PET scans. 6. Pretreatment laboratory tests for patients receiving [18F]FLT must be performed within 21 days prior to study entry. 1. Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered radiopharmaceuticals. 2. Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant. 3. Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning. 4. Patients known to be HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) positive. This is due to the potential toxicities of FLT in HIV positive patients</criteria>
