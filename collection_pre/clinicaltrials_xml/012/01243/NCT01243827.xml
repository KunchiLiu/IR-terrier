	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare of carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker and bisoprolol, a beta1- selective beta-blocker for reducing the central pulse pressure and thereby left ventricular (LV) mass in never-treated hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Effect of cARvedilol Compared To bISoprolol on cenTral Pulse Pressure in Hypertension (ARTIST) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carvedilol and bisoprolol are established beta-blockers for treating hypertension or chronic heart failure because these beta-blockers have cardio-protective effects. Recent studies have shown that the change in central pulse pressure is more closely associated with the change in cardiac load than the change in brachial pressure during hypertension treatment. Vasodilating beta-blockers may decrease central pulse pressure more than beta1- selective beta-blockers, because vasodilators reduced the magnitude of reflection wave by dilating peripheral muscular arteries. The investigators hypothesized that carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker, would be more effective than bisoprolol, a beta1- selective beta-blocker in reducing central pulse pressure and thereby LV mass, through the reduction in the magnitude of reflection wave. The aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis in an active controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison, prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) design study. At least 100 patients will be enrolled in each group and the follow up duration will be 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is to compare the change in central pulse pressure between the two groups.</detailed_description>
