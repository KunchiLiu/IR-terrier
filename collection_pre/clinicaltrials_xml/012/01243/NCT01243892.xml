	<criteria>Bone age less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 8 years (females) or &lt;/= 10 years (males) as determined by xray of the left hand and wrist obtained within six months before enrollment Prepubertal males and females by physical exam Naive to rhGH therapy Diagnosis of IGHD or ISS by standard pharmacologic testing and no other discernable etiology for short stature Height standard deviation score (Ht SDS) &lt;/= 1.5 (&lt;/= 5th percentile) for IGHD participants; Ht SDS &lt;/= 2.25 (&lt;/= 1.2 percentile) for ISS participants Short stature etiologies other than IGHD or ISS Participants receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy (greater than [&gt;] 3 months) for other medical conditions Participants with active malignancy or any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the participant if rhGH were initiated Females with turner syndrome Any previous rhGH treatment Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial Pediatric participants with closed epiphyses Participants prescribed rhGH doses outside the variance of NCGS control participant dosing</criteria>
