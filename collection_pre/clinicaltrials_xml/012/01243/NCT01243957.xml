	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure if there is any difference in how the body breaks down or inactivates either fluoxetine or LY2216684 when both of these medicines are given together. This study will look at how fluoxetine might affect LY2216684 and how giving LY2216684 might affect fluoxetine in the body. The duration of study participation in this study is approximately 36 days not including the screening appointment. This study requires 1 research unit confinement of 29 days/28 nights followed by 1 outpatient appointment. A screening appointment is required within 30 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
