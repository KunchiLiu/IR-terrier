	<brief_summary>This study aims at evaluating spinal cord structure using diffusion tensor imaging in patients with cervical spondylosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Patients With Cervical Spondylosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the cervical spinal cord will be performed in patients with cervical spondylosis with varying degrees of symptoms and in healthy control subjects. Fibre tracking of main spinal tracts will be performed. Regions of interest will also be identified. Diffusion parameters will be extracted. This will allow quantification of degree of damage in of the spinal cord. The findings will be related to motor function measures and comprehensive clinical tests of sensory and motor function.</detailed_description>
