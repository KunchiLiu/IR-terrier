	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue in the laboratory from patients who received cetuximab may help doctors understand and predict how well patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in predicting response to cetuximab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Predicting Response to Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine, among patients with advanced CRC, whether the effect of treatment (cetuximab vs bevacizumab) on progression-free survival (PFS) depends on tumor BRAF V600E mutational status. Secondary - To study the relationships between tumor BRAF V600E mutational status, OS, and tumor response. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Previously collected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded baseline tumor samples are analyzed for BRAF V600E mutation. Mutation status is correlated with clinical response and outcome data from patients enrolled on CALGB-C80405.</detailed_description>
