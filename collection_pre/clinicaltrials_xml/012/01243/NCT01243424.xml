	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the longterm impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, relevant efficacy parameters (e.g., glycaemic parameters) and safety (e.g., weight and hypoglycaemia) of treatment with linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes at elevated cardiovascular risk receiving usual care, and compare outcome against glimepiride.</brief_summary>
