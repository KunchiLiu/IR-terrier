	<brief_summary>Severe dental decay affects children physically, emotionally, socially and thereby impacts on their quality of life. Evidence from developed countries showed that children with severe dental decay weighed less than their peers and following dental treatment children's growth and quality of life improved. This suggests that treatment of severe dental decay may enhance growth and wellbeing. A study was carried out in Saudi to test that hypothesis.</brief_summary>
