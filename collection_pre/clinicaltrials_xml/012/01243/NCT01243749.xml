	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Endeavor Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System in a Real-World Patient Population in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Resolute stent is designed to support the approach of delivering drug to the coronary arterial tissue over a longer period of time than that offered by current approved DES products. This method of prolonged drug elution may address the need to control local vascular neointimal proliferation in patients with complex lesions for extended therapeutic effect. The purpose of this multi-center trial is to investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of the Endeavor Resolute drug-eluting stent in every-day patients, like stable and unstable patients with single or multi-vessel disease and/or complex lesions. Patients should be treated according to normal hospital routine practice and in line with the applicable guidelines on percutaneous coronary interventions and the Instructions For Use of the device. 1800 patients will be enrolled from China at approximately 40 centers where Endeavor Resolute stent is commercially available.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for treatment in the trial: 1. Age â‰¥ 18 years or minimum age as required by local regulations 2. The patient is an acceptable candidate for treatment with a drugeluting stent in accordance with the applicable guidelines on percutaneous coronary interventions, the Instructions for Use of the Resolute stent and the Declaration of Helsinki 3. The patient or legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial and has consented to participate and authorized the collection and release of his/her medical information by signing a Patient Informed Consent Form 4. Intention to electively implant at least one Resolute stent 5. The patient is willing and able to cooperate with study procedures and required follow up visits Patients will be excluded from the trial if any of the following criteria are met: 1. Known intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidin, heparin, bivalirudin, cobalt, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, polymer coatings (e.g. Biolinx), zotarolimus, rapamycin, tacrolimus, everolimus, or any other analogue or derivative, or contrast media 2. Women with known pregnancy or who are lactating 3. High probability of nonadherence to the followup requirements (due to social, psychological or medical reasons) 4. Currently participating in another trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current trial requirements 5. Planned surgery within 6 months of PCI unless dual antiplatelet therapy is maintained throughout the perisurgical period 6. Previous enrollment in the Resolute China Registry</criteria>
