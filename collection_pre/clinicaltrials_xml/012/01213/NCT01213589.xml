	<brief_summary>The purpose of this post-market release registry is to collect additional information concerning safety, performance and health economic data with respect to the Medtronic VALIANT Thoracic Stent Graft with the Xcelerant Delivery System in the treatment of descending thoracic aortic dissections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The VIRTUE Post Marketing Surveillance Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient device for use in this registry is the Medtronic VALIANT Thoracic Stent Graft System that received CE mark approval in March 2005. The Medtronic VALIANT Thoracic Stent Graft with Xcelerant Delivery System is designed to treat diseases of the descending thoracic aorta including but not limited to aneurysms and dissections. The VALIANT Stent Graft is designed to exclude the aneurysm, the false lumen or site of rupture and restore the blood flow through the stent graft lumen. The device is intended for use either in patients who are candidates for conventional surgical repair, and in patients who are not candidates for conventional surgical repair due to pre-existing risk factors. This registry is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center, European clinical registry with patients diagnosed with descending thoracic aortic dissection. For this registry standard hospital procedures with respect to patient interventional care for thoracic aortic diseases will be followed. This is a descriptive registry in which no specific hypotheses will be statistically tested.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient will be more than or equal to 18 years of age; or older if required by local regulations. Patient has an indication for treatment by either endovascular stent graft implantation for either an acute, subacute or chronic Type B dissection. Patient is amenable for stentgraft treatment (in accordance with the IFU). The patient is willing and able to cooperate with registry procedures and required followup visits. The patient or legal guardian has signed a patient informed consent form, including data privacy authorization (this criteria is not applicable for patients presenting in emergency with ruptured dissection and for whom legal representative is not available informed consent can be requested after surgical procedure). Patients with a thoracic dissection for which optimal treatment is observation and medical management. Patient with current non aortic medical condition with a life expectancy less than one year. The patient is participating in another device or drug study (patient must have completed the followup phase of any previous study at least 30 days prior to enrolment in this registry). Time interval between medical indication for surgical intervention and endovascular procedure exceeds 4 months (122 days).</criteria>
