	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is determine if High-Volume Hemofiltration in addition to 'contemporary' care will result in an improvement of select clinical outcomes when compared to 'contemporary' care alone in the treatment of critically ill patients with ARF secondary to septic shock.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemofiltration in Burns: RESCUE (Randomized Controlled Evaluation of Hemofiltration in Adult Burn Patients With Septic Shock and Acute Renal Failure)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common and devastating complication in critically ill burn patients with mortality reported to be between 80 and 100%.(3-7) Despite recent advances in burn care, the unacceptably high mortality rate in this subgroup has not changed over time. The pathogenesis of ARF in burns, similar to other critically ill populations, is often multi-factorial with one major component being sepsis induced ischemic tubular necrosis. Thus, ARF secondary to septic shock is a common and devastating condition in the burn ICU.</detailed_description>
