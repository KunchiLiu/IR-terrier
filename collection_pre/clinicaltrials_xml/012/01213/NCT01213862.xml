	<brief_summary>Home visits (HV) are one of the multidisciplinary approaches that has already shown to benefit the follow-up of Heart Failure (HF) patients. It is considered to be one of the most effective and humane approaches as it educates and takes care of the patient in his/her routine environment. In this study, the follow-up of HF patients in a home setting after being discharged from hospital will include the reinforcement, monitoring and re-evaluation of guidelines previously provided about the disease and self-care, compliance to prescribed medicines and, specially, the early recognition of decompensation signs and symptoms by patients and their caregivers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Based Intervention Led by Nurse in Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidemiological overview of cardiovascular diseases in which HF turns out to be the main cause of re-hospitalizations in the Unified Health System, which has not changed over the years, impairs the management of the limited resources of the public health system. Additionally, HF leads to substantial damage to the quality of life of patients, many of them at a socially productive age, resulting in early retirements and absences. In this study, the objective is to evaluate the impact of the follow-up of heart failure patients at home, interspersed with telephone contacts, by the nursing team, after hospital discharge, regarding knowledge of the disease, self-care skills and quality of life improvement, compared with the conventional follow-up of patients in a 6-month period without this intervention, as well as to build a mobile-technology computer structure to make the use of cardiology nursing evaluation forms viable; correlate sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with treatment compliance and re-hospitalization rates in both; and ascertain home follow-up costs. With this purpose, a two-center randomized clinical trial, blinded for the endpoints re-hospitalization and costs, was designed.</detailed_description>
