	<brief_summary>HbA1c is used as a gold standard to see whether patients have optimal glycemic control. Today, many physicians rely solely on HbA1c to change medication. However, there is a select group of patients that have low average glucose levels but high HbA1c levels. The investigators believe that these patients are fast glycators meaning that they incorporate sugar into their hemoglobin faster than normal. The investigators want to determine whether these patients are fast glycators.</brief_summary>
