	<brief_summary>The Örebro prevention program is a brief (6 x 30 minutes)program administered to parents of 13-16 year old youths in regular parental meetings. The program aims to encourage parents to maintain a restrictive attitude towards youth drinking throughout their children's teenage years, and thereby postpone and reduce youth drinking. A previous quasi-experimental study by the program developers showed a sustained alcohol-specific restrictivity among parents exposed to the program, and also a reduction on drinking measures among the youths of the exposed parents (Koutakis, Stattin &amp; Kerr, 2008). This study aims to investigate whether these effects are sustained also when the program has gone into wide dissemination in Sweden.</brief_summary>
