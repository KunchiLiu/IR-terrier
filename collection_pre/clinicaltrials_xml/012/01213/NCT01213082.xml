	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that proton beam irradiation combined with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is safe and potentially more effective than intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy alone in eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ProspectiveTrial of Proton Beam Combined With Anti-VEGF Therapy for Exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation combined with anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to be synergistic in treating cancer and result in sustained tumor regression. On-going clinical trials have shown potential synergism between intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and epiretinal brachytherapy administered during vitrectomy surgery in treating eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration (eAMD). In this study, we test the hypothesis that radiation to the macula administered noninvasively via proton beam is well-tolerated in eyes with eAMD when combined with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and that this combination therapy may act synergistically to result in sustained treatment effect in eyes with eAMD.</detailed_description>
