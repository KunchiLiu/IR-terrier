	<brief_title>Laparoscopic vs Abdominal Radical Hysterectomy In Patients With Early Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is one of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) recommended treatments for early cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to compare radical hysterectomy by laparoscopic approach and open radical hysterectomy in a single center randomized clinical trial. Nevertheless, there are no finished randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and abdominal radical hysterectomy although there is an ongoing trial. Methods: Were enrolled 30 IA2 with lymph vascular space invasion and IB cervical cancer patients. Postoperative pain intensity was defined as primary endpoint and pain intensity was measured by a 10-point numeric rating scale. Secondary outcomes were: intraoperative and other postoperative outcomes, histopathological outcomes and 5-year follow-up. Data analysis is being done at this moment</detailed_description>
