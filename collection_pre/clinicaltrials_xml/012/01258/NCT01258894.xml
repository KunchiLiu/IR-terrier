	<brief_summary>Studies revealed that patients with hereditary persistence of AFP also had persistent abnormal AFP. Therefore, this study will recruit the patients and their family with elevated AFP (&gt;20 ng/mL) and normal AFP patients being control groups. Then, their AFP genes extracted from the blood will be analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abnormal AFP elevation was usually noted in liver regeneration, HCC, nonseminomatous germ cell tumors or other malignant tumors. However, some studies revealed that patients with hereditary persistence of AFP also had persistent abnormal AFP. Therefore, we study will recruit the patients and their family with elevated AFP (&gt;20 ng/mL) and normal AFP patients being control groups. Then, their AFP genes extracted from the blood will be analyzed. The hypothesis of this study is that the mutation of AFP gene might be one of the causes of abnormal AFP.</detailed_description>
