	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that ArTiMist (sublingual artemether spray) is better than intravenous quinine in reducing parasite counts by &gt;= 90% within 24 hours after the start of treatment in children with severe malaria, or uncomplicated malaria with gastrointestinal complications</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superiority of ArTiMist Versus Quinine in Children With Severe Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries, despite the availability of highly effective antimalarial therapy. One of the key contributing factors is the delay in the initiation of treatment. ArTiMist is a sublingual formulation of the established antimalarial treatment, artemether. In previous studies good bioavailability has been demonstrated. In an exploratory study (ART003) ArTiMist demonstrated a non statistically significant improvement of 26% (when compared to intravenous quinine) in the numbers of patients experiencing a parasite reduction of &gt;= 90% within 24 hours of the initiation of treatment. This Phase 3 study is being conducted to establish whether treatment with ArTiMist in children with severe falciparum malaria or uncomplicated falciparum malaria with gastrointestinal complications is at least 20% superior in providing parasitological success (defined as &gt;= 90% reduction in parasite count at 24 hours after start of treatment) when compared to intravenous quinine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patient's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent and the patient has assented (where relevant) to participation in the trial 2. The patient is a child that weighs between 5.00 kg and 15.00 kg inclusive 3. The patient has falciparum malaria as evidenced by thick or thin blood smears of ≥ 500 P Falciparum per mcl (patients with mixed infections may be included provided ≥ 500 P Falciparum per mcl) 4. The patient has either: severe or complicated falciparum malaria as determined by the investigator based on the WHO criteria for severity, and/or uncomplicated falciparum malaria but is unable to tolerate oral medication as a result of gastrointestinal complications such as vomiting or diarrhoea. 1. The patient's legally acceptable representative does not provide informed consent for participation, or the child if capable, does not assent to participation in the trial. 2. Ability to tolerate oral therapy 3. Patient has received any antimalarial therapy within the 7 days prior to first study drug administration. 4. Patient has evidence of significant coinfections (this does not include mixed Plasmodium infections). 5. Patient has a contraindication, allergy or is otherwise intolerant to either artemether or quinine .</criteria>
