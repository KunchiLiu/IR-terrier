	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY573636-sodium to be given in combination with sunitinib to patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and to determine any side effects that may be associated with LY573636-sodium and sunitinib combination in this patient population. The tumor response rate will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Carcinoma, Renal Cell</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Sunitinib</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic RCC Patients must have received no prior treatment with a cytotoxicbased chemotherapy regimen Patients must have measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines Have adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function Have a serum albumin level greater than equal to 3.0 g/L Patients with reproductive potential should use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug Exhibit patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow for adequate followup Have given written informed consent approved by Lilly and the ethical review board (ERB)/institutional review board (IRB) governing the site Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancerrelated hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy, for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (except alopecia). Patients who have received wholebrain radiation must wait 90 days before starting study therapy Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry Have received a prior cytotoxic chemotherapybased systemic therapy for metastatic RCC Have had any of the following within 12 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism Ongoing cardiac arrhythmias greater than New York Health Association Class II (Protocol Attachment JZAI.4), atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the QTc interval to greater than 450 msec for males or greater than 470 msec for females Have uncontrolled hypertension (greater than 150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy), or history of poor compliance with antihypertensive treatment Patients with documented central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of study entry. Patients with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before study entry Patients with serious concomitant OR preexisting disorders, including active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, incompatible with the study (at the discretion of the investigator) Patients receiving warfarin therapy for treatment of venous thrombosis or other prothrombotic conditions Patients with a second primary malignancy that could affect interpretation of the results. NOTE: Patients with adequately treated carcinoma of the skin (excluding melanoma) and patients with a prior history of malignancy who have been diseasefree for greater than 2 years are eligible Patients who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating LY573636 Patients who have previously received sunitinib Patients who are unable to swallow capsules Patients who require concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors Women who are pregnant or lactating</criteria>
