	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, safety and immunogenicity study of GelVac™ nasal powder H5N1 influenza vaccine. Healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 49 years of age who are eligible for study participation will be enrolled in the trial. It is expected that 10 subjects will be screened to obtain 7 subjects who will be eligible for study participation. The primary objective is to determine the frequency and severity of local and systemic adverse events of vaccine. The secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine based on geometric mean titers (GMT) of serum HAI, serum neutralizing, and nasal wash IgA antibodies.</brief_summary>

Have a clinically significant structural abnormality of the nasopharynx (e.g., obvious deviation that obstructs airflow in either nostril), as determined by the investigator 22. acute respiratory disease at the time of enrollment. 23. febrile illness with temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees F) within 72 hours prior to enrollment. 24. receipt of allergy shots within the preceding 7 days or expected to receive allergy shots within 7 days following vaccination. 25. any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the participant. 26. presence of any active disease or condition at the administration site that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impact vaccine delivery or assessment of vaccination site. 27. history of drug abuse or alcohol abuse in the five years prior to enrollment.
