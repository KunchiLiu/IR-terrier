	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to determine among the patients included a subpopulation that does not need a defibrillator. This will be done by comparing the number of discordant segments (mismatch) between patients who have a severe arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) with appropriate electrical therapy within 3 years of monitoring and others. "Mismatch" in the definition of this objective is the usual definition: score 3.4 in I123-MIBG (Iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine) and PET at 0,1,2.</brief_summary>
