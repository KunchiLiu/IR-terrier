	<brief_summary>Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoclonal antibody that activates the cell death pathway in tumor cells by specifically binding to TRAIL-R1 with high affinity. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest that these agents could interact synergistically. This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ChildPugh Class A. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) advanced stage (C) hepatocellular carcinoma, or BCLC intermediate stage (B) hepatocellular carcinoma if treatment with transarterial chemoembolization is not considered appropriate Measurable disease demonstrating intratumoral arterial enhancement by contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT), with use of multislice scanners, or contrast enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with at least 1 tumor lesion that meets the following criteria: located in the liver; can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension; well delineated area of viable, hypervascular (contrast enhancement in the arterial phase) tumor that is &gt;2 centimeter (cm) in the axial plane; suitable for repeat measurement; OR not previously treated with locoregional or systemic treatment unless the lesion shows a welldelineated area of viable (contrast enhancement in the arterial phase) tumor that is &gt;2 cm in the axial plane. (If the lesion is poorly demarcated or exhibits atypical enhancement as a result of the previous intervention, then it cannot be selected as a target lesion) Radiologic eligibility (measurable disease) must be must be confirmed by the BICR prior to randomization. Adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function as defined in the protocol. Performance status of 0, 1 or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale Age 18 years or older Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of researchrelated health information), and comply with the study and followup procedures. Any comorbid condition that in the judgment of the investigator renders the subject at high risk of treatment complications or reduces the possibility of assessing clinical effect. Received prior investigational or noninvestigational cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biological therapy (including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, small molecules or other immunotherapy) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. History of organ allograft. Previously received mapatumumab or sorafenib. Underwent resection, radiofrequency ablation, radiation or chemoembolization within 4 weeks before enrollment or not recovered from such treatments. Need for concomitant anticancer therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiofrequency ablation) or other investigational agents during the study treatment period. Major surgery (i.e., the opening of a major body cavity, requiring the use of general anesthesia) within 4 weeks before enrollment; minor surgery (except for insertion of vascular access device) within 2 weeks before enrollment; or not yet recovered from the effects of the surgery. Systemic steroids within 1 week before enrollment except steroids used as part of an antiemetic regimen or maintenancedose steroids for noncancerous disease. Hepatic encephalopathy, per the investigator's evaluation. History of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding requiring procedural intervention (e.g., variceal banding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure, arterial embolization, topical coagulation therapy) within 4 weeks before enrollment. Gastrointestinal disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for intravenous hyperalimentation. History of any infection requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics within 2 weeks before enrollment. Known brain or spinal cord metastases unless adequately treated (surgery or radiotherapy) with no evidence of progression and neurologically stable off anticonvulsants and steroids. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, &gt;= Class II congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association Classification for Congestive Heart Failure within 6 months before enrollment. Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;150 millimeters of mercury [mmHg] or diastolic pressure &gt;90 mmHg despite optimal medical management). Using and unable to discontinue use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., including but not limited to St. John's Wort, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital) Pregnant female or nursing mother. All females with an intact uterus (unless amenorrheic for the 24 months before enrollment) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. All nonsterile or nonpostmenopausal females must practice a medically accepted method of contraception over the course of the study and for 60 days after the last dose of study agent. Males who do not agree to use effective contraception during the study and for a period of 60 days following the final dose of study agent. Subject is currently enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 30 days since ending other investigational device or drug study(s) or subject is receiving other investigational agents. Acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (glomoerular filtration rate &lt;30 milliliters [mL]/minute/1.73 square meters) or acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepatorenal syndrome. Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels &gt;2,000 international units/mL.</criteria>
