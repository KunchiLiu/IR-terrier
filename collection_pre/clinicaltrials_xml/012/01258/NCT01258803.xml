	<brief_summary>A study to compare the bronchodilatory effect of a single dose of Mometasone Furoate/Formoterol Fumarate (MF/F) pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI) delivered with and without an AeroChamber Plus® with Flow-Vu® Anti-Static Valved Holding Chamber (spacer) versus Placebo MDI (combined with and without spacer) and formoterol fumarate (F) dry powder inhaler (DPI). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and each participant was to receive a single dose of each of 4 treatments in each period. Each treatment period was separated by a 5 to 7 day washout period. It assumed that a single dose MF/F MDI 100/10 microgram (mcg) delivered with a spacer would produce bronchodilation, defined as a significant increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC[0-12 hr]) when compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
