	<brief_title>Tai Chi and Physical Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) causes pain and long-term disability, and the public health impact will increase as the population ages. In addition to inconsistent effectiveness, current treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, knee replacement, and physical therapy may be expensive, result in serious adverse effects, reduce physical function, and fail to improve mental well-being. Finding effective treatments to maintain function and quality of life in OA patients is one of the national priorities identified this year by the Institute of Medicine. We propose to conduct the first comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial of Tai Chi vs. physical therapy (PT) in a large symptomatic Knee OA population. A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial of Tai Chi vs. Physical Therapy will be conducted in 180 patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology criteria for Knee OA. Patients will be randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with Tai Chi (2x/week) or Standard Physical Therapy (2x/week for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of rigorous supervised home exercise) with 24 and 52 week follow-ups.</detailed_description>
