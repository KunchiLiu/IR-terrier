	<brief_summary>Many patients who have cardiac resynchronisation therapy (a type of pacemaker) implanted for heart failure do not have the settings of their device optimised. The most widely available method for optimisation uses flow measured using cardiac ultrasound (echocardiography) to determine the optimal settings. However, this is not frequently performed because it is time consuming and requires two skilled operators. In this study the investigators will test a new non-invasive method for optimisation, which utilises pressure measurements (non-invasive blood pressure measured from the finger). Is optimising AV and VV delay using non-invasive haemodynamics at least equivalent, in terms of exercise capacity, to conventional echo optimisation.</brief_summary>
