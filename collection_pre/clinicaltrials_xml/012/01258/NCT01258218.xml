	<brief_summary>The intent of this study is to evaluate the performance of the implanted Accent MRI TM system in a clinical setting and optionally in the MRI environment. This system includes the St. Jude Medical Tendril MRI™ lead and SJM Accent MRITM DR pacemaker. Also the MRI Activator™ will be evaluated in this study. The MRI Activator is a handheld device that allows the user to enable and disable MRI Settings as well as check the status of MRI Settings in the pacemaker. The patient population under study includes patients with a standard bradycardia pacing indication.</brief_summary>
