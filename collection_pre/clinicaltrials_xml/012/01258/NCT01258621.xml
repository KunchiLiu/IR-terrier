	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) for benign and borderline pancreatic lesions has recently becoming the treatment of choice in experienced centres. No data have been published about learning curve so far. The purpose of this study was to identify the learning curve period for performing LDP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Learning Curve for Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between March 2009 and August 2010 all patients with lesion of body or tail of pancreas were assessed for eligibility for LDP. Exclusion criteria were: major vessels contact in cancer patients, severe organ dysfunction, BMI &gt; 35, and refusing laparoscopic approach. All laparoscopic procedures were carried out by the same surgical team with large experience in open pancreatic surgery. All patients were treated according to an early recovery after surgery protocol. Primary endpoint was conversion rate. Secondary endpoints were operation time, operative blood loss, postoperative morbidity, and length of stay.</detailed_description>
