	<brief_summary>This is a research study into the effects of three drugs used to treat HIV infection. Some drugs used to treat HIV have been associated with changes in blood fats such as cholesterol that could be harmful over the long-term, because these blood fat changes have been associated with a small, increased risk of heart disease and stroke in some studies of adults with HIV. Now that HIV can be controlled for long periods in most patients, and because heart disease is one of the biggest causes of illness and death in the general population, it is important to develop new HIV treatments that control HIV effectively but do not cause abnormal blood fats. Hypothesis: That Raltegravir will result in less post-prandial lipid disturbances than ritonavir-boosted darunavir.</brief_summary>
