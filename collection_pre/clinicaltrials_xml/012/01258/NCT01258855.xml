	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well aldesleukin with or without ziv-aflibercept works in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether aldesleukin is more effective with or without ziv-aflibercept in treating melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin With or Without Ziv-Aflibercept in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test the hypothesis that combination biotherapy with aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept) and high-dose (HD) interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin) will improve the progression-free survival compared to HD IL-2 alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of aflibercept and HD IL-2 as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 and compare to results of HD IL-2 alone. II. Evaluate the toxicities and tolerance of combination biotherapy with aflibercept and HD IL-2 and maintenance aflibercept alone in this patient population and compare to HD-IL2 alone. III. Test the hypotheses related to the laboratory correlative studies. IV. Evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with aflibercept and HD IL-2 and HD IL-2 alone. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over at least 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 (and in week 9 of course 1 only) and high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for 5 days in weeks 1 and 3 (and in weeks 3 and 5 of course 1 only). Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising ziv-aflibercept IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for 5 days in weeks 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (includes American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IV or advanced/inoperable stage III; also includes patients with a history of lower stage melanoma and subsequent recurrent metastatic disease that is either locally/regionally advanced/inoperable disease or distant metastases) Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 10 mm with computed tomography (CT) scan or clinically (must be measurable with calipers) according to RECIST version 1.1 Patients must be free of brain metastasis by contrastenhanced CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within 4 weeks prior to enrollment; if known to have prior brain metastases, must not have evidence of active brain disease after definitive therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery) on two successive MRI evaluations at least 3 months apart (one of which is =&lt; 4 weeks prior to starting the study drugs) A patient may be treatment na√Øve; however, up to two prior regimens for metastatic melanoma are allowed; prior adjuvant interferon (IFN)alpha is allowed; no prior therapy with bevacizumab, aflibercept or interleukin2 (IL2) Patients must not have received systemic therapy or radiotherapy within the preceding 4 weeks; patients must have recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Patients must be at least 4 weeks from major surgery and have fully recovered from any effects of surgery, and be free of significant detectable infection For patients who have received prior anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen (CTLA)4 monoclonal antibody therapy (ipilimumab or tremelimumab), there is a risk of bowel perforation with IL2 therapy; therefore, for these patients if they have a history of colitis or diarrhea during antiCTLA4 monoclonal antibody therapy, they should have a formal evaluation by a gastroenterologist and a colonoscopy should be considered to demonstrate the absence of active bowel inflammation before initiating IL2 therapy on this protocol Life expectancy of greater than 3 months in the opinion of the investigator Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky &gt;
