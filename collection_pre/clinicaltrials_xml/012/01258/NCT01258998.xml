	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with relapsed lymphoma. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Akt Inhibitor MK2206 in Patients With Relapsed Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the progression free survival (PFS) of MK-2206 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 monotherapy. III. Examine pretreatment phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (pAkt) protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and correlate the results with treatment response. IV. Examine the effect of therapy on serum cytokines and chemokines that regulate the tumor-promoting inflammatory process and/or immunity in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma, and correlate the results with treatment response. OUTLINE: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) once weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
