	<brief_summary>Recently, seslenium(Se) has known as important regulator in metabolic status, lipid profile, atherosclerosis progression. SEPP1(selenoprotein P1)is a secreted protein from mainly liver. This protein is used as an index of selenium nutritional status. The association between the concentration of SEPP1(selenoprotein P1) in normal glucose tolerance,impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes is still a matter of debate. This cross sectional study will evaluate whether glucose status is matter in SEPP1 level.</brief_summary>
