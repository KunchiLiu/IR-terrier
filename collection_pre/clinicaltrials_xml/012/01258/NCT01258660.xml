	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the uptake of levomefolate calcium (Metafolin, a registered vitamin supplement) and folic acid in the body during 24 weeks of treatment with a following folate elimination phase of 20 weeks in healthy volunteers seeking contraception. Yasmin (oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol) was co-administered over the entire period of 44 weeks.</brief_summary>
