	<criteria>Evidence of qualifying vessel (carotid or aortic) plaque inflammation Documented atherosclerotic vascular disease clinically stable for at least 3 months prior to screening or type 2 diabetes mellitus with elevated cardiovascular risk Use of a stable dose of statin therapy for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. Patients must be capable of maintaining statin therapy at a current dose level from screening until the last followup visit. For patients taking angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensinreceptor blockers (ARBs), nonstatin lipidmodifying therapy, thiazolidinediones, inhaled steroids, or leukotriene modifying agents, use of a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and capable of continuing with that dose for the duration of the study Occurrence of a cardiovascular event &lt; 6 months prior to screening Pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study, or breastfeeding Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or abnormal ECG or vital signs History of anaphylactic reactions Newly discovered Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (prior to study entry) or medical treatment for T2DM started &lt; 3 months prior to study entry Use of insulin, corticosteroids (oral, rectal, or injectable), or other immunosuppressive medications Current or recent (within 4 weeks prior to screening) infection, including signs, symptoms or serology of any infection, including HIV, hepatitis B or C Impaired renal function History of malignancy within 2 years prior to screening Current lifethreatening condition other than vascular disease that may prevent a patient from completing the study Use of an investigational drug or biologic within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication Exposure to substantial radiation within 12 months prior to screening</criteria>
