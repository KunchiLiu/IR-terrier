	<brief_summary>Patients with neurological disease/injury often suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms, which frequently have a negative impact on the patients' health related quality of life. The prevalence of lower urinary tract dysfunction is high and the treatment is a challenge because available treatments may fail. In this study data of patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction treated at the University of Zürich, are prospectively and systematically collected in a database.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower urinary tract dysfunction is characterized by detrusor overactivity, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, voiding dysfunction, stress incontinence, or a combination of these and frequently has a negative impact on the patients' health related quality of life. In addition, the treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction is a challenge because conventional therapies may fail. Adequate treatment and long-term follow-up of lower urinary tract dysfunction is important to achieve/maintain continence and preserve renal function. Thus, we aim to prospectively collect clinical, video-urodynamic and radiological data of patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction treated at the University of Zürich in a database.</detailed_description>
