	<brief_summary>Propofol is routinely used for general anesthesia during pediatric heart catheterisation. Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is a rare, but often fatal complication mainly defined by bradycardia with progress to asystolia during propofol infusion. Metabolic acidosis is regarded as an early warning sign of PRIS. In this study the effect of propofol and sevoflurane on serum base excess, pH and lactate are examined during pediatric heart catheterisation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Propofol and Sevoflurane on Lactate During Anesthesia for Pediatric Heart Catheterisation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective randomised study 40 children are anesthetised for pediatric heart catheterisation with propofol (N = 22) or sevoflurane (N = 18) with ethic committee approval. Base excess, pH and lactate were measured by blood gas analysis at the beginning, during and at the end of the procedure. Changes relative to baseline were analysed by paired t-Test with correction for multiple testing. The study was powered to detect a difference of 1.5 mmol/l for base excess and lactate.</detailed_description>
