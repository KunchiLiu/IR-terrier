	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure is closely associated with autoimmunity dysfunction. A few studies represented that Qiliqiangxin capsule, a Chinese medicine, could enhance heart function in chronic heart failure and regulate the balance of TNF-a and IL-10 in myocardial infarction. In this study, to explore the effects of Qiliqiangxin capsule on the improving heart function and immunoregulation in patients with DCM, patients were recruited, anti-heart autoantibodies and some representative cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA), and the efficacy of heart function improvement was compared between Qiliqiangxin capsule and placebo under the standard treatment of DCM.</brief_summary>
