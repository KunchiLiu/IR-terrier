	<brief_title>Spica Casting in Pediatric Femur Fractures: Study of Single Leg Versus Double Leg Spica Casts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction - double-leg spica casting is the treatment of choice at many centers for the treatment of diaphyseal femur fractures in children 2 to 6 years old. - Investigators hypothesize that these patients can be effectively treated with single-leg spica casting and that such treatment will result in easier care and better patient function during treatment. Methods - Prospective randomized controlled study of patients between 2 and 6 years old with diaphyseal femur fractures - patients randomly assigned to either immediate single or double-leg spica casting groups after consent was obtained - Radiographs serially evaluated for maintenance of reduction with respect to length, varus/valgus angulation and procurvatum/recurvatum angulation - After casts removal, the Activity Scale for Kids (Performance Version) questionnaire and a custom written survey were given to parents evaluating ease of care and function of children during treatment.</detailed_description>
