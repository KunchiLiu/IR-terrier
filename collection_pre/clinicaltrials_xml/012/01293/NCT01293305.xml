	<brief_summary>The use of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate has been recognized since the 70 decade in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic properties of this association in control of osteoarthritis, especially in reducing pain and improving movement. The combination of chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine sulfate offers a significantly higher tolerance than most drug treatments and, moreover, has long lasting effects even after stopping treatment.</brief_summary>
