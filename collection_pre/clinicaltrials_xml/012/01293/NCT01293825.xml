	<brief_summary>Psychotropic-related weight gain is a common concern among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). This concern affects an individual's satisfaction with treatment and may lead to reduced adherence and illness relapse. Patient-focused care is attentive to patient concerns while at the same time utilizing evidence-based treatments. Ziprasidone is currently FDA approved for the maintenance treatment of BD. Ziprasidone may be associated with less weight gain compared to some alternative BD maintenance treatments. The proposed project will evaluate how switching to ziprasidone may affect patient adherence, drug attitudes, satisfaction with care and clinical outcomes (psychiatric symptoms, functional status, weight) among BD patients concerned with weight gain.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of Type I or II BD for at least 6 months (confirmed with MINI) 2. On maintenance evidencebased treatment for BD (lithium, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant) 3. Have weight gain concerns that individual believes are related to BD medication treatment 4. Suboptimal adherence as measured by the Tablet Routines Questionnaire (TRQ) and which the patient feels is related to weight gain concerns. TRQ threshold will be defined as missing an average of 20% or more of all prescribed BD treatment in the last week or month or missing 20% or more of the "offending agent" in the last week or last month. This is consistent with methodologies in PIs previous BD adherence studies 1. Known resistance or intolerance to ziprasidone 2. Medical contraindication to ziprasidone 3. Individuals on ziprasidone immediately prior to study enrollment 4. Prior or current treatment with clozapine 5. Diagnosis of eating disorder 6. Individuals whose suboptimal adherence is related to inability to pay for BD medication treatment or inability to arrange transportation to BD treatment clinical visits 7. Concurrent medical condition or psychiatric illness, which in the opinion of the research psychiatrist, would interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the trial 8. Current substance dependence 9. High risk of harm to self or others 10. Female who is currently pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
