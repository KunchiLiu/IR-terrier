	<brief_summary>- Preliminary scientific studies, in both animals and humans suggest that oral consumption of hydrolyzed collagen acts on the bone remodeling process by stimulating the activity of osteoblasts responsible for bone formation while improving the bone mineral density and biomechanical resistance of long bones. - The objective of this clinical research is to measure changes in biomarkers of bone turnover in postmenopausal healthy women, not osteoporotic, in response to consumption of hydrolyzed collagen for three months. - For this, we propose to measure blood and urinary markers of formation and bone resorption before consumption, then 45 and 90 days after daily consumption of 10 g of hydrolyzed collagen.</brief_summary>
