	<brief_summary>Chemerin is a novel adipokine that might provide a link between chronic inflammation and obesity. Pulse wave velocity(PWV) is a useful method for examining arterial stiffness, meaning early-stage atherosclerosis. Therefore, in the present study, the investigators examined the relationship between circulating chemerin and arterial stiffness measured using PWV in obese persons.</brief_summary>
