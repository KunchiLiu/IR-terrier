	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to detect acute febrile episodes and dengue infection in five Latin American countries to assess dengue seroprevalence. Primary objectives: - To identify acute febrile episodes among the cohort in order to detect the presence of dengue infection. - To describe the dengue seroprevalence among the cohort at baseline and at the end of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will make two visits to a study site, an enrollment visit and a termination visit. Additional visits will be made if febrile episodes occur: an acute visit and a convalescent visit. Participants or their parents/guardians will be contacted weekly to monitor the occurrence of febrile episodes and ensure appropriate assessment and care. No vaccine will be provided or administered in this study</detailed_description>
