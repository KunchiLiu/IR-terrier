	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability and determine the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous single and multiple (up to 12) dose administration of CBX129801 (long-acting synthetic C-peptide) in type 1 diabetes patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of CBX129801 in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 will be conducted in three sequential dose cohorts with dose level escalated for each successive cohort. In Part 2 of the study, a dose regimen determined from the pharmacokinetic data from Part 1 will be administered in up to 40 additional subjects to achieve a target plasma concentration range that represents the most commonly observed physiological C-peptide levels in healthy, non-diabetic individuals.</detailed_description>
