	<detailed_description>1. Assessment of Efficacy 1. Knee MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging): - Assessment of cartilage volume, thickness in target knee - GAG(glycosaminoglycan) concentration of target knee - Assessment of Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) of target knee 2. Knee radiography: - Assessment of changes in minimal medial JSW(Joint Space Width) of target knee. 3. Knee pain(VAS) - Assessment changes of pain in target knee. 4. K-WOMAC(Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index for Korean) - Assessment score change for pain(5 questions), stiffness(2 questions) and physical function(17 questions). - The questionnaire is self-administered by the patients. 5. Used frequency of rescue medicine. 6. Biochemical cartilage and bone markers - Blood and urine sample will be collected all through the morning after a night fasting period since 10 pm the previous day to avoid the variations. 2. Assessment of Safety 1. Adverse event 2. Laboratory assessment 3. Vital sign 4. 12-lead ECG 5. Physical examination 3. Enrollment: 76</detailed_description>
