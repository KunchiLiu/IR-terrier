	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effects of "Ibuprofen, Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS" on Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most painful oral lesion with a considerable prevalence . The most common aphthous ulcer treatments include applying topical agents such as antibiotics, Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) to immunosuppressants. The mixture of Diphenhydramine and Aluminum MgS suspension has been prescribed as an analgesic mouthwash for a long time in order to decrease a great number of oral ulcers symptoms such as aphthous ulcers. Ibuprofen is a potent NSAID with fair anti-inflammatory potential prescribed in dental pains. This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the effect of Ibuprofen, Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS mixture on symptoms of aphthous ulcers.40 patients will be participating in this study,20 will receive the mixture of Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS while the other group will receive Ibuprofen, Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS mixture. All patients will be instructed to apply the drug on the site of the ulcer 30-60 minutes before meals, 3 times daily. The ulcers will be assessed when the drug is applied for 3 days and the level of pain and irritation will be estimated by VAS (Visual Analogue Scale, a scaled ruler which the zero point displays the zone of lack of pain and the 10th point was considered as the zone of maximum pain).</detailed_description>
