	<criteria>Diagnosis of osteopenia for women (BMD Tscores between 1.0 and 2.5 SD at the lumbar spine, the femoral neck or total hip) Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;45 kg (99 lbs). Have at least 3 vertebral bodies in the L1L4 region and one femoral neck site that are accessible by DXA. Evidence or history of any underlying condition, other than primary osteopenia, that affect bone metabolism (eg, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism). Subjects with preexisting periodontal/dental disease or those who have undergone invasive dental procedures (eg, tooth extraction, oral surgery) within 60 days prior to Day 1. If QTcF exceeds 455 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTcF values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.</criteria>
