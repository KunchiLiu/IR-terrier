	<brief_summary>Knee arthroscopy is a common surgical procedure in pediatrics in which the knee joint is visualized through a small camera to help diagnose and treat knee problems. This procedure is commonly accomplished with the use of general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is commonly completed with a single injection of local anesthetic around the femoral nerve to provide pain relief for several hours following knee arthroscopy. The intent of this study is to examine the effects of clonidine in addition to local anesthetics for femoral nerve blockade in providing children and adolescents post-operative analgesia. The investigators hypothesize the addition of low dose clonidine (1 mcg/kg) provides an additional 4 hours of post operative analgesia following arthroscopic knee surgery and reduces post-operative opiate requirement.</brief_summary>
