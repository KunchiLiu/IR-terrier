	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to learn more about Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) and to help in identifying treatment opportunities. Several evaluations will be conducted in this study: 1) the number of skin sweat glands you have and their ability to produce sweat; 2) your ability to grow hair; 3) the structure of your face compared to faces of people affected by HED; 4) molds of your teeth to see if and how they are different than people affected by HED.</brief_summary>
