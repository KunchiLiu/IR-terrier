	<brief_summary>This randomized, open label, controlled, parallel group study is designed to test whether 2-day high dose atorvastatin administration before PCI and 30-day continuous intensive atorvastatin treatment is superior to usual care, in terms of peri-PCI cardiovascular events, as well as 6-month prognosis. The goal is to set up an optimized protocol for peri-PCI statin treatment in Chinese CHD patients. Safety will also be observed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Statin Treatment in Chinese Coronary Artery Disease Patients Undergoing PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objective is to test whether 2-day high dose atorvastatin administration before PCI and 30-day continuous intensive atorvastatin treatment is superior to usual care, in terms of peri-PCI cardiovascular events, as well as 6-month prognosis. 2160 patients with non-ST segment elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS)or stable angina pectoris (SAP) scheduled for selective PCI are randomized into two groups. The study group is given atorvastatin 80 mg/d×2d before PCI while the control group receives usual care. After angiography, patients who are not undergoing PCI procedure will be excluded from the study as selection failure. After PCI procedure, the study group is given atorvastatin 40mg/d until 30 days after PCI while the control group receive usual care. The last visit will be at 6 months after PCI. Patients data such as troponin, CK-MB, Scr, CCR, ALT, AST before and after procedure will be recorded. 1100 effective patients will be finally enrolled. The study will be conducted at about 54 centers in China. Data will be collected on 2,100 NSTE or SAP patients undergoing PCI. Primary outcome: MACE within 30 days after PCI. Secondary outcome: Post-procedural change of inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP); Morbidity of CIN; Proportion of patients who experience at least once AST &gt; 3ULN，ALT &gt; 3ULN or CK &gt; 5ULN after initiation of study treatment. Proportion of patients who experience at least once AST, ALT, or CK&gt;ULN after initiation of study treatment; Proportion of patients who take reduced dose of atorvastatin, withdraw study treatment, or withdraw study due to adverse events; Combined endpoint of death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac hospitalization, revascularization, and cerebrovascular events within 6 months after PCI.</detailed_description>
