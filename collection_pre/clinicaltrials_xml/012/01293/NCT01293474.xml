	<brief_summary>With the new software tool (EDI, enhanced depth imaging) of the SpectralisÂ® spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) it is possible to visualize and measure the choroidal thickness. In glaucoma a vascular component is known. Therefore a difference of choroidal thickness in glaucoma patients and healthy controls is proposed. - Trial with medical device</brief_summary>
