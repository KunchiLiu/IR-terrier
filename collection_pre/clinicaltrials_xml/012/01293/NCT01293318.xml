	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if there is an association between copeptin level in serum and the severity of pancreatitis and if copeptin can be used as a predictor for organ failure and pancreatic necrosis with or without superinfection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Copeptin as a Diagnostic Marker for Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis may range from mild to severe disease with high mortality in case of infected pancreatic necrosis. Due to its rising incidence it remains an important healthcare problem in Europe and US. The assessment of the severity of pancreatitis is crucial for the further management and the prognosis. Several quite complex scores like Ranson or APACHE II scores has been used in the past with reasonable sensitivity for necrosis or superinfection as well as inflammation markers like c-reactive Protein. Copeptin, the C-terminal part of antidiuretic hormone, is a relatively stable peptide in blood circulation. Several studies investigated Copeptin in the presence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, myocardial infarction, lower respiratory tract infection and cerebral stroke. Copeptin has shown to be a helpful prognostic marker in these diseases. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate whether Copeptin can be used to assess the severity of pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
