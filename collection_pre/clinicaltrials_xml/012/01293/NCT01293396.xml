	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate meal-related treatment with either premixed Insulin Aspart 30, Aspart 70 and Aspart with regard to postprandial glucose, triglyceride and free fatty acids excursions after a standard breakfast and lunch.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Premixed Insulins Aspart 30, Aspart 70 and Aspart on Postprandial Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whereas the effects of each of the established types of insulin (BiAsp30, BiAsp70, Insulin Aspart) have been shown before, their specific glucose and lipid lowering capacities have so far not been investigated in a simulated physiological situation.</detailed_description>
