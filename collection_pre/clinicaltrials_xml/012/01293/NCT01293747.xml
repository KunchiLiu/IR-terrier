	<detailed_description>Sites: 1 Phase: 1 Main objective: To determine plasmatic profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of estradiol and progesterone on each of the formulations studied, after multiple-dose administration. Secondary objectives: To determine bioavailability of each of the formulations studied, after multiple-dose-administration. Describe tolerability of each of the formulations studied, after multiple-dose administration. Study design: Randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel, pharmacokinetic study Investigational Products: - Estradiol and progesterone microspheres aqueous suspension (1 mg/20 mg) - Estradiol and progesterone microspheres aqueous suspension (0.5 mg/15 mg) Study subjects: 30 postmenopausal women 45 - 65 years old Brief description: After written informed consent, 30 eligible women will be randomized to study treatments (one IM injection each 28 days, for a total of 4 doses). Blood samples will be obtained for pharmacokinetic study.</detailed_description>
