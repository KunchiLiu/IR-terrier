	<detailed_description>The National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics is dedicated to evaluating the safety of atypical antipsychotic medications that may be taken by women during pregnancy to treat a wide range of mood, anxiety, or psychiatric disorders. The primary goal of this Registry is to determine the frequency of major malformations, such as heart defects, cleft lip, or neural tube defects, in infants exposed to atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy. We are currently studying the following medications: - Abilify (aripiprazole) - Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil) - Clozaril (clozapine) - Fanapt (iloperidone) - Geodon (ziprasidone) - Invega (paliperidone) - Latuda (lurasidone) - Rexulti (brexpiprazole) - Risperdal (risperidone) - Saphris (asenapine) - Seroquel (quetiapine) - Zyprexa (olanzapine)</detailed_description>
