	<brief_summary>Research questions: 1. Will the panoramic images derived from cone beam CT data give better diagnostic ability than conventional panoramic radiographs? 2. Will 3D cephalometric analysis offer the orthodontists and surgeons better information for treatment planning? 3. Will the 3D cephalometric analysis give more accurate treatment plan and better treatment outcome? General hypothesis and special aims Overall aims: - To compare 2D versus 3D cephalometric analysis: treatment planning and therapeutic outcome. - To determine the accuracy and diagnostic ability and usability of the 3D cephalometric analysis. - To evaluate the diagnostic ability and usability of the panoramic image derived from cone beam CT data as compared to 2D panoramic images. - To evaluate the value of the cone beam CT data in cephalometric analysing process for orthodontic and maxillofacial surgery treatment. Hypotheses: 1. The availability of the 3D cephalometric analysis influences the orthodontic and maxillofacial treatment plan and decision, and might change the treatment outcome. 2. Panoramic images derived from cone beam CT data may provide equal information for diagnosis as conventional panoramic images. 3. Cone beam CT will be able to replace "classic orthodontic imaging" being more time and dose efficient and having a beneficial effect on treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
