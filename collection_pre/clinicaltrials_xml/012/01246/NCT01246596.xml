	<brief_summary>The etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease results from complex interaction between infectious agents, mainly including bacteria, and host cellular and humoral immune responses. However it is thought that bacteria-induced pathogenesis is not sufficient alone to explain all biological and clinical features of the destructive periodontal disease. The main hypothesis is that herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr Virus, may participate as well by altering epithelial gingival cell biology and consequently may promote the initiation and progression of periodontitis.</brief_summary>
