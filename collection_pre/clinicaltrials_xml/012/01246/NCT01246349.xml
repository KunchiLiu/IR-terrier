	<detailed_description>One empirically supported intervention with a large evidence base for improving adult outcomes in behavioral health-related disorders is Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is strongly rooted in the client-centered therapy of Rogers (1951). Its relational stance emphasizes the importance of understanding the client's internal frame of reference and displaying unconditional positive regard for the client. Motivational interviewing can thus be defined as a client-centered, directive method of therapy for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. MI manifests through specific strategies, such as reflective listening, summarization, shared decision making, and agenda setting. Adolescent participants exposed to motivational interviewing in conjunction with usual care (diet and exercise program) are expected to endorse greater self-efficacy, report increased engagement in healthy behaviors, demonstrate a decrease in body weight and report improved psychological outcomes. While motivational interviewing has been shown to increase adults' motivation to make healthy behavior changes, few adolescent studies have demonstrated this effect.</detailed_description>
