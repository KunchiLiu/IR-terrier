	<brief_summary>Rationale: Recently, sunitinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used for treatment of metastatic renal carcinoma and gastrointestinal stroma tumors) has been associated with development of heart failure, possibly by off-target inhibition of AMP-protein kinase. The investigators hypothesize that sunitinib reduces the contractile ability of myocardium and the tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion and that activators of AMP-protein kinase such as atorvastatin and AICAR reverse this unwanted effect of sunitinib. Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of sunitinib on ex-vivo atrial contractile force in absence and presence of ischemia-reperfusion. A secondary objective is to explore if atorvastatin or AICAR prevent sunitinib-induced deterioration of contractile function of human atrial trabeculas. Study design: Lab</brief_summary>
