	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Evaluation of Fibrosis and Steatosis in Chronic Hepatopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For diagnosis, staging and grading of chronic liver disease, liver biopsy is the gold standard to date. Unfortunately, being an invasive diagnostic method, liver biopsy has a significant morbidity. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, sampling error (over- or underestimating severity of liver disease) is a serious problem in diagnostic of chronic liver disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate non-invasive diagnostic methods (MRI, elastography, ultrasound and serum parameters) in comparison to the gold standard to establish criteria for diagnostic in liver disease and reduce the necessary amount of liver biopsies in the future and allow regular follow up.</detailed_description>
