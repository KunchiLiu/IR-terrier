	<brief_summary>Specific Aim: To conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of extended release-naltrexone (XR-NTX) among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected prisoners meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria for opioid dependence who are transitioning from the structure of a correctional setting to the community. Hypotheses: i. XR-NTX will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes, including lower changes in HIV-1 RNA levels, higher CD4 counts and higher rates of retention in care. ii. XR-NTX will result in improved opioid treatment outcomes, including longer time to opioid relapse, lower addiction severity and lower craving for opioid. iii. XR-NTX will result in reduced drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors compared to the control group. iv. XR-NTX will result in decreased rates of reincarceration after 12 months of release to the community.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim for this study is to conduct a placebo-controlled trail (RCT) of XR-NTX among HIV+ persons in jails and prisons meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who are transitioning to the community. HIV treatment outcomes (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) adherence, retention in care), substance abuse (time to relapse to opioid use, % opioid negative urines, opioid craving), adverse side effects and HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes will be compared in 150 recruited prisoners and jail detainees in Connecticut (CT) and Massachusetts (MA) who will be randomized 2:1 to either XR-NTX or placebo. The primary outcome of interest will be the proportion with a HIV-RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include mean CD4 count, antiretroviral adherence, retention on HAART and in HIV care, HIV risk behaviors, time-to-relapse to opioid use, percent opioid negative urines, retention on d-NTX and HIV quality of life. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed for an additional 6 months after completion of the intervention. If this placebo-controlled trial of XR-NTX among released HIV+ criminal justice system (CJS) persons with opioid dependence demonstrates efficacy and safety, it is likely to become an evidence-based intervention to intervene with this extremely marginalized population in a way that will meet Healthy People 2010's goals to increase the quality and years of life, decrease health disparities particularly among minorities, break the cycle of addiction, reduce the numbers of people within the CJS and launch a number of new and innovative trials and second generation questions for future research. As such, the individual, our health care system and society have a high likelihood to benefit. This will not only be true for strategies here in the U.S., but may have even greater application for geographic areas where the interface between opioid disorders and HIV is even greater.</detailed_description>
