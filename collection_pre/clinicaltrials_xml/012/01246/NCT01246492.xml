	<brief_title>The Effect of Artificial Sweeteners on Blood Glucose Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sweet taste receptors, similar to those located on the lingual taste buds have been located along in the lining of the gut. Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of these sweetness taste receptors, either by sugars such as glucose, fructose, lactose, or artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and aspartame can influence the way nutrients, including glucose are absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Studies in animal models have shown that activation of the sweet taste receptors can increase the expression of the sodium-dependant glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) which transport glucose from the lumen into the bloodstream. Thus providing a potential mechanism by which glucose uptake can be regulated. Although artificial sweeteners stimulate the sweet taste receptors, they have little nutritive value, so that when they are consumed in the absence of any other nutrients there is little effect on blood glucose response. However, the effects of consuming artificial sweeteners in combination with sugars such as glucose is unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of artificial sweeteners to an orally consumed glucose solution affects the rate at which the glucose appears in the blood.</detailed_description>
