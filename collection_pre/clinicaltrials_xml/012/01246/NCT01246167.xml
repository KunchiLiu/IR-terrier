	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to compare head-to-head conservative with operative treatment in 2 stratum. Stratum 1: In 2 part fractures the comparison is between conservative treatment and operative treatment with plate fixation with Philos. Stratum 2: In multi-fragmented fractures (MFF) meaning 3 and 4 part fractures, the comparison is between conservative treatment, operative treatment with Philos plate and operative treatment with Epoca prosthesis. Subgroup analysis will be performed in an effort to obtain limit values for specific treatment of different age and fracture groups. A cost-effectiveness analysis and comparison between different treatment modalities will be carried out. The primary outcome measure will be the DASH score and the secondary outcome measure the EQ-5D value. Recruitment period is 3 years and follow-up 2 years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Low energy proximal humeral displaced (more than 1 cm or 45 degrees) 2 part fracture where fracture line emerges through the surgical (or anatomical) neck Low energy proximal humeral displaced (more than 1 cm or 45 degrees) 3 or 4 part fracture Refuse to participate the study Less than 60 years old Nonindependent Dementia and/or institutionalized Does no understand written and spoken guidance in either Finnish or Swedish Pathological fracture or previous fracture in the same proximal humerus Serious intoxicant dependent, eg. In first aid breathalyzer shows more than 2â€° Other operational injury in the same upper limb Major nerve injury (eg. Complete radialis or delta palsy) Open fracture Multitrauma or fractured patient Fracture dislocation or head splitting fracture Undisplaced fracture Isolated tuberculum fracture Fracture has no precondition to ossify by conservative treatment (no bony contact between fracture parts or the humeral shaft is in contact with the articular surface) Treating surgeon considers patient unsuitable to attend the study on medical basis Cuffarthropathy</criteria>
