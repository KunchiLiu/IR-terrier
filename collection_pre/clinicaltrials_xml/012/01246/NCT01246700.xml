	<brief_title>Sensory Attention Focused Exercise in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) and although medication offers symptom reduction, there are many negative side effects associated with medication use. Thus, there has been an increased emphasis on exercise interventions for symptom reduction. Recent research has shown that both sensory attention focused exercise (SAFEx) and strength training interventions improved disease severity more so than other exercise interventions (such as aerobic, aquatic and no exercise). Upon closer examination, SAFEx showed further symptom improvements than the strength training program. Thus exists the need to further examine SAFEx using a standardized protocol - a single-blind randomized double-crossover trial - that has been used sparingly in exercise interventions. In addition, the 30-second chair stand has been implemented into the testing protocol, as it has been shown to be a reliable measurement of functional strength for older adults. This test was implemented in order to identify the functional strength gains, if any, that are associated with SAFEx. It is hypothesized that the SAFEx intervention will improve disease symptoms in PD, and that the results will not be due to strength gains.</detailed_description>
