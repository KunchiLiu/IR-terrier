	<brief_summary>Functional tricuspid regurgitation is common in patients with heart valve disease, replacement and repair both can correct this anomaly. However, there is no data to address which one can bring more benefits to these patients with combined heart valve disease. The investigators retrospectively review patients with two or more heart valve disease and functional tricuspid regurgitation, and assess its long term outcomes.</brief_summary>
