	<brief_summary>By this study the investigators wish to (1) quantify hip strength and functional-performance deficits at discharge after fast-track total hip arthroplasty (THA), and (2) investigate if changes in thigh circumferences, or hip pain are correlated to changes in hip strength and functional-performance after fast-track THA.</brief_summary>
