	<brief_title>Multiple Oncological Serial Scans Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consenting patients who have undergone breast conserving surgery and who are planned to receive radiotherapy will have their first MRI and CT scan within 2 weeks of treatment planning. This will be followed by 3 weeks radiotherapy treatment. 3D ultrasound scans will be performed in the first 2 weeks before radiotherapy, during the 2nd and 3rd weeks of radiotherapy and in the 2 weeks following radiotherapy.Following the radiotherapy patients will undergo both CT and MRI scans within 2 weeks of treatment completion.The whole process should take approximately 10 weeks.In this study the CT scans, MRI scan + USS are above standard care and are the additional interventions in this study group.</detailed_description>

Ten patients will be for planned radiotherapy following both breast conservation surgery and chemotherapy and ten will be for planned radiotherapy following breast conservation surgery alone aged between 18 and 80years. Mastectomy T3 or T4 and N3 cases Patients who have not undergone surgery Severely claustrophobic patients Patients unable to lie flat Patients with any contraindications to MRI</criteria>
