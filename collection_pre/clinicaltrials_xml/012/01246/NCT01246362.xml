	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Pre-emptive Etoricoxib for Postoperative Pain and Functional Outcome in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic surgeries worldwide and has proven to be a success in the treatment of end-stage osteoarthritic knees. TKA is associated with significant postoperative pain which may delay the patient's functional recovery and necessitate an increased use of opioid analgesias, which are themselves associated with significant adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. The selective cycloxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was previously shown in a clinical trial in a paper by Buvanendran et al to reduce postoperative opioid requirement and improve clinical outcomes. Feng et al studied the use of a single dose of rofecoxib pre-operatively and its effect on inflammatory markers and postoperative pain. Rofecoxib has, however, been withdrawn from the market due to its association with cardiovascular side effects. Our current clinical practice in post-operative pain management constitutes post-operative etoricoxib but we hypothesize that pre-emptively administering etoricoxib pre-operatively would give an even greater benefit in terms of post-operative opioid usage, pain scores, and functional recovery in the first 2-3 days. To date, there has been no study investigating etoricoxib as a pre-emptive medication in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. We aim to conduct a study to test the efficacy of pre-emptive etoricoxib in reducing postoperative pain, opioid requirement and improving the rate of functional recovery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients between the ages of 50 and 80 who are listed for singleknee TKA at Singapore General Hospital by one of 4 adult reconstructive surgeons for the treatment of osteoarthritis will be recruited upon the patient giving written informed consent.
