	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Hyalgan after proximal tibial osteotomy in treatment of knee osteoarthritis patients. Normally, OA patients who were treated with osteotomy will not be treated with any SYSADOA after operation, even though their cartilage's not completely loss, so osteotomy plus HA injection should provide more benefit to patients than osteotomy alone.</brief_summary>

Oral SYSADOA treatment (chondroitin, glucosamine, diacerein) within 2 months prior to study start 4. Known or suspected infection of the affected joint 5. Painful knee condition due to another cause than chondral lesions, such as Sudeck's atrophy, intraarticular neoplasm, pigmented villonodular synovitis, chondromatosis 6.
