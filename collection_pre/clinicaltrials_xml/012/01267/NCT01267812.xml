	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib and rituximab together works in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have previously undergone stem cell transplantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Who Have Previously Undergone Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the two year disease free survival in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients treated with bortezomib + rituximab after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicity profile, safety, overall survival, time to treatment failure, remission duration, and biological markers of mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with bortezomib + rituximab after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds and rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment with bortezomib repeats every 3 months for up to 8 courses and treatment with rituximab repeats every 6 months for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
