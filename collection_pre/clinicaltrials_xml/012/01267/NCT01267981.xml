	<brief_summary>The best preparation of small bowel is still unknown. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the polyethylene glycol (PEG) impact of small bowel preparation for unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding exploration. Three different preparations are evaluated in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Small Bowel Preparation in Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Now days, the endoscopic video-capsule is the more appropriate exam for unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding exploration. The responsible damage of this unexplained bleeding are frequently small vascular damages, hard to be detected in the bowel or ulcerations or tumors. The exam quality can be limited by food residues, bubbles or bile. 30% of damage are probably undetectable because of a lack of visibility. An efficient preparation will probably increased the quality of the video-capsule exploration. The bowel exploration by endoscopy video-capsule will be realized in the usual condition. The study included 4 steps: 1. Inclusion 2. Randomization 3. Video-capsule exploration 4. Reading of the video-capsule exam by endoscopist doctors who are in blind.</detailed_description>
