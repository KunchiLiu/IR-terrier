	<brief_summary>Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the U.S.1 in spite of being preventable, easily detectable, and curable.2-11 Breast screening continues to be underutilized by the general population and especially by traditionally underserved minority populations. Two of the least screened minority groups are American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Latinas. American Indian/Alaska Native women have the poorest recorded 5-year cancer survival rates of any ethnic group and the lowest (or near-lowest) screening rates for major cancers.12 Furthermore, breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer mortality among Latina women.13 While breast cancer screening rates have increased nationally, there has been an increase in the gap in breast cancer screening utilization between individuals from minority versus majority racial/ethnic groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you decide to participate in the program, your participation will last 4 months. You will complete the Healthy Living Kansas-Breast Health survey by computer. The survey will take about 20 minutes to complete. You will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one of two groups. The groups will receive different breast health information. After completing the survey, you agree to be contacted by telephone in 4 months to answer questions. You will be asked for your name, home address, and phone number. You will be given information about breast cancer and mammography. You may or may not benefit from the information provided. Care will be taken to safeguard the information you provide but under rare circumstances confidentiality breaches may occur.</detailed_description>
