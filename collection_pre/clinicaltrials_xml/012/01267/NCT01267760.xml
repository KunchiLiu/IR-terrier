	<detailed_description>Conventional hemodialysis uses large amounts of water, which hinders travel possibilies for home hemodialysis (HD) patients. We have developed a recycling system using 25-30 l dialysate per dialysis. In vitro investigations show that this results in adequate dialysis. 12 HD patients will be studied during two dialysis sessions. The first HD will be a conventional 4 hour dialysis, using single pass dialysate. The second will be an 8-hour HD using multipass (recycled) dialysate 25-30 l. Clearance of urea, creatinine, phosphate and cobalamin will be measured both in the patient and the dialysate. Patient symptoms will be recorded.</detailed_description>
