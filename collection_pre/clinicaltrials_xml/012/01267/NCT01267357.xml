	<brief_summary>P16 is a tumor suppressor protein implicated in serous papillary endometrial carcinoma. Evidence from previous trials indicates that it may be used as a diagnostic biomarker distinguishing this disease from endometrioid endometrial cancer. Additional evidence points to its prognostic value. The current study will evaluate p16 both as a diagnostic tool for serous papillary endometrial cancer and as a prognostic biomarker. following anonymization, histology blocks will be microtomed and stained for P16 and P53 proteins. Blocks from endometrioid endometrial cancer will be used as a control group.</brief_summary>
