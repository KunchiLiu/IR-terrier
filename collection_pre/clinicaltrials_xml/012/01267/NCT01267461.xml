	<brief_summary>Recently the general medical literature has become aware that the use of certain long-acting insulin analogues could potentially increase cancer risk.During the last few years the investigators group generated information of both scientific and clinical relevance on the proliferative and anti-apoptotic actions of insulin analogues. The goal of this project is to evaluate the hypothesis that the proliferative and signalling activities elicited by insulin analogues may have a impact on tumor behavior. In this study the investigators will asses the biological actions of insulin analogs in primary tumor cells of endometrial and colon cancer.</brief_summary>
