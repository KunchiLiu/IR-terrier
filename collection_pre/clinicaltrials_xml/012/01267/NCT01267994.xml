	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Anakinra (an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) can improve hearing thresholds in those patients with Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease (AIED) that did not respond to oral steroid therapy for a sudden decline in hearing. The patients to be enrolled will have recently completed a course of oral steroids and demonstrated no change in their audiometric thresholds following corticosteroid therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Anakinra for Steroid-Resistant Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with immune mediated hearing loss (also known as autoimmune hearing loss) are typically treated with corticosteroids. Of those treated, approximately 60% respond, however, that response may be lost over time. Other therapies use to date have proven largely ineffectual in improving hearing. This study proposes a phase I open label clinical trial of Anakinra for corticosteroid-resistant patients to determine if this therapy is efficacious in hearing restoration.</detailed_description>
