	<brief_summary>This study aimed to develop Video Compact Disc (VCD) program that applying the concept of imitative learning with mirror neurons stimulation on standard rehabilitation technique in children with cerebral palsy. The author will also examine effectiveness of the program by compare the motor function measured by the gross motor function measure (GMFM-66) between conventional physical therapy and the mirror neurons stimulation based VCD program for six months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Mirror Neurons Stimulation on Motor Skill Rehabilitation in Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial was performed with thirty children with cerebral palsy recruited from Thammasat University Hospital and Rajanukul institute. Informed consent was obtained from the participants' parents before participation in this study. The participants were randomly assigned according to the randomization list to receive either the mirror neurons stimulation based VCD program and practice at home or conventional physical therapy for six months. The participants in the experiment group received the mirror neurons stimulation based VCD program and practice at home three times a day for six months. Concerning the control group, the participants received conventional physical therapy regularly at the hospital once a week for first two months and twice a month for last four months. Both experimental and control groups were measured their motor functions with gross motor function measure (GMFM-66).</detailed_description>
