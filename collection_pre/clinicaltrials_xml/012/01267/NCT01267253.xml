	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well brivanib alaninate works in treating patients with cervical cancer that has come back. Brivanib alaninate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brivanib Alaninate in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer, who survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial), treated with brivanib (brivanib alaninate). II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of brivanib in this cohort of patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer treated with brivanib. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain the serum expression levels of surrogate markers of brivanib effects including angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) and markers of endothelial damage (E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM-1], and (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]). (exploratory) II. To determine whether these marker expression levels alone or in combination are associated with response, PFS, or overall survival. (exploratory) OUTLINE: Patients receive brivanib alaninate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with documented disease progression (disease not amenable to curative therapy); histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report All patients must have measurable disease, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1); measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patient must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1 Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists In general, this would refer to any active GOG phase III protocol or rare tumor protocol for the same patient population Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG performance status of 0 or 1 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI]) Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from the time of any major surgical procedure Patients must have had one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management of advanced, metastatic, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix; chemotherapy administered concurrent with primary radiation (e.g.; weekly cisplatin) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen for management of advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease; adjuvant chemotherapy given following the completion of radiation therapy (or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen for management of advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease (e.g.; paclitaxel and carboplatin for up to 4 cycles) Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease Patients must have NOT received any noncytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agents as part of their primary treatment or for management of recurrent or persistent disease Noncytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agents include (but are not limited to) monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and smallmolecule inhibitors of signal transduction Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dl Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Urinalysis needs to be assessed at baseline and proteinuria must be less than or equal to 2+ by dipstick If the urine dipstick is &gt;
