	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the clinical study is to determine the safety of a modified stem cell SB623 when administered to chronic, stable ischemic stroke patients. A second purpose is to determine whether SB623 might improve stroke symptoms. Chronic, stable ischemic stroke patients must be between 6 and 60 months after their stroke, and with only this one prior stroke, and and with no further improvement from physical therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Modified Stem Cells in Stable Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic, stable stroke patients have no existing alternative treatments after rehabilitation therapy. SB623, a modified stem cell preparation, has been shown to improve motor function when administered in animal models of stable stroke. Safety studies in animals have shown no adverse events attributed to SB623. Patients who meet the entry criteria for this study will have regular examinations, radiological evaluations (CT, MRI, PET), and be followed for two years. Regular neurological evaluations will also be done using standard questionnaires, with occasional video recording if improvements are evident. Key entry criteria for this study, in addition to 6-60 months post-ischemic stroke, include moderately severe symptoms--e.g., difficulty standing or walking, and/or difficulty using arms or hands, and/or speech impediments.</detailed_description>
