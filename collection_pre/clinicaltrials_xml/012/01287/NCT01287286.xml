	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if food supplements,Antrodia cinnamomea, could minimize the gastrointestinal symptom of cancer patients with chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancers Treated With Combination of Antrodia Cinnamomea and Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In our unpublished report shows that patients who took Antrodia Cinnamomea compound of 15 milliliters liquid twice in a day, might help white blood cells, red blood cells and hemoglobin increase after 2 months; liver glutamic pyruvic transaminase(GPT) index mitigation, P &lt;0.05 difference statistically; In addition, liver glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase(GOT) and biochemical index of renal function had no abnormal data statistically. However, cancer patients with gastrointestinal disorders after chemotherapy is known to be a common side effect, we seek to investigate if Antrodia Cinnamomea improves the function of gastrointestinal system.</detailed_description>
