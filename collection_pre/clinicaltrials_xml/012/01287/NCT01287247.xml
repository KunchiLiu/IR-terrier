	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, observational trial evaluating the "real world" use of Xeomin®(incobotulinumtoxinA). Physicians may enroll patients who are eligible to be treated with a botulinum toxin for cervical dystonia or blepharospasm based upon their clinical experience. The physician must have chosen to treat the patient with Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA) prior to and independent of enrollment in this study. Physicians may choose to treat their subjects with up to 2 treatment cycles (approximately 6 months/subject) of Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA) at a dose determined by the physician based upon his/her clinical experience with botulinum toxin. According and dependent on clinical practice, the investigators expect that subjects will be seen by the investigator for an average of 3 visits (two treatment cycles).</brief_summary>
