	<brief_summary>Cesarean section (C/S) is an operation most commonly performed in Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics. Complications related with incomplete healing of Kerr uterine incision after C/S (adhesions, separation (dehiscence), endometritis, endometriosis, anomalous placentation in subsequent pregnancies, incomplete or complete uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies, ...) are very important issues. Classically Kerr incision is repaired with continuous locked suturing. Purse string suturing of Kerr incision may reduce the size of the incision and in turn may reduce short and long term complications. For this reason, the investigators aimed to compare two closure techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Term Comparison of Two Different Techniques of Uterine Cesarean Incision Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the clinic, patients undergoing cesarean section that meet the criteria for inclusion into the study and agreed to participate in the study will be randomized into two groups (computer-assisted randomization method will be used.) In the first group of patients classical closure method of Kerr incision (double layered continuously locked suturing) will be used. In the second group of patients double layered purse string closure technique will be used. The two groups will be compared after 6 weeks in terms of healing, operation time, blood loss, incision size and incisional scar defect( if present). A physician who does not know the method of closure will evaluate incision size by transabdominal and/or transvaginal ultrasound. The length of the incision and myometrial thickness in Kerr incisional line will be measured and recorded in longitudinal and transverse axis separately. If any incisional scar defect is determined it will be measured and recorded also.</detailed_description>
