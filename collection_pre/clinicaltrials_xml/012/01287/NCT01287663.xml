	<brief_summary>Homelessness, also name the fourth world, is a growing public health problem worldwide. Previous studies showed that up to 30% of the homeless people reported pruritus that often results in itchy lesions, which expose them to bacterial skin infections. The investigators therefore conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a single oral dose of ivermectin was effective in significantly reducing the prevalence of pruritus in a sheltered homeless population.</brief_summary>
