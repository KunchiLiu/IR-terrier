	<brief_summary>The majority of elderly patients with a displaced fracture of the proximal femur are now treated with a hemiarthroplasty. Prosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication, and the infection rate is high in this group of elderly patients. Local application of gentamicin produces high antibiotic concentrations in the wound. The aim of this study is to determine whether locally administered collagen-gentamicin in the joint perioperatively in addition to routine IV prophylaxis with beta-lactam antibiotics can reduce the early postoperative infection rate (&lt; 4 weeks postoperative)after hemiarthroplasty in proximal femoral fractures.</brief_summary>
