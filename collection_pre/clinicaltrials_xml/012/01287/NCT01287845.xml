	<criteria>Part 1: Healthy volunteers only Males ≥ 40 years of age Part 2: Prostate cancer patients Males ≥ 18 years of age Serum PSA (ProstateSpecific Antigen) value above normal. Patients had an MRI and/or a positive [11C] or [18F] choline PET/CT for primary diagnosis (Note: MRI and [11C]or [18F]choline PET/CT are optional for primary prostate cancer patients) or recurrence detection of prostate cancer and the primary cancer disease (adenocarcinoma) is histologically confirmed Patients with primary prostate cancer have to be scheduled for prostatectomy In patients with primary prostate cancer, histopathological evaluation has to show an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 3 + 3 or higher in at least two biopsies at any location in the prostate Patients with advanced primary or recurrent prostate cancer and a high likelihood to display lymph node metastasis, ideally scheduled for explorative pelvic lymphadenectomy, are to be preferably included Part 3: Prostate cancer patients The criteria for eligibility of part 3 are identical to the ones of part 2. Except it is now no longer a preference but mandatory to only enrol patients with a presumably high likelihood of metastatic disease, especially lymph node metastasis. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease other than prostate cancer (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY1075553, unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease) which could compromise participation in the study Acute renal insufficiency of any intensity, either due to hepatorenal syndrome or occurring in the perioperative liver transplantation period Active inflammatory bowel disease within the last 6 months Acute prostatitis requiring medical treatment within the last 6 months A nonurologic bacterial infection requiring active treatment with antibiotics within 3 months Active other malignancy (except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) within the last 2 years Patients with primary prostate cancer only: androgen ablation within 3 months before planned treatment Subject fulfils criteria which in the opinion of the investigator preclude participation for scientific reasons, for reasons of compliance, or for reasons of the subject's safety</criteria>
