	<brief_summary>Pediatric patients admitted to the intensive care unit and requiring conscious sedation for minor surgical procedures are at risk to hypoventilate and retain CO2. The rise in CO2 levels is not well described and unpredicted. In this study the investigators will monitor CO2 levels transcutaneously using SDMS (SenTec digital Monitoring System) a device recently approved for clinical use. The hypothesis is ventilation of patients undergoing conscious sedation is compromised and CO2 levels might rise significantly to levels that potentially can effect hemodynamics. In order to avoid hemodynamic changes proper and routine monitoring is recommended.</brief_summary>
