	<brief_summary>It is well established to assess the functionality of a filtering bleb by intraocular pressure (IOP), either as an absolute value or as a percent reduction, and by the need of additional antiglaucoma drugs. It is also possible to evaluate the appearance of a bleb by a clinical score, e.g. the "Wuerzburg bleb classification score" (WBCS). The purpose of this study was to find out whether there is a correlation between clinical findings, in particular IOP and the WBCS. 100 eyes within two years after trabeculectomy were included into the study. Using colour photographs the filtering bleb was evaluated according to the WBCS from two different examiners, both on different levels of clinical experience. WBCS = 1 indicates poor bleb appearance, WBCS = 15 indicates optimal bleb appearance. At the same time, clinical findings like intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy and medical history were taken by another examiner. - Trial with surgical intervention</brief_summary>
