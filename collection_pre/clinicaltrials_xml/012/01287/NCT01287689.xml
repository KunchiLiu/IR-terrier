	<brief_summary>This non-interventional, epidemiological study assesses long-term outcomes in subjects receiving immunoglobulins (IgG) for any treatment purpose, irrespective of the regimen prescribed by the treating physician, under routine clinical conditions among at least 550 subjects in Germany. Long-term outcome data are collected on patient characteristics in the various indications, drug utilization of intravenous and subcutaneous IgG (e.g. treatment and dosing patterns), effectiveness (i.e. number of infections), tolerability, health related quality of life, and economic variables (number of hospitalizations, sick-leave days etc.) with the possibility to estimate direct costs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Immunoglobulins (IgG) in a Long-term Non-interventional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In view of the broad range of indications in immunodeficiency and immunomodulation, it is of interest to document the use of IgG under the conditions of everyday practice and to analyze the endpoints (outcomes). A prospective cohort study such as this is an important evidence source for such rare diseases as those mentioned above. The aim of this outcome study is to fill the gap of the lack of long-term data in these rare diseases treated with IgG.</detailed_description>
