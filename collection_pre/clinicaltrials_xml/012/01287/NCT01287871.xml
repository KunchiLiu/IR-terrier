	<brief_summary>This study aims to 1) implement a culturally and contextually rooted innovative multifoci, social marketing intervention involving societal focused media campaign elements to break down the barriers and facilitate timely and appropriate screening practices for cervical cancer; 2) measure cervical cancer stigma from a culturally relevant theoretical and conceptual framework; and 3) assess the influence of stigma on hindering seeking the PAP test. Further, this is an international study that will bring together a multi-disciplinary investigatory team, community advocates and State health agencies to deliver a social marketing intervention in Southern California (the Inland Empire region specifically) and Trinidad and Tobago.</brief_summary>
