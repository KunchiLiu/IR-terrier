	<brief_summary>Apatinib is a new kind of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The investigators have finished the preclinical and phase I and phase II clinical study for apatinib and found its satisfactory anti-tumor activity and tolerated toxicities. A disease-control rate of 75% was found in lung cancer patients. In the present phase III trial, the investigators will further evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of apatinib in the treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
