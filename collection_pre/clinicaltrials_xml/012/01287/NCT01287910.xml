	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to better understand how Transmyocardial Laser Revascularization (TMR) affects the functioning of the heart and, in turn, relieves angina in individuals with coronary heart disease using Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and Computed Tomography (CT) images in some patients.</brief_summary>
