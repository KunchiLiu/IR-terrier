	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To demonstrate that 3 doses of a vaccine containing Td-IPV valences administered in a 0, 1 and 6-month schedule induce an acceptable immune response in terms of seroprotection rates (SPR) against diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis 1, 2 and 3, in subjects of 40 years of age or older with no diphtheria- and tetanus-containing booster within the last 20 years - To evaluate the percentage of subjects with antibody titre ≥5 EU/mL (ELISA) for each of the pertussis components (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM) after 1 dose of REPEVAX in these subjects Secondary objectives: - If the primary objective is achieved, to determine whether 1 or 2 doses of a vaccine containing Td-IPV valences induce an acceptable response in terms of seroprotection rates (SPR) against diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis 1, 2 and 3, in subjects of 40 years of age or older with no diphtheria- and tetanus-containing booster within the last 20 years - To describe the immune responses to REPEVAX in these subjects - To describe the immune responses to REVAXIS administered 1 and 6 months after the administration of REPEVAX in these subjects</brief_summary>
