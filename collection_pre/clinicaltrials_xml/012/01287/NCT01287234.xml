	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate an external device (SonR sensor) that is capable of detecting sounds created by the heart (SonR signal). Based on the sounds created by the heart and recorded by the SonR sensor, optimal timing settings for the cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device may be determined. The investigators will then compare the timing settings suggested by SonR to the settings suggested from the echocardiogram. The objective of this study is to determine if differences exist between these different methods of timing the contractions of the top and bottom chambers of the heart and if the SonR signal is able to produce results similar to those of an echocardiogram.</brief_summary>
