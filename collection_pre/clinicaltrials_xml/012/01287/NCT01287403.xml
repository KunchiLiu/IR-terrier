	<brief_summary>Cereal grains contain a wide variety of different phytochemicals which may play different roles in physiology. Their response in plasma and urine after a meal is poorly defined for most cereals. This study will investigate the plasma response and urinary excretion of cereal compounds after eating 6 different types of cereal preparation, with a focus on alkylresorcinols.</brief_summary>
