	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to identify a correlation between the pH and pCO2 in arterial and venous blood. The secondary objectives include a correlation of pulse oximetry and arterial pO2 along with subgroup analyses of specific patient populations such as congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, pneumonia, overdose, and trauma.</brief_summary>
