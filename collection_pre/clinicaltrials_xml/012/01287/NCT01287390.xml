	<brief_summary>Severe acute and late dysphagia is now considered as a dose-limiting toxicity of radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck cancer that significantly affects patients' quality of life. We propose to preserve swallowing function by: - adapting (individualizing) treatment (intensity-modulated radiotherapy: IMRT) to per-treatment changes occurring in the tumor and surrounding organs and tissues; - reducing the volumes of elective neck, that may result in significant decrease of severe acute and late dysphagia.</brief_summary>
