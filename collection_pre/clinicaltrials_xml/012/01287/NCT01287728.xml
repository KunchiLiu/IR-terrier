	<brief_summary>Abnormal vaginal flora is currently diagnosed among women (20-40%). It is associated with symptoms (bad smell, vaginal discharge) and adverse out-comes in pregnant and not pregnant women. The high recurrence rate raises the long-term effectiveness of therapy. The hypothesis is the persistence of bacteria associated with vaginal flora imbalance as Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis. At the present time there is a lack of an accurate marker for the risk of recurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Value of Bacterial Loads by Real Time PCR in Predicting Recurrence of Abnormal Vaginal Flora After Oral Metronidazole Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with symptomatic abnormal vaginal flora (a Nugent score of 4-10 or sup or egal 3 Amsel criteria) will be enrolled. Abnormal vaginal flora will be treated with 2g of oral metronidazole. Follow-up will be performed at 1 week,1 month and 12 months after treatment. Vaginal samples will be tested by quantitative real time PCR to determine the vaginal concentrations of A. vaginae, G. vaginalis, and Lactobacillus spp.</detailed_description>
