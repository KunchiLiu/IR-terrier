	<brief_summary>Physical activity is recommended in the treatment of heart failure. Elderly people demand various forms of physical activity. Tai chi has shown to be an appreciated form of physical activity among elderly, although there is a lack of studies focusing people aged 70 years and older. The overall goal with the project is to find a form of physical activity that is safe and free from side effects, suitable for elderly people with chronic heart failure. The hypothesis is that for patients participating in tai chi training during three months the degree of self rated fatigue will be reduced and health-related quality of life will increase, compared with a control group receiving ordinary care. The primary aim is to study the effect of tai chi training on fatigue and health-related quality of life. A second aim is to study effects on physical function and levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in blood plasma. A tertiary aim is to describe the experience of participating in tai chi training. A randomized controlled clinical study is planned. Ninety patients with a verified diagnosis of heart failure in the age of 70 years or older, who experience fatigue according to the Multi Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), will be randomized to intervention or control group. Three groups with 15 participants each will complete a tai chi training programme twice-weekly for 16 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, directly after the 16 weeks of training, and 6 and 12 months thereafter. The programme is worked out by an expert in Chinese traditional medicine to suit elderly people with chronic heart failure, and the classes are led by experienced leaders. Before the start of the study a small pilot study was conducted to test the feasibility of the programme. A group of seven patients completed the programme for eight weeks without any problems. If tai chi has a good effect on fatigue, health-related quality of life and physical function, this form of physical activity can be a valuable complement to other medical treatment. Tai chi has a potential to be offered to many patients to a relatively low cost. It can be practiced in groups or in private, and also through internet connection.</brief_summary>
