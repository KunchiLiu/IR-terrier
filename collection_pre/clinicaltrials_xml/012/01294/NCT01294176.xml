	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if oral lipoic acid can safely help relieve permanent optic nerve injury in patients diagnosed with acute optic neuritis. It will also explore how the body absorbs and breaks down the study drug, and what effects it has on the immune system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipoic Acid as a Treatment for Acute Optic Neuritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral lipoic acid is an antioxidant that helps proteins work in the body. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations and has been used in the past to treat nerve damage like that seen in diabetes and some other metabolic disorders. It is available as a dietary supplement in the United States. Patients with a diagnosis of acute optic neuritis who are enrolled in the study will undergo medical and nervous system examinations, and blood draws. The study doctor will take a medical history and perform physical examinations. Research assistants at the MS Center, who are trained in blood draws, will perform the blood draws. Patients will also undergo Optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination at Casey Eye Institute, and receive two MRIs at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). Because it is a placebo-controlled trial, subjects will have a 50:50 chance of receiving either placebo (inactive) or study drug. If enrolled in the study, patients will take two gel capsules of the study drug or placebo at the same time every day for six weeks.</detailed_description>
