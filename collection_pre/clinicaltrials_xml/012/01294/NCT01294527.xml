	<brief_summary>The WiCS-LV system is an alternative means to providing left ventricular stimulation for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the WiCS-LV System in patients with indications for CRT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will undergo an acoustic window assessment using transthoracic echocardiography. Patients with adequate acoustic windows will undergo implantation of the WiCS-LV system. Patients will undergo evaluations pre-hospital discharge, and at one month, 3 months, and 6 months post implantation. Extended follow-up will be obtained via a registry at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post implantation.</detailed_description>

Patients with previously implanted pacemakers or ICD's and meeting standard indications for CRT referred to as "upgrades" 2. Patients in whom attempted coronary sinus lead implantation for CRT has failed referred to as "untreated" 3.
