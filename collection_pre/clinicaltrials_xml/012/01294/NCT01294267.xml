	<brief_title>Percutaneous Hemodynamic Support With Impella 2.5 During Scar-related Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Impella 2.5 is a percutaneous heart pump that will be used to provide partial circulatory support -. The Impella 2.5 is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is being tested to see if it helps keep the patient's blood pressure stable during the cardiac ablation procedure. The Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support System works by placing a small pump into the left pumping chamber of the heart which will then help the heart circulate blood throughout the body. The Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support system will be removed once the heart no longer needs help with the pumping action which can be at any time from just after the completion of the heart procedure up to several days post procedure as determined by physician.</detailed_description>
