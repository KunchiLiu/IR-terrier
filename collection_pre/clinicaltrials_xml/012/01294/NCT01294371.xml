	<detailed_description>This was a non-interventional, observational program in which Lucrin Depot (leuprorelin acetate) and add-back therapy (hormone and non-hormone) were prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to dose, population and indication (for leuprorelin acetate) and with regards to the local guidelines or therapeutic recommendation (for add-back therapy).
