	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Femoral Nerve Block in Children With a Femur Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with femur fractures can have severe pain after elastic nail fixation. The current national standard for post operative pain control would be intravenous narcotics. In addition to the use of intravenous narcotics, there are two alternative methods used during the surgery in order to potentially decrease the pain post-operatively. These methods are hematoma block or a femoral nerve block. Both are proven safe and effective in children, however little research has been done to look at the effectiveness of these various methods compared to one another.</detailed_description>
