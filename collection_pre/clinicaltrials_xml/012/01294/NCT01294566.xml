	<brief_summary>This study is the First Time In Human study for the motilin receptor agonist, GSK1322888. GSK1322888 is a potent and selective small molecule motilin receptor agonist, distinct from the motilide compound structures. The aims of this study are to assess the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of GSK1322888 and to identify a well-tolerated and safe dose that will accelerate gastric emptying of a 13C stable isotope-labeled test meal in healthy volunteers. The study will include assessment of ECGs, vital signs, safety laboratory sampling, adverse events, pharmacokinetics, and the 13C-Octanoic Acid Breath Test to measure gastric emptying.</brief_summary>
