	<brief_title>A Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Safety Study of Hydrochlorothiazide and Canagliflozin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label study with 2 study periods where volunteers and study staff will know the names and doses of assigned study treatments. All volunteers will receive the same treatment. Canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. During Period 1, volunteers will take canagliflozin 300 mg once daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) and during Period 2, volunteers will take HCTZ 25 mg once daily for 28 days (Days 1 to 28), and then starting on Day 29, will take canagliflozin 300 mg once daily and HCTZ 25 mg once daily for 7 days (Days 29 to 35). Period 1 and Period 2 will be separated by a minimum of 14 days.</detailed_description>
