	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the plasma levels of Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) at the diagnosis and after treatment of sepsis, and to determine whether it has a diagnostic and prognostic value in late-onset neonatal sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) in Late-onset Neonatal Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinical presentation of neonatal infection is subtle and nonspecific. Microbiologic cultures of clinical specimens, the gold standard for diagnosis, have low sensitivity and are not available in time to influence initial therapy. Therefore, reliable and rapid in vitro tests are needed for early diagnosis and management of infection in neonates. suPAR, secreted from the cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells) has recently been reported to be a potential biomarker for several infection diseases. The levels of suPAR have not been studied in newborn infants yet.</detailed_description>
