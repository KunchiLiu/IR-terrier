	<brief_title>Case Series Study of Biliary Tract Cancer Patients in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patients of biliary tract cancer have advanced disease at diagnosis and often relapse despite surgery. Combination therapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a standard therapy for this kind of cancer with the evidence of phase III study compared with gemcitabine alone. However the prognosis and the tolerability of chemotherapy in the patients with recurrent biliary tract cancer after radical resection might differ from those of unresectable biliary tract cancer, because the dose intensity of chemotherapy can be influenced by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hepatic resection.</detailed_description>
