	<brief_summary>Human studies of Chinese liquor are sparse. The investigators hypothesize that short-term Chinese Tea-flavor liquor (TFL) consumption may be beneficial to inflammation biomarkers and CVD risk factors. Guizhou Meijiao Liquor (GML) is a traditional Chinese liquor, fermented from sorghum, corn, sticky rice, wheat and rice, while TFL is a novel Chinese liquor fermented from above 5 grains plus green tea. Forty-five volunteers(23 males, 22 females) were selected to participate a paralleled randomized trial drinking 30 mL two kinds of Chinese liquors: TFL and GML respectively with meal every day for 28 days. Serums of volunteers were collected for analyzing serum lipids, inflammation biomarkers and CVD risk factors. TFL could significantly decrease systolic blood pressure of males, but increase diastolic blood pressure of females. TFL could also decreased blood lipid of volunteers, especially for females. Both liquor significantly decrease serum uric acid and glucose in males and females. The effect of the two liquors on inflammation biomarkers were complicated and needs further research work. TFL may possess more beneficial effect on CVD risk factors than GML probably because of the special fermentation products of green tea with other grains.</brief_summary>
