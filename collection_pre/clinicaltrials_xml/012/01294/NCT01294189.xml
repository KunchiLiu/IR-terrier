	<brief_title>Advance Directives and End-of-life Decision Making in Intensive Care Medicine in Germany</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patients on the intensive care unit (ICU) die after an end-of-life decision (EOLD) has been made (Sprung et al. 2003). On September 1st 2009 the "advance-directives-law" was inured in Germany considering a written advance directive of an adult binding for physicians and the patientÂ´s surrogate decision makers if it fits into the medical context (BGBL 2009). There is a lack of data describing the process and the factors associated with end-of-life-decisions in ICUs in Germany in detail. The purpose of this observational study is to describe the decision making process as well as the practices of end of life care in an ICU of a German university hospital during a period when changes of German legislation occurred.</detailed_description>
