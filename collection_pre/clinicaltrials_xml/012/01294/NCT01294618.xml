	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of a combination of 2 treatments shown to have some efficacy in Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CP CML) separately, but that have never been combined to date, and this combination is expected to substantially increase the molecular response rates.</brief_summary>
