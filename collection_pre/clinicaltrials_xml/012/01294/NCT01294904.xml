	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic kidney disease (both men and women), especially those with terminal renal failure, manifest infertility. There has been demonstrated several hormonal changes in patients on dialysis. Increased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) has been seen in men (12). In women the opposite has been reported. The number of spermatocytes is reduced and a disturbance in maturation has been observed. This project is aimed to study the influence of uremic milieu on fertility in men and women. The hypopituitary/hypothalamus gland axis and hormonal levels will be studied.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal elimination of hormones and peptides. By using a human transplantation model the investigators will study changes in hormonal levels before and after a successful transplantation up to 12 months. Hormones: testosterone, SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin), LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), estradiol and inhibin B. Analysis of sperm quality, concentration, motility, morphology and as well DNA-fragmentation index (DFI) in men with chronic kidney disease. In women the investigators will study the maturation of follicles via vaginal ultrasound. Controls are persons from a study at Dept of Reproductive Medicine.</detailed_description>
