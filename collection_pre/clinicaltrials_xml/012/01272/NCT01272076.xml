	<brief_title>Cirrus HD-OCT Measurement of Area of Increased Light Penetration Under the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives: 1. To compare Cirrus HD-OCT automated measurements of the illumination area under the RPE to expert manual measurements of areas of hypofluorescence typical of geographic atrophy in fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images. 2. To describe the differences and similarities between Cirrus HD-OCT and fundus autofluorescence images of subjects with geographic atrophy secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 3. To determine the clinical factors that affect the Cirrus HD-OCT automated measurements of the illumination area under the RPE.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females 50 years of age and older diagnosed to have advanced dry AMD with geographic atrophy. Geographic atrophy lesions should: Not be greater than 5 mm at the widest diameter. The entire lesion(s) should fit into the 6x6 mm scan area of the Cirrus HDOCT. Not be smaller than 1.25 mm2. Not be confluent with peripapillary atrophy. Not be combined with other lesions such as CNVs. Able and willing to make the required study visit. Able and willing to give consent and follow study instructions. History of retinal surgery, laser photocoagulation, and/or radiation therapy to the eye. Evidence of other retinal diseases of the eye, including wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or significant vitreomacular traction upon dilated examination, or upon evaluation of retinal photos. Thick media opacity or inability to fixate that precludes obtaining acceptable scans. Concomitant use of hydrochloroquine and chloroquine. Unable to make the required study visit. Unable to give consent or follow study instructions.</criteria>
