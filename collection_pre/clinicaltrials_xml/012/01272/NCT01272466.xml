	<brief_summary>Anti-apoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family are known to play a key role in oncogenesis and are overexpressed in myeloma cells. Studies have shown that dendritic cells exposed to proteasome inhibition present exogene antigens better than unexposed dendritic cells. Patients with relapse of multiple myeloma will be offered vaccination with peptides derived from antiapoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family in combination with an immunostimulatory adjuvant. The vaccination will be given in relation to treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.</brief_summary>
