	<brief_summary>The patient is being asked to join this clinical research study to find out if lapatinib, an agent that targets a protein, called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of cancer cells in combination with everolimus, an agent that targets a protein in the cancer cell, called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is effective in metastatic triple negative breast cancers that are no longer controlled by standard chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

Patients of childbearing potential agree to use an effective form of contraception during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of study medication (an effective form of contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double barrier method) Patients with current active hepatic or biliary disease (except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment) Patients with an active infection or with a fever &gt; 101.3 Fahrenheit within 3 days of the first scheduled day of protocol treatment Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with stable CNS disease, who have undergone radiotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to the planned first protocol treatment and who have been on a stable dose of corticosteroids for 3 weeks are eligible for the trial History of prior malignancy within the past 5 years except for curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with two consecutive normal pap smears 6 months apart Patients who received radiotherapy to more than 25% of their bone marrow; or patients who received radiotherapy to target lesions within 4 weeks of entry Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy Peripheral neuropathy &gt;= Grade 2 Patients who are pregnant or lactating Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.
