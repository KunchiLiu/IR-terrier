	<brief_summary>The 3 Specific Aims are (1) To determine the prevalence, incidence and severity of oral conditions in postmenopausal early stage breast cancer survivors within the first 18 months of adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor(AI) therapy, (2) To determine the oral health quality of life among postmenopausal early stage breast cancer survivors who are receiving AI therapy, (3) To determine the utilization of dental care among postmenopausal women receiving AIs with a history of early stage BCa over time. The hypothesis for this pilot study is that AIs negatively impact oral health and oral health quality of life in the setting of breast cancer survivors. Further, we hypothesize that dental visits are underutilized in women with BCa undergoing adjuvant AI therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a 2 arm prospective study. PM women receiving breast care, with and without breast cancer, at the University of Michigan are eligible. The study procedures include: survey/questionnaires, oral exam performed at Michigan Center for Oral Health Research (MCOHR) with specimen collection, and medical chart review. The goal of this study is to collect dental data and oral health quality of life data on women who are receiving AI therapy. This study does not administer any treatments or drugs to participants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal as defined by NCCN (any of the following) Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age equal to or greater then 60 years of age Age less then 60 and amenorrheic for 12 or more months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene or ovarian suppression and FSH and estradiol in the postmenopausal range If taking tamoxifen or toremifene and age less then 60y, then FSH and plasma estradiol level in postmenopausal ranges71. Individuals capable of consenting and self administering the survey instrument. At least 15 teeth present. AI users: Diagnosis of BCa Histologic confirmed diagnosis of BCa: Stage 0, I, II, or III with no evidence of metastatic disease. Treatment AI as clinically indicated (AI may be anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole). Subjects may have had prior tamoxifen or raloxifene. Subjects may have had chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Must be within the first year of consecutive AI therapy. If a subject started AI, discontinued, then restarted, they will be accepted into the study as long as the past therapy did not exceed 12 months and the current therapy has not exceeded 12 months. Controls: No Diagnosis of cancer. Patients must not have a diagnosis of any cancer (Not including a history of thyroid or skin cancer). Metastatic BCa (AI treated group: fully resected locally recurrent disease is permitted if the patient has been rendered without evidence of disease). Significant psychiatric illness/social situations that would preclude completion of questionnaires Chronic medications known to affect the periodontal status (calcium antagonist, anticonvulsives, immunosuppressives (&gt; prednisone 7.5mg daily). NSAIDS and bisphosphonates are permitted. Premedication Conditions that require antibiotic therapy will be evaluated on a casebycase basis. (Patients taking prophylaxis for joint replacements will not be excluded.)</criteria>
