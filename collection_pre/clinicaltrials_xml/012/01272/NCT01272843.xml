	<brief_summary>The carotid arteries are blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. Carotid stenosis disease is defined as a narrowing of these arteries due to the build up of plaque. The plaque material can also break off and move into the brain. The resulting blockage of blood supply to a portion of the brain is what causes 80% of all strokes. One treatment option is to have surgery on the carotid artery and remove the plaque. This procedure is called a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). There is evidence that proves CEA reduces the risk of stroke. The objective of this research project is to determine who is most likely to benefit from CEA surgery.</brief_summary>
