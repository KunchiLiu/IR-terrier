	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America and South America. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the potential of liraglutide to induce and maintain weight loss over 56 weeks in obese subjects or overweight subjects with co-morbidities. Furthermore, the aim is to investigate the long term potential of liraglutide to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in subjects diagnosed with pre-diabetes at baseline. Based on body mass index (BMI) and pre-diabetes status, subjects will be randomised to either 68 weeks (56 weeks of randomised treatment followed by a 12 week re-randomised treatment period) or 160 weeks of treatment (160 week treatment will only be applicable to subjects with pre-diabetes status at baseline).</brief_summary>
