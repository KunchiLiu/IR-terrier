	<brief_summary>Prevnar (7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [7vPnC]) has been shown to be effective against ear infections in children. Prevnar 13 is a new vaccine that is similar to Prevnar. It is expected that the effectiveness of Prevnar 13 against ear infections in children will be similar to that observed following Prevnar. Pfizer has committed to conduct a postmarketing study of the impact of Prevnar 13 in reducing ear infections among children.</brief_summary>
