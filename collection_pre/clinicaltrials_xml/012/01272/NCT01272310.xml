	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a fixed dose combination therapy of: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2a (PEG-IFN alpha-2a) and Ribavirin (RBV) in Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1 Infected adult subjects who failed to respond following a course of PEG-IFN and RBV Therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Combination Therapy: Hydroxychloroquine, Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2a and Ribavirin in Chronic Hepatitis C Subjects Non-responders to the Standard of Care Therapy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I/II, open clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy data of a fixed dose combination therapy of: HCQ, Peg-IFN alpha-2a and RBV in chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infected subjects who failed to respond following a course of Peg-IFN and RBV Therapy (SoC). The study is a single center trial to be conducted at the Department of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology, at Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel. Overall, thirty six (36) patients will be recruited. All patients enrolled will have a documented history of chronic HCV disease and being non-responder on earlier Peg-IFN based treatment lasting for at least 12 consecutive weeks prior to study enrolment. The expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is in-between six weeks (42 days) up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day at visit 2 (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed twice on the first week of the study, once a week during the initiation of the treatment period at weeks 2,3 and week 4, later during the treatment period once a month at weeks 8-48 and at two follow up visits post treatment to take place at week 60 and 72 (allowing a time window of ± 5 days for all visits).</detailed_description>
