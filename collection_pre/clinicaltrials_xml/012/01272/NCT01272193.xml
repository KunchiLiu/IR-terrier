The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) with insulin glargine in subjects with type 2 diabetes in Japan. Depending on pre-trial oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), subjects continued at the same dose and dosing frequency.</brief_summary>
