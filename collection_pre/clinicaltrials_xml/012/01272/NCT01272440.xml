	<brief_summary>Asparaginase is an important drug i the treatment of childhood leukaemia. The aim of this project is to study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antibody development and hypersensitivity reactions during prolonged PEG-asparaginase treatment. Study part 1) Asparaginase pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during prolonged PEG-asparaginase treatment: A NOPHO ALL-2008 study Study part 2) Asparagine depletion in cerebrospinal fluid: A NOPHO ALL-2008 study Study part 3) A characterization of PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in children treated according to the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol Perspectives: New knowledge about PEG-asparaginase treatment regarding dosing, dosing interval, adverse effects and EFS, which may lead to improved future therapy Patients: Children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the Nordic Countries</brief_summary>
