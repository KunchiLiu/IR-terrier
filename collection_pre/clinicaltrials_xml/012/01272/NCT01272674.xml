	<brief_summary>Adiponectin and exercise training contribute to the maintenance of a normal vascular tone by influencing vascular NO bioavailability and concentration and function of endothelial progenitor cells. The molecular mechanisms are only partially understood. Therefore, aim of the present study is to elucidate the effects of Adiponectin on endothelial progenitor cell migration and the underlying signaling pathways. Furthermore, the impact of exercise training on adiponectin-mediated endothelial progenitor cell migration will be investigated.</brief_summary>
