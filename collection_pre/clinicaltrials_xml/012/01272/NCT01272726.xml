	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 10-12% of school-aged children in the United States, making it one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children. It is characterized as inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, which has persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level (DSM-IV-TR). ADHD is a non-fluctuating illness unlike many other psychiatric co-morbid conditions.</detailed_description>
