	<brief_summary>Impairment of visual deficits, in particular contrast acuity and contrast impairment are frequent symptoms in MS. However, visual function is not appropriately covered by the standard tools for clinical assessment, namely, the EDSS and the MSFC. The primary aim of this study is to investigate, whether in MS patients contrast acuity and sensitivity change over a period of two years. Secondary aims are the correlation of visual contrast parameters with structural retinal changes and quality of life.</brief_summary>
