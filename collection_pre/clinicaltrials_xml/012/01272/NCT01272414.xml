	<brief_summary>Currently there are few therapeutic options for the treatment of lid retraction secondary to thyroid orbitopathy (TO) during the active stages of the disease. BoTox injection is capable of creating a ptosis, that in the setting of TO can return the upper lid to a more physiologic position, thus improving cosmesis, corneal lubrication and potentially quiescent stage lid position. This investigation aims to examine the properties of this relationship.</brief_summary>
