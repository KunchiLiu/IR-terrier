	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the areas designated as elevated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by the Cirrus HD-OCT versus those designated as drusen on color fundus photographs (CFPs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement and Analysis of Macular Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) Elevations With Cirrus HD-OCT vs. Color Fundus Photography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multiple site study. Ocular history and examination will be conducted on consented subjects to determine further participation in the study. Subjects qualified to continue will undergo color fundus photography and imaging of their study eye using the Cirrus HD-OCT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females 50 years of age or older diagnosed to have dry AMD with macular drusen. Drusen should not be combined with other lesions such as geographic atrophy (GA) or choroidal neovascularization. Able and willing to make the required study visits. Able and willing to give consent and follow study instructions. History of retinal surgery, laser photocoagulation, and/or radiation therapy to the eye. Evidence of other retinal diseases of the eye, including wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or significant vitreomacular traction upon dilated examination, or upon evaluation of retinal photos. Thick media opacity or inability to fixate that precludes obtaining acceptable scans. Concomitant use of hydrochloroquine and chloroquine. Unable to make the required study visits. Unable to give consent or follow study instructions.</criteria>
