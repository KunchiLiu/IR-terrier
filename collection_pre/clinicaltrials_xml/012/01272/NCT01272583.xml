	<brief_summary>Hypoglycaemia is a well-known complication of insulin treated diabetes. The counterregulatory response to hypoglycaemia, with glucagon as the most important mediator, is initially diminished within a few years of onset of Type 1 diabetes and subsequently lost and thus increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl Peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors augment the glucagon response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor in patients with type 1 diabetes will recover the alpha cell response to hypoglycaemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors and Alpha-cell Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 16 type 1 patients will be randomised to one of two treatment sequences: DPP-4 inhibitor followed by placebo or placebo followed by a DPP-4 inhibitor. Each treatment period lasts 6 weeks, so all patients will receive treatment for 12 weeks in total. Induction of hypoglycaemia will take place at 0 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks to determine the glucagon response.</detailed_description>
