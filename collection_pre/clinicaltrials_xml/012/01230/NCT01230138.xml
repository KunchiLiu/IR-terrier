	<brief_title>Pivotal Efficacy and Safety Registration Trial of FP187 in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial tests two different dose levels and two different daily dosing schedules (twice daily (BID) and three times daily (TID))over 20 weeks of treatment. Key is effect as measured by achievement of a 75% reduction in PASI after 20 weeks and safety monitored by adverse events and safety lab. There are 3 active arms: 1. FP-187 at a daily dose of 750mg divided in three doses (250mg TID) 2. FP-187 at a daily dose of 750mg divided in two doses (375mg BID) 3. FP-187 at a daily dose of 500mg divided in two doses (250mg BID) and 1 placebo arm. An additional open (flexible dosing) treatment arm has been amended to the trial</detailed_description>
