	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies a culturally-informed counseling intervention in Latinas at high risk for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. A culturally-informed counseling intervention may be an effective method to help people learn more about their cancer risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Culturally-Informed Counseling in Latinas at High Risk for Hereditary Breast or Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct a randomized trial of a culturally-informed pre-genetic cancer risk assessment (GCRA) telephone intervention. II. To evaluate the effect of the pre-GCRA intervention versus a time and attention control versus standard scheduling procedure alone (usual care) on levels of anxiety, perceived personal control and cancer genetics knowledge. III. To explore patients' experiences with the pre-GCRA intervention through post-intervention telephone interviews. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore patients' perceived barriers to GCRA through no-show telephone interviews. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive a culturally-informed adapted motivational interviewing telephone call. ARM II: Patients participate in a controlled condition comprising a health habits intervention group. ARM III: Patients receive usual care comprising a standard scheduling phone call and proceed with normal GCRA process. All patients are mailed standard new patient packets containing questionnaires on demographics and personal health history, and a family history form. All patients then undergo genetic cancer risk assessment.</detailed_description>
