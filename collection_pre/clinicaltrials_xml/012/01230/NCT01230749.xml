	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) and pharmacodynamics (what the medication does to the body) of treatment with JNJ-41443532 relative to treatment with placebo in type 2 diabetes mellitus participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Multiple Oral Doses of JNJ-41443532 in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither investigator nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), and placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) and active comparator (an established effective treatment that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) controlled study (placebo or active comparator is compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study). The study consists of 4 phases: screening phase (45 days before administration of study medication); pre-dosing run-in phase (a phase before a clinical study is commenced when no treatment is given. In this study, participant's glucose level will be observed during run-in-phase: days 15 to 1 before administration of study medication); treatment phase, and follow-up phase (7 to 10 days after the last dose of the study medication). Approximately 88 participants will be enrolled in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to 4 treatment arms: JNJ-41443532 250 mg; JNJ-41443532 1000 mg; pioglitazone arm; and placebo. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events including ocular assessments, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The maximum study duration for each participant will be approximately 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
