	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe and United States of America (USA). The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (at which rate the substance is distributed and eliminated from the body) and the safety profile of catridecacog (recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII)) in children with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Young children (1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII deficiency are evaluated.</brief_summary>
