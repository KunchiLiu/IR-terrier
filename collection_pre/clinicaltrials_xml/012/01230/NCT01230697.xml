	<brief_summary>The study includes the recruitment of patients with advanced renal cells carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma in treatment with sorafenib. Multicenter cohort study. It is a prospective observational study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perspective Evaluation of Hormones Involved in Serum Phosphate Homeostasis in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cells Carcinoma or Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Sorafenib (SORHORM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several tyrosin kinase inhibitors are able to induce hypophosphatemia but the mechanisms underling this metabolic disorder are unknown. Sorafenib is probably the drug in which this metabolic disturbance is most frequent. The aim of the study is identify variation of blood serum analites involved in hypophosphatemia in patients with advanced renal cells carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma in treatment with sorafenib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. age over 18 years 2. Histologically documented kidney cancer or hepatocarcinoma 3. Performance status more than / equal to 2 4. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks 5. in patients with recent surgery, the wound should be completely healed before taking Sorafenib 6. required initial laboratory values: absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/ul Platelets &gt; 100,000/ul., Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dl, Creatinine, SGOT, SGPT less than 2.0 X upper limit of normal Bilirubin less than/equal to upper limit of normal(ULN) 7. Appropriate patienty compliance 1. myocardial infarction or significant change in anginal pattern within the last 6 months, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or higher) or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, 2. previous history of malignant disease with the exception of non melanoma skin cancer curatively treated, 3. significant neurologic or psychiatric diseases preventing patients to give a valid informed consent 4.
