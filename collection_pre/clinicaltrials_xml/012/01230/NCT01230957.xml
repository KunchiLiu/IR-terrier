	<brief_summary>This study will further evaluate the ACAM-CDIFF™ vaccine in a population of middle-aged to elderly individuals at risk of exposure to Clostridium difficile because of impending hospitalization or residence in a care facility. Primary Objectives: - To describe the safety profile of subjects in each of the study groups. - To describe the immune responses elicited by toxoid A and toxoid B of subjects in each of the study groups. Observational Objective: - To describe the occurrence of first-time Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) episodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Different Formulations of a Clostridium Difficile Toxoid Vaccine Given at Three Different Schedules in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will receive 3 doses of either one of 4 different formulations of ACAM-CDIFF™ vaccine or placebo, on one of 3 different schedules. The trial will have 2 stages. Stage I will test 4 different formulations of ACAM-CDIFF™ vaccine. Stage II will explore different vaccination schedules using one of these formulations. Participants will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity; stool samples will also be provided in case of diarrhea.</detailed_description>
