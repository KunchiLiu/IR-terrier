	<brief_title>Prophylactic Enoxaparin Dosing in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Patients at St. Vincent Carmel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FDA-approved enoxaparin dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is a fixed-dose regimen irrespective of body mass index (BMI) or actual body weight (ABW). Clinical trials suggest that dosing may be inadequate for obese patients. We plan to assess anti-factor-Xa concentrations in patients who received prophylactic enoxaparin after bariatric surgery. This prospective study will examine 150 anti-factor Xa concentrations from patients 18 years or older undergoing primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery at St. Vincent Carmel Bariatric Center of Excellence. Patients receive varying prophylactic enoxaparin regimens at the surgeon's discretion. Anti-factor-Xa concentrations are obtained at steady state.</detailed_description>
