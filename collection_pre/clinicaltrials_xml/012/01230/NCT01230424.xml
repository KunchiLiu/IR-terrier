	<brief_summary>A steroid (triamcinolone) 40 mg will be compared to placebo in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the effect of this steroid versus placebo given into the study knee joint that has osteoarthritis (OA). The knee injection will be given once every 12 weeks over two years for a total of eight knee injections. How well each participant tolerates each injection and all the injections over time will be assessed. The safety of getting a knee injection every 12 weeks will be assessed by collecting reported adverse effects, knee examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Participants will complete questionnaires, X-ray, MRIs, and bone density tests as part of this study.</brief_summary>
