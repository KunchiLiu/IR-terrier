	<brief_title>Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Control on Progression of Coronary Atherosclerosis: Randomized Evaluation by Intravascular Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antihypertensive therapy is reported to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. The goal of blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease is recommended to control below 140/90mmHg. However, the effect of intensive blood pressure control compared to standard blood pressure control is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control compared to standard blood pressure control on progression of coronary atherosclerosis by intravascular ultrasound in hypertensive patients with coronary atherosclerosis after 18 months. The goal of systolic blood pressure is under 120mmHg in intensive blood pressure control group and under 140mmHg in standard blood pressure control group. The design of this study is randomized control study.</detailed_description>
