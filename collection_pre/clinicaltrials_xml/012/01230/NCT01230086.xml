	<brief_summary>Implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the treatment of choice for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Traditionally, intraoperative testing for sensing and defibrillation capabilities of the ICD system is performed. Modern implantation strategies suggest a non-testing approach because net-benefit of a testing versus a non-testing strategy is questionable and because arrhythmia induction and defibrillation may cause micro damage to the heart. The study aims to investigate the contribution of different steps in the ICD implantation procedure (implantation of the lead, shock delivery and induced ventricular fibrillation) with respect to their potential damage to the heart measured by high sensitivity (HS) TroponinT.</brief_summary>
