	<brief_title>Feasibility of Comparing Two Surgical Treatment of Female Urodynamic Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single incision tension-free sub-urethral vaginal tapes procedures8 have been recently described in an attempt to avoid the blind passage of the trochars through the groin &amp; the adductor muscles and consequently reducing the incidence &amp; severity of postoperative leg pain. The obvious advantages would be shorter hospital stay, early recovery, early resumption of day to day activities &amp; earlier return to work. A number of small prospective audits and case-series have been presented in international conferences reporting on the safety &amp; outcomes for these procedures. However all these studies were for preliminary reports for proof of concept and therefore the studies populations were 15-70 women with short term follow-up of 2-3 month9-11.These studies have shown low perioperative complication rates: bladder injury 0-1%, vaginal erosion 1-3% &amp; one study showing 1.3% pain at 6 weeks follow-up. The patient reported success rates were 77-93% at 2-3 month follow-up9-12. Objectives: 1. Establish the feasibility of the "Single incision sub-urethral tapes" to be done under local anaesthesia. 2. The feasibility of randomisation to the standard surgical treatment TVT-O / TVT. 3. To compare the surgical approach in this relatively new procedure against the standard procedures as regard: Peri-operative complication rates, Postoperative pain, Time to discharge from the hospital, 4. To compare the outcomes as regard: Patient-reported cure rates, Patient satisfaction, Impact on Quality of life (QoL) and sexual function at 3 month &amp; 1 -year follow-up. The objective cure rates will be assessed at 3 month follow-up. Design: A pilot prospective randomised study within participating urogynaecology units of the "Scottish Pelvic Floor Network".</detailed_description>
