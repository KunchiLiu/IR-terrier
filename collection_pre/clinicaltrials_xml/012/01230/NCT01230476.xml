	<brief_summary>Standard of care for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is chemoradiation with concurrent cisplatin. Addition of a second agent, cetuximab, which targets nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with high EGFR protein expression, may enhance the effectiveness of radiation and result in better tumour control. This study investigates the addition of 2 cycles of cisplatin/5FU chemotherapy with cetuximab, followed by cisplatin and cetuximab concurrent with radiation, for treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</brief_summary>
