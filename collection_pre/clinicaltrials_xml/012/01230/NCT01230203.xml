	<brief_summary>Cumulative radiation dose, cost, contrast induced nephrotoxicity and increased demand for computed tomography aortography (CTA) suggest that duplex ultrasonoraphy (DU) may be an alternative to CTA-based surveillance. The investigators compared CTA with DU during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) follow-up. Patients undergoing EVAR have radiological follow-up data entered in a prospectively multicenter database. The gold standard test for endoleak detection was CTA. DU interpretation was performed independently of CTA and vice versa.</brief_summary>
