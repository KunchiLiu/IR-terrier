	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic property of C3G after administration of Mulberry fruit extract to 12 healthy Korean volunteers. Plasma concentration of C3G and the antioxidative markers such as total antioxidative capacity and attack of free oxygen radical will be measured. Additional objective is to investigate the multiple dose (2 weeks) safety of daily 1000mg Mulberry fruit extract. This study, as an exploratory trial, does not required statistical hypothesis.</brief_summary>
