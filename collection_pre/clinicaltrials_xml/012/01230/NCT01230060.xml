	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the enVistaÂ® One-Piece Hydrophobic Acrylic intraocular lens (IOL), following primary implantation for the visual correction of aphakia in adults 18 years of age or older in whom the cataractous lens has been removed by an extracapsular cataract extraction method (eg, small incision phacoemulsification).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of agerelated cataract that is considered amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification/extracapsular cataract extraction. Subjects must have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) equal to or worse than 20/40 in the study eye, with or without a glare source. Subjects must have a BCVA projected to be better than 20/30 after IOL implantation in the study eye. Subjects with any anterior segment pathology for which extracapsular phacoemulsification cataract surgery would be contraindicated. Subjects with any other serious ocular pathology, or underlying serious medical conditions, which based on the Investigator's medical judgment, could confound the results of the study.</criteria>
