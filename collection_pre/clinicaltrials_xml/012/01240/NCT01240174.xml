	<brief_summary>Studies show, guidelines state, and performance measures assert that antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated acute bronchitis is inappropriate. However, clinicians prescribe antimicrobials in over 60% of the 22.5 million acute bronchitis visits in the United States each year. Previous successful interventions have only reduced the antimicrobial prescribing rate to 40% or 50%. It is unknown if the antimicrobial prescribing rate for acute bronchitis can be brought to near zero percent in actual practice while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction. The goal of this study is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrated algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with acute bronchitis with a goal of reducing the antibiotic prescribing rate to near zero percent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Demonstration of Near Zero Antibiotic Prescribing for Acute Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will use a multi-modal implementation - including computerized decision support, reporting tools, and clinician feedback - and quality improvement techniques to ensure adherence to the algorithm and reduce the antimicrobial prescribing rate to near zero percent. The duration of the intervention will be 4 years.</detailed_description>
