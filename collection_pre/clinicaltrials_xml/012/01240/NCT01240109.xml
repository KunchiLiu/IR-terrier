	<brief_title>Effect of Remifentanil on Cough During Emergence From General Anesthesia : Trial to Compare Between Sevoflurane Anesthesia and Propofol Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During recovery from general anesthesia the stimuli of endotracheal tube lead to the coughing, hypertension, tachycardia, which can cause a serious complication. It has been demonstrated that opioid, intravenous or topical lidocaine administration can attenuate the coughing reflex. Administered the opioid before emergence, it is effective to prevent cough reflex but the recovery is delayed, it was difficult to predict emergence. However, remifentanil is an opioid widely used because of rapid context-sensitive half-life, target-controled infusion method to adequately maintain the effect site concentration could help to predict the recovery time to the alert state from the general anesthesia. It is considered proper method of continuous infusion of remifentanil for reducing emergence cough. Recent reporters suggest that antitussive effect of remifentanil differs depend on main anesthetic agents, the incidence of coughing when tracheal extubation is reduced after propofol anesthesia compared with sevoflurane anesthesia. However, these studies raise important questions about failure of maintaining the same effect site concentration of remifentanil in both groups. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of remifentanil on suppression cough reflex during emergence in patient anesthetized using either propofol or sevoflurane additionally under infusion of the identical concentration of remifentanil.
