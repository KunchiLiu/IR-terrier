	<brief_summary>The registry is a multi-center, prospective, observational study designed to collect data in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in the hospital setting in the USA and hyponatremia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in Europe; patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia will be excluded from the registry. The registry is observational in design, and the registry will collect data on patients with a serum sodium ≤130 mmol/L. Data from the patients' chart will be collected throughout the duration of the hospital, from admission to discharge, and the data will be entered into the case report form (CRF) or into an electronic data capture (EDC) system. These patients will be entered into the registry over the duration of 18 months at community, tertiary, and academic medical centers from diverse multiple regions of the USA and Europe. A patient's treatment will be determined by their caregiver and not by this protocol. Thus, the registry will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate how the patients are managed under real-world management conditions.</brief_summary>
