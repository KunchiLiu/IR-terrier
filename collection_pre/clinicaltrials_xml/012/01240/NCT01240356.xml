	<brief_summary>The purpose of CLOTBUST-HF is to determine the safety of a novel, external Hands-Free transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound system in healthy volunteers and ischemic stroke patients. If found to be safe, the widespread use of operator-independent, ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis will allow the planning for a large Phase III efficacy trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CLOTBUST Hands-Free: A Phase I/II Pilot Safety Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound energy to enhance intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis is a promising novel treatment modality for ischemic stroke. Despite encouraging safety data utilizing diagnostic frequencies of transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, lack of widespread availability of trained personnel has limited its application. - The primary specific aim for this pilot phase I/II study is to assess the safety of a novel, external Hands-Free TCD ultrasound system. Safety of the new Hands-Free TCD system will first be assessed in healthy volunteers. Safety in these participants will be determined by detailed neurological and dermatological exams and MRI imaging of the brain. Next, safety of the device will be evaluated in two distinct sets of acute ischemic stroke patients: 0-3 hour patients treated with standard IV rt-PA and 3-6 hour non-lytic, image-selected patients treated with sonolysis (with or without intravenous microbubbles). Among the healthy volunteers the primary measures of safety will be to have no detectable changes in a detailed neurological exam nor any blood- brain barrier (BBB) disruption or changes in permeability. Among both the 0-3 hour and 3-6 hour groups the primary measure of safety will be to not tolerate greater than a 10% rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours. * The primary hypothesis is that replacing conventional TCD ultrasound hand-held TCD technology with a Hands-Free system will be safe in healthy volunteers as well as acute ischemic stroke patients. If the device is found to be safe in either the 0-3 hour or 3-6 hour groups, - the secondary aims for this study will explore the rates of arterial recanalization in the 0-3 hour and/or 3-6 hour groups, favorable outcomes, and clinical recovery. The secondary aims will assess the hypothesis is that Hands-Free TCD will display similar recanalization and early clinical recovery rates compared to available historical diagnostic TCD ultrasound controls exposed to conventional FDA-approved TCD technology. Data generated during this phase I/II trial will evaluate the safety of replacing an operator-dependent TCD device with an operator-independent unit. In turn, this will allow extensive availability of therapeutic ultrasound and improve enrollment into ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis stroke trials.</detailed_description>
