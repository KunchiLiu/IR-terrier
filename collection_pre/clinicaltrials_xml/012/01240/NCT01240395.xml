	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on physical symptoms attributed to chemical exposures, psychological distress, illness worry, quality of life, and illness perceptions in patients suffering from multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). Furthermore, a secondary objective is to evaluate whether a possible symptom reduction is mediated by an increased level of mindfulness. The primary hypothesis is that the self-reported severity of MCS symptoms and the degree to which chemical exposures causes symptoms and the impact on daily life will be significantly improved in the MBCT treatment group as compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
