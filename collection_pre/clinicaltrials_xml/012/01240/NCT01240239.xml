	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate different methods of pre-anesthesia consultation, with the aim of improving the day of surgery experience for the patient. In this study, we will use a telephone consultation, an in-person consultation, and a telemedicine consultation, which involves television cameras and monitors that allow live two-way communication for the pre-anesthesia consultation. The reason for this study is to evaluate the use of telemedicine for the pre-anesthesia consultation. Patients and anesthesiologists have been highly satisfied in previous studies using pre-anesthesia telemedicine consultation. In this study, we will examine a larger group of patients, as previous studies have studied smaller groups of patients.</brief_summary>
