	<brief_summary>MultiStem(r) is a new biological product, manufactured from human stem cells obtained from adult bone marrow or other nonembryonic tissue sources. Factors expressed by MultiStem cells are believed to reduce inflammation and regulate immune system function, protect damaged or injured cells and tissue, promote formation of new blood vessels, and augment tissue repair and healing. MultiStem cell treatment resulted in significant efficacy in a mouse model of Graft versus Host Disease with almost complete reversal of gastrointestinal pathology (similar to pathology that would be expected in Ulcerative Colitis). These data, together with safety data generated in 2 other clinical trials, suggest that MultiStem has the potential to be a new treatment option for patients with ulcerative colitis. This is the first study of MultiStem in this patient population and will cautiously explore the safety/toleration and potential benefit of this new treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must have a documented diagnosis of ulcerative colitis at least 6 months prior to screening. Subjects must have active moderatetosevere ulcerative colitis based on Mayo score. Subjects must have Modified Baron endoscopic score of at least 2 determined within 7 days of first dosing. Subjects must have failed or be intolerant (as determined by the investigator) of at least one of the following treatments for UC: Oral corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine (6MP), or antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, eg, infliximab or adalimumab. Subjects must be on stable steroid doses. Subjects who have abnormal organ and marrow function. Subjects with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis, or clinical findings suggestive of Crohn's disease. Subjects who meet TrueloveWitts criteria for severe ulcerative colitis. Subjects receiving or who are expected to receive Infliximab or other biologic treatment within 8 weeks of the Day 1 study visit. Subjects receiving or who are expected to receive Cyclosporine, mycophenolate, or tacrolimus within 4 weeks of the Day 1 study visit.</criteria>
