	<brief_title>Vasculaire Compression System Increases Flow Velocity in the Femoral Vein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism, e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, occurs in approximately one in 1,000 persons in the United States annually and results in more than 250,000 hospital admissions annually in the United States. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), which prevents stasis in the lower limbs, has been shown to be a safe and effective method of prophylaxis of DVT in studies comparing the incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism with and without IPC. IPC devices decrease venous stasis by augmenting the venous blood flow in the lower extremities. Studies have suggested that an important indicator of the effectiveness of an IPC device in preventing DVT is the peak femoral venous velocity augmentation during the compression phase as compared with the decompression phase of the device. IPC devices produced in the early 1980s and 1990s were cumbersome, noisy and required external power sources, making them suitable only for non-ambulatory patients. Furthermore, these devices have been associated with poor compliance in trauma patients in a hospital setting, and the poor compliance was associated with a higher rate of DVT. The aim of this study is to test the hemodynamic performance of a new portable IPC device, the Venous Health Systems' Vasculaire Compression System. This new device is designed to provide patient comfort and convenience of use while providing similar improvement in venous blood flow when compared with existing IPC devices.</detailed_description>
