	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators are testing the expert system called eVENT. eVENT provides expert advice about the patient's breathing. The investigators have developed and tested a prototype of eVENT and now want to test how it works in practice. To do this the investigators plan to use computer based simulations and test it when used by anesthesiologists in a full size human simulator. If these tests are successful the investigators will then be ready to evaluate eVENT on real patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The development of new sensors or the intelligent synthesis of existing signals (smart sensors) cannot reliably prevent adverse events unless the investigators assimilate the data produced from these devices and provide it to the clinician in a format that is easy to comprehend. The expert system that the investigators are developing will provide intelligent synthesis of data. The clinician focus can then be directed toward the patient rather than continual observation of the monitors. Clinicians need an expert system to augment vigilance and situation awareness, and to aid in decision making to prevent patient harm. The development of an expert system to assist the everyday anesthesiologist in the operating room is a significant challenge that is in urgent need of being addressed. Assistance is required in interpreting the overwhelming stream of physiological data, intelligently extracting key features from these data, and bringing them to the attention of the clinician.</detailed_description>
