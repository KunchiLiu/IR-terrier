Metformin is a peroral drug used worldwide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and also in a few studies on patients with gestational diabetes. The investigators aim is to compare insulin and metformin in the treatment of gestational diabetes. The investigators hypothesis is that there is no difference between insulin and metformin treated mothers in the main outcome criteria (birth weight, neonatal complications).</brief_summary>

Metformin is a peroral drug used worldwide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and also in a few studies on patients with gestational diabetes. The investigators aim is to compare insulin and metformin in the treatment of gestational diabetes.
