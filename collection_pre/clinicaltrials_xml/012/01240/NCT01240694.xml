	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of repeated administration of subcutaneous (sc) CEP 33457 for injection every 4 weeks over 72 weeks (18 doses) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have participated in a previous Cephalon sponsored clinical study of CEP 33457, and completed at least visit 8 (week 24 of that study).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Long-Term Study of the Safety and Tolerability of Repeated Administration of CEP-33457 in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>

	<criteria>The patient has an established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as defined by ACR Classification Revised Criteria. The diagnosis is fulfilled provided that at least 4 criteria are met. The patient previously participated in and completed at least visit 8 (week 24) the Cephalon sponsored clinical study with CEP 33457 (study C33457/2047) and, in the investigator's opinion, would benefit from continued participation in a clinical study. Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing potential, using a medically accepted method of contraception, and must agree to continued use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of study drug treatment. The patient has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure. The patient has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (via Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation). The patient has an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or a total bilirubin level greater than 1.5 times ULN. The patient has a planned immunization with a live or live attenuated vaccine within 3 months prior to administration of the first dose of study drug and for 3 months after administration of the last dose of study drug. The patient has any clinically significant abnormalities on ECG that are not related to SLE, as determined by the investigator. Patients with stable ECG changes without evidence of active cardiovascular disease may participate at the discretion of the investigator and medical monitor. The patient has an ongoing active systemic infection requiring treatment or a history of severe infection, such as hepatitis or pneumonia, in the 3 months prior to administration of the first dose of study drug. Less severe infections in the 3 months prior to administration of the first dose of study drug are permitted at the discretion of the investigator and medical monitor. The patient has any concomitant medical condition unrelated to SLE that may interfere with his or her safety or with evaluation of the study drug, as determined by the investigator. The patient has a history of a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab). The patient has a known positive history of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or HIV disease. The patient has a history of alcohol or substance dependence or abuse (with the exception of nicotine), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSMIVTR), within 3 months of the screening visit for study C33457/2047, or has current substance abuse. The patient has a history of severe allergic reactions to or hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug. The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman. (Any women becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.) The patient has undergone or is undergoing treatment with another investigational drug for the treatment of lupus within 6 months prior to the 1st dose of study drug or has received any other investigational drug for any other condition within 30 days prior to the 1st dose of study drug, except for treatment with CEP33457 or placebo in study C33457/2047. The patient has a known history of antibodies to CEP33457. The patient is unlikely to comply with the study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason, as judged by the investigator or medical monitor.</criteria>
