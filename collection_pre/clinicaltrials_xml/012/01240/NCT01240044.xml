	<brief_summary>This study intend to assess the pain intensity of newborns in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) undergoing different techniques of respiratory therapy and compare these procedures. A randomized controlled clinical trial and blind trial with newborns admitted to NICU. The babies were categorized according to gestational age , age, weight, diagnosis, support and signs of respiratory distress. Then, they were allocated by lot to come from one of 3 groups: G1 - control, G2 - undergoing physical therapy; G3 - received the thoracoabdominal rebalancing. Each newborn received just one physical therapy session in that they were assessed before one of the three procedures (T1), immediately after (T2) and after 15 minutes (T3). This evaluation found cardiorespiratory parameters (oxygen saturation, heart and respiratory rate) and three specific scales for pain assessment (NIPS, NFCS and PIPP). The hypothesis is that newborns hospitalized in intensive care unit did not show pain when undergoing respiratory therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Newborns up to 28 days with any weight and gestational age in ventilatory support or oxygen therapy and clinical indication for Physical Therapy. Newborns with contraindication of respiratory therapy, those that had problems during any of the study procedures and changes in those suffering from respiratory support or oxygen therapy during data collection. If there was failure to collect any of the parameters for evaluating the newborn also was no longer part of the sample.</criteria>
