	<criteria>Histologic proof of breast cancer (invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma). Breast sarcoma and lymphoma are not eligible. Clinical diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIB (T3,N0,M0), Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC, according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TumourNodeMetastasis (TNM) Cancer Staging), including inflammatory breast cancer. Ability to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence of metastatic disease (identified on chest xray, liver ultrasound, bone scan or other imaging tests); Previous chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer; Significant concurrent medical problems that result in the patient being unfit for surgery (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active cardiac disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); Known pregnancy or lactating female (e.g. positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (BhCG) pregnancy test); Inability to lie supine for imaging with Positron Emission Tomography (PET); Any contraindication to undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or PET; Currently receiving Antabuse; Inability to provide informed consent (e.g. dementia or severe cognitive impairment).</criteria>
