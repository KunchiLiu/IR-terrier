	<brief_title>The Clinical Role of Intravenous Glutamine in Trauma Patients Receiving Enteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma Patients are characterized by alteration in the immune response, increased exposure to infectious complications, sepsis, and consequently organ failure and death. Glutamine supplementation to parenteral nutrition is one of the nutritional interventions that have been proven to be associated with improved survival rate, decreased infectious morbidity, costs, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay. However, glutamine supplementation in patients receiving enteral nutrition and its best route are still controversial. A number of trials investigated the beneficial effects of intravenous alanyl-glutamine supplementation in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. However, these trials were: pilot trials, investigated surrogate outcomes, or supplementation was for a short period of time. Therefore, a well designed trial is needed to investigate the effect of intravenous alanyl-glutamine supplementation in critically ill patients with multiple trauma receiving enteral nutrition on major clinical outcomes. Our hypothesis is that trauma patients receiving standard enteral nutrition supplemented with intravenous alanyl-glutamine will demonstrate improved clinical outcomes compared to patients receiving standard enteral nutrition without supplementation.</detailed_description>
