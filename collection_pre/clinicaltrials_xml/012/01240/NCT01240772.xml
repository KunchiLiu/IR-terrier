	<brief_summary>This multicentre RCT aims to compare two surgical treatments of haemorrhoidal disease: doppler-guided arterial ligation with mucopexy (DGALM) and stapled haemorrhoidopexy according to Longo (SH). The hypothesis of the trial is that the DGALM is at a lesser risk and is more cost-effective than SH. With a large number of patients managed in more than 20 centres, we aim to demonstrate that DGALM has a lower morbidity than SH when treating haemorrhoidal disease. At a lower postoperative risk and a lower risk of sequelae, the DGALM would demonstrate to be cost-effective for health care system and attractive for patients.</brief_summary>
