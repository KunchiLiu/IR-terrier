	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new potential treatment for non invasive bladder cancer is safe and if it leads to side effects such as irregular heart rate, agitation, or burning with urination. Patients who have early stage bladder cancer and will be receiving BCG, a bladder cancer therapy as recommended by a doctor, will be asked to participate in a study where they are given the standard BCG followed by the experimental drug, aminophylline. Although we hope this medicine may one day prove to help bladder cancer patients, at the current time we do not know if it has any benefits at all. We have data in mice that suggest that aminophylline slows the growth of tumors when coupled with BCG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of BCG + Aminophylline Toxicity When Used in the Treatment of Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before using the combination of BCG and aminophylline clinically, we need to first determine if aminophylline is safe, when placed directly into the bladder of patients who have bladder cancer. We will give it along with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) - a medication put into the bladder through a catheter tube to treat bladder cancer. We also would like to determine the maximum dose of aminophylline that can be safely given and how the drug is absorbed and used by the body as well as document side effects when aminophylline is given in the bladder. This is a study about aminophylline instilled into the bladder. Aminophylline has not been proven to be safe or a helpful treatment for bladder cancer. It is considered an experimental drug as used in this protocol for bladder cancer. Aminophylline has not been given to anyone who has bladder cancer. Aminophylline is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) to give directly into the bloodstream for the treatment of asthma. We intend to use it at doses much lower than that used for asthma.</detailed_description>
