	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of viral therapy in treating young patients with solid tumors that have come back or that have not responded to standard therapy. Some tumors have cells with a genetic weakness that makes them unable to fight off a virus called wild-type reovirus. The virus causes cells with this weakness to die, and may therefore be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Cyclophosphamide is a drug used in chemotherapy that stops tumor cells from dividing and causes them to die. Giving wild-type reovirus together with cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REOLYSIN (wild-type reovirus) administered as an intravenous infusion daily for 5 days, every 28 days to children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. II. To define and describe the toxicities of Reolysin in these patients. III. To define the toxicity and tolerability of combining Reolysin with oral cyclophosphamide in these patients. IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (time course of viral clearance) of Reolysin in children with refractory cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the antitumor activity of Reolysin within the confines of a phase I study. II. To evaluate the development of neutralizing antibodies to Reolysin following intravenous administration of Reolysin alone and in combination with cyclophosphamide. III. To assess the biologic activity of Reolysin. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of wild-type reovirus. Patients receive wild-type reovirus intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Some patients also receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

16 years of age and Lansky &gt;= 50 for patients =&lt; 16 years of age; patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer chemotherapy and immunizations Must not have received myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea) At least 14 days after the last dose of a longacting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for shortacting growth factor; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair At least 6 weeks since the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines At least 3 halflives of the antibody after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody &gt;= 2 weeks for local palliative radiation therapy (XRT) (small port); &gt;= 24 weeks must have elapsed if prior totalbody irradiation (TBI), craniospinal XRT or if &gt;= 50% radiation of pelvis; &gt;= 6 weeks must have elapsed if other substantial bone marrow (BM) radiation No evidence of active graft vs host disease and &gt;= 12 weeks must have elapsed since stem cell transplant or infusion Patients must not have received any previous viralbased antineoplastic therapies Viral immunizations, including influenza, may not have been administered within 7 days prior to enrollment; Note: patients may not receive any viral immunizations after enrolling on study until 28 days post their last planned REOLYSIN infusion Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/mm^3 Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions within a 7 day period prior to enrollment) Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study but not evaluable for hematologic toxicity (maximum of one per cohort); such patients must meet the blood counts above (may receive transfusions provided they are not be known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusion); if doselimiting hematologic toxicity is observed, all subsequent patients enrolled must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 70 mL/min OR serum creatinine based on age and/or gender as follows: 0.8 mg/dL (3 to &lt; 6 years of age) 1.0 mg/dL (6 to &lt; 10 years of age) 1.2 mg/dL (10 to &lt; 13 years of age) 1.5 mg/dL (male) or 1.4 mg/dL (female) (13 to &lt; 16 years of age) 1.7 mg/dL (male) or 1.4 mg/dL (female) (&gt;= 16 years of age) Bilirubin (sum of conjugated plus unconjugated) =&lt;
