	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 6-month follow-up trial of low (400 IU/day) versus high (4000 IU/day) dose vitamin D supplementation in individuals with pre- and early stage 1 hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. A total of 530 participants (265 participants per treatment arm) will be randomized between 3 sites. Approximately 2,250 participants will be screened between the 3 sites. Vital signs, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinical laboratory safety tests and adverse event assessments will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the two doses of vitamin D on blood pressure. Blood samples will be stored for future biomarker assessments. The total duration of the study is anticipated to be 18 months, assuming a 12 month enrollment period.</brief_summary>
