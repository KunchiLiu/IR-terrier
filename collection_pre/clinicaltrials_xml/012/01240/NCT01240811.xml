	<brief_summary>This pilot study is being performed to investigate the influence that starting contraception with an IUD has on the local immune cell populations and features, with a particular focus on the cells and cell-surface features that are important in HIV transmission (CD4 cells and CCR5 cell receptors). Based on results from large epidemiologic studies there seems to be a consistent finding of slightly increased HIV acquisition in women who use hormonal contraception. It is not clear if this is due to a biological phenomenon or if it relates to a difference in sexual behaviors/risks of women on hormonal contraceptives. The study hypothesis is that CD4 cells and CCR5 HIV-tropic receptor density increases within the upper and lower genital tract of women 2 months after placement of progestin-containing intrauterine devices for contraception as compared with women not using hormonal contraception.</brief_summary>
