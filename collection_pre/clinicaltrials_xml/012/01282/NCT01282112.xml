	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective chart review study (700 charts from 2002 to 2010)of children from 0 to 18 years of age who have undergone Brainstem Evoked Auditory Response (BEAR)testing using midazolam and pentobarbital protocol for moderate sedation. The specific aims of this study are two-fold: 1. to determine the efficacy of intravenous pentobarbital during BEAR testing in the pediatric population using a standardized protocol; and 2. to evaluate the incidence of adverse events (major and minor), paradoxical reaction and failed sedation and identify predictors for failure and adverse events if any.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sedation for Brainstem Evoked Auditory Response (BEAR) Testing Using Intravenous Pentobarbital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sedation Protocol: - Versed: 0.1mg/kg IV - Induction: 2mg/kg IV in children &lt;1 year; 3mg/kg IV in children &gt;1year - Maintenance phase: 1mg/kg IV every 3 to 5 minutes with a maximal dose of 8mg/kg or 200 mg Definition of terms: - Failed Sedation: A case in which a patient is inadequately sedated after receiving maximum required dosages such that the test cannot be completed. - Paradoxical Reaction: Also known as 'pentobarbital rage' is defined as a patient experiencing sustained, inconsolable, and severe irritability or combativeness. This can occur anywhere between 30 minutes after administration of pentobarbital to post recovery phase. - Prolonged Sedation: A case in which either the patient cannot be discharged 3 hours after administration of the last sedating medication. It could also be a case in which patient is not back to baseline in 24 hours. - Hypoxia: This is defined as a sustained decrease in oxygen saturation (&gt;30 seconds) of more than 10% from baseline. - Time to goal sedation: Time in minutes from initial administration of midazolam to the achievement of adequate sedation of the patient/start of procedure. - Time to recovery: time in minutes from the last dose of pentobarbital to recovery of baseline status. - Time to discharge: Time in minutes from administration of midazolam to discharge of patient from recovery room.</detailed_description>
