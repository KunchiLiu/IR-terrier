	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of idelalisib in patients with previously treated indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL) that is refractory both to rituximab and to alkylating-agent-containing chemotherapy. The primary objective will be to assess the overall response rate. Eligible patients will initiate oral therapy with idelalisib at a starting dose of 150 mg taken twice per day. Treatment with idelalisib can continue in compliant patients as long as the study is still ongoing and the patients appear to be benefiting from treatment with acceptable safety.</brief_summary>

History of a nonlymphoma malignancy except for the following: adequately treated local basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, localized prostate cancer, other adequately treated Stage 1 or 2 cancer currently in complete remission, or any other cancer that has been in complete remission for ≥ 5 years Evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (excluding viral upper respiratory tract infections) at the time of initiation of study treatment Pregnancy or breastfeeding Ongoing alcohol or drug addiction Known history of druginduced liver injury, chronic active hepatitis B infection, chronic active hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, ongoing extrahepatic obstruction caused by stones, cirrhosis of the liver, or portal hypertension History of prior allogeneic bone marrow progenitor cell or solid organ transplantation Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Prior therapy with idelalisib Exposure to another investigational drug within 3 weeks prior to start of study treatment. Concurrent participation in another therapeutic treatment trial. Prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical condition, surgical history, physical finding, ECG finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the patient, alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug, or impair the assessment of study results</criteria>
