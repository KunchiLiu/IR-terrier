	<brief_summary>Treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, especially adalimumab, demonstrated an improvement in work productivity in participants with rheumatic diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Limited data was available for the effect of adalimumab treatment on sleep in all three diseases (RA, PsA, and AS) and no data was available for the effect of adalimumab treatment on work productivity in PsA. This long term Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) observational study was conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment with adalimumab on work productivity and sleep disturbance in Greek participants with moderate to severe rheumatic diseases (RA, PsA, and AS).</brief_summary>
