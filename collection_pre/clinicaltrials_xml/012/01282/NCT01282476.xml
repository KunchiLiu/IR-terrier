	<brief_summary>Panobinostat is a drug that may slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by blocking certain enzymes. Panobinostat has shown effects against cancer in laboratory studies. However, it is not known if it will show the same activity in humans. Panobinostat has been given to participants with various types of cancers, including DLBCL, in previous research studies. In this study panobinostat will be given with the the antibody rituximab, which is FDA approved to be given with chemotherapy in DLBCL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panobinostat With Rituximab for Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study treatment will be given in 4 week periods called cycles. Panobinostat will be taken orally on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week. Rituximab will be given as an intravenous infusion weekly during Cycle 1 and then once per month on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Subjects can receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. Blood draws and 2 EKGs will be done weekly in Cycle 1 and then once in each cycle. PET/CT scans will be done every 2 months. If disease has not progressed after 6 cycles on combination of panobinostat and rituximab, subjects may continue on panobinostat alone for up to 6 additional months.</detailed_description>
