	<brief_summary>Dietary fiber (commonly called bulk or roughage) is the edible nondigestible component of carbohydrate and lignin naturally found in plant food; however, bacteria in the lower gut may metabolize part of it. Epidemiological studies have found that fiber intake in the population is below the suggested recommendations. The beneficial effects of the fibers in human health are recognized. The regular intake of dietary fiber has an important role in the intestinal function increasing the intestinal fecal and reducing the transit time along the intestine; collaborates with the LDL-cholesterol plasmatic reduction by increasing fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acids, decreases postprandial glucose in healthy, diabetics and insulin resistant people, reduces the risk for developing certain cancers, promotes satiety, helps with weight loss, and exerts immunomodulatory effect. However, fiber intake may be associated with adverse effects such as flatulence, bloating, cramps, and daily consumption of orange juice to bring digestive problems associated with acidity and heartburn, epigastric burning. Then it becomes of interest to study the tolerance of a new orange juice product fortified with mixed fibers (fructooligosaccharides, resistant dextrin, polydextrose and lactulose).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Digestive Tolerance of Orange Juice With Fibers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monocentric, double blind, randomized, two parallel arms controlled placebo study. 200 healthy women from 18 to 45 years old, without functional digestive disorders or diagnosed digestive disease will take part in the study. The study consists of 21 days consumption of Orange juice. The participants will be randomized in two groups: placebo (Orange juice without fiber - control) and study group (Orange juice fortified with fiber mix). In both groups, the volunteers will be instructed to consume 200ml of juice twice a day (1 pack of 200ml at lunch and one at dinner).</detailed_description>
