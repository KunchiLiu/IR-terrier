	<brief_summary>This multicenter trial will enroll participants with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis who have had disease progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment arms: docetaxel; docetaxel and ramucirumab; or docetaxel and IMC-18F1.</brief_summary>
