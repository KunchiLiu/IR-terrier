	<brief_summary>Research studies show that the type of fat in the diet may affect breast cancer risk. Fish oil and fish contain increased amounts of omega 3 fatty acids which appear to stop or slow down the growth and development of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies of mice and breast cancer cells. The use of omega 3 fatty acids to reduce the risk of breast cancer development in humans has not been adequately studied. Eating fish or taking fish oil may increase the amount of omega 3 in the breast, which may lower one's risk of breast cancer development. Persons in this study with do one of the following: (1) take two capsules daily of omega 3 fatty acid supplements, or (2) eat several servings of canned salmon / tuna per week for a total of three months. Amounts of omega 3 fatty acids in the body's tissues will be measured by blood tests and a small sample of breast fat as obtained by a fine needle aspiration. This study is supported by funding from the National Fisheries Institute, Food Innovation Center of The Ohio State University, and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Fish and Omega 3 Fatty Acids for Breast Cancer Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to: i.) Determine the effects of increased fish consumption on serum and breast fat tissue fatty acids in women at high risk for developing breast cancer relative to an omega 3 fatty acid supplement; ii.) Assess adherence and tolerability of increased dietary intake of fish relative to an omega 3 fatty acid supplement. Secondary objectives include: iii.) Evaluate possible correlations between physical factors such as body mass index (BMI) and dietary factors and target tissue effects. iv.) Explore additional biomarkers as surrogate endpoints to measure effects of fish consumption.</detailed_description>
