	<brief_summary>Ozurdex(TM) has recently been FDA approved for use in macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion. It remains unclear how quickly the drug works and for how long as the initial studies did not have frequent anatomic monitoring. This study will utilize frequent Spectral domain OCT imaging to better understand the onset of treatment effectiveness and duration of action on the anatomic thickness of the retina, in addition to distinguishing structural abnormalities of responders from non-responders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anatomic Outcomes Following Ozurdex Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Focal laser therapy has been the gold standard for the treatment of macular edema secondary to branch vein occlusion (BRVO), though it has not been shown to be effective for central vein occlusion (CRVO). Intravitreal corticosteroids have been shown in many case series to be effective at diminishing macular edema secondary to both BRVO and CRVO. Sustained drug delivery models have been sought after to relieve the need for frequent injections. Ozurdex has recently been found to be effective for the treatment of macular edema following BRVO or CRVO and has been approved by the FDA for these indications. The onset of effectiveness and duration of action on the anatomic thickness of the retina have not yet been demonstrated. In addition, it is uncertain as to when the clinician can label the patient as a responder or nonresponder. We also believe this study will help identify patients that may need more frequent dosing schedules.</detailed_description>
