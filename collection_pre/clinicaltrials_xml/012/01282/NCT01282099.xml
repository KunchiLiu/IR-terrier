	<brief_summary>While near infrared spectroscopy is an exciting technology, scientific rigor is required in order to optimize its appropriate use in the clinical arena. This study will explore the feasibility and clinical applicability of data obtained from the NIRS device. The ability to noninvasively monitor peripheral perfusion remains an area of intense research. The most widely used method is pulse oximetry. The international mandate of its use in operating rooms in the early 1990s after the publication of the Harvard minimum standards for monitoring speaks to its unquestionable utility. Its pervasive application notwithstanding, pulse oximetry merely provides a calibrated ratio of arterial and venous hemoglobin saturation. While this data is valuable, time-tested, and even may hold the promise of accurately noninvasively trending cardiac output, cellular dysmetabolism -- hallmarks of vulnerable, yet viable tissue beds -- are beyond the predictive values of currently available devices.</brief_summary>
