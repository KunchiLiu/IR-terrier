	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical study is to verify hair count reduction, associated comfort/discomfort and treatment time using the LightSheer Duet System with the High Speed (HS) handpieces for temporary hair removal and permanent hair reduction. It is anticipated that the larger treatment size of the HS handpiece will result in faster treatment of larger areas; and that the lower energy levels will result in greater comfort.</brief_summary>
