	<brief_summary>Non-invasive brain stimulation can increase cortical excitability in the visual system, but it is not known if this is of clinical value. The investigators now assessed if repetitive, transcranial alternating current stimulation (rtACS) can improve visual field size in patients with optic nerve damage. The investigators hypothesized that rtACS would improve visual functions with the defective visual field sectors of the visual field (primary outcome measure).</brief_summary>
