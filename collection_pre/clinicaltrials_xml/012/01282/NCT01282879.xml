	<brief_summary>Antifungal prophylaxis should be used in patients being treated with glucocorticoids for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Although fluconazole has been widely used as an antifungal prophylactic agent after allogeneic HSCT, fluconazole prophlaxis only shows a limited protective role against IFIs, is not effective against invasive aspergillosis. In addition, NCCN guideline of the prevention and treatment of cancer-related infections recommends antifungal prophylaxis in patients with significant GVHD until resolution of GVHD using Posaconazole, Voriconazole, Echinocandin, or Amphotericin B. However, under the National Health Insurance System, none of the drug can be given prophylactically except itraconazole oral solution against IFIs. Itraconazole oral solution shows excellent bioavailability and good efficacy against aspergillus and fluconazole resistant candida infection.Based on these findings, we will perform prospective multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety and long-term outcomes of itraconazole oral solution prophylaxis against IFIs in patients treated with systemic corticosteroids for GVHD after allogeneic HSCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Antifungal Prophylaxis on Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients who provided an informed consent form will be administered itraconazole oral solution (200mg bid initially, swash and swallow) in either an in patient or outpatient setting. Treatment can be initiated at the same time of or within 10 days after starting systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Itraconazole oral solution dose can be adjusted according to the liver function test: 1) in case of - AST/ALT level 5-10 times UNL or bilirubin/ALP level 2-5 times UNL, itraconazole dose can be reduced to half (i.e. itraconazole 200mg po once daily or 100mg bid); 2) in case of - AST/ALT level &gt; 10 times UNL or bilirubin/ALP level &gt; 5 times UNL, itraconazole can be stopped. GVHD treatment can be given per center's policy: With respect to acute GVHD, prednisone (1-2mg/Kg/day) oral or iv can be given on top of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) GVHD prophylaxis. For chronic GVHD, various type of frontline regimen can be permitted including CNI+prednisone (PD), PD alone, CNI+PD+mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or MMF+PD. Various dose of PD will be accepted if it is at least from 0.5mg/Kg/day. For example, at SMC, in case of mild grade cGVHD with high risk feature, or of moderate grade cGVHD, CNI plus PD, 0.5mg/kg/day can be given initially. In case of severe grade cGVHD, CNI plus PD, 1.0mg/Kg/day will be given. Itraconazole will be maintained until PD is tapered to 10mg/day in case of PD alone therapy group, or until PD is stopped in case of CNI+PD or CNI+PD+MMF or MMF+PD group, etc. In addition, patients will receive itraconazole oral suspension until: 1) Development of proven or probable IFIs, 2) Severe toxicity (such as liver function abnormality - AST/ALT level &gt; 10 times UNL or bilirubin/ALP level &gt; 5 times UNL, 3) Worsening GVHD that requires second line therapy for steroid refractory GVHD (in this situation, investigator could stop itraconazole oral solution if there is a potential drug interaction between itraconazole oral solution and 2nd line GVHD drug or prolonged use of itraconazole oral solution could be hazardous to the patient), 4) Need to switch antifungal agent for the treatment of prolonged febrile episode related to systemic infection, thus requiring systemic antifungal treatment, 6) Withdrawal from study participation (patient's decision), or 7) Death.</detailed_description>
