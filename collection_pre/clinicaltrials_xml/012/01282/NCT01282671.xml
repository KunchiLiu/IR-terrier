	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Deep breathing exercises performed during the first two months after cardiac surgery, will improve pulmonary function and patient-perceived quality of recovery. Specific aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of breathing exercises performed with a mechanical device for positive expiratory pressure during the first two months after cardiac surgery compared to a control group performing no breathing exercises. Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled two-center study.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Respiratory Aspiration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>A sample of 360 adults (&gt;18 years) patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the two University hospitals are invited to participate in the study. Type of cardiac surgery included will be Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with saphenous vein grafts and/or internal mammary artery graft, valve surgery or combinations of CABG and valve surgery. Patients who have an emergency operation, previous cardiac or lung surgery, renal dysfunction requiring dialysis or are unable to communicate in Swedish will not be included. Patients who requires more than 24 hours respirator treatment, reintubation, reoperation, sternum instability/infection or develop a neurological, mental or haemodynamic complication that affects the patients' ability to collaborate, will be excluded.</criteria>
