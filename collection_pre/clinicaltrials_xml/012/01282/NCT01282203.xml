	<brief_summary>The main objective of this post-marketing observational study is to collect data from the use of general anesthesia in patients undergoing any surgery to create local recommendations. These data will be based on the evaluation of volatile induction and maintenance anesthesia (VIMA) with SevoraneÂ® (sevoflurane) in adult patients requiring general anesthesia for surgery in terms of quality of anesthesia and its influence on cardiovascular system in common clinical practice in Kazakhstan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Volatile Induction and Maintenance Anesthesia (VIMA) With Sevorane in Adult Patients Required General Anesthesia for Surgery in Terms of Quality of Anesthesia and Its Influence on Cardiovascular System in Common Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This post-marketing observational study will be conducted in a prospective, multi-centre format. It is a non-interventional, observational study in which Sevorane is prescribed for adult patients undergoing general surgery for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization. Sevorane is used for induction and maintenance anesthesia by the choice of anesthesiologist. No additional procedures (other than standard of care) shall be applied to the patients. Each patient will be observed from the start of anesthesia through anesthesia end. Markers of myocardial ischemia will be detected up to the first 24 hours after anesthesia (if available). Additionally the correlation between the experience and training background of anesthesiologists and patient related outcomes of general anesthesia with Sevorane as a single anesthetic will be assessed.</detailed_description>
