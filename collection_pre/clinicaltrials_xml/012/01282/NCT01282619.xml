	<brief_title>Study of Huperzine A Sustained-Release Tablets in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled therapeutic trial is to determine whether treatment with huperzine A sustained-release tablets can improve cognitive function in individuals with AD. A total of 390 participants will be randomly assigned to three groups of equal size. This will allow a comparison of huperzine A sustained-release tablets 400µg once a day, huperzine A tablets 200µg twice a day, and placebo. The study is divided into 2 periods: 1. A two-week placebo run-in period 2. A 6-month double blind treatment period, consisting of three months of titration and three months of fixed dose treatment.</detailed_description>
