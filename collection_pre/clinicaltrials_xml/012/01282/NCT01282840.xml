	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) affects around 17 % of female population. However, the etiology of OAB is complicated and unclear in many aspects. Bladder wall thickness had been reported to be strongly associated with OAB, but its use as a screening tool remains controversial. Besides, few studies reported patterns of sexual dysfunction in female patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Therefore the aims of our study were to analyze the bladder wall blood perfusion pattern in female LUTS patients, the association of between the bladder wall blood perfusion pattern and the efficacy of anti-muscarinic treatment for female OAB, and the patterns of sexual dysfunction in the female LUTS patients.</brief_summary>
