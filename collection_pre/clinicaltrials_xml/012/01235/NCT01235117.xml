	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of azacitidine and to see how well it works in treating patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the safety and tolerability of azacitidine in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). - To assess the overall response rate in these patients. Secondary - To assess the incidence of clinical remission/complete remission or partial response in these patients. - To assess hematological improvement in patients treated with this drug. - To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - To assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. - To assess the time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation of CMML. - To assess the time to death or AML transformation of CMML. - To assess the biological correlates. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-5 and 8-9. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of loss of response/disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo response evaluation after 6 courses or the last course of treatment. Responders may continue azacitidine until loss of response/disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients undergo blood, bone marrow, and buccal swab sample collection periodically for correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
