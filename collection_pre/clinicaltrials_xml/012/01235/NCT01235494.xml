	<brief_summary>To develop techniques with MRI of Helium-3 gas to give functional images of the lungs. The goal is to test a single breath-hold functional 3-He MRI pulse sequence with sensitivity to multiple functional aspects of the luncg physiology. A group of 20 healthy volunteers willbe recruited from the local research group and the results compared with existing methods that require seperate breath-holds of 3He gas</brief_summary>
