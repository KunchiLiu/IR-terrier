	<brief_title>Fish Oil Supplementation in Late-life Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with late-life depression were reported cognitive impairment, especially in information-processing speed, working memory, attention and episodic memory, even after depressive symptoms subside and some of them further progress to dementia in two to four years. Several epidemiological studies, fatty acid comparison studies, animal studies, and clinical trials found that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were significantly associated with the major depression, cognitive decline in general population and Alzheimer's disease. Until now, there is no study investigating the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms and cognition in patients with late-life depression. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate whether fish oil supplementation, compared to placebo (olive oil), could have better effects on depression course and cognitive function in older people with major depression.</detailed_description>
