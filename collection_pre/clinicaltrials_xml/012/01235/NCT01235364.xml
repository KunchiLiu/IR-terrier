	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess pain in women randomised to digital or speculum placement of a Foley catheter. Pain during cervical ripening with the Foley catheter is also to be evaluated as well as maternal satisfaction with induction of labour.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Pain With Insertion of the Foley Catheter for Induction of Labour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most common method described for placing the Foley catheter is under direct visualisation of the cervix during a sterile speculum examination. Another method is to place the catheter during a digital cervical examination. Maternal discomfort/pain during speculum placement of the catheter has been evaluated in a few studies whereas studies that compare the digital method with the speculum method of placement are lacking. The visual analogue scale is used to subjectively assess pain. With a skin conductance algesimeter an objective assessment of pain is possible.</detailed_description>
