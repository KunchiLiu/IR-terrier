	<brief_title>Multi_center Study to Evaluate the Effect of N-3 Fatty Acids (OMEGA-3) on Arrhythmia Recurrence in Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most common arrhythmia of clinical importance. The prevalence of AF in the general population has been estimated to be just below 1%, or 300,000 Canadians, and rising. Current strategies in AF to preserve normal sinus rhythm include pharmacological therapy with agents that demonstrate intermediate efficacy and significant adverse effects. Newer non-pharmacological strategies such as pulmonary vein ablation are suitable for only a minority of patients and are an expensive method of treatment. As a result, simple, safe, inexpensive and effective strategies to treat AF and preserve sinus rhythm are required given the great health and financial burden that this condition represents to our society. Omega-3 or "n-3" polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 fatty acids) represent a novel approach to the prevention and treatment of AF. N-3 fatty acids have known anti-arrhythmic properties and are associated with a lower risk of sudden (arrhythmic) death. Additionally, n-3 fatty acids have significant anti-inflammatory properties and potential anti-oxidant effects. Higher consumption of non-fried fish was recently shown to confer a lower incidence of new onset AF in elderly adults. N-3 fatty acids might therefore represent a useful strategy for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF, given their potential to act on several mechanisms simultaneously. We seek to test this hypothesis in the current clinical trial proposal.</detailed_description>
