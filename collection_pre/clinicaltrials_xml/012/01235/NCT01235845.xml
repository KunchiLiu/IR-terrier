	<brief_summary>Malignant gliomas are very aggressive and among the most common of brain tumors. A diagnosis carries with it a median survival of approximately 12 months, with 90 - 95% of patients surviving less than 2 years. The current standard treatment of surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy has not substantially prolonged survival. Dendritic cells (DCs) are immune cells that form part of the mammalian immune system. Their main function is to process antigen material and present it on the surface to other cells of the immune system, thus functioning as antigen-presenting cells.In the present study, DCs were used for antigen presentation of glioma antigens to directly induce a cytotoxic T-cell response. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK)cells are shown to be a heterogeneous population, and the major population expresses both the T cell marker CD3 and the NK cell marker CD56, and is termed NKT cells, which has shown significant anti-tumor activity in both clinical trials and animal studies. Furthermore, CIK cells are able to expand significantly when they are cultured with DCs, and the CIK cells activated by DCs stimulation (DCIKs)have a characteristic which cytotoxic activity enhanced and show increased anti-tumor activity. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of DCIK cells treatment combined with DCs following tumor resection and radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma.</brief_summary>
