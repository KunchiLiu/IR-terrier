	<brief_summary>Identify new genes responsible for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), one of the most common causes of hereditary diseases of the retina, and thus better understand the mechanisms involved of the disease."</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa: Prevalence of Known Genes Identification of New Loci / Genes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred and fifty samples from unrelated patients, from which 150 were provided by the national reference center of rare disease in Montpellier and 100 recruited in the 9 participating centers over a period of two years."To identify the missing genes, we proceed in two steps. A first step in selecting families negative for the 8 major genes genes, by systematic sequencing of exons most frequently involved. A second step in finding new loci / genes by locus exclusion using microsatellite markers and SNP genotyping.</detailed_description>
