	<brief_title>GlideScope Versus Direct Laryngoscope for Emergency Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On admission to the emergency department following traumatic injury, many patients require placement of an artificial airway to support their breathing, provide oxygen and protect their airway. This procedure is accomplished through a number of different techniques and few studies have compared these techniques in order to establish the best method. We will compare an older technique using a metal handle and blade that allows for direct visualization of the vocal cords (direct laryngoscopy) to a newer technique that employs a fiberoptic bundle imbedded in a handle that allows indirect visualization of the vocal cords during placement of the artificial airway. The newer technique has the theoretical advantage of being more useful in patients with abnormal airways which are frequently encountered in trauma patients. Since both techniques are currently employed routinely in our institution, we will randomize all trauma admission to have an initial attempt with one of the two techniques in order to perform a randomized, unblinded trial.</detailed_description>
