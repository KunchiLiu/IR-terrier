	<brief_summary>Following screening, eligible subjects will be enrolled into a 6‑week Low Calorie Diet (LCD) lead-in period. Subjects who lose at least 2% of their body weight at the end of the 6-week LCD lead-in period will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (pramlintide+metreleptin or placebo) to begin a 16-week treatment period during which the effect on body weight of treatment with pramlintide+metreleptin will be compared to placebo. Following the 16 week blinded core treatment period, subjects will discontinue study medication for a period of 12 weeks. Following the 12 week off-drug follow-up period, subjects in both groups will initiate a 12 week open-label treatment period with Pramlintide+Metreleptin. During the 12 week off-drug and 12 week open label treatment periods, subjects will continue to participate in a Lifestyle Intervention (LSI) program.</brief_summary>
