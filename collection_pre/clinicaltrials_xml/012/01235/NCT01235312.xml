	<brief_summary>Currently, dorsal hand rejuvenation is an upcoming issue as patients seek plastic surgeons to address this highly visible area, although no specific statistics concerning the number of patients undergoing dorsal hand rejuvenation have been published yet. The solitary use of fillers, fat, sclerotherapy, skin excision, resurfacing and combinations of the above mentioned therapies have been reported in the literature, but still there is a lack of scientific literature about functional microcirculation of the dorsum of the hand. Furthermore, there is a lack of scientific data about functional microcirculation of the plantar foot in healthy subjects compared to patients suffering from Diabetes mellitus or peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Consequently, the aim of this study is the evaluation of the functional microcirculation of hands and feet in healthy subjects as well as patients suffering from the above mentioned diseases.</brief_summary>
