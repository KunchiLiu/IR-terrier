	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of powered intraosseous vascular access (EZ-IO by Vidacare) in the emergency department for patients requiring urgent vascular access. Data collected will be compared to historical data on central venous catheter use in the emergency department. The primary hypothesis is that powered intraosseous vascular access will decrease the amount of time needed to obtain vascular access.</brief_summary>
