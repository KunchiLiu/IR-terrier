	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is common among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Peoples. Diabetes related complications decrease quality of life and can result in early morbidity. The purpose of the Partners in Care diabetes self-management educational intervention is to teach participants how to manage their diabetes to avoid or delay diabetes-related complications and how to better work with their health care team.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partners in Care Diabetes Self-management Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a feasibility study using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in which 100 Native Hawaiians (NHs) and other Pacific Islanders (PPs) will be randomized to either a 3-month diabetes self-management group (DSMG; N=50) or a delayed intervention control group (CG; N=50). Participants in the DSMG will receive culturally-tailored, group diabetes self-management education delivered in a community setting by trained community peer educators. To meet this objective, we have partnered with four community-based organizations: 1) Hawai`i Maoli Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs, 2) Ke Ola Mamo Native Hawaiian Health Care System, 3) Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services, and 4) Kula No NƒÅ Po`e Hawai`i. These four organizations provide services to a large number of Pacific People to include, but not limited to, Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Filipinos, and Chuukese. They already have intervention research experience as members of the PILI 'Ohana CBPR Project. The 3-month face-to-face intervention will be community-based and community-led by trained community peer educators from these four partnering community organizations. Individuals with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; average blood sugar levels) &gt;=8% will be recruited for the study because they represent the most at-risk for diabetes-related complications. Over a 1-year accrual period, the community partners will recruit and enroll 100 eligible NHs and PPs (25 participants per a participating community), as well as deliver and evaluate the intervention in their respective community settings. The primary outcomes of our study are hemoglobin A1c and self-reported diabetes specific quality of life. Secondary outcomes are cholesterol levels (including HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides), blood pressure, body mass index, and psychosocial adaptation.</detailed_description>
