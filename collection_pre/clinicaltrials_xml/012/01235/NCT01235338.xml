	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effects of co-administration of SPD489 and the antidepressant EFFEXOR XR on the pharmacokinetics of lisdexamfetamine, d-amphetamine, and EFFEXOR XR. In addition, serial blood pressure and pulse measures will be obtained and examined to ensure that there are no unexpected changes in vital signs following co administration of SPD489 and EFFEXOR XR that would impact the further study of this drug combination. The hypothesis is that a drug drug interaction could possibly exist.</brief_summary>
