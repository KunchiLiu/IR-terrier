	<brief_summary>The Cesarean Section Optimal Antibiotic Prophylaxis (C/SOAP) study is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of azithromycin-based extended-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis (azithromycin plus standard narrow-spectrum cephalosporin) relative to standard single-agent cephalosporin (preferably prior to surgical incision) to prevent post-cesarean infection. Hypothesis: Compared to narrow-spectrum prophylaxis (i.e. cefazolin alone, or clindamycin if cephalosporin allergy) prior to surgical incision, the addition of extended-spectrum prophylaxis (azithromycin + cefazolin) reduces the incidence of post-cesarean infection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pregnant Women aged 14 years and over at ≥ 24 weeks' viable gestation who will undergo unscheduled/nonelective cesareans with either: 1. Labor (spontaneous or induced): active labor (ongoing contractions and at least 4cm dilated or contractions for at least 4 hours with documented cervical change of ≥1cm dilatation or ≥50% effacement), or 2. Membrane rupture (standardized to duration of at least 4 hours prior to randomization). Patient unwilling or unable to provide consent Multiple pregnancy Known azithromycin (or other macrolide) allergy Vaginal delivery Elective or scheduled cesarean prior to labor or membrane rupture. Azithromycin, erythromycin or other macrolide antibiotic use within 7 days of enrollment. Clinical chorioamnionitis or any other active bacterial infection (e.g. pyelonephritis, pneumonia, abscess) at time of randomization. Patient is unable or unlikely to followup after delivery (e.g. no prenatal care or a nonresident patient) Fetal demise or major congenital anomaly Significant liver disease defined as known cirrhosis or elevated transaminases of at least 3fold upper limit of normal Significant renal disease defined as serum creatinine known to be &gt;2.0 mg/dl or on dialysis. Active congestive heart failure (EF&lt;45%) or pulmonary edema Active diarrhea at time of delivery Any patient with significant electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia or hypocalcemia Any patient with structural heart disease or arrhythmias, or taking any medications known to prolong the QT interval Patient currently being treated with efavirenz, nelfinavir or fluconazole</criteria>
