	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin K Supplementation on Bone Health in Adult Crohn's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the impact of 12 months of vitamin K1 supplementation (plus vitamin D and calcium supplementation to avoid deficiency of these problematic nutrients) at a level which leads to dramatically (i.e greater than 70%) reduced levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin - a functional marker of vitamin K status, on vitamin K status, the rate of bone formation and bone resorption, using biochemical markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density in adult patients with longstanding Crohn's disease.</detailed_description>
