	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study of a method to compare common, FDA-approved drugs in a clinic. Instead of putting single patients into one of two drug groups, the investigators will assign the doctors who prescribe these drugs for high blood pressure into two groups. One group of doctors has agreed to prescribe mostly ("favor") one drug, chlorthalidone, if that drug would be a good choice for a patient. The other group has agreed to prescribe mostly hydrochlorothiazide. For both groups, they will try to use the doses that were shown to be protective in other trials. If the doctors mostly prescribe the drug they agreed to favor, the investigators will be able to compare outcomes, like heart attacks, in the two groups.</brief_summary>
