	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Image Verified Early Response to Certolizumab Pegol in Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To identify the efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) on synovitis in dynamic MRI parameters; to make the correlation between European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), American College of Rheumatology (ACR)p, Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS 28) responses, and Digital XRay (DXR) assessment with reduction of synovitis.</detailed_description>
