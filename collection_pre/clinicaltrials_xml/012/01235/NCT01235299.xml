	<brief_summary>In case of free flap failure, time is of utmost importance as salvage rates have been reported to be inversely related to the time interval between the onset of ischemia and its clinical recognition. Consecutively, monitoring of free flaps remains of major importance. Currently, combined Laser-Doppler and Spectrophotometry is available to determine microcirculation of free flaps in reconstructive surgery as a scientific method of reliable assessment of flap perfusion. The investigators thought to analyze the correlation of free flap skin temperature and free frap microcirculation as an accurate tool of postoperative flap monitoring.</brief_summary>
