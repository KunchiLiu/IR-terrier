	<brief_summary>The aim of the current study is to determine whether ibuprofen, given as immediate or delayed prophylactic antipyretic treatment in a standardized manner, significantly impacts the immune response in children receiving primary vaccination with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, co-administered with DTPa-combined vaccines, at 3, 4 and 5 months of age. In addition, this study will further evaluate the impact of prophylactic administration of paracetamol following primary vaccination with immediate or delayed administration or when given in an immediate manner at the time of the booster dose.</brief_summary>
