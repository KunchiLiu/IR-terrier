	<mesh_term>Carcinoma, Renal Cell</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Signed written informed consent Diagnosis of RCC with clearcell or predominant clearcell histology Subjects with nonmetastatic disease (M0) fulfilling any of the following combinations of pathologic staging based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging version 2010 and Fuhrman nuclear grading. pT2, G3 or G4, N0; or, pT3, G any, N0; or, pT4, G any, N0; or, pT any, G any, N1 Fulfill all of the following criteria of diseasefree status at baseline: Had complete gross surgical resection of all RCC via radical or partial nephrectomy using either open or laparoscopic technique. Baseline imaging of chest, abdomen and pelvis shows no metastasis or residual tumor lesions as confirmed centrally by an independent radiologist. Received no prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for RCC Recovered from nephrectomy: any surgery related toxicities should be reduced to ≤ grade 1 per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (Version 4) Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) of ≥ 80 Adequate organ system function History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have had another malignancy and have been diseasefree for 5 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding including, but not limited to: Active peptic ulcer disease Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), or other gastrointestinal conditions with increased risk of perforation History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment Active diarrhea of any grade Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect absorption of investigational product including, but not limited to: Malabsorption syndrome Major resection of the stomach or small bowel History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection History of active hepatitis Presence of uncontrolled infection. History of any one or more of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months: Cardiac angioplasty or stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease History of Class III or IV congestive heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association Classification of Congestive Heart Failure History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack (TIA), pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 milliseconds (msec) Poorly controlled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 90mmHg. Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. Blood pressure (BP) must be reassessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 1 hour; on each of these occasions, the mean (of 3 readings) SBP / DBP values from each BP assessment must be &lt;140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study (see Section 7.6.2 for instruction on blood pressure measurement and obtaining mean blood pressure values). Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other condition that could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications for at least 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study treatment and for the duration of the study. Concurrent therapy given to treat cancer including treatment with an investigational agent or concurrent participation in another clinical trial involving anticancer investigational drug. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of study treatment. Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to pazopanib or excipients that in the opinion of the investigator contraindicates their participation. Prior or current use of systemic antiVEGF inhibitors, cytokines (e.g. interferon, interleukin 2).</criteria>
