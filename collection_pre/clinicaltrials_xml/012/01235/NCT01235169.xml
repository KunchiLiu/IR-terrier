	<brief_summary>This is an open multicenter study, evaluating a new operative technique in femur neck fractures. The treatment consist of augmentated nails in cases of subtrochanteric or inter fracture due to osteoporosis.There two routine surgical techniques in femoral neck fractures: 1. Insertion an intramedullary nail (without augmentation) to the bone. 2. insertion a nail and metal plateto the bone. The major disadvantage of these methods is the relative high rate (4-10 precentages) of failure because of the femur head bone which is very brittle and osteoporotic. This new approach enables the nail a better grip as a result of the cement augmentation which consists of PMMA (Polymethyl methacrylate). The investigators main goal is to evaluate the use of this surgical technique</brief_summary>
