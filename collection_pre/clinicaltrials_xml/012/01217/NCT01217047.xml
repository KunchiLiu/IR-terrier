	<brief_title>Study on Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Cycling Following Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FES cycling is a method of applying low level electrical currents to the leg and buttock muscles to cause the weakened or paralyzed muscles to contract and produce a cycling motion of the legs. The FES cycling in this study will be done through a device called the RT300-SL Cycle Ergometer. Although this device has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by individuals with spinal cord injury, we are trying to find out the best way to use it in order to obtain the greatest benefits in an attempt to improve functional recovery.</detailed_description>
