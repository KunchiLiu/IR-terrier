	<brief_summary>The purpose of Phase 1 of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral ixazomib administered in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). The purpose of Phase 2 of this study was to determine the overall response rate (ORR) and further evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of the combination of oral ixazomib, lenalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone in patients with NDMM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Ixazomib Administered in Combination With Lenalidomide and Low-Dose Dexamethasone in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib was being tested to treat people who had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had not previously received systemic treatment. This study was conducted in two Phases. Phase 1 looked at side effects and lab results in people who took ixazomib to determine the MTD and RP2D. Phase 2 looked at overall response rates and side effects in people who took ixazomib. The study enrolled 15 patients in Phase 1 and 50 patients in Phase 2. Participants in Phase 1 were assigned to cohorts and received ixazomib 1.68, 2.23, 2.97, or 3.95 mg/m^2 in addition to dexamethasone 40 mg and lenalidomide 25 mg. Participants in Phase 2 received ixazomib 4.0 mg fixed dose in addition to dexamethasone 40 mg and lenalidomide 25 mg. In both Phases study treatment was administered in 28-day Cycles as follows: ixazomib Days 1, 8 and 15, dexamethasone Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, and lenalidomide 25 mg Days 1 through 21. This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 12, 28-day cycles with the option to continue into a maintenance portion in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and a final visit 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
