	<brief_summary>A study in which intraocular pressure (IOP) will be monitored over 24 hours using the SENSIMED Triggerfish® device and Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) in primary open angle glaucoma patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the comparability of diurnal IOP patterns emerging from SENSIMED Triggerfish and GAT.</brief_summary>
