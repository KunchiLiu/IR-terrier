	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent obtained before any trialrelated activities 2. Progressive disease or relapse of multiple myeloma (according to the IMWG definition) after one or two prior therapeutic treatments or regimens for multiple myeloma that achieved a response duration of at least 6 months 3. Prior therapeutic treatment regimens may have included Thalidomide and Lenalidomide. Regarding patients previously treated by Lenalidomide, only patients who achieved at least Partial Response duration of at least 6 months can be included. The patient must not have discontinued treatment due to Lenalidomide intolerance. 4. Measurable disease, as indicated by one or more of the following: Serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5 g/dL If Serum Protein Electrophoresis is felt to be unreliable for routine Mprotein measurement (particularly for patients with IgA MM), then quantitative immunoglobulin levels can be accepted). Urine BenceJones protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h Involved serum Free Light Chains (sFLC) level ≥ 10 mg/dl ( ≥ 100 mg/l) provided sFLC ratio is abnormal (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65) 5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 6. Clinical laboratory values at screening Calculated creatinine clearance (according to MDRD) &gt; 60 ml/min Platelet ≥ 75 x 109 /l for patients with &lt; 50% BM plasma cells, and ≥ 30 x 109 /l for patients with &gt; 50% BM plasma cells ANC &gt; 1 x 109 /l Bilirubin levels &lt; 1.5 ULN ; ALT and AST &lt; 3 ULN (grade 1 NCI) 7. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of prescribing Lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking Lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy 8. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®. 1. Age &lt; 18 years or &gt; 80 years 2. Non secreting multiple myeloma or non measurable disease (&lt; 0.5 g /dL MProtein in serum or &lt; 200 mg urinary Mprotein / 24 h or &lt;10 mg/dl involved sFLC) 3. Lifethreatening conditions related or not to MM relapse 4. Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking Lenalidomide) 5. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or IMiD®. 6. Use of any investigational agent within the last month 7. Treatment by systemic corticosteroids (except inhaled corticosteroids) or chemotherapy (including consolidation and maintenance) within the last month (use of biphosphonates is permitted) 8. Radiotherapy within the last month 9. Primary or associated amyloidosis 10. Peripheral neuropathy of grade ≥ 3 according to the CTCAE of the NCI 11. Abnormal cardiac status with any of the following NYHA stage III or IV congestive heart failure myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months cardiac arrhythmia remaining symptomatic despite treatment 12. Current active infectious disease or positive serology for HIV, HCV or positive Hbs Antigen 13. History of or current autoimmune disease 14. History of other active malignancy within the past 5 years (apart from basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervix carcinoma) 15. Serious concurrent uncontrolled medical disorder 16. History of allograft or solid organ transplantation 17. Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule 18. Inability to comply with an antithrombotic regimen</criteria>
