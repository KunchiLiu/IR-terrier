	<brief_summary>Periodontal disease is a bacterially-induced inflammation. As such, it can become a point of entry of bacteria, toxins and cytokines into the systemic blood circulation, thus adversely affecting the function of kidneys. This is turn can aggravate the condition of patients with CKD. The study hypothesis is that periodontal therapy can improve renal function in patients with CKD and lower the blood levels of markers for systemic inflammation.</brief_summary>
