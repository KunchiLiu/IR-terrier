	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - Demonstrate that sarilumab (SAR153191/REGN88) on top of methotrexate [MTX] is superior in efficacy to placebo for the relief of signs and symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis [RA], in patients with active RA who have failed up to 2 Tumor Necrosis Factor α [TNF-α] antagonists. Secondary Objectives: - Assess the safety of sarilumab; - Document the pharmacokinetic profile of sarilumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of SAR153191 (REGN88) With Methotrexate in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Failed TNF-α Blockers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study period for each participant was approximately 22 weeks; including up to 4 weeks screening period, 12-week double-blind treatment period and 6-week safety follow-up period. Participants who completed the 12-week treatment period were offered enrollment in a separate long-term extension study (LTS11210/NCT01146652).</detailed_description>
