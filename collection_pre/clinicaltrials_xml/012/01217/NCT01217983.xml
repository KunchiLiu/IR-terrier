	<brief_summary>Evaluation of kidney function is critical in cirrhotic patients as there is a clear relationship between renal failure and prognosis. The investigators hypothesized that in this population new biomarkers of renal function could help in early detection of acute renal failure and in discrimination between renal and pre-renal causes. Finally the investigators hypothesized that such biomarkers could predict short-term outcome in this population.</brief_summary>
