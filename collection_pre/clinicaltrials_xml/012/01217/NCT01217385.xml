	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New imaging procedures, such as diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging, may help measure a patient's response and allow doctors to plan better treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging in monitoring and predicting response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy before surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging in Monitoring and Predicting Response in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether the percentage change in the diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging (DOSI) measurement of the tumor/normal (T/N) tissue optical index (TOI) from baseline to mid-therapy is predictive of the final pathologic response of the primary tumor in patients with locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary - To investigate whether change of TOI measurements from baseline to post-therapy are predictive of the final pathologic response in these patients treated with this regimen. - To investigate whether baseline TOI measurements are associated with final pathologic response in patients treated with this regimen. - To investigate whether TOI measurements at baseline, change from baseline to mid-therapy, and change from baseline to post-therapy correlate with available MRI volumetric imaging measurements. - To investigate whether changes on TOI measurements from baseline to mid-therapy, and from baseline to post-therapy, correlate with other standard-of-care imaging and/or any MRI-imaging measurements. - To explore whether additional optical endpoints and indices obtained during DOSI measurements can be used to predict final pathologic response in patients treated with this regimen. - To determine a cutpoint for the percent change of TOI from baseline to mid-therapy that is predictive of pathological complete response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging (DOSI) at baseline, 5-10 days after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, during early- and mid-neoadjuvant therapy, and within 21 days after completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Results are compared to standard-of-care imaging (e.g., MRI, ultrasound, mammography). Patients then undergo surgery.</detailed_description>
