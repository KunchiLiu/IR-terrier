	<brief_summary>Part of the problems related with proper use of epinephrine autoinjector may be related with the design of the autoinjector itself.The aim of the study is to investigate whether minor modifications in the design of currently available epinephrine autoinjector ease its use and abrogate common use errors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Make up for the Epinephrine Autoinjector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All interns except the ones who previously worked in allergy department in a medical school were invited to the study. Two identical epinephrine autoinjector trainers (Epipen trainerÂ®) were used, one of which was modified by changing gray safety cap to red and placing a yellow arrow pointing to the black injection tip. Written and visual instruction sheet for each trainer was provided. Participants were asked to demonstrate the use of Epipen trainer either with the original or the modified one. They were scored and timed for demonstration. Primary study parameter was the rate of participants correctly demonstrating the use of epinephrine autoinjector. Secondary study parameters were the mean total score, mean time required to administer autoinjector and unintentional self injection of autoinjector into thumb.</detailed_description>
