	<brief_summary>Despite being a proven life-saving intervention in appropriately selected individuals, multiple studies continue to demonstrate low implantation of defibrillators in potential candidates. Based upon prior research, a major barrier to low utilization is low referral of potential candidates by healthcare providers. In this study, via brief clinical reminder placed in the electronic medical record, we ask healthcare providers who have not referred potential candidates for defibrillator the reasons for this decision and provide them with the tools for referral if appropriate.</brief_summary>
