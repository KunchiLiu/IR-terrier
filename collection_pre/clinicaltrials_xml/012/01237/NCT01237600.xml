	<brief_title>Efficacy of Cultivated Corneal Epithelial Stem Cell for Ocular Surface Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular surface damage caused by severe ocular surface diseases, particularly thermal and chemical burn or Stevens-Johnson syndrome result in corneal epithelial defect, corneal vascularization, corneal conjunctivalization and loss of transparency. Corneal limbal stem cell transplantation has been demonstrated to improve the outcome of ocular surface reconstruction. However, the conventional management of allograft limbal transplantation generally has unsatisfactory outcome because of high risk of rejection and requires long-life immunosuppressive medications.</detailed_description>
