	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate immune responses in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic Hepatitis B treated with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a). Eligible patients will have been randomized in study ML18253 to receive Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously for 48 or 96 weeks. Sample collection period for each patients will occur in the first 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
