	<brief_summary>The current treatment guidelines of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the American and European Associations for the Study of Liver Disease are based on the Barcelona-Clinic-Liver-Cancer classification (BCLC), which does not recommend surgery in patients with large, multinodular and macrovascular invasive disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hepatic resection in a large retrospective multicentric cohort of patients resected for HCC regardless of the BCLC indications.</brief_summary>
