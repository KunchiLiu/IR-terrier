	<brief_summary>Extreme pediatric obesity, the fastest growing category of obesity in youth, is associated with high risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Obesity tracks strongly into adulthood and interventions early in life may reduce risk for developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Few drug therapies for weight loss have been evaluated in adolescents. Since exenatide is associated with weight loss and improves risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adults, it may be useful in extremely obese youth. Our primary objective in this study is to generate preliminary data on the ability of exenatide to reduce body mass index (BMI) and improve risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in 26 extremely obese adolescents (age 12-19 years) in a three-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial. GLP-1 therapy has never been evaluated as a treatment for pediatric obesity and is an innovative approach to a challenging and significant health care problem.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exenatide in Extreme Pediatric Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>26 (approximately 13 per site) extremely obese (Body mass index [BMI] &gt; or = 1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI &gt; or = 35 kg/m2) adolescents (age 12-19 years old) will be enrolled in a six-month study consisting of a three-month, randomized, double-blind (participants and investigators), placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial phase followed by a three-month open-label extension during which all participants will receive exenatide. For the initial three-month phase, participants will be equally (by site) and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) exenatide plus lifestyle modification, or 2) placebo plus lifestyle modification. Following baseline testing, subjects will be randomly assigned to study group. Participants will return at one-month for titration and assessment of safety (blood draw and adverse event assessment) and injection/lifestyle modification compliance and at three-months for reassessment of baseline variables and injection/lifestyle modification compliance and allocation to study drug for the three-month open-label extension. Participants will return at four-months for assessment of safety (blood draw and adverse event assessment) and injection/lifestyle modification compliance and at six-months for reassessment of baseline variables and injection/lifestyle modification compliance. All subjects, regardless of group assignment, will participate in the clinical lifestyle modification program offered through either the University of Minnesota or Children's Hospitals and Clinics weight management programs. Participants and their families receive regular (approximately bi-monthly) face-to-face and/or phone behavioral-, dietary-, and physical activity-counseling from a multi-disciplinary team of health care professionals including physicians, dieticians, registered nurses, psychologists, and exercise physiologists. Screening will include review of medical records for previous clinical and laboratory data. The following measures will be collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Subject will be asked to fast for a minimum of 12 hours.</detailed_description>
