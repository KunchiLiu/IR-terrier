	<brief_summary>Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is important for the care of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. Stem cell transplants are used to treat blood cancers and bone marrow disorders. This involves the use of high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation to kill cancer cells; but this damages the marrow and blood system. Blood stem cells are transplanted by infusing into the recipient and blood counts recover over 2-3 weeks. Before bone marrow recovery, RBCs are needed to support the patient. Higher hemoglobin in these high risk patients may have benefits such as better energy and organ function. However, research in other areas of medicine suggests that a higher red cell count may be dangerous. Taken together, it is unclear whether having a lower or higher red cell count is better for patients having a blood stem cell transplant. The investigators plan to study this by randomly assigning patients having a transplant to be transfused with RBCs either at a higher or lower hemoglobin level. In this way, the investigators will be able to accurately find out if there are any benefits or harms in having a lower or higher red cell count during the recovery period after blood stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
