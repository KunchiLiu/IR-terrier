	<brief_summary>This is a national, multicenter, open-label, randomized, comparative study designed to compare, first, the TTP of the two treatment schemes proposed (MPV followed by Rd or MPV alternating with Rd) in newly diagnosed MM patients older than 65 years. This comparison will be performing in terms of both efficacy and safety. Up to 120 patients will be included in each treatment arm and evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3 study periods: Pre-treatment, Treatment and Follow-up. Primary outcome measure: - To evaluate the efficacy in terms of time to progression (TTP) at 18 months of MPV and Rd used as either in a sequential or alternating approach in newly diagnosed MM patients older than 65 years. - To evaluate the toxicity (safety and tolerability) of the sequential versus the alternating use of MPV and Rd. Secondary outcome measure: - To evaluate the response, duration of response, progression free survival (PFS), time to next therapy (TNT) and overall survival (OS) in the two different groups of patients. - To identify, within the group of patients treated with the alternating scheme, the biological characteristics (including a comprehensive genomic analysis) of those patients resistant to one or the other, and patients refractory to both treatments</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Treatment for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients Older Than 65 Years With Sequential Melphalan/Prednisone/Velcade (MPV) Followed by Revlimid/Low Dose Dexamethasone (Rd) Versus Alternating Velcade/Melphalan/Prednisone (MPV) With Revlimid/Low Dose Dexamethasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pre-treatment period includes Screening visit. After providing written informed consent form to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated for eligibility during a screening period of 14 days (Days -14 to -1). If patients meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized at the moment of entry in the trial in a 1:1 allocation to receive either MPV followed by Rd (Treatment Group A) or MPV alternating with Rd (Treatment Group B). Patients in the Treatment Group A will receive nine cycles of MPV consisting on one 6-weeks cycle of Velcade (Bortezomib) as an intravenous bolus twice weekly (days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32) followed by a 10 day rest period (day 33 to 42), in combination with oral Melphalan, once daily on days 1 to 4 and oral Prednisone, once daily on days 1 to 4, followed by eight 4-weeks cycles of Velcade (Bortezomib) as an intravenous bolus on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 followed by a 6 day rest period (days 23 to 28), in combination with Melphalan and Prednisone per os once daily on days 1 to 4, followed by a 24-day rest period (days 5 to 28). After the nine MPV cycles, patients will receive nine cycles of Rd consisting on 4-weeks cycles, including Revlimid (lenalidomide), once daily on days 1-21 followed by a 7 day rest period (days 22 to 28) plus oral dexamethasone, once weekly on days 1,8,15 and 22, followed by a 6 day rest period (days 23 to 28). Patients in the Treatment Group B will receive the same schedule of therapy, but the MPV cycles will be alternated with Rd cycles. In this treatment Group B, patients will be again randomized to start receiving either MPV or Rd as first cycle of therapy. Overall, patients will receive an identical number of cycles, nine cycles of MPV and nine of Rd. Patients randomized to Treatment Group A relapsing/progressing or with major toxicities under treatment with MPV will be crossover to receive Rd, but only after study coordinator approval. During the Treatment Period, patients will be evaluated at day 1 of each cycle. After completion of the Treatment Period, all patients will be evaluated every 2 months thereafter. Safety will be assessed by the monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs measurements, and haematology and clinical chemistry test. Response to treatment will be based on EBMT an IMWG criteria. Response to treatment will be evaluated at day 1 of each induction cycle, and every 2 months during thereafter.</detailed_description>
