	<brief_summary>For patients diagnosed with early (Stage I) non-small cell lung cancer, a lobe of lung is usually removed at surgery to treat the cancer. For some patients, the removal of a lobe of lung may leave too little lung behind for easy breathing. For some of these patients, it may be possible to perform a smaller-scale surgery ("sub-lobar resection") and place a radioactive implant behind to prevent the cancer from growing back. This study will see how these patients do in terms of controlling their disease treated with a radioactive implant called Cesium-131.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have suspicious lung nodule for clinical stage I/recurrent nonsmall cell Lung Cancer 2. Mass Tumor size &lt; 7 cm 3. Patient must have a CT scan of the chest with upper abdomen within 90 days prior to date of preregistration. 4. Patient must have ECOG/Zubrod performance status 0,1, or 2. 1. Patient has already received high dose radiation to the area 2. Cancerous nodule is very close to the esophagus or spinal cord, thereby increasing the risk of radiation treatment 3. Pregnancy or unwillingness to practice a form of birth control (i.e. abstinence, oral contraceptives, etc.)</criteria>
