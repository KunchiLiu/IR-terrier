	<brief_summary>One interesting area is the relationship of high salt intake and central aortic blood pressure. High salt intake is associated development of hypertension and cardiovascular mortality. Central aortic pressure is better correlated with cardiovascular events and mortality. With recent advances in technology, it is possible to measure central aortic pressure noninvasively and easily. Until now there is no study to evaluate the relationship of high salt intake and aortic blood pressure. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the relationship of high salt intake and aortic blood pressure and aortic stiffness. Subjects with or without hypertension will be enrolled for investigation. Subjects with hypertension should be never treated with antihypertensive medications. Subjects with secondary hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, high grade kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, and major arrhythmia will be excluded. Sodium intake is measured by 24 hour urinary sodium excretion, with the measurement of peripheral and central aortic blood pressure, and aortic pulse wave velocity. Salt sensitive hypertension related single nucleotide polymorphism will be analyzed to define the relationship with high salt intake and aortic pressure and pulse wave velocity.</brief_summary>
