	<criteria>Patients with confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (including de novo AML, tAML and sAML) Presence of NPM1 mutation as assessed in one of the central AMLSG reference laboratories. Age &gt; 60 years. There is no upper age limit. No prior chemotherapy for leukemia except hydroxyurea to control hyperleukocytosis if needed for up to 10 days during the diagnostic screening phase. Signed written informed consent Men must give their informed consent that they do not father a baby and must use a latex condom during any sexual contact with women of childbearing potential, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.

Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse within one year.</criteria>
