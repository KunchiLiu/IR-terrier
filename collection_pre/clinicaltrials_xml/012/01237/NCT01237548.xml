	<brief_summary>Title: The acute effect of narghile smoking on endothelial Function, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and pulmonary function tests in healthy volunteers. Objectives: To evaluate the acute effect of one cession of narghile smoking on endothelial Function, airway inflammation as assessed by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in healthy volunteers. Design: Prospective study evaluating these parameters before and after 30 minutes of Narghile smoking. The changes in inflammatory parameters pre and post smoking will be evaluated blindly. Sample size: 50 participants Participant selection: Adults subjects who smoke Narghile . Intervention: Each subject will undergo evaluation including a respiratory questionnaire, endothelial Function , pulmonary function tests , exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and carboxy- hemoglobin levels . All measurements will be evaluated before and after one cession of 30 minutes narghile smoking.</brief_summary>
