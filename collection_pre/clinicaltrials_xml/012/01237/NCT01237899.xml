	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY2623091 after multiple oral dosing in healthy men and women of non-childbearing potential. Two cohorts of 16 subjects will participate in 2 dosing periods. Treatment assignment will be double-blind for LY2623091 and placebo(negative control), and open label for eplerenone(positive control).</brief_summary>

Are currently enrolled in, or have discontinued, within 60 days inclusive, a clinical trial involving an investigational drug, device or an offlabel use of an approved drug, or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged to be scientifically or medically incompatible with this study. Subjects who meet any of these criteria may be enrolled in this study but they cannot be dosed until at least 60 days following the last day of the previous investigational trial. Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating LY2623091. Have a history or presence of medical illness including but not limited to any cardiovascular, hepatic, respiratory, hematological, endocrine or neurological disease, or any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that is of a serious medical problem that would preclude study participation. Have an abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which increases the risks associated with participation in the study.

No use of acetaminophen/paracetamol or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 24 hours of first dosing and/or anticipated use during the study. Aspirin may not be used at doses greater than 100 milligrams/day (mg/day) within 7days of first dosing and/or anticipated use during the study. No use of herbal or nutritional products within 7 days of first dosing and/or anticipated use during the study. Have donated blood of more than 50 milliliters (mL) within the last 60 days. Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week and/or subjects unwilling to stop alcohol within 48 hours of study enrollment and for the duration of the study. Have an abnormally high blood pressure (supine or standing) defined as diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 millimeters of mercury and /or systolic blood pressure greater than 150 millimeters of mercury, confirmed by at least 1 repeat measurement. Have serum potassium greater than the upper limit of normal. Regularly use known drugs of abuse or show positive findings for such use on urinary drug screening. Consumption of natural licorice and/or natural licoricecontaining products and/or grapefruit and/or grapefruit juice within 7 days of first dosing and/or anticipated consumption during the study.
