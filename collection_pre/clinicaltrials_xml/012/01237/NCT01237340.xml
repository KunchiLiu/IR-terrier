	<criteria>Adult male and female subjects, 1860 years of age, inclusive, at the time the informed consent is signed Subjects who have confirmed adult GHD Subjects who are growth hormone (GH) treatmentnaive or had received Saizen® (freezedried formulation) for pediatric GHD (PGHD), or are currently receiving Saizen® freezedried formulation for adult GHD (AGHD) Subjects who have binding antibodynegative (BAbs) at screening Subjects who have no evidence of concomitant disease, intercurrent illness, or resultant therapy that would interfere with subject compliance, the evaluation of study results, or compromise the safety of the subject Female subjects of childbearing potential who have a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit (and at each scheduled visit during the study) Subjects who are willing to comply with the procedures of the study Subjects who are willing to sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved informed consent form Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply Subjects who are currently receiving or have previously received treatment for adult GHD or any other indication, including PGHD, with a commercial GH product other than Saizen® freezedried formulation Subjects who had a chronic underlying disease within 6 months prior to screening or concomitant medication(s) that in the opinion of the investigator would exclude the subject from the trial Subjects who have significant renal impairment Subjects who have diabetes mellitus Subjects who are immunosuppressed Subjects who have a current malignancy or a history of any malignancy (excluding fullytreated basal cell carcinoma) Subjects who have participated in another study and received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening visit Subjects who have clinically significant abnormal laboratory value(s) Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or allergy to exogenous human GH or any of the excipients or phenol, the bacteriostatic agent in the Saizen® solution for injection Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
