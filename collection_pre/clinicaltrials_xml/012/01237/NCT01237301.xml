	<brief_title>Comparing Self Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) to Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves the use of the following 2 glucose monitoring methods to measure your blood sugar (glucose) levels and help manage type 2 diabetes: 1. Self Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG): blood glucose is measured 4-7 times each day using finger sticks and an AccuChek Aviva blood glucose meter. 2. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM): blood glucose is measured continuously via the DexCom SevenPlus CGM device. This device has been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</detailed_description>
