	<brief_summary>Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is considered a "surgical disease" with no medical therapy available to improve any clinical outcomes, including symptoms, time to surgery, or long-term survival. Thus far, randomized studies involving statins have not been promising with respect to slowing progressive valve stenosis. Beyond the valve, two common consequences of aortic stenosis are hypertrophic remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary venous hypertension; each of these has been associated with worse heart failure symptoms, increased operative mortality, and worse long-term outcomes. Whether altering LV structural abnormalities, improving LV function, and/or reducing pulmonary artery pressures with medical therapy would improve clinical outcomes in patients with AS has not been tested. Animal models of pressure overload have demonstrated that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition influences nitric oxide (NO) - cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in the LV and favorably impacts LV structure and function, but this has not been tested in humans with AS. Studies in humans with left-sided heart failure and pulmonary venous hypertension have shown that PDE5 inhibition improves functional capacity and quality of life, but patients with AS were not included in those studies. The investigators hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition with tadalafil will have a favorable impact on LV structure and function as well as pulmonary artery pressures. In this pilot study, the investigators anticipate that short-term administration of tadalafil to patients with AS will be safe and well-tolerated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aortic Stenosis and PhosphodiEsterase Type 5 iNhibition (ASPEN): A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with moderately severe to severe aortic stenosis (AS), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, preserved ejection fraction, and no planned aortic valve replacement over the next 6 months will be eligible for this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study. There will be a diabetic cohort (n=32) and non-diabetic cohort (n=24); each cohort will be randomized 1:1 to tadalafil vs. placebo. During a baseline study visit, the following will be obtained: clinical data, 6 minute walk, quality of life questionnaire, blood draw, and an echocardiogram. A 3-day run-in will occur to initially assess tolerability and compliance. If the drug is tolerated during this run-in period, participants will be randomized. An MRI will also be performed during this randomization visit. Follow-up study visits and testing will occur at 6 and 12 weeks and 6 months.</detailed_description>
