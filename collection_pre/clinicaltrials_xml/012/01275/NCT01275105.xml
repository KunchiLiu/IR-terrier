	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dose response of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution as compared to placebo in the prevention of allergen-induced conjunctival redness using a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. It is hypothesized that low-dose brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution will be more effective than vehicle in the prevention of conjunctival redness induced by conjunctival allergen challenge when instilled prior to the allergen challenge.</brief_summary>
