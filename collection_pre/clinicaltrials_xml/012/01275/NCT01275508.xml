	<brief_summary>The scientific objective of the project is to evaluate if the topical administration of Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-Adalimumab during the endomicroscopic examination of the gut in Crohn's disease (CD) patients shows an acceptable safety profile. Another objective is to explore whether the use of FITC-Adalimumab as a predictive biomarker might reliably predict patient response to Adalimumab therapy and hence enable optimized utilization of this treatment option.</brief_summary>
