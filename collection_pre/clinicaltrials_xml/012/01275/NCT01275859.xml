	<brief_summary>Cross-talk between epidermal growth factors and the ER occurs at multiple levels and seems to play a crucial role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.Combined HER1/HER2-targeted therapy with aromatase inhibitors for ER-positive and HER-2 positive postmenopausal breast cancer might enhance response and block emergence of endocrine resistant tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Combined Endocrine and HER2 Target Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With ER and Her2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To evaluate the efficacy of the neoadjuvant combination therapy with letrozole and lapatinib in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer. 2. To assess markers predictive of treatment response and outcome in this setting.</detailed_description>
