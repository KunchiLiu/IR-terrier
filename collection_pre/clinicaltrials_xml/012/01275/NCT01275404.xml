	<brief_summary>The investigators know that treatment for prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction can impact sexual health and quality of life. They want to learn how the treatment affects one's emotional and social well-being. They have developed a new type of counseling. Cancer patients seek counseling for lots of reasons. It often helps them cope because they can express their feelings with a trained professional. They hope that this counseling will teach patients skills that they can use to comply with erectile treatment programs, improve their sexual health and quality of life. These skills may also improve physical and emotional well-being. As part of this study they will ask the patient to provide feedback on the proposed counseling.</brief_summary>
