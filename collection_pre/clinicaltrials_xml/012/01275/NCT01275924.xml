	<brief_summary>Syndesmotic injuries are common and often associated with unstable ankle fractures. The most common treatment is with a syndesmotic screw through the fibula and tibia which is later removed, usually after 10-12 weeks. The Tightrope Syndesmosis Repair Kit (Arthrex; Naples, Florida). is used for the same indication, it consists of a heavy suture placed across the syndesmosis which has been looped and tightened through cortical button anchors on either side of the ankle. It does not need removal and thus avoids subsequent surgery. This trial compares these two treatment methods for syndesmotic injuries of the ankle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tightrope or Screw Fixation of Acute Tibiofibular Syndesmotic Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients 18-70 years presenting to one of the two hospitals with an acute syndesmotic injury are eligible for inclusion. 50 patients are randomised to two treatment groups: One group receives a Tightrope (R) fixation and the other receives a quadricortical screw fixation which is removed after 12 weeks. Follow-up intervals are at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months with standardised CT scans postoperatively and at 12 and 24 months and clinical end-ponts/scores.</detailed_description>
