	<brief_summary>Subjects in this research study have Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). This occurs when there is a build-up of fatty material in the wall of the heart arteries that causes narrowing of the arteries. This could lead to chest pain, a heart attack, weakening of the heart and/or permanent damage to the heart. As part of their normal routine care, subjects had or will have a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) to restore the blood flow in the arteries of their heart. During a PCI procedure, pictures are taken of the arteries before and after the treatment of the narrowing in the arteries. These pictures are acquired through angiography which is a way to produce X-ray pictures of the inside of arteries. After a PCI procedure, there is a possibility for narrowing of the arteries to return. The likelihood of this happening can be greatly reduced by lifestyle changes and adhering to heart medication regimens. It is part of normal, routine care for CAD patients to be given written and verbal information on how to lead a heart healthy lifestyle and to take heart medications properly. In this research study, the investigators will show half of the patients their before and after images of their heart arteries where the narrowing occurred and was treated. The other half of the patients will not be shown these images. Both groups will still receive information about lifestyle and medications as part of their normal, routine care. At the end of this study, the investigators will compare both groups to see if there are any differences in making lifestyle changes and taking heart medications properly. Additionally, the investigators would also like to see if there are any resulting differences in the amount of hearts attacks or other heart related medical events.</brief_summary>
