	<brief_summary>This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of two doses of ondansetron (0.5 mg and 0.75 mg) relative to placebo when administered twice daily as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) who have not adequately responded to treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Low-Dose Ondansetron For Adjunctive Therapy In Adult Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. A sufficient number of patients will be screened to obtain approximately 150 patients randomized to the double-blind portion of the study. This study will consist of at least 6 weeks of retrospectively documented SRI treatment (prior to screening), 6 weeks of prospective SRI treatment after screening (run-in) but prior to randomization, and 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with study drug (ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a day, ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day or placebo twice a day). All patients will have been maintained on a single SRI at the same dose throughout the retrospective 6-week period and will continue the same SRI at the same dose throughout the run-in and double-blind treatment periods. The 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will be the "core period" for purposes of efficacy and short-term safety assessment. Patients completing all 12 weeks of the core period will be offered an opportunity to participate in an "extension period" where they will continue to receive treatment for up to 30 months following the core period. Treatment assignment in the extension period will be as follows: responders will continue on the same double-blind treatment to which they were assigned in the core period (ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a day, ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day, or placebo twice a day); non-responders will be reassigned to continuing treatment according to their prior treatment assignment in the core period (those who received placebo will be assigned to ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a day, those who received ondansetron 0.5 mg twice a day will be assigned to ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day, and those who received ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day will continue receiving ondansetron 0.75 mg twice a day). Patients will receive treatment under double-blind conditions (double-blind phase of the extension study) until the core study is completed and the safety and efficacy of an ondansetron dose has been confirmed If after the core study data analysis, no treatment differences are found between ondansetron and placebo in the primary efficacy variable, the extension study will be terminated. If the core study results are positive for the primary efficacy endpoint and safety endpoints, then patients participating in the double-blind phase of the extension study will be offered an opportunity to continue treatment under open-label conditions with the dose deemed efficacious and safe (open-label phase of the extension study). A Data Review Committee will be responsible for reviewing the core study analysis results, providing a dose recommendation for the open-label phase of the extension study, and for communicating the results and their recommendation to the participating institutional review boards/ethics committees (IRBs/ECs) and investigators. Patients may continue receiving treatment for up to 30 months or until the sponsor provides an alternative.</detailed_description>

Females using oral contraception must have started using the medication at least 8 weeks prior to screening. Surgical sterilization must have occurred at least 6 weeks prior to screening. Documented diagnosis of ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIVTR) criteria At screening, documented history of stable and current regimen of one of the following five serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) for at least 6 weeks prior to screening at the minimum daily dosage listed: clomipramine (Anafranil®) 150 mg fluvoxamine (Luvox®) 200 mg or fluvoxamine CR (Luvox CR®) 200 mg fluoxetine (Prozac®) 40 mg paroxetine (Paxil®) 40 mg (does not include paroxetine CR (Paxil CR®)) sertraline (Zoloft®) 100 mg YaleBrown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale (YBOCS) score of ≥ 24 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of &lt; 20 Inclusion criteria for randomization to doubleblind treatment period: During runin, documented use of stable and current regimen of one of the following five serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) for at least 6 weeks prior to screening at the minimum daily dosage listed: clomipramine (Anafranil®) 150 mg fluvoxamine (Luvox®) 200 mg or fluvoxamine CR (Luvox CR®) 200 mg fluoxetine (Prozac®) 40 mg paroxetine (Paxil®) 40 mg (does not include paroxetine CR (Paxil CR®)) sertraline (Zoloft®) 100 mg Demonstrated failure to adequately respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment, defined by the following 2 criteria after 6 weeks of prospective treatment: YaleBrown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale (YBOCS) score ≥ 21 Less than 25% improvement in YaleBrown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale (YBOCS) score from Week 6 (screening) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of ≤ 16 Extension Period Inclusion criteria for randomization to doubleblind extension treatment period: Completing 12 weeks of treatment in the doubleblind core period Demonstrating compliance in the judgment of the investigator, with both the SRI and study drug as prescribed.
