	<brief_summary>Part I of this study will compare the pharmacokinetics of MK-7655, dosed in combination with PRIMAXIN® (imipenem + cilastatin), in participants with impaired renal function and matched control participants. In Part II of the study, the potential for renal insufficiency to affect non-renal clearance mechanisms will be investigated.</brief_summary>
