	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Glucose and Insulin Response to Nutralin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational food product has helped decrease the amount of insulin needed in treating diabetic dogs and has improved the dogs' longevity and quality of life. Observational analysis by trained veterinarians has indicated that the natural fluctuations in blood glucose levels do not exist in dogs using the product. The hypothesis for this study is that healthy human subjects will have an increase in insulin levels after consuming the investigational food product.</detailed_description>
