	<brief_summary>Assessment of left ventricular systolic function is the most frequent indication for routine echocardiography. Qualitative eyeball method and biplane modified Simpson's rule, both measuring radial ventricular function, are the currently recommended methods to meet this challenge. Due to the complexity of the myocardial architecture, global left ventricular function also has longitudinal and torsional components. The aim of this study is to evaluate new echocardiographic parameters for longitudinal left ventricular function. A special focus is set on strain imaging by speckle tracking, which is a relatively new technique. Patients with different cardiac pathologies (e. g. dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, diastolic dysfunction) will be included and compared to healthy individuals.</brief_summary>
