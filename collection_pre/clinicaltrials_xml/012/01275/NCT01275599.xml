	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the drug-drug interaction potential between telaprevir and buprenorphine/naloxone. An understanding of the interaction potential will help to determine whether buprenorphine dose adjustments are necessary for patients who are concomitantly treated with telaprevir. Telaprevir, in combination with other antiviral agents, is being investigated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Buprenorphine/naloxone is used for maintainance therapy in patients with opioid dependence.</brief_summary>
