	<brief_summary>The aims of the present study are to evaluate the concentrations of vitamin D in the plasma and of calcium in the plasma and in the urine as well as to evaluate bone mineral density using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), after supplementation of vitamin D with 30µg (1200 IU) and 40µg (1600 IU), in comparison with currently recommended supplementation of vitamin D with 10µg (400 IU). In this pilot study supplementation is given to infants from 2 weeks of age to 3 months of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Intervention in Infants - Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency is common around the world. In Finland vitamin D levels are low in all age groups. Especially infants are predisposed to vitamin D deficiency. Partly this is due to low exposure to sunlight but mainly it is due to low dietary intake of vitamin D. Vitamin D prophylaxis was introduced in Finland in the 1950´s to overcome rickets. However, the recommended dose has decreased from 50µg (2000 IU) in the 1960´s to 10µg (400 IU) from beginning of the 1990´s. The serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25OHD) is used as a marker of vitamin D status in the body. Although there is no consensus of optimal concentration of S-25OHD, it has been proposed that concentrations lower than 50 nmol/l indicate deficiency. According to recent findings on 25-OHD concentrations in Finnish children, currently recommended intake of vitamin D is inadequate.</detailed_description>
