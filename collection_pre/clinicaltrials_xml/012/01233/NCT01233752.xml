	<brief_summary>Identification of the genetic polymorphisms that could be correlated either with a better clinical response or with a major predisposition of patients to develop tolerance and/or side effects to the treatment with morphine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Clinical Effect of Morphine With PCA After Surgery and Pharmacogenetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Valuation of the medium morphine dose (mg/kg/die) necessary to maintain NRS&lt;4 in the first 24 hours post-surgery in the two groups of patients, A e B. Group A: homozygous patients for the more frequent allele of the polymorphism A118G of OPRM1 gene (about 80%); group B: both homozygous and heterozygous patients for the less frequent allele (about 20%). In order to avoid the bias related to alterations in metabolism, patients with Cmax and AUC of morphine (and metabolites M6G and M3G) &gt;2 standard deviation higher than expected population curve ("outliers") will be excluded for the primary purpose.</detailed_description>
