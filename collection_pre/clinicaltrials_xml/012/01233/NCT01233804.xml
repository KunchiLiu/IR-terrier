	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare methods for consenting (opting in vs opting out) on influenza vaccine uptake rate in pregnant women. This study is designed to learn about the impact of influenza vaccination in pregnant women. This study will help gather knowledge about influenza vaccine side effects (if given) and whether the vaccine reduces the number of respiratory infection in mothers and their infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opting In vs Opting Out</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant women who present for routine prenatal care when influenza vaccine is available would be eligible. Enrolled women would be randomized to either the Opting in (obtaining written consent to administer the vaccine) or Opting out (signing only to refuse the vaccine) study group (Part 1). Vaccine uptake rate and reason for refusal will be captured for enrollees. At the end of this clinic visit, enrollees will be asked if they are interested in participating in Part 2 and 3 of the study. If yes, consent will be obtained. Part 2 of the study, a random sample of 50 women will be called 2 days after enrollment to determine 1) vaccine side effects 2) recall of information provided in consent and 3) to confirm next followup visit with Obstetrician. During Part 3, at 6 weeks post EDD (estimated due date), data about episodes of respiratory illness in the mothers and their infants occuring between the time when influenza vaccine was offered (Part 1) and 6 weeks post-EDD will be abstracted using a standard form. Data will be collected retrospectively by research nurses.</detailed_description>
