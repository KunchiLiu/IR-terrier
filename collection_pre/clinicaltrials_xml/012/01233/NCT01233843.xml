	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that induction chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy plus Cetuximab will give better results than the validated treatment (chemoradiotherapy), for treatment of locoregional advanced head and neck cancers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy+ carboplatin + 5FU) is a validated treatment for patients with locoregional advanced head and neck cancers. This study evaluates the outcome of induction chemotherapy (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU) followed by radiation therapy + Erbitux for patients with head and neck carcinoma with almost one measurable lesion by RMI or CT scan. We hope we can improve the progression free survival of 14% at two years .</detailed_description>
