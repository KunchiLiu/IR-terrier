	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center trial conducted at up to 20 US, Canadian, European and Asian centers designed to determine the diagnostic performance of CT-FLOW (the investigational technology) by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) for non-invasive assessment of the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions, as compared to direct measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) during cardiac catheterization as a reference standard.</brief_summary>
