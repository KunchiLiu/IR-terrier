	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II study of erlotinib and AMG 102 in previously treated subjects with advanced NSCLC. Subjects will be enrolled with recurrent or progressive advanced stage NSCLC that has been treated with at least one and a maximum of two prior chemotherapy regimens. The Phase I part of the study will enroll 8-16 subjects with the Phase II part enrolling 21-45 subjects. The Phase I part of the study is designed to determine how safest the combination of AMG 102 and erlotinib is and the recommended dose for the Phase II part. The Phase II part is to determine whether the combination of AMG102 and erlotinib works enough to warrant further interest in this combination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have baseline evaluations performed prior to the first dose of study drug and must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results of all baseline evaluations, which assure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been satisfied, must be reviewed by a Physician Investigator prior to enrollment of that patient. In addition, the patient must be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule and required evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written informed consent must be obtained from the patient prior to enrollment. The following criteria apply to all patients enrolled onto the study unless otherwise specified. Patients with recurrent or progressive advanced stage Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC,no SCLC component) who have been treated with at least one and a maximum of two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced NSCLC. Chemotherapy as part of initial potentially curative therapy (given as part of adjuvant or concomitant chemoradiotherapy) that was completed &lt;1 year counts as 1 prior regimen. Prior erlotinib, other epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs or monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR are not allowed. NOTE: Chemotherapy as part of initial potentially curative therapy (given as part of adjuvant or concomitant chemoradiotherapy) that was completed one or more years prior to screening for this study does not count as a prior regimen. If the tumor is refractory (progressed) after a prior chemotherapy regimen, then that regimen would count. If a prior chemotherapy regimen has been changed due to other reasons than disease progression (e.g. poor tolerance, allergic reaction), then it would not count as a separate prior regimen. A chemotherapy drug added for "maintenance" following disease stabilization or response to a chemotherapy regimen (in the absence of prior disease progression) does not count as a separate prior regimen. NOTE: Pathology reports documenting the diagnosis of NSCLC are required to be reviewed by the screening physician investigator. Measurable disease (RECIST version 1.1) (for phase II part only). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2 and life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. NOTE: For the phase I part of the study, patients with ECOG Performance Status 2 will be excluded. Age ≥ 18 years old and ability to provide written informed consent obtained prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed. Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria (within 14 days prior to study registration): oHematology: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 or prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal limits (WNL) of the institution oBiochemistry: Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limits. AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), except if there is known hepatic metastasis, wherein transaminases may be ≤ 5 x institutional ULN. Creatinine clearance 45 ml/min or higher calculated using the CockcroftGault formula. Multiply the number by 0.85 if the patient is female. Patients must have fully recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In the case of residual effects, these must be clinically stable, grade 1 or less in severity and do not meet other protocol exclusion criteria. A minimum time period of 3 weeks should elapse between the completion of radiation therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease and enrollment in the study. A minimum of 4 weeks should elapse between the completion of chemotherapy or any experimental therapy and enrollment in the study. A minimum of 4 weeks should elapse between prior major surgery (such as open biopsy or significant traumatic injury) and enrollment in the study. A minimum of 2 weeks should elapse between prior minor surgical procedures (such as chemotherapy infusion port placement or core visceral organ biopsy) and enrollment in the study. If patient has history of brain metastases, brain lesions should have been treated with surgery and/or radiation and be stable on repeat imaging and patients should be neurologically stable on a stable or tapering dose of corticosteroids. No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, unless there is a 3year diseasefree interval. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of the first administration of study treatment and must be willing to use two methods of contraception one of them being a barrier method or abstain from sexual activity during the study and for 6 months after last study drug administration. Sexually active males and their female partners must agree to use two methods of accepted and effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier methods, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. All patients must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration on study. Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C; baseline testing for HIV and hepatitis C is not required. This is due to the unknown effects of AMG102. Patients with any significant history of noncompliance to medical regimens or with inability to grant a reliable informed consent. Patients who have mixed tumors with smallcell elements are ineligible. Pregnancy or lactation. All females of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine pregnancy tests within 7 days prior to starting study treatment. Prior treatment of NSCLC with EGFR TKIs or monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR. A serious active infection (&gt;grade 2) within 7 days of enrollment. A serious underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment. Untreated brain metastases. A major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days of beginning treatment, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of the study per inclusion criterion 3.1. In addition, if a patient has not yet recovered from prior minor surgery (such as central venous access device or fine needle aspiration biopsy). Thrombosis or vascular ischemic events within the last twelve months, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, or myocardial infarction Concurrent or prior (within 7 days of enrollment) anticoagulation therapy, except for the use of low dose coumarintype anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis against central venous catheter thrombosis Presence of peripheral edema &gt; Grade 2 (CTCAE version 4).</criteria>
