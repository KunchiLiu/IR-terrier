	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized feasibility study of endothelial function, exercise capacity, and outcome following pre-left ventricular assist device (LVAD)therapy and cardiac transplant. The study period will be 5 years, with 20 patients to be enrolled. The investigators anticipate that 15 patients will survive to complete the one year follow up period.(the published survival rate of LVAD is 75% in one year). 10 patients are anticipated to undergo cardiac transplant within 3 years of initial enrollment and they are followed until their 2nd annual post transplant invasive evaluation. Markers of endothelial function will be studied to permit comparison with selected clinical outcomes. The hypothesis is that the endothelial functions will be altered after implantation of LVAD then before its implantation, both acutely and chronically, and this may affect the exercise capacity, quality of life and occurrence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy post cardiac transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, feasibility study of endothelial function, exercise capacity, and outcome following pre-LVAD patients through LVAD therapy and cardiac transplantation. The study period will be 5 years. It is anticipated that 20 patients will be enrolled and 15 will survive (published survival estimate following LVAD is approximately 75% at one year) to complete the one-year follow-up period. 10 patients are anticipated to undergo heart transplant within 3 years of initial enrollment and they will be followed until their 2nd annual post-transplant invasive evaluation.</detailed_description>
