	<brief_title>Diazepam Vaginal Suppositories for High Tone Pelvic Floor Dysfunction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High tone pelvic floor dysfunction is a common cause of pelvic pain in females. It is thought to be initiated by a sentinel event such as trauma, surgery, or vaginal delivery1. Currently, treatment options include warm baths, stretching, physical therapy with myofascial therapy or biofeedback, or pharmacologic therapy with oral amitriptyline or tiazadine2. Physical therapy can be effective. However, it usually involves frequent visits to a specialized physical therapist to undergo intravaginal treatments consisting of myofascial release, massage, or biofeedback. We would like to find a treatment option for patients that would be effective without the invasive and time consuming nature of physical therapy. It is known that diazepam is a valid treatment option for disorders involving spasticity including spastic cerebral palsy5 and tetanus. A literature search on diazepam and high tone pelvic floor dysfunction revealed one paper. This study has an intrinsic flaw as it is a retrospective chart review, and the results are confounded by concurrent physical therapy. They were, however, able to find that patients treated with diazepam suppositories showed a significant improvement in pelvic floor tone. They also assessed pain and sexual function, but these did not reach statistical significance.</detailed_description>
