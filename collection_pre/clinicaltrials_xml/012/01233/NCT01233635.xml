	<brief_summary>In the present application, we propose to refine and extend current insight into AAF mechanism and therapy by examining the importance of pharmacologic RAAS inhibition, ACE genotype, and their interaction in secondary AF prevention. We have 3 specific aims: 1. To confirm that RAAS inhibition therapy reduces the incidence of AF recurrence. 2. To test the hypothesis that the incidence of AF recurrence in the absence of RAAS inhibition therapy is higher among patients with the D allele. 3. To explore the hypothesis that RAAS inhibition therapy is more effective for preventing AF recurrence in patients with the DD genotype than in those with DI or II genotypes.</brief_summary>
