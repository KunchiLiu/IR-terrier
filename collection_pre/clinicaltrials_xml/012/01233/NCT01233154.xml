	<brief_summary>Various studies in animal and humans have shown a potential beneficial effect of probiotics consumption on allergy. However few studies exist that document their efficacy for upper airways allergies such as allergic rhinitis. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of short-term oral administration of a L. paracasei or of a blend of 2 probiotics (L. acidophilus + B. lactis) on a nasal provocation test (NPT) with grass pollen, performed out of the pollen season. Adult volunteers with allergic rhinitis are enrolled in a randomized, double-blind study, based on two 4-weeks cross-over periods of product consumption separated by a washout period of 6-8 weeks. Objective and subjective clinical parameters of NPT as well as systemic and nasal immunological markers are compared before and after each treatment.</brief_summary>
