Children with PDD show delays in speech and language and reduced social interaction. Some children with PDD also have behavior problems, including defiance of rules, aggression, and tantrums.

Following confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Parent Training or a Psychoeducational Program. The Parent Training program involves specific suggestions about how to deal with behavior problems. The Psychoeducational program covers specific issues related to autism and parenting, including an co-occurring medical conditions and treatment options. Parents will attend up to 13 one-on-one sessions with a trained therapist over a 24-week period. Participation in the study also involves 2 home visits and 6 monthly assessment visits. The purpose of the assessment visits is to evaluate the child's response to treatment. Evaluations will also be conducted at 3 and 6 months after completion of the study.</detailed_description>
