	<brief_title>LOC387715/HTRA1 and the Combined Photodynamic Therapy With Intravitreal Bevacizumab in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective cohort study comprised of 70 eyes being treated for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy with combined photodynamic therapy and intravitreal bevacizumab injections. Patients were genotyped for the LOC387715 (rs10490924) and the HTRA1 gene polymorphism (rs11200638).</detailed_description>
