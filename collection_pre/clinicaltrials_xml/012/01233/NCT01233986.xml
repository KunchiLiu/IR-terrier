	<criteria>Large artery atherosclerotic ischemic stroke group(LAA group) Age over 20 years Patients with symptomatic stenosis in the eligible vessels(the middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, or internal carotid artery) as assessed by MRA or CTA corresponding to the acute ischemic stroke Patients without the occlusion of corresponding artery by MRA or CTA The fasting and postprandial serum Apo B48 level can be assessed within 72 hours after the symptom onset of ischemic stroke Small vessel occlusive ischemic stroke group (SVO group) Age over 20 years Patients with acute ischemic stroke of basal ganglia, internal capsule, or corona radiata Patients without both symptomatic and asymptomatic arterial occlusion or stenosis by MRA or CTA Patients without a history of systemic atherosclerosis(for example, acute myocardial infarction, angina, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysm) The fasting and postprandial serum Apo B48 level can be assessed within 72 hours after the symptom onset of ischemic stroke both LAA group and SVO group Patients with cardioembolic ischemic stroke Patients treated with lipid lowering agents or steroid within the previous 30 dsys Patients with severe liver disease (AST &gt;100 or ALT &gt;100) at the time of randomization Patients with endocrine disease except diabetes mellitus at the time of randomization (for example, thyroid disease, adrenal disease) Patients with severe renal disease (serum creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dl)at the time of randomization chronic alcoholics or drug user Patients with infection at the time of randomization Patients, in the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with the clinical study or unsuitable for the any other disease or reason Informed consent has not been obtained</criteria>
