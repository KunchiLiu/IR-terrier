	<brief_summary>Recent scientific evidence suggests that the main defence cell of the body (neutrophil) behaves in a different manner in patients with gum diseaseÍ¾ namely how they interact with bacteria and their role in defence systems of the body. This study proposes to examine these responses in periodontitis patients and healthy controls. The proposed study will include patients undergoing periodontal (gum) treatment who will be matched to periodontally healthy controls. Blood, gingival crevicular (gum) fluid and clinical measures will be collected both pre- and post-therapy to measure differences in cell behaviour both before, and following routine therapy. Blood samples will be used to isolate peripheral blood neutrophils prior to analysis of their responses to different bacterial stimuli including oxygen radical, cytokine and extracellular trap release. Gingival Crevicular Fluid samples will be used to measure different biochemical markers that result from the production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). Routine clinical measures will be taken both pre- and post-therapy as a measure of treatment response. Patient volunteers undergoing treatment will be asked to donate a total of four small samples of tissue from the gums whilst they are already anaesthetised for routine treatment. These will be approximately the size of a needle head (2mm2mm) and used to examine NET formation within the tissues and related processes. This will provide novel in-vivo data regarding this recently discovered method of neutrophil defence in innate immunity. This proposal represents a novel study aimed at improving our current understanding of why inflammatory periodontitis develops in some patients but not others, as well as providing pointers to causal/noncausal relationships between periodontitis and important systemic conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Ultimately, novel treatment approaches and primary prevention (for periodontitis) or secondary prevention (for systemic disease) strategies may emerge.</brief_summary>
