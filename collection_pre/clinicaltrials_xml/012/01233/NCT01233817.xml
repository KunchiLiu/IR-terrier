	<brief_summary>The proposed feasibility study is necessary to test if children and young adults will participate in and adhere to a 12-week, home-based, supervised progressive strength training exercise program and to obtain preliminary data that will subsequently allow us to determine the safety and impact of strength training in spinal muscular atrophy. Our pilot study will address 3 aims: (1) Ascertain the feasibility of, and potential barriers to, participation in and adherence to a 12-week home-based, supervised, progressive strength training exercise program in children and young adults aged 5-21 years with SMA types II and III; (2) Determine the safety and tolerability of progressive strength training in a pilot study sample of children and young adults with SMA types II and III; and (3) Determine candidate outcome measures.</brief_summary>
