	<brief_summary>Studies have found a relationship between dietary fiber consumption and body weight regulation. This relationship may stem from enhanced satiety through fermentation of certain fibers in the large intestine. The objective of this study is to determine and compare satiety ratings, changes in food intake, and gastrointestinal effects for four fibers: fructooligosaccharide, inulin, soluble corn fiber, and resistant starch.</brief_summary>
