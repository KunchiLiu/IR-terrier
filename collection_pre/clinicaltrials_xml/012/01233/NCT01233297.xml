	<brief_summary>Copsac has discovered that asthmatic exacerbations are as closely linked to bacterial as to viral infection. The current study will examine whether treatment of asthmatic exacerbations with macrolide antibiotics - in the abscence of clear clinical bacterial infection which would in any case precipitate antibiotic treatment - has an effect on either the particular episode, or subsequently. Macrolide antibiotics are chosen for ease of administration ensuring high compliance, antibiotic appropriacy, and anti-inflammatory properties.</brief_summary>
