	<brief_summary>Biomarkers of bone resorption will be measured in the blood of patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer during the course of their illness. Changes in these biomarkers will be correlated with the patient's treatment with antiandrogen therapy and bisphosphonates and the response and/or progression of their cancer. It is hoped that serial measurement of these biomarkers may allow therapeutic monitoring in the future with successful individualisation of bisphosphonate therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
