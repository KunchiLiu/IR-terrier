	<brief_summary>This is a two-staged study of a single dose of 200 mg of bosutinib given to subjects with renal impairment and matching healthy volunteers. In Stage 1, only subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects with normal renal function will be enrolled. Subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment will be enrolled in Stage 2 if the results from Stage 1 suggest a substantial difference in PK profiles between subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects with normal renal function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females, aged 18 to 65. Adequate hepatic function. Documented creatinine clearance by CockroftGault formula indicative of the respective level of renal impairment: Severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate renal impairment (30 ≤ CrCl ≤50 mL/min/1.73m2), mild renal impairment (50 &lt; CrCl≤80 mL/min/1.73m2) and normal renal function (CrCl &gt;80 mL/min/1.73m2). Use of any investigational drug or biologic within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit of during the screening period. Ongoing treatment with Digoxin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Uncontrolled hypertension (for renally impaired subjects only).</criteria>
