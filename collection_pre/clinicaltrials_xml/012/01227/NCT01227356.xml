	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in imatinib induced CHR are randomized between imatinib 400 mg daily and imatinib 400 mg daily + PegIntron 30 ug weekly. Primary endpoint: To compare at 12 months between the treatment arms the rate of Major Molecular Response (=99,9% tumour reduction) at 12 months</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>130 patients registered, 112 randomized. 56 pats in each treatment arm. 12 months study duration. Rate of Major Molecular Response was at 12 months 53 vs 82 % (p=0.002) in favour of the combination arm.</detailed_description>
