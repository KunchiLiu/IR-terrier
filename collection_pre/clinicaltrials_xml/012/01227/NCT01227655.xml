	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown aetiology with an estimated incidence of 4.5-16/100,000 persons/year. BIA 9-1067 is currently being developed by BIAL (Portela &amp; CÂª,S.A.) to be used in addition to L-DOPA (Levodopa) /carbidopa or L-DOPA (Levodopa) / preparations in PD patients. Promising results have been obtained for BIA 9-1067 in previous studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BIA 9-1067 used in addition to L-DOPA/DDCI to control the "wearing-off" phenomenon in patients with PD. DDCI (DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors): benserazide and carbidopa</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent form. 2. Male and female subjects between 30 and 83 years old, inclusive. 3. Diagnosed with idiopathic PD according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for at least 3 years. 4. Disease severity Stages IIII (modified Hoehn &amp;Yahr staging) at ON. 5. Treated with LDOPA/DDCI for at least 1 year with clear clinical improvement. 6. Treated with 3 to 8 daily doses of LDOPA/DDCI, which can include a slowrelease formulation. 7. On a stable regimen of LDOPA/DDCI and other antiPD drugs for at least 4 weeks before screening. 8. Signs of "wearingoff" phenomenon (endofdose deterioration) for a minimum of 4 weeks before screening with average total daily OFF time while awake of at least 1.5 hours, excluding the early morning prefirst dose OFF, despite optimal antiPD therapy (based on the investigator's judgment. 1. Nonidiopathic PD (atypical parkinsonism, secondary [acquired or symptomatic] parkinsonism, Parkinsonplus syndrome). 2. Dyskinesia disability score &gt;3 in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale UPDRS) Subsection IV A, item 33. 3. Severe and/or unpredictable OFF periods. 4. Treatment with prohibited medication: entacapone, tolcapone, neuroleptics, venlafaxine, MAO inhibitors (except selegiline up to 10 mg/day in oral formulation or 1.25 mg/day in buccal absorption formulation or rasagiline up to 1mg/day), or antiemetics with antidopaminergic action (except domperidone) within the month before screening. 5. Treatment with apomorphine within the month before screening or likely to be needed at any time during the study. 6. Dosage change of concomitant antiPD medication within 4 weeks of screening. 7. Previous or planned (during the entire study duration, including the OL period)deep brain stimulation. 8. Previous stereotactic surgery (e.g. pallidotomy, thalamotomy) for PD or with planned stereotactic surgery during the study period. 9. Any investigational medicinal product within the 3 months (or within 5 halflives, whichever is longer) before screening. 10. Any medical condition that might place the subject at increased risk or interfere with assessments.</criteria>
