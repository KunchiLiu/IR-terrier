	<brief_title>Avoiding the Hippocampus During Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate delayed recall as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVTL-R) at 4 months after hippocampal avoidance during whole-brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) in patients with brain metastasis. Secondary - Evaluate auditory and visual learning and memory, as assessed by 2 CogState tests (International Shopping List Test and One Card Learning Test), after HA-WBRT in these patients. - Compare psychometric properties of the 2 CogState tests to the HVLT-R for the assessment of memory decline after HA-WBRT in these patients. - Evaluate health-related quality of life [as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-BR) and the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)] after HA-WBRT in these patients. - Evaluate time to radiographic progression after HA-WBRT in these patients. - Evaluate overall survival of these patients after HA-WBR. - Evaluate the adverse events of HA-WBR. - Evaluate predictive biomarkers of cognitive function. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo 10 fractions of intensity-modulated whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), avoiding hippocampal (HA) regions, once daily, 5 days a week, for 2-2½ weeks. Patients neurocognitive functions (delayed recall, auditory and visual learning, and memory) are evaluated by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVTL-R), The One Card Learning Test (OCLT), and the International Shopping List Test (ISLT) at baseline and periodically during study. Patients may undergo serum, plasma, or whole blood collection at baseline and at 4 months after completion of HA-WBRT for correlative studies. Patients may complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-BR), and the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study and follow up. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
