	<brief_summary>BRF113683 is a Phase III, randomized, open-label study comparing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GSK2118436 to dacarbazine (DTIC), in subjects with BRAF mutant advanced (Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) melanoma. Subjects will be randomized to receive 150 mg of GSK2118436 twice daily or 1000 mg/m2 DTIC every 3 weeks and continue on treatment until disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event. Subjects who progress on DTIC will be allowed to crossover to an optional extension arm of the study to receive GSK2118436.</brief_summary>
