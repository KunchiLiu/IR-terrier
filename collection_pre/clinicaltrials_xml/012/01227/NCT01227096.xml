	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether electroacupuncture preconditioning would provide protection against myocardial Ischemic-Reperfusion injury and systemic inflammation in children undergoing CPB for repair of congenital heart defects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of the Effects of Electroacupuncture Preconditioning in Children Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2-12 years old children undergoing repair of congenital heart defects were included, except for those with server pulmonary arterial hypertension, chromosomal defects, airway and parenchymal lung disease, immunodeficiency, or blood disorders were excluded. Children were equal randomized to EAPC(electroacupuncture preconditioning)or control group. Electroacupuncture was administered on the bilateral P6 acupoint after anesthesia induction, but prior to surgery in EAPC group. Control patients underwent sham placement of the electrode the arm without stimulation. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp time was recorded. Myocardial injury was assessed by cardiac heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (HFAP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI&gt;0.40 ng/mL). 8-isoprostane , C-reactive protein, cytokines were measured pre- and postoperatively.</detailed_description>
