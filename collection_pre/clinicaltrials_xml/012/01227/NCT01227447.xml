	<brief_summary>The aim is to find out if adreno-muscarinic synergy is present also in human tissues of the urinary outflow tract that have a dual adrenergic-muscarinic receptor fitting. To further characterise morphology and function of the suburothelial myofibroblast network in the human bladder outlet.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Tissue will be collected from the operation theatre only after having obtained the patient´s consent and in strictest accordance with histopathological requirements, i.e. after assessment of resection margins. It might be necessary to retrieve the tissue from the pathologist after first pathological assessment is completed. Tissue will be placed in Tyrode´s solution, gassed with 95 % O2 and 5 % CO2, for functional and RTPCR or Western blot experiments, or in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) compound, snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a 80°C freezer until cutting for immunohistochemical experiments.</criteria>
