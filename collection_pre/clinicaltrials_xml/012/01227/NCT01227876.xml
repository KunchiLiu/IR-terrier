	<brief_summary>Is the primary objective of this investigation to compare the clinical efficacy of the drug test - Ster 速 (prednisolone 1% ophthalmic suspension - Union Chemicals) in the comparator - Fort 速 Pred (prednisolone 1% ophthalmic suspension - Allergan) in the control of postoperative inflammation in cataract surgery by phacoemulsification through periodic measurement of efficiency scores (number of cells in the anterior chamber, the presence of fibrin in the anterior chamber, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema and Descemet folds).</brief_summary>
