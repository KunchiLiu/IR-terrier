	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Pazopanib Monotherapy After First-line Chemotherapy in Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer in Asian Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an extension study to the VEG110655 study. The parent study, VEG110655, was designed to evaluate whether pazopanib 800 mg daily for 52 weeks will prolong progression free survival (PFS) in women diagnosed with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. These women will have obtained stable disease, a complete remission, or a partial remission after debulking surgery and at least five cycles of chemotherapy (taxane/platinum). This extension study will evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes of pazopanib monotherapy and placebo in an Asian population with the same indication as the parent study.</detailed_description>
