	<brief_title>Influence of Tightly Glucose Control on Hyperglycemic Toxicity and Protein Catabolism in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical illness is associated with increased circulating concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 which may be important mediators of insulin resistance and results in hyperglycemia. Altered glucose metabolism was caused by release of counter regulatory hormones such as glucagons; epinephrine and cortisol oppose the normal action of insulin, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle proteolysis. It did not know whether tightly glucose control had beneficial effect in urinary nitrogen excretion and nitrogen balance.</detailed_description>
