	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether MK-4827 can be safely administered in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and if so, will obtain an estimate of the benefit of the combination in patients with ovarian cancer as compared to historical data with single agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The first part of the study (Part A) is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety of MK-4827, when administered in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Part B is designed to assess preliminary clinical activity of MK-4827, when administered in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to participants with ovarian cancer. It is hypothesized that MK-4827 can be administered, in conjunction with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, with acceptable tolerability and that MK-4827, administered in conjunction with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, will demonstrate a tumor response rate equal or superior to that of historical data for pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Parts A and B: The participant has a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor and lacks curative options Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin must be an appropriate therapy or the participant has not responded to standard of care or therapies known to provide clinical benefit, or has refused such therapies or no therapy is known to provide clinical benefit Part B only: Female participants must have high grade serous ovarian cancer without curative options; pegylated liposomal doxorubicin must be an appropriate therapy. Eligible patients for Part B must have: Platinumresistant ovarian cancer, defined as tumor progression within 6 months of completing treatment with a platinumcontaining agent, OR secondary platinumrefractory ovarian cancer defined as tumor progression while on treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer after initially responding to a platinumbased chemotherapy regimen in the first line setting; and Measurable disease, OR elevated serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels at baseline, defined as a pretreatment sample that is at least twice the upper limit of normal and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment Participant has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) Performance Scale Participant must have adequate organ function Participant has no history of a prior malignancy with the exception of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease for five years, or is deemed at low risk for recurrence by his/her treating physician Parts A and B: The participant: Has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within 4 weeks of entering the study Has previously been treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin Has active central nervous system metastases or a primary central nervous system tumor Part A: Has had more than two prior chemotherapy regimens; in Part B, there is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens Is known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive Has a known history of Hepatitis B or C Has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the institutional lower limit of normal Has had prior doxorubicin exposure &gt;240 mg/m^2 (or anthracycline equivalent) Has initiated or adjusted bisphosphonate therapy/regimen within 30 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Part B only: Has been previously treated with a poly[ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor</criteria>
