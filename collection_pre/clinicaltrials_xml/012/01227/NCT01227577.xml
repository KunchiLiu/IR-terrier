	<brief_summary>"This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center study of complete molecular response (CMR) in adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). The study is designed to evaluate early and deep molecular responses up to 4 years on nilotinib treatment. The primary end point is Rate of confirmed CMR in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive CML-CP patients."</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with Ph+ CMLCP within 3 months of diagnosis. Male or female patients' â‰¥ 18 years of age. Patients must have adequate end organ function. Previously documented T315I mutation. Other CML treatment is an exclusion criteria with the following exception: While awaiting study start, patients may be treated with anagrelide (no treatment duration limit), hydroxyurea (no treatment duration limit), and/or up to a 14 day supply of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved by the FDA for frontline treatment. Patients taking a TKI prior to study entry must have at least a one day washout from their last dose of medication and have recovered from any side effects of such therapy. Impaired cardiac function as defined by the protocol. Patients with contraindications to receiving nilotinib, including concomitant medications.</criteria>
