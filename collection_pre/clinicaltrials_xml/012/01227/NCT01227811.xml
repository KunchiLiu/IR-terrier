	<brief_summary>The present study was designed to assess the bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic profiling of a brand generic formulation of darifenacin [Darisec(R)]vs. the innovator [Enablex(R)]in healthy volunteers after a high fat breakfast. The bioequivalence will be evaluated using: - the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and, - the peak plasma concentration (Cmax). Safety will be evaluated recording: - vital signs - adverse events, - laboratory analysis. - EKG and chest XRays. Bioequivalence will be claimed if the drugs comply with local regulatory requirement, eg.: - mean AUCt/AUCr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25 - mean Cmaxt/Cmaxr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Darifenacin is a muscarinic receptor antagonist drug used to treat overactive bladder. There is a new formulation of darifenacin extended release developed by an argentinian pharmaceutical company and, according to regional regulations, a bioequivalence study should be performed to put it in the market. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiling of a brand generic formulation of darifenacin [Darisec(R) 15 mg] vs. the innovator [Enablex(R) 15 mg] in 24 healthy uruguayan volunteers after a high fat breakfast of 1000 calories (50% fat, 35% carbohydrates (sugar, flour, etc.) and 15&amp; proteins) to establish their average bioequivalence. The bioequivalence will be evaluated using outcome measures that will be described later. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drugs will be described calculating: - the time to Cmax (Tmax) - the elimination constant (Ke), - the elimination half-life (t1/2e)and, - the systemic clearance (Cls. Safety will be evaluated recording: - vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) - adverse events, - laboratory analysis (hemogram, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, sugar in blood,etc.). - EKG and chest XRays. Bioequivalence will be claimed if the drugs comply with local and FDA regulatory requirement, eg.: - mean AUCt/AUCr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25 - mean Cmaxt/Cmaxr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25. Safety will be evaluated comparing incidences of adverse events/adverse effects for both products.</detailed_description>
