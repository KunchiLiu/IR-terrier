	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, open-label, single-dose, single-arm phase I-II study in which 15 patients diagnosed with gonarthrosis grade II-III (Kellgren and Lawrence) will enter the study with the primary objective of assessing the feasibility and safety of the knee articular infiltration of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires. MSC obtained from each patient's bone marrow will be isolated and expanded "Ex-Vivo" under GMP conditions at Xcelia-Divisi√≥n de Terapias avanzadas del Banc de Sang I Teixits. After 21 days, patients will be implanted a single-dose of approximately 40 millions of autologous MSC in the knee by articular injection, and followed up for 12 month. Articular cartilage changes will be determined by T2-weighted MRI (Cartigram) at 6 and 12 month. Clinical assessment will measure the pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS), the self-reported functional status by Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the quality of life by Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) at 3, 6 and 12 month. The working hypothesis proposes that the expected regenerative articular cartilage effect of the MSC will be produced to a measurable degree by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires.</brief_summary>
