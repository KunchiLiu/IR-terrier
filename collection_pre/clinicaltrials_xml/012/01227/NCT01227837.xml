	<detailed_description>Introduction: Widely used as lipid lowering agents, Omega 3 fatty acids have been demonstrated to possess the potential to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients suffering from chronic heart conditions. In this double -blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, we aim to investigate the possible beneficial effects of Omega-3 supplements on echocardiographic parameters and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma levels in patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF). Methods and Materials: 100 patients with class II and III CHF, who had tri-chamber pacemaker and automated defibrillator( CRT-AICD) were initially recruited among which 70 subjects consented to participate. Subjects were randomly assigned and matched to two treatment groups. 42 patients were allocated to a two gram/day dosing of omega-3 capsule while 28 subjects were allocated to the placebo group. Demographic features and BNP plasma levels, 6-minute walk test and echocardiographic parameters of patients were recorded at baseline and at 6 months after implementation of treatment protocols. Data were further gathered and analyzed to evaluate the beneficial effects of omega-3 supplements compared to placebo. Conclusion: Beneficial effects of Omega-3 supplementation on CHF patients were not as dramatic as initially presumed</detailed_description>
