	<brief_title>Pilot Program to Improve Statin Adherence and Lower Cholesterol in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will answer the following primary research question: 1. What is the estimated effect size of a behavioral MA intervention on MA rates in older adults who are poorly adherent to statin medications? The study will also explore the following secondary research questions: 2. What is the estimated effect size of a behavioral MA intervention on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in older adults? 3. What is the estimated effect size of a behavioral MA intervention on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in older adults? 4. What is the feasibility of successfully testing this intervention protocol in a population of older adults with low adherence to statin medications?</detailed_description>
