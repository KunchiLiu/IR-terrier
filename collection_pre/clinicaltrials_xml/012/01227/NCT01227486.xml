	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether verification of correct tube placement after endotracheal intubation in the obese patient can be conducted as fast with ultrasound as with the conventional method of combined auscultation and capnography. The investigators hypothesize that ultrasound is a faster method for verifying correct endotracheal tube placement in the obese patient than combined auscultation and capnography.</brief_summary>
