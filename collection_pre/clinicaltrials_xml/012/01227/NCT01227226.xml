	<brief_title>Tear Osmolarity Over Time With Artificial Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tear osmolarity measures the amount of solutes in the human tear film. The higher the reading, the more likely the patient has dry eyes. Some say it has "potential to be the gold standard" of dry eye testing. The investigators study the tear osmolarity at different time points after instillation of artificial tears.</detailed_description>
