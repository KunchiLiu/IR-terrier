	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of sitagliptin in suppressing glucagon release in subjects with type 1 diabetes over a 16 week treatment period. The hypothesis of this study is that sitagliptin (Januvia™) will decrease post-prandial glucagon release and may result in improved glucose control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. There is only one small, pilot study of sitagliptin in patients with type 1 diabetes which significantly reduced total daily insulin dose and A1c values while improving mean blood glucose (MBG) and time spent in euglycemic range (1). In the pilot study, GLP-1 and glucagon levels were not assessed. The purpose of this trial is to determine if sitagliptin can suppress the paradoxical rise of glucagon, and thus can decrease A1c. This study will enroll a maximum of 140 patients (with an expected 10% dropout rate) with A1c values between 7.5-10% who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either the study drug or placebo. 100 of these patients will wear a continuous glucose monitor. Subjects may be using insulin via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI). The clinic visits will be conducted at screening, -1 week, baseline/randomization, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks in addition to telephone visits (Appendix 1 and 2). At home, starting at week 0 (randomization/baseline), subjects will take 100 mg/day of sitagliptin or placebo and continue for the study duration. Laboratory analysis will be performed at various time points assessing glucagon, A1c, C-peptide, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and insulin levels.</brief_summary>
