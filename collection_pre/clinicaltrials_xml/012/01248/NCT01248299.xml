	<brief_title>Benefit of Chemotherapy Over Best Supportive Care in Metastatic and Squamous Cell-type Esophageal Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the data in litterature does not provide the basis for well-argued statistical hypothesis, it is suggested to randomize 30 patients per arm. An IDMC will come to a decision after the inclusion of 10, 20 ans 40 patients on the efficacy and the toxicity profile and on whether to maintain the current clinical position, justifying randomisation . In order to take into account any possible effects of prior concomitant radiochemotherapy, patient will be stratified according to whether they have already undergone chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy.</detailed_description>
