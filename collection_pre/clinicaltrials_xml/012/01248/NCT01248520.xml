	<brief_summary>History and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic suggest that both seasonal and pandemic influenza infections impart disproportionate morbidity and mortality among gravidas. The influenza vaccine represents a viable, preventive health intervention to mitigate disease burden for gravidas and their neonates[1,2]. Despite the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccines, suboptimal maternal vaccination rates (13-24%) persist nationwide[3]. Barriers to influenza vaccination during pregnancy include patient concerns about vaccine safety and unappreciated risk of influenza infection[4]. Cellular phone text messaging has emerged as an innovative technology with advantages of ubiquity, rapid, confidential information transmission, and low cost. Text messaging may represent an effective way to educate pregnant women about their particular vulnerability to influenza infection and enhance influenza vaccine uptake. We propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess whether text messaging to an outpatient obstetric population can improve maternal influenza vaccine uptake.</brief_summary>
