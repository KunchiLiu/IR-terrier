	<brief_summary>High Dose Rate (HDR) temporary prostate brachytherapy offers a precise form of dose escalation for prostate cancer. Needles are placed, the position is confirmed and treatment is delivered. Previously High Dose Rate prostate brachytherapy was performed under TransRectal UltraSound (TRUS) guidance but planned with Computed Tomography (CT) imaging which introduced a source of error through needle displacement while transporting and repositioning patient. Recently Varian has introduced a one-step procedure where both implant and planning are based on UltraSound imaging and performed without patient repositioning. This planning system is approved by Health Canada and is commercially available. This study will use High Dose Rate brachytherapy to treat 15 men. Treatment will be planned with TransRectal UltraSound but validated pre-treatment using Computed Tomography imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT-validation of Ultrasound Based Planning for High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate Brachytherapy Using Vitesse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, suitable for the combination of external beam radiotherapy and High Dose Rate brachytherapy will be entered in this study. High Dose Rate brachytherapy will be performed using TransRectal UltraSound guidance and then planned using both cone-beam Computed Tomography and TransRectal UltraSound. Planning by Computed Tomography is to check the reliability and reproducibility of UltraSound imaging to correctly identify the needle positions. Correct needle localization is essential because this is the basis for determining source dwell positions, dose calculation and dose optimization.</detailed_description>
