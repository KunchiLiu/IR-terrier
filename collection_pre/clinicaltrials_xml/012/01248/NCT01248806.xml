	<detailed_description>Lung carcinoma is one the most fatal cancer in the world. The enormous fatality rate reflects the limited chance of cure, with a dismal overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 14%. The prognosis of lung cancer depends largely on early detection and immediate treatment prior to metastatic spread. For Stage 1 lung cancer the 5-year survival rate can be as high as 70% . These data suggest that early detection and surgical treatment would have a huge beneficial effect on the lung cancer population. We developed a single arm observational study for the early detection of lung cancer with low dose CT scan in high risk asymptomatic subjects. A mainly non invasive algorithm for management of undetermined nodules was designed including low dose CT at three months for baseline nodules with diameter between 5 and 8 mm, a PET scan for nodules larger that 8 mm (not reduced after antibiotics and one month follow up CT). Lesions increasing in diameter or in density or positive nodules at CT/PET were sent to surgical biopsy (videothoracoscopic approach preferred). Spirometry was done in all subjects prior to CT scan to evaluate correlation between BPCO and lung cancer.</detailed_description>
