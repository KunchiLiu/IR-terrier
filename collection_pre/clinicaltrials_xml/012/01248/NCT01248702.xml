	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a critical pathway to identify patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who are candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). This study will also determine whether the use of the critical pathway for ICDs is associated with a change in the ICD referral and implantation rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Critical Pathway for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvements in both medical management and revascularization strategies, sudden death is still a significant complication in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. There is strong evidence to support the role of ICDs for the primary prevention of sudden death in this population. However, in Canada and the United States, ICDs are underutilized. Critical pathways are algorithms that improve health care delivery and clinical outcomes while reducing practice variability. The use of a critical pathway to assess a patient's eligibility for an ICD may increase the appropriate use of this evidence-based technology.</detailed_description>
