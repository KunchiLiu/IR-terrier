Eligibility was limited to patients with age greater than 20. Outcome measures were improvement in symptom score. Outcome predictors studied included quality of relationships, measured with a Quality of Relationship Inventory and attribution of IBS to physical or emotional cause, measured with a Mind-Body IBS Questionnaire, both administered before onset of hypnotherapy.</detailed_description>
