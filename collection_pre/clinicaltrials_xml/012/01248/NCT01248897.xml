	<mesh_term>Lapatinib</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. HER2positive (defined as either (a) IHC3+ or (b) FISH+ in local lab) recurrent / metastatic breast cancer patients who have received treatment with lapatinibbased regimen. These are either new, current or completed cases from any of the following settings: treated according to physician's clinical judgement in routine practice; or treated in clinical trials with known allocation to lapatinibbased regimen; or treated via lapatinib expanded access or named patient programs. These regimens should contain lapatinib as the only antiHER2 agent. 2. Exposed to &lt; 2 lines of trastuzumabbased regimen in the metastatic setting prior to start of lapatinibbased regimen. These regimens should contain trastuzumab as the only antiHER2 agent. 3. Patients with an historical tumor biopsy specimen available from their primary breast cancer diagnosis. If this is not available, then at least a specimen should be available anytime during the period before the patient started on any antiHER2 therapy. 4. Willing to give written informed consent to release the tumor biopsy specimen with corresponding clinical data. If consent could be waived according to institutional practice (eg. patient already deceased, or patient previously provided blanket consent for institution to utilize tissue/data for research purpose), this is accepted with appropriate supporting documentation. 1. Patients who have been exposed to other experimental antiHER2 therapy eg. pertuzumab, trastuzumabDM, neratinib, ertumaxomab, AV412, BIBW2992, CUDC101, antiHER2 vaccines. 2. Other primary lesions that are not of breast origin.</criteria>
