	<brief_summary>Older people tend to live a sedentary lifestyle which causes a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness, impaired postural stability and a increased risk of falls. Social isolation of older people leads to depression and other mental diseases. However, numerous studies show that age-related degradation processes and functional limitations can be counteracted by physical activity. Various studies show that alpine skiing is a complex sport that places demands on the cardiorespiratory, neuromuscular and sensorimotor systems. With studies providing evidence to suggest alpine skiing is an appropriate activity for elderly as a health-enhancing sport, perhaps Alpine skiing could provide the physical activity needed to counteract age-related degradation processes and loss of function. To date, there is a lack of long-term intervention studies devoted to this topic. The aim of this study was to monitor the long-term effects of skiing on the health of older people, as to age-related muscle breakdown, cardiorespiratory fitness, body stability, general mobility and the overall psychological state of the subjects.</brief_summary>
