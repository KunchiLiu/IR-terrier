	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine the effective lens position (ELP) - or location an intraocular lens (IOL) "sits" in the eye - of the Softec HD IOL. A secondary study goal is to determine if measures of the eye taken prior to surgery can reliably predict postoperative ELP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Effective Lens Position With a Uniplanar Bi-aspheric IOL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the effective lens position (ELP) of the study lens, and to report the stability of ELP post-operatively. Additionally, correlations of ELP to predicted postoperative lens position, capsular bag metrics, preoperative biometry and age will be statistically analyzed for determination of ELP prediction via one, or a combination of preoperative variables.</detailed_description>
