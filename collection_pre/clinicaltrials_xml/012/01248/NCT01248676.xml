	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Usability and Usefulness of a Multi-language Online Patient Education Module</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research shows that treatment-related information is the most important informational need of cancer patients and online media sources are gaining popularity as a cancer communication method. It is important to know whether having multi-language online education modules are usable for and beneficial to the multicultural cancer patient population at Sunnybrook Hospital, given that recent research suggests that this cancer population in general faces many barriers to effective online cancer communication. Approximately 10 new patients from the radiation oncology clinic at Sunnybrook Hospital will be screened to participate in the study. Usability testing will involve a combination of interviewing, observation, think-aloud methodology and a short survey.Results will be analyzed by assessing the percentage of patients identifying with a certain level of the Likert scale on the survey as well as through content analysis of responses to the interview and open-ended survey questions.</detailed_description>
