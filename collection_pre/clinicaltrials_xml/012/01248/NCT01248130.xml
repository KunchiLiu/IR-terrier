	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of short-term omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy in youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The investigators hypothesize that Omega-3 fatty acids will be efficacious in improving the core and associated features of ASD in youth, and that Omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy will be safe and well tolerated by youth with ASD. The secondary aim of this study is to examine the neuropsychological effect of Omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy in youth with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acids will be efficacious in improving cognitive functions in youth with ASD.</brief_summary>
