	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of ICT-107 in treating a type of brain tumor called Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). ICT-107 is an immunotherapy in which the patient's immune response will be stimulated to kill the tumor cells. Patients must be newly diagnosed with GBM and not yet received chemoradiation. Some of the patient's white blood cells (WBC) will be removed and cultured in a laboratory with purified antigens, similar to those on GBM cells. The patient's own WBC/DC that have been exposed to the tumor antigens will then be given back to the patient as a vaccine over several months. The goal is for the ICT-107 vaccine to stimulate the patient's immune response to kill the remaining GBM tumor cells after surgery and chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of ICT-107 Immunotherapy in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed phase 2 study is a randomized, double blind, controlled study of the safety and efficacy of ICT-107 in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following resection and chemoradiation. The phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated safety and promising efficacy in a small, open-label study. The purpose of this study is to provide information from a larger, controlled clinical trial. Patients must be newly diagnosed with GBM and not yet received chemoradiation. Patients will have had tumor resection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tumor assessment prior to enrollment into the study. Post surgical treatment consists of 6 weeks of chemotherapy (TMZ) and radiation followed by a washout period. After Screening and informed consent, patients will undergo apheresis at the study site for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Apheresis product will be sent to a central site where monocytes will be purified and cultured into dendritic cells (DC). DC will be pulsed with synthetic peptides that correspond to immunogenic epitopes of tumor antigens. The pulsed dendritic cells will then be aliquoted and frozen before shipping back to the site. Patients will have the autologous DCs reinfused intradermally. A control group will receive unpulsed autologous DC. Patients will be randomized by age in a 2:1 ratio to ICT-107 or control.Patients will receive at least four intradermal injections of the ICT-107 vaccine and additional vaccine during a maintenance phase. The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in patients when treated with ICT-107 versus Control.</detailed_description>
