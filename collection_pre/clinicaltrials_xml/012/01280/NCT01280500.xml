	<brief_summary>The overall goal is to identify best practices for improving health outcomes for patients with asthma using comparative effectiveness research within an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN). This goal will be achieved by completing the following aims: (1) Create a centralized database for comparative effectiveness research on asthma by combining clinical and billing data from one of the largest healthcare systems in the country (Carolinas Healthcare System) with data from the school system, Medicaid, and patient and community-level datasets; (2) Deploy a fully developed integrated approach to asthma management based on the Chronic Care Model; (3) Develop and implement a "shared decision making" approach for asthmatic patients from disadvantaged backgrounds; (4) Implement an electronic data collection system for an existing CDC funded school-based asthma intervention that will allow program evaluation and link school nurses with providers; (5) Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these three asthma management strategies on: overall healthcare consumption and medical costs; quality of life, school absenteeism and performance; asthma clinical measures; and medication utilization; and (6) Disseminate findings across the state via the statewide PBRN and other network partners. This project has the potential to impact over 30,000 asthma patients across the Carolinas including many patients from disadvantaged backgrounds.</brief_summary>
