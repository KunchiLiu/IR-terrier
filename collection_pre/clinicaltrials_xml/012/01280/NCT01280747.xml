	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that fibromyalgia (FM) and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) patients with access restrictions on pregabalin will lead to higher healthcare resource use and cost compared to patients without such restrictions on pregabalin in a naturalistic setting. The randomization will occur at the physician level and not the patient level.</brief_summary>
