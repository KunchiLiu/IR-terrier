	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to assess if use of aromatase inhibitors could decrease volume of uterine leiomyoma and cause same percentage of adverse effects during its use compared to GnRH analogs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Aromatase Inhibitors and GnRH Analogs to Treat Uterine Leiomyoma by Vaginal Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma is the most prevalent benign gynecologic tumor in women. Standard treatment is surgical (hysterectomy or myomectomy), and depends of many variables. If these tumors are large, preoperative assessment with clinical treatment may be useful in order to decrease its volume, improve hematologic patterns and modify surgical approach (vaginal or abdominal). It is well know that GnRH analogs can cause these goals; however, aromatase inhibitors are new promising drugs which are being used for reducing uterine leiomyoma's volume and few observational studies have shown this fact. The investigators are aiming to compare both treatments in a randomized controlled trial and see if it both treatments are similar or not in decreasing uterine leiomyoma's volume, influencing operative time, blood loss during surgery.</detailed_description>
