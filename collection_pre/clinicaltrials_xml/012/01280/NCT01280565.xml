	<brief_summary>Masitinib is a novel TKI that potently inhibits wild type (WT) c-kit and its activated form, mutated in the juxtamembrane region (JM c-kit) PDGFRs, the intracellular kinase Lyn, and to a lesser extent fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Pre-clinical data suggest that masitinib is a strong candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma carrying a c-kit JM mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib to Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Non-Resectable or Metastatic Stage 3 or Stage 4 Melanoma Carrying a Mutation in the Juxta Membrane Domain of C-Kit</brief_title>

	<criteria>Patient with histologically or cytologically confirmed nonresectable or metastatic stage 3 (nonresectable IIIB or IIIC, AJCC TNM staging system 7th edition) or stage 4 melanoma Patient with detectable ckit JM mutation confirmed by DNA or RNA sequencing, which is expected to be mainly found after screening of mucosal or acral melanoma or melanoma on skin with chronic suninduced damages (defined by a microscopically marked elastosis involving the skin surrounding their primary melanoma) Patient with measurable disease according to RECIST Patient with ECOG ≤ 2 Patient with other malignancies from which the patient has been continuously diseasefree for &lt; 3 years, with the exception of melanoma, cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast Patient with active brain metastases are not eligible. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if : presence of 3 brain lesions or less lesion(s) diameter is ≤ 2 cm radiation therapy (gamma knife) was completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to baseline surgery was completed ≥4 weeks prior to baseline lesions assessed by followup scan (or MRI if MRI performed before brain therapy) ≥ 1 month after brain therapy are considered under control at baseline Patient refractory to dacarbazine defined as patient presenting a disease progression after 3 months of dacarbazine therapy. Prior treatment with a tyrosine kinase ckit inhibitor</criteria>
