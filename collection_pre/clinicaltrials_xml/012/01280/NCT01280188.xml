	<criteria>Participants must be documented to have Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) by at least two of the following four criteria (ad): 1. Failure to increase urine osmolality above 300 mOsm/kg during a period of fluid deprivation sufficient to raise plasma osmolality and sodium above the upper limit of normal level for the reference laboratory (usually 295 mOsm/kg and 148 mEq/l, respectively) 2. Complete and continuous control of the DI by desmopressin therapy without "breakthrough" diuresis, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, or symptoms or signs of water intoxication. 3. A deficient plasma vasopressin response to osmotic or nonosmotic stimulation. 4. Absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot on T1 weighted midsagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Given written informed consent prior to any trialrelated procedure is performed 24 hour urine volume (mL), urine osmolality (mOsm/kg), urine specific gravity, and serum sodium (mEq/L) maintained at a normal level by desmopressin nasal administration Outpatient The participant is, in the investigator's opinion, otherwise healthy Be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements including restriction of water intake Presence or a history of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus Presence of uncorrected hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism or hypogonadism Abnormalities or disease of the oral cavity that might affect the release and absorption of drug Unable to be placed on waterintake restriction starting from two hours before bedtime Presence of a hypothalamus abnormality leading to thirst disorder Evidence of hepatic, renal, cardiac, or pulmonary dysfunction Uncontrolled hypertension Treatment with another investigational product within the past 3 months Concurrent treatment with diuretics, chlorpropamide, tricyclic antidepressants, indomethacin, carbamazepine Alcohol dependency or drug abuse Breastfeeding, pregnant, or likely to become pregnant A mental condition, the lack of decisionmaking ability, dementia or a speech handicap Any other reason that the Investigator believes inappropriate</criteria>
