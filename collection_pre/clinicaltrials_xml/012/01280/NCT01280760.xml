	<brief_summary>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been proposed to reduce the incidence of ventilatory dysfunction following mechanical ventilation weaning. However, the nasogastric tube reduces the airtightness of the facial mask used to perform non-invasive ventilation and induces air leaks. The presence of leaks at the patient-mask interface can increase the risk of patient-ventilator asynchrony, which in turn leads to increase patient discomfort. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA)could contribute to decreasing asynchrony. Its principle is to record the diaphragmatic electrical activity and to control the ventilator. The investigators hypothesized driving the ventilator based on a neural signal (diaphragm electrical activity) would reduce patient-ventilator asynchronies in NIV</brief_summary>
