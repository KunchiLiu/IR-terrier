	<brief_title>Malaria Active Epidemiology and Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an active observational Cohort Study of malaria epidemiology with a nested two arm, randomized, open label Treatment Study comparing the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a two versus three day course of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for those developing uncomplicated malaria. At the conclusion of the Cohort Study, a subset of volunteers with documented exposure to Plasmodium vivax during the study will be treated with primaquine as presumptive anti-relapse therapy directed against the exoerythrocytic malaria stages of P. vivax, and followed passively for an additional 6 months.</detailed_description>
