	<detailed_description>Even though behavioral modification therapy seems to be effective, it is not usually recommended for patients with nocturia because much patience and understanding is required for the patients to follow the therapy. Few studies have reported the efficacy of repetitive education for behavioral modification as the first-line therapy for patients with nocturia and nocturnal polyuria (NPU). Furthermore, no report demonstrated the evidence about how many times or how long the education for behavioral therapy should be performed and how long will the education effect would continue. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of repetitive education for behavioral modification as the first-line therapy in the patients with NPU and to show whether a single education for behavioral modification is sufficient for the patients.</detailed_description>
