	<brief_summary>This study is an open label, multicenter study with two phases: - A dose escalation phase of Romidepsin administered IV at day 1 and 8 or at day 1 without day 8 in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)administered every 3 weeks for 8 cycles in patients with T-cell lymphoma. - An expansion phase in order to assess the safety and the efficacy of the association of the recommended dose of Romidepsin associated with CHOP in a population of patients with T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Escalating Doses of Romidepsin in Association With CHOP in the Treatment of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of the combination and the recommended dose (RD) of Romidepsin when administered in association with CHOP in a population of patients with newly diagnosed Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) as measured by the toxicities during treatment. Secondary objectives: - To assess the safety of the association Romidepsin and CHOP, - To assess the efficacy of the association of Romidepsin and CHOP: response rate and complete response rate, progression-free survival, response duration and overall survival.</detailed_description>
