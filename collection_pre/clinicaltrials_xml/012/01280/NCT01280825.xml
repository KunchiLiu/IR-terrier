	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect DNA samples from patients undergoing routine care at the University of Chicago. These samples will be tested for differences in genes that may suggest greater risk of side effects or chance of increased benefit from certain medications. The results will be made available to the patient's treating physician and the researchers will track whether or not this information is used in routine health care.</brief_summary>
