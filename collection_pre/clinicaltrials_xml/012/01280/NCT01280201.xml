	<brief_summary>The incidence of new diagnosed patients with NET of the digestive tract including carcinoid and pancreatic islet cells tumors ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the western Countries (Kulke M, Mayer R. N Engl J Med 340:858-868, 1999). Despite of the low incidence, the prevalence of these tumors is high because of their relatively long survival estimated in 35% at 5 years for those patients with well or moderate differentiated tumors (Yao JC, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:3063-3072). In fact, digestive NETs are the second most prevalent tumors derived from the digestive tract after colorectal carcinoma. NETs are characterized by abundant vasculature, moreover VEGFR and VEGFR are overexpressed in 60-84% of the carcinoids and pancreatic islet cells NETs (Zhang et al. Cancer 2007;109:1478-1486). Other pro-angiogenic factors like the platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR) have been also involved in NET progression and development (Chaudhry A, et al.Cancer Res 1992;52:1006-12). Pazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR, PDGFR and KIT with a dual activity both as an antiangiogenic and also and anti-tumoral agent (Kumar et al. Mol Cancer Ther2007;6:2012-2021, Hurwitz et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:4220-4227). Pazopanib seems to have a better toxicity profile versus the other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and has already shown activity in several tumor types like renal cell carcinoma (Sternberg et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 5021), soft tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:3126-32), hepatocellular carcinoma (Yau et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3561), colorectal cancer (Brady et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst.4133), and thyroid cancers (Bible et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3521). The Spanish Group for Research in Neuroendocrine Tumors (GETNE) group is an active Member inside of the GENET group and has a large tradition in clinical trials in NETs. The investigators hypothesize that pazopanib may have at least as good activity and better safety profile than other VEGFR inhibitors in progressive advanced or metastatic NET tumors derived from the digestive tract.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must provide signed informed consent form prior to performance of studyspecific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow‑up. Procedures conducted as part of the subject's clinical routine (e.g., blood count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing the consent form might be used for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures have been conducted as specified in the protocol. 2. Age ≥ 18 years. 3. Diagnosis of pancreatic islet cell tumors, well differentiated gastrointestinal NETs, pulmonary carcinoids and well differentiated thymic carcinoids. Locallyadvanced or metastatic disease documented as progressive by CT scan, MRI, or Octreoscan at baseline and within 12 months prior to baseline. The previous scans will be used to classify the patient as having progressive disease at baseline according to RECIST criteria. Octreoscan results may be used to document progressive disease at baseline, but not for RECIST determination during the study. 4. ECOG performance status 01. 5. Disease not amenable to surgery, radiation or combined modality therapy with curative intent. 6. Presence of at least one dimensionally measurable target lesion for further evaluation according to RECIST 1.0 criteria (contrast enhancing lesion with the largest diameter &gt; 1cm, based on CT or MRI scan done within 4 weeks before the start of treatment). 7. Patients could have received treatment with somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, antiVEGF, and antimTOR agents previously to the entrance into this study if the final toxicity was grade ≤ 1. 8. From patients who sign an informed consent form to donate biological samples: Tumor tissue must be provided for all available subjects at baseline and serum samples will be collected at baseline and at week 12 of treatment for biomarker analysis as defined at the biomarker section of this protocol. 9.
