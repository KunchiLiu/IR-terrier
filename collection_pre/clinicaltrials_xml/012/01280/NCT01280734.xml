The subject has taken these IMPs earlier in this clinical study. 8. The subject has known hypersensitivity to the melatonin, zolpidem or their excipients. 9. The subject has a history of severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity. 10. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. 11. The subject has a presence or history of sleep disorder, fainting, cardiovascular diseases, carotid sinus syndrome, relevant dizziness or arrhythmia. 12.
