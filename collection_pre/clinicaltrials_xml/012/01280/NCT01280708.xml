	<brief_summary>The aim of project DIVAT-URO (Données Informatisées et Validées en Transplantation - Urology) is to organize a thematic network in urology traced on NetWork DIVAT to supplement the medical and biological data of DIVAT existing cohort with parameters of surgical transplantation of kidney and pancreas. These data will concern the transplantation itself and the events and complications related to surgery occurring throughout the follow-up. The collection will involve patients in the cohort DIVAT and future patients. This project will allow us to have the sufficiency of surgical transplantation by increasing the quantity and quality of information gathered thus avoiding the biases commonly upbraided against the retrospective studies. Finally, by supplementing it with new parameters, it will strengthen the medical and scientific interest of the cohort DIVAT and will open new perspectives for clinical trials in surgery and work in epidemiology.Networking of urologists and the expansion of the base DIVAT would carry out research in epidemiology and factors that may play a role in the outcome of renal and pancreatic transplantation. It would also help to define good practices. The first study from the proposed network DIVAT-Uro is assessing the impact of vesico-ureteric reflux on the occurrence of urinary tract infections and effects on survival of the transplant in the recipient adult.</brief_summary>
