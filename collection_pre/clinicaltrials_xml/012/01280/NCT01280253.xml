	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to identify biochemical predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from hip fracture. For this purpose blood samples are collected prehospitally or in the emergency department in patients with a suspected hip fracture. During the hospital stay medical history, anesthesiological management recorded. In addition, american society of anesthesiology physiological score (ASA), revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), and POSSUM score is calculated. Morbidity and mortality is recorded " in house", after 30 days, after 4 months and after 1 year. Biochemical predictors of outcome will be evaluated with logistic regression analysis. Biochemical predictors include pro-brain natriuretic peptide, lactate, pro-calcitonin, adrenomedullin, copeptin, cystatin c. The predictive value of the potential markers will be compared to that of ASA, RCRI and POSSUM.</brief_summary>
