	<brief_summary>The drug being tested is called VigantOL® oil - a very effective form of Vitamin D hormone supplement (cholecalciferol). Low levels of Vitamin D have been described to be associated with a higher risk of developing Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and it is known that up to 90% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis have Vitamin D deficiency. Rebif® is known to be an effective treatment for slowing down the progression of MS. The purpose of this research trial is to evaluate if VigantOL® oil on top of Rebif® has any benefit on the progression of MS compared to Rebif® and placebo. Disease activity will be assessed by clinical examination and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The planned study treatment duration for each study participant is 48 weeks, and the study consists of a total of 8 visits. Study participants who are already passed Week 48 at the time of approval of Protocol Amendment 5 will have a study duration of 96 weeks and a total of 12 visits. During the study, the participant will undergo physical examination, neurological assessments, safety assessments, blood tests and urinalysis (including pregnancy tests).</brief_summary>
