	<brief_summary>Part A- The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY2801653 to be given to participants with advanced cancer and to determine any side effects that may be associated with LY2801653 in this participant population. Efficacy measures will be used to assess the activity of LY2801653. Part B- The dose determined in Part A will be used along with efficacy measures to assess the activity of LY2801653 in participants with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), uveal melanoma with liver metastasis, and cholangiocarcinoma. Part C - the objective of Part C is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with HNSCC when taken with standard doses of cetuximab Part D - the objective of Part D is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with cholangiocarcinoma when taken with a standard dose of cisplatin. Part E - the objective of Part E is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with cholangiocarcinoma when taken with gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Part F - the objective of Part F is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with gastric cancer when taken with ramucirumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part A Diagnosed with advanced and/or metastatic cancer during dose escalation Part B Diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, uveal melanoma with liver with metastasis, or cholangiocarcinoma Part C Diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and have received at least one prior platinumbased systemic therapy Part D Diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma and have not received more than 1 prior systemic therapy Part E Diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, either intrahepatic or extrahepatic, that is unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic. Participants must not have received prior systemic front line therapy for metastatic or resectable disease (i.e. participants may have received adjuvant gemcitabine but have not yet received gemcitabine/cisplatin for recurrent metastatic disease). Participants must be, in the opinion of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy. Participants should be evaluated for the need to undergo biliary drainage by stent placement prior to study participation. Participants should have adequate biliary drainage with no unresolved biliary obstruction. Part F Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed gastric carcinoma, including gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma (participants with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus are eligible if the primary tumor involves the GEJ). Participants must be ramucirumab na√Øve. Participants must be, in the opinion of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy. human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu status should be documented, if known. Must be at least 18 years of age Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver functions Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 or 1 Ability to swallow capsules, with the exception of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma participants who may have study drug crushed and administered through a feeding tube Have serious preexisting medical conditions that would preclude participation in the study Have a chronic underlying infection Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis Have current acute or chronic leukemia Are pregnant or lactating Have hepatocellular cancer, liver cirrhosis with a ChildPugh stage of B or higher, or have received a liver transplant Have a history of congestive heart failure with a New York Heart Association class greater than 2, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of study enrollment), transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or arterial or venous vascular disease Have a QTc interval greater than 470 msec For participants in Part B, C, D, E, and F, a tumor tissue sample is mandatory, when safe and feasible, for biomarker analysis</criteria>
