	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the pain experience of patients who have not had dermatologic procedures (previously "unexposed") using energy devices (lasers, radiofrequency, ultrasound, etc.) with patients who have previously had procedures (previously "exposed") using energy devices. Based on previous clinical encounters, individuals with no prior experience with cosmetic procedures appear to experience more pain. However, no study to date has thoroughly examined this observation. As a result, this study has been designed to find a possible difference in pain perception between previously exposed and unexposed patients undergoing cosmetic procedures using energy devices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the Pain Experience Between Patients Who Have and Who Have Not Undergone Dermatologic Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty subjects will be enrolled in the study: 10 subjects who have had cosmetic procedures in the past and 10 subjects who have not had such procedures. For each subject, pain tolerance in three areas will be assessed: temple, midface/cheek, and abdomen. In two areas of the face (temple and midface/cheek), a small sterile needle will be inserted into the skin along with three applications of the following devices that are FDA approved for use on the face: an ultrasound device (Ulthera), a pulsed dye laser (VBeam), and a radiofrequency (Thermage) device. Additionally, the abdomen will receive three of these four devices in a randomized order: small sterile needle insertion, a pulsed dye laser (VBeam) pulse, and a radiofrequency (Thermage) exposure (the ultrasound device, Ulthera, will not be used on the abdomen because it is currently not FDA approved for this indication). Subjects will then be asked to rate their pain after each application at each individual site using a pain scale. In addition, subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding their pain experiences and other possibly related factors before and after the procedures.</detailed_description>
