	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to compare the oxygenation index (OI), dyspnea, and pain scale and evaluate the duration of thoracic drainage and pleural air leaks after lung resection in two groups of patients: chest physiotherapy (CP) patients and combined CP and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CPAP as Intervention After Lung Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pulmonary resection surgery complications that lead to significant functional losses of the lung parenchyma and alterations in the ventilatory function may trigger retention of secretions, atelectasis, pneumonia and respiratory failure, which prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalisation and contribute to the increase in risk of mortality. In this study the oxygenation index (OI), Borg Scale, pain scale and the presence and duration of thoracic drainage was determined in the immediate postoperative (POi) period and in the first and second postoperative (PO1, PO2) days in 40 patients who underwent elective lung resection. Similar to Chest Physiotherapy, the preventive application of CPAP in the postoperative period after lung resection in our study also appeared to be a safe technique, which allowed improved oxygenation without increasing air leaks through the thoracic drains.</detailed_description>
