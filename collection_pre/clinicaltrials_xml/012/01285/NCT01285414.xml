	<brief_summary>This, international, multi-center, Phase 2 study of verubulin will be conducted in patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is an open-label dose finding study that will determine the safety and tolerability of verubulin in combination with standard treatment. Part B is a randomized open-label study that will investigate progression-free survival and overall survival of patients receiving verubulin, at the dose determined in Part A, in combination with standard treatment versus standard treatment alone.</brief_summary>
