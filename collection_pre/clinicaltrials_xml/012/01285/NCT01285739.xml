	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine occurrence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in tracheostomized patients with COPD discharged in invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) compared to patients with CPOPD discharged with tracheostomy but in non invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tracheostomized COPD Patients and Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory failure due to COPD is often treated with invasive mechanical ventilation through endotracheal intubation, followed by placement of a endotracheal canula. However, invasive ventilation is at risk of infective complications and is difficult to manage at home. In particular, invasive mechanical ventilation may be associated with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is usually suspected when the individual develops a new or progressive infiltrate on chest radiograph, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial secretions. When possible, we tried to put these tracheotomized patients in non invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV)to avoid VAP. This population was followed for eight consecutive years and compared with patients in invasive home mechanical ventilation (IMV).</detailed_description>
