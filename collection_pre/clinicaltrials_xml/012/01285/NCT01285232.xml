	<brief_summary>Rationale: Once diabetes develops, β-cell function progressively deteriorates and therapeutic approaches that prevent of delay loss of β-cell function are needed in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent findings suggest that interleukin-1 (IL-1) may be involved in the progressive β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objective: to determine whether blocking IL-1β by recombinant human IL-1ra (anakinra) improves beta-cell function in subjects with β-cell dysfunction.</brief_summary>
