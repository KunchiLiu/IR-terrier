	<brief_summary>Excess visceral fat is a key factor in the development of metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. After bariatric surgery, patients experience weight loss accompanied by a decrease in the amount of total body fat. It is unclear how the different surgical procedures vary in their effect on the visceral and subcutaneous fat change. Ultrasonography (US) is an effective, efficient method in assessing this metabolically active layer of fat even when compared with gold standard techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Only a few studies managed to show the actual decrease in the visceral fat layer after these kinds of surgeries. The aim is to compare by ultrasound evaluation the extent of fat layers reduction after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The hypothesis is that the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass being not only a restrictive procedure but also a malabsorptive procedure will have the best results in decreasing the amount of visceral fat.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>excess visceral fat is a key factor in the development of metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. After bariatric surgery, patients experience weight loss accompanied by a decrease in the amount of total body fat. It is unclear how the different surgical procedures vary in their effect in reducing the amount of the visceral fat layer . Ultrasonography (US) is an effective, efficient method in assessing this metabolically active layer of fat even when compared with gold standard techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Only a few studies managed to show the actual decrease in the visceral fat layer after these kinds of bariatric surgeries. The aim is to compare by ultrasound evaluation the extent of fat layers reduction after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Visceral fat (VF) will be defined as the depth, in centimeters, from the rectus abdominis muscle to the aorta; and subcutaneous fat (SCF) defined as the depth, in centimeters, from the skin to the rectus abdominis muscle. Results will be compared with anthropometric measures as weight and waist circumference as well as laboratory results to try and find correlation between sonographic improvement and anthropometric and laboratory improvement. The hypothesis is that the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass being not only a restrictive procedure but also a malabsorptive procedure will have the best results in decreasing the amount of visceral fat.</detailed_description>
