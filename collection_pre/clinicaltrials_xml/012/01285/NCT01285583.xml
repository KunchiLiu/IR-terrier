	<brief_summary>The purpose of the assay is to assess the safety of TRO19622 330 mg QD as add-on therapy to riluzole 50 mg bid in the treatment of patients suffering from ALS, after completion of the preceding clinical trial (TRO19622 CL E Q 1015-1) in an open label extension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Extension Study of TRO19622 in ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Entry of a patient into this safety study is intended to occur immediately after the patient has finished participating in the preceding efficacy study (Protocol TRO19622 CL E Q 1015-1). The Investigator will explain to the patients the nature of this open-label safety study, its procedures, requirements and restrictions so as to obtain their written informed consent. Each patient will be treated with olesoxime (TRO19622) until the results of the double-blind trial become available with a maximum of 15 months. Follow-up visits will take place every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks). Safety assessments will be performed at all visits (every 3 months).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have completed the 18month safety and efficacy study of TRO19622 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients treated with riluzole (Protocol TRO19622 CL E Q 10151). Both the investigator and the patient will decide based on previous good tolerance and other clinical grounds whether or not to participate to the openlabel extension. If patients were on antivitamin K during the doubleblind period, when entering the openlabel extension, coagulation tests should be monitored in exactly the same conditions as if a new anticoagulant treatment was initiated and the dose of antivitamin K should be adjusted accordingly. Patients enrolling from this prior safety and efficacy study must: If female of childbearing age of potential, continue to use adequate birth control methods and have a negative serum pregnancy test at the preceding doubleblind protocol termination visit. Male and female partners must agree to use an effective method of birth control during their participation in the trial and for at least 15 days after the last IMP dose. Both partners must use reliable methods of contraception with 2 independent methods. The following measures are acceptable: Hormone contraceptives (e.g. oral contraceptives or comparable methods), intrauterine device, condoms with spermicidal coating or in combination with spermicidal creams, total abstinence or sterilisation performed in the past. Be able to follow the investigator's instructions and be able to comply with the visit schedule and visit requirements; and Sign a written informed consent. Patients may not participate in this study if they have an ongoing, unresolved, clinically significant medical problem (including patients having experienced serious adverse events or nonserious, but medically significant adverse events during the preceding safety and efficacy study that was assessed to be related to the study medication by the investigator) that in the judgment of the investigator would make it unsafe for the patient to participate in the trial.</criteria>
