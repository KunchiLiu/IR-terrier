	<brief_summary>Steel triple innominate osteotomy was designed for dysplastic hip in adolescents and young adults with three incisions to increase the coverage; however the amount of correction remained questionable due to ligamentous attachments that hinder the rotation. The investigators modified the technique with two anterior incisions and ramus cuts close to inferior acetabulum. The purpose of this study is to compare these two techniques in femoral head coverage</brief_summary>
