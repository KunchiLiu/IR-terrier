	<brief_summary>The safety and preliminary efficacy of the addition of an aqueous curcumin-cyclodextrin complex (CDC) solution to graft perfusion solution is studied. CDC has proved safe and highly effective in preventing primary graft non-function, delayed graft function and chronic dysfunction in pre-clinical kidney transplantation animal models. The hypothesis is that addition of CDC to the graft perfusion solution will decrease the incidence of delayed graft function in human kidney transplantation subjects.</brief_summary>
