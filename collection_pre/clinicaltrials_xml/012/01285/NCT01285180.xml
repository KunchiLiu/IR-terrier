	<brief_summary>Daxas (roflumilast) is the first oral anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE-4) for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experiencing chronic cough and sputum and with a history of exacerbations as add-on to bronchodilator treatment. With its mode of action Daxas can reduce exacerbations rates and improve lung function parameters which may result in a better health-related quality of life and an improved long-term management of COPD. The aim of this non-interventional study is to evaluate data on quality of life in COPD patients in Germany in a real life medical setting. Evaluation is based on two COPD specific questionnaires to assess the patient`s health status over six months. During the study, socio-demographic data and cost-of-illness data will be recorded. Daxas (tablet) will be administered once daily. The study will provide further data on the safety and tolerability of Daxas.</brief_summary>
