	<criteria>1. Subject is informed of the investigational nature of this study and voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent prior to performing any of the screening procedures 2. Healthy Korean male volunteers, age ranged 20 to 45 years (both inclusive) 3. A subject with body weight between 60 kg (inclusive) and 90 kg (exclusive) and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 (inclusive) and 25 (exclusive). ☞ BMI (kg/m2) = weight (kg) / {height (m)}2 4. Findings within the range of clinical acceptability in medical history and physical examination, and laboratory results within the laboratory reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests (unless the investigator considers the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study) 1. A subject with history of allergies including drug allergies (aspirin, antibiotics, etc.), or history of clinically significant allergies 2. A subject with clinical evidence or history of hepatic (including carrier of hepatitis virus), renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurologic, immunologic, hematologic, oncologic, psychiatric, or cardiovascular disease 3. A subject with history of gastrointestinal disease or surgery (except simple appendectomy or repair of hernia), which can influence the absorption of the study drug 4. A subject whose hemoglobin(Hb) level &lt; 12 g/dL 5. A subject with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level ≤ 70 mg/dL or ≥ 126 mg/dL 6. A subject with HbA1c level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L 7. A subject whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤ 40 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg or pulse rate (PR) ≥ 100 /min after at least 5 min sitting 8. A subject with history of drug abuse or positive urine drug screening test 9. A subject who has taken any prescribed medication or herbal compounds within 14 days prior to the study drug administration. In addition, a subject who has taken any overthecounter drug or vitamin supplements within 7 days prior to the study drug administration (However, investigators can judge the subject, who has taken the medications during those periods above, eligible for the trial if all other conditions are satisfied.) 10. A subject who has participated in any other clinical trial either for investigational or marketed drugs within 8 weeks before the study drug administration 11. A subject who has donated or had loss of ≥ 400 mL of blood within 8 weeks prior to start of administration of study drug 12. A subject who consumes more than 21 units of alcohol per week or unable to stop drinking throughout the study period. 13. A smoker (except for whom quitted smoking prior to the drug administration for at least 3 months) 14. A subject who heavily takes caffeine or caffeinecontaining products, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruitcontaining products 15. A subject with unusual dietary habit 16. A subject who was previously assigned to treatment during this study 17. The investigator judges the subject not eligible for the study after reviewing clinical laboratory results or other reasons.</criteria>
