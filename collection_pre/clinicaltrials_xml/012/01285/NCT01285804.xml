	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) on the oxygen concentration in the oropharynx during adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, or adenotonsillectomy. The study hypothesis is that inflation of the cuff on the ETT will eliminate contamination of the oropharynx with the inspired anesthetic gases and decrease the oxygen concentration in the oropharynx.</brief_summary>
