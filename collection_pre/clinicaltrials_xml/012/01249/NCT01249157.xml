	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) is a newly developed imaging examination of the breast that uses a radioactive glucose based tracer, which is a form of sugar attached to a low radiation agent, to detect cancer cells. The radioactive glucose based tracer is called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and it is FDA approved. A PEM scanner is able to better detect cancer cells within the breast, more than a regular PET scanner. The PEM scanner is also FDA approved. This type of imaging may be able to see the breast cancer before it could be seen with mammograms and may be as good as or better than breast MRI. The purpose of this study is to compare the value of FDG Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) with contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast for patients with breast cancer. This study will also perform special pathology test to compare the FDG PEM and contrast enhanced breast MRI images with the results from the standard of care breast surgery. This may teach us more about the biology of each breast tumor.</brief_summary>
