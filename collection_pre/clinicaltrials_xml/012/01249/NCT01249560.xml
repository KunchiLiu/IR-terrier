	<brief_summary>The objective of the antiretroviral treatment is to inhibit the viral replication, estimated(appreciated) by the measure of the viral plasmatic load(responsibility). In this inhibition of the viral replication usually joins an immune reconstruction [ 1 ]. Nevertheless, a viro-immunological dissociation, i.e. an undetectable viral load(responsibility) and an absence of immune reconstruction, is regularly observed. It is now turned out that an undetectable viral load(responsibility) does not correspond to the total absence of viral replication and that it is possible to detect of the intracellular pro-viral DNA . Raltegravir ®, because of its mode of action(share) inhibiting the integration of the pro-viral DNA in the chromosomes of the infected cells(units) , could decrease the intracellular reservoir of monocyte-macrophages, improve the homeostasis, so optimizing the cooperation lymphocytes T - macrophages. Several experimental data suggest that the regression of the abnormalities of cellular interactions, and the rate of apoptose abnormally raised(abnormally brought up) by cells(units) T at the patients in viro-immunological dissociation, could be obtained . This study aims at measuring the impact of Raltegravir ® on the viral reservoirs lymphocyte and monocyte, to quantify the expression of the molecules of costimulation, the source(spring) of intercellular interactions lymphocytes - monocytes, and to measure the rate of apoptose of the cells(units) T.</brief_summary>
