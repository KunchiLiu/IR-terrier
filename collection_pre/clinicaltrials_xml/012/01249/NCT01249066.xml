	<brief_summary>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionally conserved protein kinase that serves as an energy guardian to help cells adapt to various metabolic stress including hypoxia. Because the role of AMPK in cancers has not been fully elucidated, in this study we investigated the expression and activation of AMPK in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) cells and tissue.</brief_summary>
