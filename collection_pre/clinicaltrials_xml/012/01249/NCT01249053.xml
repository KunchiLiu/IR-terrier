	<brief_summary>Optic atrophy type 1(OPA1) is a nuclear dynamin-related GTPase, targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which plays a role in mitochondrial fusion. Mitochondria fusion is associated with process of apoptosis. . OPA1 plays an important role in the mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitochondrial networks. The changes in mitochondrial shape and mitochondrial bioenergetics may be cause of the disease. In this study, we investigate the expression of OPA1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) cells and tissue.</brief_summary>
