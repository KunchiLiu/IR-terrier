	<brief_summary>Objective of the study: To determine whether Perioperative Auto-CPAP treatment prevent postoperative worsening of OSA and improve nocturnal oxygen saturation in surgical patients with moderate and severe OSA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Perioperative CPAP to Reduce Obstructive Sleep Apnea Related Adverse Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will be approached by the study coordinators at the preoperative clinic. If the patient is interested in participating the study, STOP-Bang and Epworth questionnaires will be implemented to determine the risk for OSA.If the patients are classified as high risk of having OSA, they are scheduled for an overnight sleep study at home. The patients with Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)&gt;15 from the sleep study will be randomized into two study groups: Perioperative CPAP group or control group (routine care). In the perioperative CPAP group, patients will be treated with auto-CPAP for 2-3 nights preoperatively and 5 nights postoperatively. All patients will undergo sleep study on the third postoperative night and be monitored by a pulse oximeter for 2-3 nights preoperatively and 5 nights postoperatively.</detailed_description>
