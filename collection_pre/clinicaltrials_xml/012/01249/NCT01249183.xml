	<brief_summary>Primary objectives: To demonstrate that REPEVAX and VAXIGRIP administered concomitantly in subjects 60 years of age and older are at least as immunogenic as REPEVAX or VAXIGRIP administered separately. Secondary objectives: •Secondary immunogenicity objectives: To describe the immune responses 28 days after concomitant or separate administration of REPEVAX and VAXIGRIP in subjects 60 years of age and older To describe the immune response of VAXIGRIP according to European Medicines Agency criteria in subjects 60 years of age and older (Note for Guidance, 1997: 28) •Secondary safety objective: To describe the safety profile after vaccination in each group</brief_summary>
