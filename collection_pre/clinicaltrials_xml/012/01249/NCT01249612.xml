	<brief_summary>With this study the investigators wish to (1) investigate the acute effect of knee joint icing on knee-extension strength shortly after total knee arthroplasty (TKA); and (2) investigate the acute effect of knee joint icing on knee pain, knee joint circumference and functional performance shortly after TKA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Knee Joint Icing and Knee-extension Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As knee joint icing had no acute effect on knee-extension strength in the present study, prolonged icing may have an effect on one or more of the parameters, and further studies are needed to determine the potential beneficial effects of cooling after TKA.</detailed_description>
