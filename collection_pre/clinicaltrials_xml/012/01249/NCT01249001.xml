	<brief_title>Relative Bioavailability of an Extemporaneous Oral Suspension of Aprepitant in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiemetic therapies have improved in recent years, but chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are still common and are among the most distressing side effects of chemotherapy. In a recent survey, parents of children receiving chemotherapy in Ontario centres identified nausea as the fourth most prevalent and bothersome treatment-related symptom experienced by their children. Aprepitant is commercially available in Canada as capsules. An oral liquid aprepitant formulation would be ideal for oral administration to children.</detailed_description>
