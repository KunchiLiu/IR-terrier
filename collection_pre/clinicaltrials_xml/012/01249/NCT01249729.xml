	<brief_summary>We use the three-dimensional image software reconstruct MRI. The propose of this research purposes as follows: 1. 3D reconstructed image processing from MRI to realize the short term nervous system response after dynamic acupuncture stimulation.2. Realizing the corresponding area in the brain caused by electroacupuncture. 3. Realizing the connection between electroacupuncture stimulation and brain physics, chemistry, and physiology. The implement the two-dimentional image into three-dimensional image by Amira software, in order to find out the difference of the pre-and post- response of the nervous system. In addition, we will use "describe statistics" and "Paired t-test" statistical analysis, compare the statistical difference of blood oxygen concentration.</brief_summary>

Anticipate of results: Using the three-dimensional software reconstruct magnetic resonance imaging to realize the immediate response of nervous system after acupoint acupuncture stimulation, and find out the meridian, nerve or physiological corresponding relationship. It will be a tremendous finding to the world if we can deliver a brain mapping concerning the localization of the response on the central nervous system after various acupoints stimulation.</detailed_description>
