	<brief_title>The Effect of Fascia Therapy and Transcutaneous Fibrolysis on Acute Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle sprain is the most occurring sport related injury. In spite of the high prevalence of this injury and the often residual symptoms, there is a large variety in diagnostic approach and therapeutic protocols. Concerning the treatment of an acute ankle sprain, it remains a challenge to minimize injury consequences on short and long term. In this study we investigate the immediate effect of two therapeutic techniques: fascia therapy and transcutaneous fibrolysis. They will be compared to a third group, who receives a placebo treatment. Muscle strength, muscle vascularisation, muscle tenderness and joint position sense are measured before and after treatment. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the knowledge of treating acute ankle sprains.</detailed_description>
