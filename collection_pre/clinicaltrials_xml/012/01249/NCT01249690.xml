	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of PAD and TAD in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant tumor with abnormal proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow. Bone damage is one of the characteristic clinical manifestations. Myeloma plasma cells and bone marrow microenvironment are the targets of thalidomide and bortezomib. The regimens based on them as first-line treatments of MM have greatly improved efficacy and prolonged the survival of MM patients. But whether the regimens can prevent and treat bone complications of MM patients or improve the quality of life is not clear. By evaluating the efficacy of PAD-regimen(Bortezomib,Pirarubicin and Dexamethasone) and TAD-regimen(Thalidomide,Pirarubicin and Dexamethasone) in MM and the effect of them on bone lesions, this study can provide evidence of evidence-based medicine for MM treatment.</detailed_description>
