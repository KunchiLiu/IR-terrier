	<brief_summary>Glucose-induced insulin secretion is often diminished in hyperglycaemic patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators examined, whether chronic basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine lead to improvements in glucose-induced insulin secretion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Reduction of Fasting Glycaemia With Insulin Glargine Improves First and Second Phase Insulin Secretion in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>14 patients with type 2 diabetes on previous metformin therapy were examined before and after eight weeks of treatment with insulin glargine, aimed to normalize fasting glycaemia. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed with and without previous adjustment of fasting glucose levels by means of a 3-hour intravenous insulin infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age between 18 and 75 years, inclusive 2. BMIrange 2750 kg/mÂ² 3. patients with type 2 diabetes presenting with fasting hyperglycaemia (&gt;126mg/dl) on metformin treatment 1.Preexisting insulin therapy, treatment with sulphonylureas, glitazones, 2.glinides, DPP4inhibitors or exenatide 3.patients with type 1 diabetes 4.Patients are investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study, or are immediate family of investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted. 5. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breastfeeding or intend to become pregnant or are not using adequate contraceptive methods (adequate contraceptive measures include sterilisation, hormonal intrauterine devices, oral contraceptives, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner). A male subject who is sexually active and has not been surgically sterilised must be informed that he must either use a condom during intercourse, ensure that his partner practices contraception, or he must refrain from sexual intercourse during the trial and until 1 month after completion of the trial. This is to prevent the possibility of a pregnancy from spermatocytes that can potentially be damaged by trial medication. It is strongly recommended that the female partners use a highly effective contraception (Pearl Index &lt; 1%). 6. Patients have participated in an interventional medical, surgical, or pharmaceutical study (a study in which an experimental, drug, medical, or surgical treatment was given) within 30 days prior to screening. This criterion includes drugs that have not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry. 7. Patients have alcohol consumption (&gt;20 g daily for males and &gt;10 g daily for females) 8. Patients have alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater than ten times the upper limit of the reference range. 9.Patients are undergoing therapy for a malignancy, other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. 10. Patients have cardiac disease that is Class III or IV, according to the New York Heart Association criteria. 11. Patients have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal dialysis or have serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL for males and greater than or equal to &gt;1.5 mg/dL for females. 12.Patients have known hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia 13.Patients are receiving chronic (lasting longer than 2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical and inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within 2 weeks immediately prior to screening. 14. Patients have any other condition (including known drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric disorder) that precludes them from following and completing the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator. 15. Patients fail to satisfy the investigator of suitability to participate for any other reason.</criteria>
