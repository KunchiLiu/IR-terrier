	<brief_summary>Neuromyotonia (NMT), so called Isaac's syndrome, is a rare disorder in which hyperexcitability of peripheral motor nerves leads to intermittent muscle contractions. It is characterized by muscle twitching at rest (visible myokymia), cramps, hyperhidrosis, paraesthesiae, mild muscle weakness. and impaired muscle relaxation, or pseudomyotonia. Electromyographic recording is a key diagnostic tool in detecting myokymia and neuromyotonia. Pathophysiology of neuromyotonia is claimed to be related immune disorder, autoimmune anti-voltage-gated potassium-channel antibodies and genetic mutation in potassium channel. KCNA1 (Kv1.1) mutation was mostly reported in a autosomal dominant trait. In the present study, we report a family affected with myokymiaï¼Œworsening with elevated body temperature, febrile illness or spicy food. How the change in temperature influence clinical features of channelopathies is an interesting topic. Variant clinical severity of family members are recorded. The index patient has possible autoimmune mechanism involvement because of his clinical feature of myasthenia gravis with thymoma and hyperthyroidism. Further analyzing the genetic mutation in potassium channelopathy may provide researchers some pathophysiological insight into the Isaac's syndrome.</brief_summary>
