	<brief_title>Effects of Canola Oil on Blood Vessel Function in Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given that much of the evidence for current dietary recommendations for type and amounts of fatty acids is based on heart disease, the proposed research will contribute to the knowledge base for dietary fat recommendations for individuals with established cardiovascular disease. Specifically, this study will establish whether canola oil has positive effects on blood vessel function in individuals with peripheral arterial disease by measuring true clinical endpoints such as ankle-brachial index, walking distance, claudication, and vascular function measures. Additionally, since reduced blood flow contributes to cognitive impairment, this study will explore whether improvements in blood vessel function are also associated with improvements in cognitive function. Given the large proportion of the population affected by atherosclerosis and various forms of cardiovascular disease, there is significant potential for greater consumption and utilization of canola oil if there are beneficial effects on blood vessel function and other indicators of cardiovascular disease risk.</detailed_description>
