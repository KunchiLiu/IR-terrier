	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine whether reduction of serum calcium concentration by cinacalcet leads to reduction of mean blood pressure adjusted c-fPWV. The secondary objectives are to study the effects of calcium reduction on 1) carotid-radial PWV (c-rPWV), 2) common carotid artery (CCA) biomechanics, 3) pulse wave profile and cardiac function.</brief_summary>
