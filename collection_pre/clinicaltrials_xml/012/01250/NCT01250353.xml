	<brief_summary>The main problem of ocular surface reconstruction is the lack of viable conjunctival tissue. The use of a biocompatible latex biomembrane in ocular surface healing, like post pterygium surgery, could be an alternative therapeutic resource to this process.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Natural Latex Biomembrane in Ocular Surface Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The latex biomembrane is considered biocompatible and believed to promote neoformation of biological tissues. It also induces vascular neoformation and promotes extra cellular provisional matrix formation, fundamental steps for any kind of wound healing. In humans, it was successfully used in chronic cutaneous ulcer and otologic surgeries. In rabbits' eyes, the latex biomembrane was efficient in ocular surface reconstruction with adequate conjunctiva functional recovery, compared to bare sclera. To study the latex biomembrane action in human ocular surface, it was compared to conjunctival autograft in humans eyes. Considering the deficiency of adequate sized groups and the pterygium recurrences criteria differences, this study proposes the fibrovascular tissue growing measure like an auxiliary method of pos-operative evaluation. The biomembrane of natural latex seems to be efficient in ocular surface reconstruction and must be employed in future studies of other ocular pathologies. This material revealed to be a new source of therapeutic resort to external eye diseases and conjunctival replace in surgeries living bare sclera.</detailed_description>
