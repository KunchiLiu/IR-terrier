	<brief_summary>Brimonidine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, is an effective and safe medication which is widely used in glaucoma treatment. Although it is known that it is quickly taken up by the cornea following topical administration and that the cornea has alpha-2 adrenoceptors there are only few studies available on the impact brimonidine has on the cornea. The aim of the study is to find out 1. whether topical administration of brimonidine results in interaction with corneal alpha-2 adrenoceptors in terms of an increase in corneal thickness and 2. whether there are any differences between the response corneal epithelium, stroma and endothelium show to alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation.</brief_summary>
