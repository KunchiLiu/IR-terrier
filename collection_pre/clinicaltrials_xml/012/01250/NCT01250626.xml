	<brief_summary>Inulin's usefulness as a diagnostic agent is based on the method of its elimination from the body. Inulin is biologically inert, unbound by plasma proteins, freely filtered at the glomerulus, and is neither reabsorbed, metabolized nor secreted by the kidneys. It is excreted almost entirely by glomerular filtration. Inulin clearance is considered to be identical to glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</brief_summary>
