	<brief_summary>This is a research study to look at vitamin D deficiency (low levels) in men and women with HIV. As part of your regular medical care, you will be screened for vitamin D deficiency. If your levels are low, and you choose to start using vitamin D supplements, the investigators would like to take some blood before and after you start using vitamin D to see how this affects your levels of HIV, T cells, cholesterol, and other blood levels. The investigators will provide you with vitamin D supplements for the first 24 weeks (6 months) of the study. If you and your physician decide that you should continue taking vitamin D supplements after that time, you will be responsible for purchasing your own vitamin D supplements.</brief_summary>
