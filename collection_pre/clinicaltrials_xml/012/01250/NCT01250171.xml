	<brief_summary>This study assessed the effects of a single intravenous dose of secukinumab (AIN457) 10 mg/kg or canakinumab (ACZ885) 10 mg/kg on the signs and symptoms of dry eye. In addition, the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of secukinumab and canakinumab were assessed. Blood samples were collected for the analysis of the effect of secukinumab and canakinumab on select biomarkers.</brief_summary>
