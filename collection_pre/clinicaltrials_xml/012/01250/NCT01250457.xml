	<brief_title>Topical Timolol for the Treatment of Benign Vascular Periocular Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benign vascular tumors of the eyelid are common causes of ocular morbidity. Capillary hemangiomas in children cause refractive and occlusive amblyopia. In adults, Rosacea-associated eyelid telangiectasis and sclerosis can result in keratitis and corneal neovascularization. Corticosteroid therapy of benign vascular lesions risks sight-threatening complications including central retinal artery occlusion and significant systemic morbidity. Alternatively, oral and intravenous beta-blockers have been reported to induce regression of benign vascular lesions. One recent report documented efficacy of topical timolol in treating a large capillary hemangioma of the eyelid in a child. Topical application reduces systemic side effects of beta-blockers including bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and bronchospasm. This one-year prospective case-control series will investigate whether topical Timolol 0.5% solution applied twice daily causes significant regression of benign vascular periocular lesions.</detailed_description>
