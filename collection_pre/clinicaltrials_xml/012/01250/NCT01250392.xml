	<brief_title>The Effect of Active Choice on Nurse Visit Participation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The employees in our sample will schedule their nurse visit time slot via e-mail and a health service provider website. Much as is the case in the current system, the control group will be informed via e-mail of the window of dates during which they can take part in the on-site screening and given instructions for scheduling an appointment. The treatment group, the active choice only arm, will be given the same information as the control group, but they will also be asked to make an appointment immediately, defer the scheduling decision, or decline to receive a screening. The treatment group will also receive email reminders one week before their appointment.</detailed_description>
