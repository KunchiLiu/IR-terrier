	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study will assess the efficacy and s afety of Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with chemotherapy versus chemother apy alone as second- and third-line therapy in patients with locally recurrent o r metastatic breast cancer progressing after first-line therapy with Avastin and chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either Avastin (15 mg/kg e very 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks intravenously) plus standard chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Anticipated time on study treatment is until third-line disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
