	<brief_summary>Some patients are at risk for life-threatening fast heart rates. These can frequently be treated by using a catheter inside the heart to burn away the cells that create the fast heart rates. The purpose of this study is to image the nerves inside the heart of those patients. The investigators want to find out if abnormalities in the nervous system in the heart can help the physician to find the area that needs to be burnt away.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ventricular tachycardia is the next frontier in cardiology. Patients that have scar in the heart (for example after heart attacks) are at an increased risk of developing ventricular tachycardia. In these patients ventricular tachycardia represents an electrical wave front that circulates in the heart muscle using the scar in the heart. An increasing number of patients with ventricular tachycardia require cauterization (burning away) of the tissue to treat this life-threatening condition. The goal of this cauterization or ablation is to destroy "highways of surviving tissue" inside the scar, that allow ventricular tachycardia to exist. However, this can be very lengthy procedure (&gt;5 hours) that has only a moderate success in the long run. Therefore, new treatment approaches are needed to make this procedure better. The purpose of this study is to assess if radio tracers showing the nerve distribution in the heart (cardiac innervation) can be used in addition to the current technology ("voltage mapping") to identify the area that needs to be ablated (burnt away) to treat life-threatening fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia) Certain patterns of nerve distribution in the heart (sympathetic cardiac innervation) have been shown to predict outcome for different heart diseases, like heart transplant, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias. One substance that allows visualization of the cardiac innervation is 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG), which could provide additional information to understand and treat ventricular tachycardia.</detailed_description>
