	<brief_title>Effect of Donepexil on Smoking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nicotine dependence is a major public health problem and currently available treatments are ineffective for the majority of smokers. Thus, there is a need to develop and test novel medications to assist smokers to quit smoking. Recent evidence from two genetic studies by our group implicates the endogenous cholinergic system in smoking cessation and nicotine dependence, Pre-clinical investigations have also demonstrated an important role for the endogenous cholinergic system in nicotine addiction. The proposed proof of concept pilot study is a randomized Phase 2a trial designed to study the effects of Donepezil hydrochloride (HCL) (Aricept), compared to placebo, on smoking behavior in 24 smokers. Key outcomes include, adherence, side effects, smoking rate, and smoking topography.</detailed_description>
