	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to measure the change in psychological symptoms and gene expression in war veterans after a series of 10 EFT coaching sessions. Outcome studies have shown statistically significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and PTSD in veterans after EFT, and this study extends earlier research using biological sampling. EFT is a form of Energy Psychology (EP) that is sometimes referred to as "emotional acupuncture." It involves self-stimulation of 14 acupuncture points at the end of meridians with the fingertips, while recalling an emotional event such as a combat trauma. It is typically effective in 6 to 15 coaching sessions, making it an efficient clinical technique for reducing affect.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There is peer-reviewed published experimental evidence showing that (a) acupuncture reduces the fear response in the brain, especially the limbic system, and most particularly the amygdala; that (b) tapping or rubbing acupuncture points (acupressure) can be as effective as needling them; that (c) EFTs use of such acupressure is efficacious in reducing anxiety, PTSD and other mood disorders; that (d) EFT reliably reduces emotional intensity associated with traumatic memories, is safe and low-risk; that (e) all EP studies that included a long-term follow-up show that patient gains are maintained over time; that (f) the psychological questionnaires used in this study are validated and safe; and that for all these reasons (g) EP is a treatment of choice among therapists when dealing with the traumatic memories of clients. This study extends these findings by noting changes in gene expression associated with the remission of PTSD symptoms.</detailed_description>
