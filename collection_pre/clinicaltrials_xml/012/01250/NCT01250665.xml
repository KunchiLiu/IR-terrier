	<brief_summary>This study is a cross sectional study of patients diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and RRMS, who will undergo a series of tests to assess cognitive impairment, fatigue severity and depressive symptoms. Cognitive impairment will be assessed with Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC) and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), fatigue severity will be measured with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) and depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All tests mentioned above are validated for MS patients. In the second step we will use our large longitudinal database of serial MRI examinations from which a linear measurement of CCI will be retrospectively calculated.</brief_summary>
