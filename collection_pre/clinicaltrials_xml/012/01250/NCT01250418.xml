	<brief_summary>The study question: Does the SNAP-Index (SI) correlates better with the OASS than the BIS Monitor during sedation with ketamine? The study hypothesis: Since the SNAP II monitor seems to be more responsive during emergence of anesthesia, it will have a better correlation with the OASS than the BIS monitor with the use of ketamine.</brief_summary>
