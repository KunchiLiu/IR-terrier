	<brief_summary>Drug-drug interactions play an important role in clinical adverse events due to the prevalence of multi-drug therapy. Co-administration of warfarin and a statin has expanded substantially in the US over the last decades. The purpose of this study is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of a drug-metabolizing enzyme, CYP4F2, in the interaction between warfarin and statins. This study will test the hypothesis that lovastatin potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin by inducing vitamin K-metabolizing enzyme CYP4F2 in humans, thus increasing warfarin's anticoagulant effect.</brief_summary>
