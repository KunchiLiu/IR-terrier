	<brief_summary>Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women, and has profound negative impacts on their children. The investigators are conducting a randomized trial of a systems approach to identify mothers at risk for depression in Head Start - a federally funded early learning program for children of low-income families - and to provide an on-site intervention to prevent or alleviate depressive symptoms; improve functioning; and, where appropriate, proactively link mothers to more definitive mental health services.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Maternal Depression In Head Start</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is one component of a series of studies that aims to develop a comprehensive system of maternal depression prevention and management within Head Start. In our March 2014 review of the CT.gov protocol, we synchronized it with our institution's IRB protocol, which had been modified based on how the individual studies within this series relate to one another. Specifically, the original IRB protocol combined two studies into one: a 'main' depression prevention trial (n=230, R01MH091871), and a small adjunct pilot aimed at referring those with symptoms of major depression to further care (n=60). Thus, the original CT.gov protocol included subjects both at risk for depression and with symptoms consistent with major depression. When the latter pilot study subsequently received external funding, we separated the two studies into two IRB protocols, and thus have adjusted our CT.gov protocol to the appropriate sample size of 230, and indicated symptoms of major depression as an exclusion criterion for the prevention trial. Because Major Depressive Episode was inadvertently listed as a primary outcome measure for the prevention trial (and PTSD and Anxiety as secondary outcome measures), we have removed them as such and listed it under 'other' outcomes, thereby aligning the CT.gov protocol with the statistical analysis plan of the original grant application and IRB protocol. Lastly, we corrected administrative errors in the study's projected end date and masking design.</detailed_description>
