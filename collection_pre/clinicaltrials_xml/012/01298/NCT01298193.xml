	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, open label, non-comparative trial in Spain. The primary objective of this study is to determine the complete response, defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue treatment, in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with one cycle of Docetaxel-Cyclophosphamide and active therapy for the prevention of CINV(Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting) day 1, 5-HT3 antagonist plus 3 days of dexamethasone. A second step (efficacy phase) is designed to examine the efficacy and tolerability of aprepitant in the second cycle among patients who failed to the previous CINV prevention treatment. The study will focus on early-stage chemonaïve breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel-cyclophosphamide and a 5-HT3 antagonist plus dexamethasone for the CINV prevention. The CINV incidence in those patients will be evaluated on the first cycle. All refractory patients, will be asked to participate in the second phase, where aprepitant on days 1, 2 and 3 will be added to their antiemetic regimen. Assuming a drop out of 5%, 212 patients will be included in the study. It is anticipated that around 48 patients will enter the efficacy phase. The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be approximately 21 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Female patient ≥ 18 years of age. 2. Patient has a histological confirmed earlystage (I to III) breast cancer. 3. Patient is able to understand study procedures and agrees to participate in the study by giving written informed consent. 4. Patient is naïve to moderate or highly emetogenic chemotherapy per Hesketh criteria (see Appendix 7.1). 5. Patient is scheduled to receive of chemotherapy with DocetaxelCyclophosphamide (Docetaxel 75mg/m2 and Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2) administered every 21 days. 6. Patient has a predicted life expectancy ≥ 4 months. 7. Functional State 01 ECOG Scale (see Appendix 12.2). 8. Patient has an adequate organ function including the following: Bone marrow reserve: Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt;1500/mm3 and WBC count &gt;3000/mm3; Platelet Count &gt;100.000/mm3 Hepatic: AST (aspartate transaminase) &lt;2.5 x upper limit of normal; ALT (alanine transaminase) &lt;2.5 x upper limit of normal; Bilirubin within the normal limit. Renal: Creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal. 9. Premenopausal female patients must demonstrate a negative serum and/or urine pregnancy test within 3 days of study drug administration, and agree to use a doublebarrier form of contraception for at least 14 days prior to, throughout and for at least 14 days following the last dose of study medication. Women taking oral contraceptive agents must agree to add a barrier form of contraception. Abstinence is also considered an acceptable form of contraception. (Note: A female patient who is not of reproductive potential is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A female patient who is not of reproductive potential is defined as one who has either: 1) reached natural menopause (defined as 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory, or 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea); 2) 6 weeks post surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy; or 3) bilateral tubal ligation.) 10. Patient is able to read, understand and complete study questionnaires. 1. Patient is scheduled to receive any chemotherapy treatment different to the DocetaxelCyclophosphamide chemotherapy. 2. Patient has received or will receive radiation therapy to the abdomen, chest or pelvis in the month prior to the study enter. 3. Patient has vomited in the 24 hours prior to Treatment Day 1. 4. Patient has a history of treatment with emetogenic chemotherapy of moderate or high level per Hesketh (see Appendix 7.1). 5. Patient has an active infection (e.g., pneumonia) or any uncontrolled disease (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal obstruction) except for malignancy which, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose unwarranted risk. 6. Patient currently uses any illicit drugs, including marijuana, or has current evidence of alcohol abuse as determined by the investigator. 7. Patient is mentally incapacitated or has a significant emotional or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes study entry. 8. Patient has a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose unwarranted risk. 9. Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to aprepitant, 5HT3 antagonists, or dexamethasone. 10. Patient is pregnant or breast feeding. 11. Patient has participated in a study with aprepitant or has taken a non approved (investigational) drug within the last 4 weeks. 12. Patient is taking systemic corticosteroid therapy at any dose; topical and inhaled corticosteroids are permitted. 13. Patient is taking, or will be taking within 28 days of Day 1 of cycle 2 (cycle in which patients will start taking aprepitant) the following CYP3A4 inducers: phenytoin or carbamazepine barbiturates rifampicin or rifabutin St. John's Wort 14. Patient is taking, or will be taking within 7 days of Day 1 of cycle 2 the following CYP3A4 substrates: terfenadine cisapride astemizole pimozide 15. Patient is taking, or will be taking within the 7 days of Day 1 of cycle 2 the following CYP3A4 inhibitors: clarithromycin ketoconazole, itraconazole 16. Patient will be taking an antiemetic within 48 hours of Day 1 of cycle 2. Prohibited antiemetics include: 5HT3 antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, tropisetron or palonosetron) phenothiazines (e.g., prochlorperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, thiethylperazine, or chlorpromazine) butyrophenones (e.g., haloperidol or droperidol) benzamides (e.g., metoclopramide or alizapride) domperidone cannabinoids herbal therapies with potential antiemetic properties scopolamine cyclizine 17. Patient has used benzodiazepines or opiates, except for single daily doses of triazolam, temazepam or midazolam in the 48 hours prior to Day 1 of cycle 2. Continuation of chronic benzodiazepines or opiate therapy is permitted provided it was iniciated at least 48 hours before enrollment.</criteria>
