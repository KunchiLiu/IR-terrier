	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis is that the long-term cognitive and behavioral sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are due to selective disruption of the long association white matter tracts of the cerebral hemispheres, with resulting functional impairment of the network of cortical regions that are interconnected by these long-range association pathways. We propose that traumatic white matter injury can be measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and that the impaired cortical activation can be detected with magnetoencephalography (MEG), and that the results of these imaging examinations will correlate with neurocognitive status and functional recovery after TBI.</brief_summary>
