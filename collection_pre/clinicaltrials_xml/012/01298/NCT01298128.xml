	<brief_summary>The newly designed contraceptive ring, Nuvaring has a lower total steroid dose, and medications are delivered locally. It has been proven to be as safe and effective as the combined OCP in ovarian suppression and preventing ovulation with fewer side effects due to minimal systemic absorption. Following a single vaginal insertion, steroid concentrations remain stable for up to 4 weeks. It is hypothesized that Nuvaring may, therefore lead to better compliance, tolerability and acceptance by patients requiring ovarian suppression prior to COH for IVF.</brief_summary>
