	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study is designed to find out what treatment options new patients with chronic kidney disease learn about from their renal unit. Aims: To determine the proportion of new CKD patients who receive information about treatment options prior to commencing dialysis, pre−emptive transplantation or conservative management. To determine the timing (i.e. patient's stage of disease) when information is given. To find out whether patients have a friend or family member with them when information is given. Research Design and methods: This study is an assessment of CKD education practices. Nephrologists and pre−dialysis coordinators from each renal unit will complete questionnaires about information that was given to each new dialysis, pre−emptive transplant or conservatively managed patient that started treatment during a 3 month period. Study hypothesis: Approximately one third of CKD patients will receive information after starting treatment. There will be a positive association between in−centre haemodialysis and later referral, non−English speaking background, and advancing age. Significance: The results from this national audit will provide Australian nephrologists and renal nurses with evidence about CKD education practices and compliance with clinical practice guidelines. The results may highlight opportunities for improvement in practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Additional research objectives and key research questions: 1. To determine the proportion of patients who receive information about: pre−emptive transplantation; peritoneal dialysis; home haemodialysis; centre based haemodialysis; supported non−dialytic care or conservative management. 3. To determine the proportion of incident patients that have a non−English speaking background (NESB) requiring an interpreter or translated materials. 4. To examine associations between age, gender, health insurance status, NESB, CKD stage and information provided on initial treatment commenced. 5. To determine the proportion of patients who choose not to dialyse.</detailed_description>
