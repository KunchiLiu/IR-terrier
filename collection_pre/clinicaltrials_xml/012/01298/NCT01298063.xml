	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Healthy subjects: 1. Healthy males and females according to a complete medical history, including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate), 12lead Electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests. The healthy subjects must meet the matching criteria based on the matching approach (cf. Section 3.3). 2. Age =18 and =75 years 3. Body Mass Index =18.5 and =34 kg/m2 4. Creatinine clearance &gt;70 mL/min according to Cockroft &amp; Gault (for healthy volunteers, cf. Section 10.2) 5. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation. Hepatically impaired subjects as determined by a hepatologist/ gastroenterologist: 6. Male and female liver impaired subjects determined by results of screening classified as ChildPugh A; ChildPugh score of 56 points or as ChildPugh B; ChildPugh score of 79 points, cf. Section 10.2. ChildPugh criteria must be stable for at least 3 months prior to screening and during the trial. 7. Age =18 and =75 years 8. Body Mass Index =18.5 and =34 kg/m2 9. Creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min according to Cockroft &amp; Gault (for liver impaired subjects, cf. Section 10.2) 10. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation. For all females: 11. Postmenopausal female subjects (postmenopausal defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases or spontaneous amenorrhea below 1 year a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) above 40 IU/l and estradiol below 30 ng/l is confirmatory]) or adequate contraception* for female subjects of childbearing potential during the study and until 2 months after study completion, e.g. any of the following: implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, IUD (intrauterine device), sexual abstinence for at least 1 month prior to first study drug administration, vasectomised partner (vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to enrolment), or surgical sterilisation (including hysterectomy). Females, who do not have a vasectomised partner, are not sexually abstinent or surgically sterile have to use an additional barrier method (e.g. condom). Exclusion criteria: Any relevant deviation from healthy conditions (excluded conditions caused by liver impairment)</criteria>
