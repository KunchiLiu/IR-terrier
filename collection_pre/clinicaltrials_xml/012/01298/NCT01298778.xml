	<brief_summary>In previous studies the investigators have seen that the severity of pain one day after cesarean delivery can predict the presence of pain and depression 2 months later. The investigators believe those at risk for severe acute post-partum pain can be identified, and medical interventions can be tailored to manage postoperative pain more effectively.</brief_summary>
