	<brief_summary>The purpose is to study the effect of early NEuroMuscular EXercise (NEMEX) versus conventional treatment (late exercise) in patients with acute non-operative achilles tendon rupture (ATR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study on Exercise After Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is currently no consensus on treatment for achilles tendon rupture with regard to surgical or non-surgical treatment. In addition, the optimal time to start exercise treatment after the injury, with or without surgery, is not well understood. Animal studies show positive effects of early mobilization in tendon healing. Neuromuscular exercise has shown better effects than strength exercise in people with knee injury or knee disease. There are few studies in humans focusing on exercise as treatment, without surgical intervention, after ATR.</detailed_description>
