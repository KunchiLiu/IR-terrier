	<criteria>Consistent treatment for chronic, noncancerrelated pain with any oral, transdermal, intravenous, or subcutaneous opioid (full agonist) other than methadone for at least 30 days prior to screening, and will continue opioid therapy throughout the study. Diagnosis of opioidinduced bowel dysfunction (OBD) as confirmed during the screening period. If patient has a history of chronic constipation (&gt;90days), condition must have been exacerbated by initiation of opioid treatment. Use of prescribed or OTC medication that affects gastrointestinal motility (other than opioid therapy) must be discontinued from the screening visit through the completion of the study. If treated for clinical depression with SSRIs, SNRIs, or MAO inhibitors, treatment must have been at a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening and not likely to change during the study. Patient must discontinue use of laxatives and stool softeners (with the exception of approved rescue medications) while on study. Treatment with opioid therapy for cancerrelated pain, abdominal pain, scleroderma, and/or for the management of drug addiction. Patient has current evidence of, or has been treated for, cancer within the past 5 years (with the exception of localized basal cell, squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ cancer that has been resected). Changes in opioid treatment, route of administration or dose adjustments (increased or decreased by +/30% in morphine equivalent daily dose [MEDD] of opioid treatment) within 30 days of screening, or likelihood of opioid discontinuation over the course of the study. Gastrointestinal or abdominal surgical procedures within 90 days prior to screening or has had a bowel resection at any time. Nonambulatory patients or those who are unable to eat/drink, take oral medications, or to hold down oral medications due to vomiting. Female patients of childbearing potential who are unable/unwilling to use protocolspecified method(s) of birth control and/or are pregnant, nursing, or plan to become pregnant or nurse during the study. Prior use of Amitiza, lubiprostone, SPI0211, or RU0211. Patients receiving methadone, methadone HCl, or a congener of methadone either alone or as part of opioid regimen.</criteria>
