	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the improvement in ankle control and brain activation in subjects with stroke resulting from two different forms of telerehabilitation: tracking training, emphasizing accurate movements, versus movement training, involving simple movements. Hypotheses: 1. The Track group will show greater improvement in ankle range of motion compared to the Move group. 2. The Track group will show greater improvement in ankle tracking accuracy and greater changes in fMRI (increase in relative volume of activation for ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex, increase in laterality index, and decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity index) compared to Move group. 3. The Track group will show greater improvement in tracking accuracy at an untrained joint (knee) compared to the Move group. 4. The Track group will show greater improvement in standing balance. 5. The Track group will show greater improvement in walking speed and ankle dorsiflexion during gait compared to the Move group.</brief_summary>
