	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage in conjunction with ICH by cranial computed tomography (CCT) or Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT) Patients who need by judgement of a clinical neurologist or neurosurgeon surgical removal of the blood clot due to its spaceoccupying effects Age greater or equal 18 years for men Age greater or equal 18 years for women if confirmed infertility (e.g. hysterectomy or surgical sterilisation at least 3 months before study start) For all other women age greater or equal 50 years with last menstrual bleeding at least one year before study start Minimum hematoma diameter of 2 cm as measured in baseline CCT or MRT Signed, written informed consent of patient or consent/assertion from the patient's legally acceptable representative/affiliated if the patient is unable to provide informed consent Participation in any other clinical trial within the past 3 months or ongoing Occurrence of inconsistency with initial diagnosis at baseline during surgery of the patient leading to unfulfilled inclusion criterion Hemorrhage secondary to tumour or trauma Patients with a cerebellar hemorrhage or extension of a supratentorial hemorrhage into the brainstem Patients with severe preexisting physical or mental disability or severe comorbidity that interferes with the assessment of outcome Allergy to contrast media (MRT) Acute infection Muscular, neurological, or vascular insufficiency of the respective tissue Polypropylene incompatibility Acute immunosuppressive medication Patient after organ transplantation Patient with immune depression Patients with a high probability of spontaneous recovery or showing rapidly improving signs Patients with extensive intracranial hemorrhages or with deep hemispheric localisation of the clots Patients whose diagnosis of ICH is uncertain</criteria>
