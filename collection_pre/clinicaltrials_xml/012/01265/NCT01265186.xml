	<brief_summary>Neonates treated on Neonatal Intensive Care Units are often critically ill, subject to numerous painful procedures and often dependent on mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation as well as painful conditions require a sufficient analgesia and or an accurately regulated sedation. Newborns incapable of self-report are therefore dependent on the assessment of the infants level of pain and sedation by the treating team. The aim of this prospective, controlled, observer-blinded clinical trial is to compare the performance of two EEG based methods and a clinical sedation scale to measure the level of sedation in neonates. The Bispectral-Index (BIS) and the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) are compared with the Neonatal Pain and Sedation Scale (N-PASS). We hypothesize a correlation between the clinical sedation score (N-PASS), the bispectral index (BIS) and the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG). Fifty-two mechanically ventilated term neonates and fifteen control patients are enrolled and observed for up to 72h.</brief_summary>
