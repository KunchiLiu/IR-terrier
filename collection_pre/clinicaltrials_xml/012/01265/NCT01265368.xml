	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of a Tumor Vaccine in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (ASET)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty four patients with advanced RCC will be included in this open, single-arm study. The treatment will last 12 weeks. The investigational product (MGN1601) will be administered intradermally for a total of 8 applications, whereas the first 3 applications will be administered weekly, and the following 5 applications will be administered bi-weekly. Patients who will develop disease control (CR, PR, or SD) by week 12 will be proposed to participate in the extension phase of the study. The extension phase will be continued until disease progression in each patient, however, maximally up to week 120 (total treatment duration 2.5 years). During this time period the investigational product will be administered 5 times by weeks 24, 36, 48, 72, and 120.</detailed_description>
