	<brief_title>Telemetric Arrhythmia and Syncope Diagnosis - Evaluation of Arrhythmia Treatment Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive methods enabling long-term ECG monitoring in patients with paroxysmal symptoms, such as tachycardia or palpitations increase the probability of detecting infrequent but dangerous events with profound clinical significance. Patients with recommendation for the first catheter ablation of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation in the reference center will be included in the study. Eligible patients will have 14-day telemetric ECG monitoring. Based on detected arrhythmia events, patient's medical history and available documentation the most appropriate treatment will be recommended. Patients will undergo invasive procedures of ablation or pacemaker implantation or can be treated pharmacologically. After the invasive treatment or initiation of pharmacotherapy the 14-day telemetric ECG monitoring will be repeated to assess efficacy of the treatment. Patients with no record of arrhythmia requiring treatment during the first 14 days ECG monitoring will terminate participation in the study. The referring physician will be informed. Further diagnosis or treatment should be performed at the referring physician's center according to the best clinical practice.</detailed_description>
