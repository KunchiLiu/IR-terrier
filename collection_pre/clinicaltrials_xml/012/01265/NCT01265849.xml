	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether LI administered in combination with cyclophosphamide, indomethacin and zinc (CIZ) in a multivitamin combination prior to standard of care therapy (surgery followed by radiotherapy or concurrent radiochemotherapy) is safe and will increase the overall survival of subjects with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or soft palate at a median of 3 years</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Leukocyte Interleukin,Injection (LI) to Treat Cancer of the Oral Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head and neck carcinomas constitute about 5% of all cancers annually worldwide. In the US there are about 37,000 new cases annually. Ninety percent are advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN). Approximately 2/3 of SCCHN patients present on their first visit with locally advanced disease. The median 3 year overall survival(OS) for these patients with existing standard of care (SOC) therapies - surgery followed by radiotherapy or combined radiochemotherapy - is between 52 and 55%; the 5 year OS is 43%. There are clearly a large number of SCCHN patients not well served by available modalities. Regional intra or perilymphatic and/or intratumoral or peritumoral low dose cytokine therapy may have important therapeutic effects in SCCHN patients and constitute an additional anti-tumor mechanism of action different and distinct from current SOC. Leukocyte Interleukin Injection (LI) [Multikine]contains a defined mixture of naturally derived cytokines and chemokines with demonstrated safety and immunomodulatory activity in animals and in man in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. LI was administered prior to SOC and in combination with low non-chemotherapeutic doses of cyclophosphamide, indomethacin, and zinc (CIZ) in studies with LI. The results of these studies indicate that the local/regional injection of mixed interleukins (LI) with CIZ prior to SOC can overcome local immunosuppression, break tumor tolerance to tumor antigens and allow for a sustainable and effective anti-tumor immune response. LI is being tested in this large, global, multinational Phase III clinical trial to develop definitive proof of its efficacy and safety in treating SCCHN. The trial is an open-label randomized multi-center controlled study of LI + CIZ + SOC in subjects with advanced primary SCCHN of the oral cavity/soft palate vs. SOC [The Comparator Arms for, Overall Survival, the Primary End Point of this Study].</detailed_description>
