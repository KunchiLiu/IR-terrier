	<brief_summary>Burn patients have extreme pain. Opioids are the main agents used for analgesia. Opioids can have several adverse outcomes and have been only partially effective in controlling the pain assoicated with burn injury. Agents directed at neuropathic pain are rarely used acutely in thermal injury. However, there is mounting evidence from small randomized clinical studies that the administration of the anticonvulsant Gabapentin decreases acute burn pain and has an opioid sparing effect. We therefore propose a single center study to fruther assess the efficacy of neuropathic agents in controlling the pain associated with acute thermal injury.</brief_summary>
