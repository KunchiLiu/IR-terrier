	<brief_summary>This is a non-interventional, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. A total of 150 pediatric subjects with glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure, including 75 latanoprost-treated subjects and 75 non-topical prostaglandin analogue treated subjects, will be enrolled from ophthalmic hospital clinics and academic ophthalmic centers. As a non-interventional study, the study subjects' continued use of latanoprost and assessments of ocular events will be obtained through the routine medical follow-up with treating ophthalmologists or other designated members of the medical care team.</brief_summary>
