	<detailed_description>Irregular and/or rapid beating of the heart called heart palpitations can occur in individuals without heart disease and the reasons for their palpitations are unknown. Together with heart palpitations silent arrhythmia may be present that could lead to serious complications (eg. stroke). In others, palpitations result from heart rhythm disturbances, sometimes life threatening. Standard diagnostic methods such as 24 hours Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring or Event Holter do not guarantee early diagnosis of the arrhythmia. Prolonged heart rhythm recording and analysis using an automatic full disclosure telemetric device can increase probability of arrhythmia diagnosis and early administration of applicable treatment. Study patients will be diagnosed using standard Holter ECG monitoring, Event Holter or 30 days telemetric ECG monitoring. Efficacy of telemetric monitoring in diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia will be assessed in comparison with the standard Holter monitoring and Event Holter</detailed_description>
