	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of prolonged Full Disclosure electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and signal analysis using advanced telemetric technology in comparison with a standard Holter ECG recording and an Event Holter recording to diagnose cardiac arrhythmia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemetric Arrhythmia Diagnosis in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irregular and/or rapid beating of the heart called heart palpitations can occur in individuals without heart disease and the reasons for their palpitations are unknown. Together with heart palpitations silent arrhythmia may be present that could lead to serious complications (eg. stroke). In others, palpitations result from heart rhythm disturbances, sometimes life threatening. Standard diagnostic methods such as 24 hours Holter ECG monitoring or Event Holter do not guarantee early diagnosis of the arrhythmia. Prolonged heart rhythm recording and analysis using an automatic full disclosure telemetric device increase probability of arrhythmia diagnosis and early administration of applicable treatment. Study patients will be diagnosed using standard Holter ECG monitoring and 14 days telemetric full disclosure ECG monitoring. The full disclosure signal will be subsequently analyzed in the Event Monitoring mode by an independent consultant. Efficacy of Telemetric Monitoring in diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia will be assessed in comparison with the standard Holter monitoring and Event Monitoring.</detailed_description>
