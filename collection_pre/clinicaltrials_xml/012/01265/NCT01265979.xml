	<brief_title>WB-DWI for Early Prediction of Therapy Response in Patients With Advanced Metastatic GIST Treated With Regorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim of the study - To assess whole body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DWI) for the assessment and early prediction of response of treatment with regorafenib or placebo in patients with advanced, metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) 1. Evaluation of pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and b1000 signal intensity (SI) of GIST visualized on the WB-DWI as predictor of time to progression, determined by progression-free survival (PFS) 2. Evaluation of WB-DWI using changes of high b-value SI and ADC early during treatment (2weeks after start of therapy; allowed optimal window 10-14 days) as early predictor of time to progression or patient benefit according to RECIST (stable disease + partial response + complete response) 3. Evaluation of WB-DWI for treatment follow-up 3 months after initiation of treatment. Confirmation of prior published pilot study (Dunet V et al, J Nucl Med 2010) 4. Comparison of WB-DWI with conventional CT imaging for response assessment</detailed_description>
