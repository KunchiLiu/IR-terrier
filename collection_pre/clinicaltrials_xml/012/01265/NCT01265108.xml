	<brief_summary>During alveolar hypoxia, for example at high altitude or in patients with respiratory disease, there is evidence to suggest that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension might limit exercise performance. Intravenous iron supplementation has recently been shown to reverse pulmonary hypertension in healthy humans at high altitude, and to prevent pulmonary hypertension in volunteers exposed to hypoxia at sea level. The investigators hypothesized that intravenous iron supplementation would enhance exercise capacity during alveolar hypoxia.</brief_summary>
