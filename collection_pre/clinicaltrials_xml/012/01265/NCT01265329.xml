	<brief_summary>In spite of the achievements and developement of the assisted reproduction techniques in the last years, there is still an elevated percentage of unsuccessful treatments, needing sometimes repeated attempts to reach pregnancy. The molecular physiology of sperm is being better characterized, and some reports have demonstrated the implication of different molecular processes in the pathophysiology of male infertility. Recently, different sperm selection methods have been based on these molecular differences, showing a better quality of the sperm population after selection. The main objective of this research project is to clinically apply these techniques in order to increase the pregnancy rates per cycle in infertile couples attending assisted reproduction treatments.</brief_summary>
