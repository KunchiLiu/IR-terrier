	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea is a common situation that affects up to 80% of acromegalic patients. This disease is linked to disturbance on the carbohydrate metabolism increasing the rates of diabetes. The objective of this trial is to assess (with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp) the impact of the treatment of sleep apnea, with a continuous positive air pressure device (CPAP), on the insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
