	<brief_title>Intratracheal Vitamin A Administration With Surfactant for Newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity is the major cause of long-term disability of extremely LBW (ELBW) premature infants, and it is the most cost consumptive disease in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit graduates. Vitamin A plays an important role in the development of premature lung. Nevertheless, premature infants are prone to vitamin A deficiency. Oral supplementation of vitamin A does not alter the incidence of CLD in ELBW infants. Intramuscular administration of vitamin A reduced the incidence of CLD. The treatment is considered painful and this way is not routinely practiced. Vitamin A is systemically bioavailable after intratracheal administration with surfactant in an animal model of newborn respiratory distress.</detailed_description>
