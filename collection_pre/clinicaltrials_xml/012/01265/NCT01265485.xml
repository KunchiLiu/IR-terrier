	<brief_summary>This is an open label, dose-finding, 2-parts study. Approximately 6 subjects will be participating in this study. This study is composed of 2 parts: Part 1 is a dose finding study. Part 2 is a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic study of an elected dose. A screening will be used to determine patients' suitability for inclusion in the trial. Within one week after the screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will enter part 1 of the study, one day of dose escalation. During this part, patients will undergo rectal manometry to determine anal pressure at baseline. Afterwards coated suppositories at various drug concentrations will be inserted and follow up manometries will be performed to determine response. Patients that presented with an increase in rectal resting pressure without adverse events will enter the second part of the study. In this part, patients will be administered with a coated suppository, at a dose found at part 1 of the study to cause significant anal contraction. Manometry studies will be performed before insertion (baseline) and at 1, 3 and 5 hours after insertion. Blood levels for drug concentrations will be taken at times 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300 minutes after administration and rectal manometries will be done at times 0, 1, 3 and 5 hours after administration.</brief_summary>
