	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effectiveness of 28 days of triple combination therapy including SCY-635 with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in reducing serum HCV RNA levels. An additional 20 weeks of treatment with the currently approved standard of care will be offered to all participants. The Week 24 visit will be the last on-study visit. After the Week 24 visit, all subjects with undetectable HCV RNA will be given the option to continue treatment with standard of care for an additional 24 weeks (out to Week 48) under the care of their Principal Investigator.</brief_summary>
