	<criteria>Patient must have biopsy proven highgrade (severe)dysplasia, carcinomainsitu or early stage adenocarcinoma Patient may have received prior therapy; e.g.NdYAG laser, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. At least onemonth must have elapsed between prior treatments and PDT Tumors (HGD/CIS or early adenocarcinoma) can be primary or recurrent, Stage 0 or I N0M (any) Patients must have no contraindication to endoscopy Male or female patients must be 18 years old or older. Female patients must not be pregnant and must be practicing a medically acceptable form of birth control or be sterile or postmenopausal. A Pregnancy test is required and must be negative. Patients must sign an Informed Consent according to FDA guidelines and be acceptable to the RPCI IRB Patients must have a Karnofsky status 50 or above. Patients with early invasive adenocarcinoma will be included only if they are considered poor surgical risks, have failed or refused XRT/chemo, or refused surgery. If the patients has had cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, their treating physician must deem them diseasefree. Patients with tumors of grade greater than T1. Porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrin or porphyrinlike compounds WBC&lt;4000; platelet count&lt;100,000; prothrombin times 1.5 times above upper normal limit. Patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function (total serum bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/d, serum creatinine&gt;3 mg%, alkaline phosphatase (hepatic) or SGOT&gt; 3 times the upper normal limit. Patients on concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be excluded as well as those having received prior treatment for the esophageal cancer within 4 weeks of enrollment.</criteria>
