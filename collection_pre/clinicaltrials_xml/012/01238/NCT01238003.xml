	<brief_summary>Laboratory testing of Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasm Antibody (ANCA) is used to confirm diagnosis of patients who have a high level of suspicion for ANCA-related vasculitis. In these patients the specificity and sensitivity to the ANCA test is very high. This study hopes to prove that when this lab test is performed on blood of patients who do not have a high level of suspicion for ANCA-related vasculitis, the sensitivity and specificity is reduced and there are many false positive results. Because of this, it should not be used as a screening test for a more general patient population.</brief_summary>
