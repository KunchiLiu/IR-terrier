	<brief_title>Latin America Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to provide local evidence regarding Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), in both pacing and defibrillation devices across Latin America. The primary objective will focus on changes in left ventricular heart size and function measurements in subjects receiving CRT therapy. The following additional parameters will also be collected: - Data on referral patterns in Latin America; - Data on device implant (including delivery system, device information, and lead information); - Clinical data on subject outcomes and changes (improved, unchanged, or worsened) in heart failure status as assessed by heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, mortality, and Quality of Life (QOL) measured by the Patient Global Assessment;</detailed_description>
