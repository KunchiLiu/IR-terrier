	<brief_title>Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy Followed by MIDLE Chemotherapy in Stage I/II Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy: Radiation 36-44 Gy/18-22 fractions (2 Gy/fraction) Weekly Cisplatin 30mg/m2 + N/S 100ml MIV over 30min Tri-weekly L-asparaginase 4000 IU IV (D1, 3, 5) Rest period: 3 weeks MIDLE chemotherapy: Repeated every 28 days for 2 cycles D1 Methotrexate 3g/m2 + D5W 500ml MIV over 6 hours D2-D3 Etoposide 100mg/m2 + D5W 500ml MIV over 90mins D2-D3 Ifosfamide 1000mg/m2 + D5W 100ml MIV over 1hr D2-D3 Mesna 300mg/m2 + D5W 100ml MIV over 15mins (-15min, 4hrs and 8hrs after ifosfamide, total 3 doses) D1-D4 Dexamethasone 40mg/d PO or IV D4, 6, 8, 14, 10 L-asparaginase 6000IU/m2 + D5W 500ml MIV over 2hours</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients were required to have a biopsyproven diagnosis of nasal ENKTL at least 18 years old Ann Arbor stage IE or IIE measurable disease Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 life expectancy greater than 12 weeks adequate hematologic (hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/uL and platelets &gt; 100,000/uL) renal (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min) hepatic (total bilirubin &lt; 2 times of upper limit of normal and aspartate transferase &lt; 3 times of upper limit of normal) function Diagnosis of ENKTL is based on the presence of histological features and immunophenotypes compatible with ENKTL (e.g., cytoplasmic CD3+, CD20, CD56+, positive for cytotoxic molecules positive for EBV by in situ hybridization). Informed consent prior or concomitant malignant tumors any coexisting medical problems of sufficient severity to prevent full compliance with the study protocol. ENKTL with nonnasal sites such as skin or gastrointestinal tract was excluded even if it is localized. Other subtypes of nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia, blastic NK cell lymphoma/precursor NK cell lymphoblastic leukemia, aggressive NK cell leukemia, and peripheral T cell lymphoma, unspecified, were excluded.</criteria>
