	<brief_summary>This randomized,active controlled study aimed to compare the effects on sexual function of treatment with combined antihypertensive drugs. The researchers hypothesize that: 1. Both felodipine-irbesartan combination and felodipine-metoprolol combination are effective in lowing blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. 2. Felodipine-metoprolol combination induces a worse sexual function and a reduction of sex hormone,whereas felodipine-irbesartan combination does not impair sexual function and does not change hormone levels. 3. Oxidative stress decline after both combination regimens. Felodipine-irbesartan combination has a greater impact on oxidative stress indicators than felodipine-metoprolol combination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effects of hypertension and its pharmacotherapy on sexual function are well known in men,although this topic remains unexplored in women.There is evidence suggests that some classes of antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics and beta-blockers have more negative impact on male sexual function than other classes such as calcium channel blockers(CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEI).Some data suggest that angiotensin Ⅱ antagonists（ARBs) not only do not exacerbate sexual function in males,but even improve it. Treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications was often necessary to attain blood-pressure goals recommended by guidelines.More than two third of patients with 2 or 3 degree of essential hypertension require combination therapy at the beginning of treatment to avoid target organ damage and to minimize the accidence of adverse events. CCBs were recommended by both JNC-7 and ESH / ESC 2007 hypertension guidelines as the basic for the treatment of hypertension.The purpose of this study is to compare the impacts of different CCB-based antihypertensive drugs combination on sexual behavior in both male and female patients with essential hypertension,thus provide evidences for physicians to increase patients adherence to the treatment regimens beside lowing blood pressure.</detailed_description>
