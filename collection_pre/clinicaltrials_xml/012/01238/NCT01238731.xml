	<brief_summary>Background: Persistent severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) after mechanical valve replacement is a frequent finding in patients with severe valve-diseases. The reasons to develop PH are multifactorial and the prevalence of severe PH significantly worsens the patientsÂ´ outcome. Aims: (i) To define the prevalence of PH in patients after valve replacement and (ii) to identify factors predicting persistent PH. Methods: All patients which underwent valve replacement at our institution between the years 2008 -2010 will be screened retrospectively. Those patients with pre- procedural proven PH by means of right-heart catheterization will receive prospective follow-up with echocardiography. Diagnosis of persistent PH will be confirmed with right heart catheterization.</brief_summary>
