	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving combination chemotherapy together with dasatinib works in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with dasatinib may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of dasatinib with intensive induction therapy (daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine), consolidation chemotherapy (high-dose cytarabine), and as single agent in maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess clinical outcomes such as event-free survival (EFS), complete response (CR) rate, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), cumulative incidence of death (CID), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with these regimens. II. To describe the frequency and severity of adverse events of patients treated on this study during induction, consolidation, and continuation therapy. III. To describe the interaction of pretreatment disease and patient characteristics including morphology, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, molecular genetic features, white blood cell (WBC) count and hemogram, and performance status on clinical outcomes. OUTLINE: INDUCTION THERAPY (course 1): Patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1-3, cytarabine IV continuously over 168 hours on days 1-7, and dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-21. Patients with responsive disease on day 21 undergo consolidation therapy, and patients with non-responsive disease on day 21 (bone marrow cellularity &gt;= 20 % and leukemia blasts &gt;= 5%) receive a second course of induction therapy. INDUCTION THERAPY (course 2): Patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, cytarabine IV continuously over 120 hours on days 1-5, and dasatinib PO once a day on days 6-19. Patients achieving complete response receive consolidation therapy. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, and dasatinib PO QD on days 6-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete remission receive continuation therapy. CONTINUATION THERAPY: Patients receive dasatinib PO on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every year for up to 10 years.</detailed_description>
