Periods without Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), lasting for at least 36 hours, will separate treatment visits. At each treatment visit, blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be sampled immediately before, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, as well as at 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after start of product administration. The time until complete tablet dissolution will be recorded. Subjects will also be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur. Treatment labels will be concealed from subjects and study personnel.</detailed_description>
