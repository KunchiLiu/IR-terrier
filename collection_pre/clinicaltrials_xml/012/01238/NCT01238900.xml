	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Use of Metal Stents as Part of the Treatment of Benign Biliary Strictures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with benign biliary strictures, the use of fully covered self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) has been proposed as an alternative to plastic stenting, but high quality prospective data is sparse. This study was performed to evaluate the long -term effectiveness and safety of a new fully covered SEMS for benign biliary strictures.</detailed_description>
