	<brief_summary>The current trial shall clarify the potential of the multitarget antiangiogenic tyrosinkinase inhibitor GW 786034 (pazopanib) in combination with oral cyclophosphamide as salvage treatment in patients with recurrent, pretreated ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Pazopanib and Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective open-label, non-randomized multicenter phase I/II trial in order to determine overall response rate of patients with platinum-resistant or refractory recurrent, pretreated epithelial ovarian cancer. In order to assure adequate toxicity assessment, a phase-I-trial is proponed. Phase II will be performed with MTD.</detailed_description>
