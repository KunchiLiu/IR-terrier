	<brief_summary>Recently, IgE-type autoantibodies against self proteins have been detected in the serum of the atopic dermatitis patients. The role of this IgE autoantibodies involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is not known, yet. But, there may be a correlation between the severity of the disease and the serum levels of this autoantibodies. The autologous serum skin testing is applied to both atopic dermatitis patients and healthy control and the results are estimated in this study.The investigators detected 70% positive autologous serum skin testing in atopic dermatitis patients and test positivity was higher in patients with atopy history, moderately severe disease calculated by SCORAD index and high serum IgE levels.</brief_summary>
