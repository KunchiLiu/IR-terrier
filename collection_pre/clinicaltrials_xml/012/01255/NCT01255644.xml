	<brief_summary>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is increasingly believed to be closely related to chronic stimulation of healthy B-cells. Identification of antigen(s) are relevant for the stimulation of CLL precursor cells is therefore of high interest. The investigators found recently evidence that a herpes virus is involved in this process of stimulation. Consequently, elimination of the antigenic stimulation of leukemic cells by this herpes virus may be expected to reduce or even inhibit propagation of leukemic cells. The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of CMV replication by a short course of antiviral treatment may reduce significantly proliferation rates of leukemic cells. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will treat 20 CLL patients with an antiviral drug for 3 months in a proof-of-concept clinical trial and leukemic cell counts measured before and after antiviral treatment. Antiviral treatment has the potential to treat the disease at its origin and therefore more efficiently than conventional chemotherapeutic regimens.</brief_summary>
