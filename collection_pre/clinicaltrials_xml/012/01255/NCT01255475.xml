	<brief_summary>Previous studies have demonstrated a direct association between blood pressure level and cardiovascular risk. However in patients with heart failure this association is considered controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the reduction of blood pressure in patients with heart failure. The investigators will examine the effects of this intervention over mortality, quality of life, and cardiac function.</brief_summary>
