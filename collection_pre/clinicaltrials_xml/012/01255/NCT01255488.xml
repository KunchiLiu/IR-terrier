	<brief_summary>To better understand the extent to which family nurse practitioners (FNPs) might use research abstracts in shaping their clinical decision-making under simulated conditions. A secondary point is to examine if and how FNPs might use full-text manuscripts (associated with the abstracts) if made available to them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Abstract Usefulness in Clinical Decision-making</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will recruit the approximate 25 - 1st year and 25 - 2nd year family nurse practitioner students of the Graduate School of Nursing. After being presented an overview of the study and informed consent document, those electing to participate will draw a sealed envelope indicating whether they are assigned to group A (intervention group) or group B (control group). The participant will proceed to the associated room, be provided a brief clinical case (appropriate to their training), an iPad device with pre-loaded EBN-Search engine, and a questionnaire. The EBN-Search engine for the intervention group will include 9 research abstracts associated to the case. The EBN-Search for the control group will include both the research abstracts and full-text versions of the manuscripts. The participants will be provided 20 minutes to complete the questionnaire using the information available to them. The questionnaire will require the participant to indicate treatment plan, respond to questions regarding the usefulness of research abstracts, questions regarding the usefulness of full-text (control group only) and recommendations on improving EBN-Search.</detailed_description>
