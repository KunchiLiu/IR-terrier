	<brief_summary>This study is to understand the role of nerve growth factor(NGF) and other cytokines in the pancreatic fluid of patients with chronic pancreatitis. Hypothesis: 1. Pain does not correlate with changes in the PD morphology suggesting that pain in CP is not only a mechanical problem 2. Pain in CP correlates better with the levels of NGF in the pancreatic juice. NGF is variably expressed in different morphological stages of CP and regulates the sensitivity of the peptidergic nociceptors and is upregulated in pancreatic inflammation.</brief_summary>
