	<brief_summary>Background: - Adrenocortical carcinoma is an aggressive cancer that starts in the adrenal gland at the top of the kidneys. It has a low survival rate if standard treatment options are not effective. Axitinib is an experimental drug that is being studied to determine if it can stop tumors from growing or make them smaller. Researchers are interested in investigating axitinib in individuals with aggressive or otherwise untreatable adrenocortical cancer. Objectives: - To evaluate the effectiveness of axitinib in individuals who have adrenocortical cancer that is inoperable and has not responded to standard treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with adrenocortical cancer that has not responded to standard treatments. Design: - Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history, as well as tumor imaging studies. - Participants may have a tumor biopsy prior to starting axitinib. - All participants will receive axitinib to take twice a day with food for 28 days (1 cycle). Participants should not drink grapefruit juice or smoke cigarettes while participating in this study. - After the first cycle, the dose may be increased and additional cycles will be given if the treatment has not had serious side effects. - Participants will have regular examinations while taking axitinib, including blood samples and tumor imaging studies to determine if the tumor has stopped growing. Blood pressure levels will be carefully monitored during treatment to evaluate potential risk for high blood pressure. - Participants may have a second tumor biopsy 20 to 30 days after treatment begins. - Treatment will continue as directed by the study researchers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Axitinib (AG-013736) With Evaluation of the VEGF-Pathway in Metastatic, Recurrent or Primary Unresectable Adrenocortical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - The response rates of recurrent, metastatic and unresectable adrenocortical cancer (ACC) to mitotane, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cisplatin are low and underscore the need for more effective systemic therapies. - VEGF expression and evidence of angiogenesis has been found in many ACCs, so it is plausible that interfering with vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) signaling may result in anti-tumor activity in patients with ACC. - Axitinib (AG-013736) is an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2, and 3. Pre-clinical data suggests that the anti-tumor activity of axitinib may result from its anti-angiogenic activity and that this is reversible when treatment is discontinued. - Given the known clinical safety and efficacy of axitinib, an assessment of its activity in ACC and its impact on the VEGF pathway in ACC could provide valuable information. Objectives: - Determine the response rate of axitinib (AG-013736) in recurrent, metastatic, or primary unresectable ACC - Determine the progression-free survival - Explore the relationship of potential biological markers of axitinib activity with clinical outcomes. - Explore the pharmacogenetic analyses of drug metabolism and transport proteins through germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) examination. Eligibility: - Adults with pathologic confirmation of ACC by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Diagnosis of recurrent, metastatic, or primary unresectable ACC - Measurable disease at presentation - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 - Patients must not have received prior therapy with a tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor Design: - Phase II, open label, non-randomized trial - Patients with recurrent, metastatic, or primary unresectable ACC will be given in eight weeks cycles with BID dosing of axitinib (AG-013736). - Patients will be evaluated for response every eight weeks using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. - Tumor biopsies are not mandatory but every attempt will be made to obtain these from patients prior to starting axitinib and again 20-30 days after treatment has begun. - Approximately 40 patients will be needed to achieve the objectives of the trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Pathologic confirmation of adrenocortical cancer by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI). 2. Measurable disease at presentation. 3. A life expectancy of at least 3 months and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2. 4. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. 5. Last dose of chemotherapy or experimental therapy more than 4 weeks (6 weeks in the case of nitrosourea) prior to enrollment date; 2 weeks if the last therapy was received as part of a phase 0 or exploratory investigational new drug (IND) trial. Last surgery more than 4 weeks prior to enrollment, to allow for wound healing. Core biopsies or fine needle aspiration (FNA) will not require any waiting period. 6. Last radiotherapy treatment 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with this protocol and there must be sites of measurable disease that did not receive radiation. 7. Prior mitotane therapy is allowed. Patients with a history of a functional tumor who are receiving mitotane to control the excess hormone production may continue to receive mitotane. 8. Organ and marrow function as defined below: Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal), unless the patient meets the criteria for Gilbert's Syndrome. The upper limit value for bilirubin for subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome is less than 3 mg/dl. Note: A diagnosis of Gilbert's disease will be made in the presence of (1) unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted on several occasions; (2) normal results from complete blood count (CBC) count, reticulocyte count, and blood smear; (3) normal liver function test results; and (4) an absence of other disease processes that can explain the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN, alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater than or equal to 2.5 times ULN Amylase and lipase equal to, or less than, the institutional ULN. Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 ml/min (measured in a timed urine collection) or serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm^3. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/ mm^3. 9. Ability to understand and sign an informed consent document. 10. Ability and willingness to follow the guidelines of the clinical protocol including visits to NCI, Bethesda, Maryland for treatment and follow up visits. 11. Because the effects of chemotherapy on the developing human fetus are potentially harmful, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier methods) before, during the study and for a period of 3 months after the last dose of chemotherapy. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patients with adrenocortical tumors potentially curable by surgical excision alone as determined by the Principal Investigator in discussions with the surgical consultants. 2. Patients who have large abdominal masses impinging on bowel or pulmonary masses with encroached vessels and a potential to bleed will be considered on case by case basis after careful consultation with multiple disciplines such as radiologists and surgeons with main intent being patient safety. 3.
