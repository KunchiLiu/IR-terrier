	<brief_summary>Despite the use of highly effective anti-malarial medications, 10-30% of African children with severe malaria will die, underscoring the need for adjunctive therapies that can be applied in endemic areas. A clinical trial of adjunctive inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in severe malaria is warranted on the basis of firm proof of concept from animal studies and a human study using the NO donor L-arginine, together with evidence of safety from clinical experience and trials of iNO for other conditions. Our objective is to determine whether supplemental iNO (80 ppm) in addition to Ugandan Standard of Care treatment reduces levels of Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a quantitative biomarker of malaria severity, in children with severe malaria compared to Standard of Care treatment alone. We will conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial among children 1-10 years of age admitted to Jinja Hospital (Uganda) with severe malaria to test the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in severe malaria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitric Oxide for the Adjunctive Therapy of Severe Malaria: a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe malaria remains a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. While the use of artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy has improved outcomes in severe malaria, the mortality rate remains high. Adjunctive therapies that target the underlying pathophysiology of severe malaria may further reduce morbidity and mortality. Endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria, of which the angiogenic factors angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have recently been shown to function as key regulators. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major inhibitor of Ang-2 release from endothelium and has been shown to decrease endothelial inflammation and reduce the adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes. Low-flow inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) is a US FDA-approved treatment for hypoxic respiratory failure in neonates. Based on compelling data on the efficacy of iNO in experimental cerebral malaria in animal models, coupled with the documented safety of iNO in clinical practice and trials for other diseases, we propose a randomized clinical trial of iNO for the adjunctive treatment of severe malaria in Ugandan children.</detailed_description>
