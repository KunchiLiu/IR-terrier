	<brief_summary>Despite the common use of oral steroids in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), the natural history and efficacy of this treatment modality has not been fully elucidated. Specifically, patients who have undergone prior ESS and have recalcitrant CRS, the natural history of endoscopic improvement and quality of life (QoL) outcomes, following an oral steroid taper, is poorly defined. The purpose of this non-randomized single-arm clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an oral steroid taper in improving endoscopic grading, QoL, and olfactory function as well as defining the duration of improvement, in patients with recalcitrant CRS with prior endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).</brief_summary>
