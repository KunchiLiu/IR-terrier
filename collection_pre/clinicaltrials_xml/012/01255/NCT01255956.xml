	<brief_title>Restenosis Treatment With Rapamycin Eluting Stent or Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon Catheter (RESTENOZA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study aims: - Clinical efficacy evaluation of different treatment's strategies, including periprocedural and long-term endpoints defined as: death, myocardial infarction, brain stroke, necessity of repeated revascularization - Evaluation of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as an optimisation method for direct and long-term revascularization effects - Evaluation of optical coherence tomography as an optimisation method for direct and long-term revascularization effects - Evaluation of late lumen loss and neointimal hyperplasia in stent in long-term follow-up - Analysis of direct and indirect medical costs of alternative treatment strategies Study group: 200 patients with symptomatic restenosis evidenced angiographically in bare metal stent implanted in native coronary artery. Patients will be randomised to 2 therapeutic groups: - Patients treated with rapamycin eluting stent (n=100) - Patients treated with paclitaxel eluting balloon catheter (n=100)</detailed_description>
