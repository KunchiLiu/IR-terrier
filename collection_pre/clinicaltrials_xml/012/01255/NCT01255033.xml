	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of two peripheral and non invasive devices to detect hypoxic events during one-lung ventilation and during the early postoperative period. One device measures regional cerebral oxygenation and the other muscular oxygenation. These two devices are compared to non invasive arterial saturation (SpO2), which is the gold standard.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung surgery is often complicated by hypoxic evants : - during one-lung ventilation which leads to changes about ratio in ventilated and perfused lung areas. This blood flow redistribution promotes shunt with a decreased arterial oxygenation and possible hypoxemia. - during the postoperative period. Common measure of arterial saturation through SpO2 may miss a great number of hypoxic events with regional impact because a significant decrease in SpO2 occurs for an arterial pressure in oxygen below 60 mmHg. Currently, cerebral and somatic saturation can be monitored non-invasively and continuously via optical sensors applied to the right and left forehead and to the thenar eminence. These devices may help clinicians in the detection of such hypoxemic events.</detailed_description>
