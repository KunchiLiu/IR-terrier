Subject is felt to be at risk of noncompliance (e.g., for completing the diary or maintaining a stable headache medicine regimen) in the Investigator's opinion. Subject has had previous lesional radiofrequency ablation of the ipsilateral sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG). Subject has had blocks of the ipsilateral SPG in the last three (3) months. Subject has undergone botulinum toxin injections of the head and/or neck in the last three (3) months.
