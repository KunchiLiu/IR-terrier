	<brief_summary>Despite the advantages of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) over conventional chemotherapy,1,2 the results of high-dose chemoradiotherapy in multiple myeloma (MM) are still unsatisfactory with a 6-year event free survival (EFS) of only 24%. Based on existing data, bortezomib-containing regimens are currently accepted at many centers as an induction treatment option for patients with symptomatic MM, particularly if it is planned to offer subsequent high-dose therapy with ASCT. So we will use bortezomib-containing regimens as induction prior to this novel conditioning regimen. The objective of the present study is to compare the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a new high-dose regimen using dose-escalation of BOR, BU and MEL for ASCT in the Korean patients with MM. The patients should be treated with bortezomib-containing regimens as an induction therapy before ASCT. We will specifically analyze (i) the efficacy of the conditioning regimen in improving the pre-ASCT status, response rate (ii) engraftment and transplant-related mortality (TRM) and (iii) the impact on survival including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Triple combination of conditioning will enhance the response rate after ASCT, and will improve not only PFS, but also OS. We think that data from this study may further strengthen feasibility of BOR in conditioning prior to ASCT.</brief_summary>
