	<brief_summary>Excessive body weight and obesity have reached epidemic proportions over the last few decades, which may cause many chronic diseases. Maintaining a healthy life style could decrease the risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The study aimed to evaluate long-term low glycemic index (GI) diet intervention on lipid profile, body composition and the mechanism of obese women. The pilot study will recruit twenty healthy subjects, and served test food to determine low GI food. In the experiment period, twenty women age from 20-50 years will be recruited. To be included in the study, subjects should have a BMI above 24 kg/m2, or the either one (fat mass ≧ 30% or waistline &gt; 80 cm). Before dietary intervention, participants will receive food choice table and dietary questionnaires to record their dietary intake. The study will be a randomized, crossover, controlled clinical trails. The experiment period have six weeks, each participants will provide low GI diet (lunch and dinner). On the 0, 3, 6 week, subjects will measurement their body composition (body weight, body mass, waist and hip circumferences) and collect fasting blood samples to analysis the lipid profile, free fatty acid, blood sugar, insulin, adiponectin, leptin and fatty acid synthesis enzymes. Statistical analysis will be performed by paired t-test. The study expect that long-term low GI diet intervention have beneficial effects on regulate body composition of obese women.</brief_summary>
