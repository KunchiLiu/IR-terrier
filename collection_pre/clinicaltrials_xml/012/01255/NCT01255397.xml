	<brief_summary>The purpose of this experiment is to test the feasibility of a minimally interventionist protocol for young couples with male factor infertility, which addresses the cause of infertility for these couples which is the inability of the sperm to fertilize the egg.Ultrasound monitoring of natural follicular development utilizing rFSH, GnRH antagonist and rHCG only for the final maturation. Single follicle aspiration and IUI or IVF/ICSI based on sperm charcteristics on the day of fertilization. Fertilized eggs transfered to the uterus on the same day as the aspiration.</brief_summary>
