	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the (statistical) non-inferiority of iobitridol (Xenetix速 350) when compared to contrast agents with higher iodine concentrations, iopromide (Ultravist速 370) and iomeprol (Iomeron速 400) in terms of coronary CT scan evaluability (quality and interpretability of images).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Xenetix速 350: Comparative Assessment of Image Quality for Coronary CT Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suspected of coronary artery disease were submitted to coronary CT angiography using either iobitridol or contrast agents with higher iodine concentrations (iopromide or iomeprol). Independent off-site readers evaluated image quality regarding the ability to identify coronary artery stenosis (score 0- non evaluable to 4- excellent quality). The study was aimed at showing the non-inferiority of iobitridol in its ability to provide evaluable CT scans for the identification of coronary stenosis.</detailed_description>
