	<detailed_description>The changes in cerebral perfusion have an important role on the development of intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leucomalacia. Near infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility of noninvasive and continuous bedside investigation of cerebral oxygenation in newborn infants. Using this technique we investigated the effect of positional changes on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants.</detailed_description>
