	<brief_summary>This study examines the pharmacokinetic profile of Armstrong's proposed Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP, an HFA134a propelled Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (E004), using a stable isotope deuterium-labeled epinephrine (epinephrine-d3) to differentiate the administered drug from the endogenous epinephrine, in healthy male and female adult volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP, CLINICAL STUDY-B3 FOR ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is designed to complement and expand the previous PK studies, API-E004-CL-B and API-E004-CL-B2, with emphasis on lower E004 dose strengths (at 90 and 100 mcg per inhalation), for a more thorough evaluation of the E004 PK profiles. Safety of E004 will also be evaluated, under augmented dose conditions.</detailed_description>
