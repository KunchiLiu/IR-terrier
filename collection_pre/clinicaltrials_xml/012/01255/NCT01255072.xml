	<brief_title>rTMS in Elderly Depressed:Neuronavegated Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most part of the studies uses samples of severe depressive patients with refractoriness and/or psychotic symptoms, which leave lacuna about the effects on depressive disorder with low or moderate scores. The literature is poor about the use of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the old age population.Therefore, we chose this group to research for the antidepressive effect of TMS; other interests are to identify modifications in the magnetic resonance imaging, evaluate cognitive functions and to verify the occurrence of collateral effects and safety use for this specific population.</detailed_description>
