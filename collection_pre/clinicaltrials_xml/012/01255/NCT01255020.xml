	<brief_title>Renal Protective Effects of Restricted Protein Dietary With α-keto Acid in CAPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residual renal function (RRF) is associated with cardiovascular complication, nutritional status, incidence of peritonitis, and quality of life in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Therefore, RRF is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity in PD patients. Previous studies have suggested that dietary protein restriction supplemented with α-keto acids may slow the loss of RRF in chronic kidney disease patients. However, these trials are small sample and short-time research. In PD patients, there is very few reports to indicate the effect of α-keto acid with restricted protein diet on RRF. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of α-keto acid with restricted protein diet on protecting residual renal function in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.This is a prospective, double blind randomized, parallel control, and multi-center clinical study. 160 patients who meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be randomized into α-Keto Acid group or control group at the ratio of 1:1. The α-Keto Acid group will use compound α-Keto Acid plus restricted protein diet, while control group will use placebo plus restricted protein diet.The α-Keto Acid dosage is 100mg/kg/d daily. The restricted protein dosage is 1g/kg/d. The safety and efficacy of α-Keto Acid with restricted protein diet on RRF will be evaluated after 1 year treatment.</detailed_description>
