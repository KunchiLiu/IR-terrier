	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the frequency and severity of postoperative( after surgery) pain between two surgical techniques for treating severe hemorrhoids. The two techniques are called: transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) and standard surgical excision (removal) of the hemorrhoids</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trans-anal Hemorrhoidal Dearterialization (THD) vs. Hemorrhoidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The THD technique involves using ultrasound equipment to identify the arteries that are feeding blood into the hemorrhoids. Once located, stitches are placed around those arteries to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoids, which destroys them. In the standard surgical excision technique, the hemorrhoids are removed by cutting them out with a scalpel. Both techniques are widely used in many hospitals today. However, there have been no formal studies comparing the two techniques regarding outcomes, particularly regarding pain after the procedure. We plan to enroll 60 patients in this study here at Stony Brook; 30 patients will have THD and 30 will have the standard surgical excision of hemorrhoids.</detailed_description>
