	<brief_title>Intervention With n3 LC-PUFA-supplemented Yogurt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty three mildly hypertriacylglycerolemic subjects (TAG ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)) participated on the placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel designed study. The subjects consumed placebo yoghurt (1), or n3 LC-PUFA-enriched yoghurt (0.8 g n3 LC-PUFA/d (2), 3 g n3 LC-PUFA/d (3)) for 10 weeks. Blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the period. Parameters: - Blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triacylglycerols) - Fatty acid distribution of plasma lipids (PL) and erythrocyte membranes (EM) - Concentrations of eicosanoids (PGs, HETEs) - Production of ex vivo stimulated cytokines by T cells - SNPs in the CD36 genotype</detailed_description>
	<criteria>hypertriacylglycerolemic subjects (TAG: ≥ 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l)) patients receiving blooddiluting and lipidlowering medications or glucocorticoids patients suffering from gastrointestinal or metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hyper and hypothyroidism) and hypercholesteremic patients with familial previous impacts patients taking dietary supplements (e.g., fish oil capsules, vitamin E) or having either known allergies or foodstuff indigestibility further exclusion criteria: smoking, high sportive activity or daily alcohol intake</criteria>
