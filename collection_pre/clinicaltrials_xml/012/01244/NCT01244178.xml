	<brief_summary>Insulin regulates blood sugar and acts to suppress inflammation. Hyperinsulinemic Therapy is a protocol for Insulin administration that involves the administration of a calculated higher dose of insulin into the blood stream. This therapy is called dextrose/insulin clamp. It has been shown to be safe and successful in maintaining normal glucose levels. The objective of the study is to assess if the clamp can achieve a steady and normal blood glucose level in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis. Furthermore, if the higher insulin dose would lead to a drop in the inflammatory response seen in septic patients.</brief_summary>
