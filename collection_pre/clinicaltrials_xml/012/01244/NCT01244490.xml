Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSMIVTR) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD, combined subtype, hyperactive/impulsive subtype, or inattentive subtype based on a detailed psychiatric evaluation using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime version (KSADSPL). 4.

Subject has a known or suspected allergy, hypersensitivity, or clinically significant intolerance to guanfacine hydrochloride or atomoxetine hydrochloride, or any components found in SPD503 or STRATTERA. 16. Clinically important abnormality on drug and alcohol screen (excluding the subject's current ADHD stimulant if applicable) at Screening (Visit 1) 17. Subject is female and is pregnant or currently lactating. 18. Subject failed screening or was previously enrolled in this study. 19. Subject is currently considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the Investigator, has previously made a suicide attempt, or has a prior history of, or is currently demonstrating active suicide ideation.
