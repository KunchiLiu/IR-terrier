	<brief_title>A Cohort Study of Patients Treated With Brachytherapy for Selected Desmoid Patients in Gardner Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1978, we have been following a family of 105 descendants with Gardner Syndrome (GS). Mutation carriers were screened by endoscopy, and colorectal resection was performed upon pending malignancy. Resectable desmoid tumors were excised, whereas large tumors of the abdominal wall were treated by a combination of brachytherapy (BT) and radiotherapy (RT). Outcome was analyzed with respect to length of tumor-free survival, and morbidity from surgery or radiotherapy. Results: 37 of 105 family members have GS. Preventive colorectal resections were performed in 16 patients (15%), with one death due to subsequent gastric cancer. In 4 patients who denied screening endoscopy, invasive tumors of the colon (3 patients) and stomach (one patient each) developed. Of 33 desmoid tumors, 10 (30%) were located in the mesentery, 17 (52%) in the abdominal wall, and 6 (18%) in extra-abdominal sites. Excision of 12 desmoids was performed in 8 patients (36%), and 4 were treated by a combination of BT and RT. Following BT/RT, all patients showed full or partial remission.</detailed_description>
