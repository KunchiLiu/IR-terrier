	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential role of a cardiology clinic-based educational intervention for 15 to 17 year olds with congenital heart disease (CHD) and their parents, and to determine whether this intervention results in improved self-management skills (e.g., renewing medication prescriptions), teens having greater knowledge of their heart condition, and more teen and parent satisfaction with services. The results of this study will form the basis for a website that in turn may serve as an additional means of providing transition interventions. The results of this study may also be applicable to youth with other special health care needs.</brief_summary>
