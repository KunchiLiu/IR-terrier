	<brief_summary>Number of patients planned The study adopted two parallel phase II studies, with the same P1 and P0 in each arm, suggested by Logan. The investigators hypothesized a target ORR of interest, P1=50, and a lower ORR, P0=25 with the treatment of DCS and DCF, respectively. Under the assumption of α-error=0.05 and β-error= 0.2, using sample size tables of A'Hern, 26 patients were required per arm to achieve the desired statistical power. Finally, taking a 20% drop-out rate into consideration, the overall number of enrolled patients was 62.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Combination Chemotherapy of DCS (Cisplatin + Docetaxel + S-1) and DCF (Docetaxel + Cisplatin + 5-FU) in Patients With Locally Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment scheme - Screening period: D-21 to D1 (treatment day) - Preoperative screening includes EUS, laparoscopy (optional), EGD and abd-pelvic CT scan. - Preoperative clinical staging is based on the guideline of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA, 1998) - Tumor response is assessed every 2 cycles (6 weeks) - Treatment is repeated until,. - 4 cycles - progressive disease - unacceptable toxicity - patient's withdrawal - Gastric surgery should be performed within 4~6 weeks of the last dose of chemotherapy - Gastric surgery is for curative aim and should include ≥ D2 LN dissection. - Patients who received R0 resection should receive at least 4-cycled adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU and cisplatin. - Palliative chemotherapy should be indicated for inoperable progressive disease or who failed curative resection. 5-FU and oxaliplatin combination is recommended as first-line therapy. - Follow up for survival is repeated every 3 months for 2 years Study period Patient enroll period for 12 months., and follow-up duration for further 12 months., resulting total study period of 24 months</detailed_description>
