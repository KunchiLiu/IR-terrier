	<brief_summary>The Insulin Sensitivity using Aerobic Interval Conditioning (ISAIC) trial will compare traditional aerobic training (AER) to interval training (INT) in sedentary, overweight/obese men at risk for pre-diabetes. The investigators will randomly assign 42 individuals to 3 months of monitored exercise using a randomly assisgned design where participants will exercise under either AER or INT training conditions. The AER training condition will be consistent with "standard-of-care" recommendations. Exercise training will entail one 3-month blocks of either AER or INT. Training will consist of 1) a 1-month ramp up period, 2) 1-month of traditional aerobic training and 3) 1-month of either continued AER or INT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is currently estimated that type II diabetes (T2D) affects 5-8% of adults. Also recognized is a transitional group of individuals whose control of blood glucose is abnormal, but not yet considered diabetic. These individuals are classified as having pre-diabetes, which is defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG;fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dl), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; post 2-h glucose load; 140-199 mg/dl) or both. This population represents a significant segment of the population as it is estimated that approximately 23% of Americans have pre-diabetes (IGT or IFG). Two unifying features associated with these metabolic impairments is a strong link to obesity and physical inactivity. Regular exercise positively influences IFG/IGT and obesity, and represents an important therapy for preventing the progression to T2D by enhancing several mechanisms of action including improved: glucose metabolism, muscle respiratory capacity, mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and ÃŸ-oxidation. Importantly, the dose of physical activity required to promote metabolic benefits appears to be obtainable for most individuals with as little as ~1000 kcal/w of aerobic activity. While most exercise policy statement guidelines recommend that exercise be performed within an intensity ranging of 40-85% V02max, newer guidelines, such as the recently updated Physical Activity and Public Health Recommendations recognize that few studies have examined the effects of intensity, duration, or frequency of physical activity independent of their contribution to the total amount of physical activity. Accordingly, this writing group specifically recommended that, "based on recent data, there is some indication that vigorous-intensity activities may have greater benefit for reducing cardiovascular disease and premature mortality than moderate-intensity physical activity .... that much more work is needed is this area."</detailed_description>
