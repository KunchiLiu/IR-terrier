	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of talazoparib in patients with advanced tumors with DNA-repair pathway deficiencies. There will be 2 parts to the study: a dose escalation phase in which the maximum tolerated dose will be defined, and a dose expansion phase.</brief_summary>
