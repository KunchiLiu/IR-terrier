	<brief_title>A Multinational Trial To Evaluate The Parachute Implant System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While current therapies for heart failure (including but not limited to: medical management, cardiac resynchronization and ICDs) may represent the best treatment available today for the majority of HF patients, the medical community recognizes that pharmacologic therapy has been optimized to nearly the extent that is possible, and that any incremental improvements in the management of HF patients will now come from device based therapies. With this background, CardioKinetix has developed a catheter-based intravascular approach to ventricular partitioning using an implantable device. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of using the CardioKinetix Parachute device to isolate the malfunctioning portion of the left ventricle in patients with symptoms of HF due to ischemic heart disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Candidates for this study must meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Akinesis or dyskinesis due to myocardial infarction limited to anteroapical region 2. Subject is not hospitalized at time of enrollment. 3. Diagnosis of heart failure for a minimum of 6 months prior to enrollment 4. NYHA Class at time of enrollment, either: NYHA Class III or Ambulatory IV if predominant during the 3month period prior to enrollment NYHA Class II if diagnosed with NYHA Class III or IV during 3month period prior to enrollment 5. LVEF &gt;15% and â‰¤ 40% as measured by echocardiography. 6. Post LV MI structural heart dysfunction represented by LV wall motion abnormality (WMA) by echocardiography. 7. Eligible for cardiac surgery 8. Between 18 and 79 years of age (inclusive) 9. Receiving appropriate medical treatment for heart failure according to the ACC/AHA 2009 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult during the three months prior to enrollment 10. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (within 7 days of the procedure) and must agree not to attempt to become pregnant during the course of the study 11. Provide written informed consent 12. Agree to the protocolrequired followup Candidates will be excluded from the study if ANY of the following conditions apply: 1. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring intervention. 2. Acute MI (see MI definition) within 60 days of enrollment or patients with suspected evolving MI at time of enrollment 3. Cardiogenic shock within 72 hours of enrollment 4. Revascularization procedure (PCI or CABG) within 60 days of enrollment 5. Patient has received a pacemaker, ICD, or CRT device within 60 days of enrollment 6. Moderate aortic stenosis and regurgitation (aortic or mitral) &gt;2+. 7. History of aborted sudden cardiac death, if patient has not received an ICD and has potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia, VT or VF 8. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, warfarin, nitinol (titanium and nickel alloy), or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre medicated. 9. Aortic valve replacement or repair 10. Blood dyscrasia, history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or hypercoagulable states. 11. Active peptic ulcer or GI bleeding within the past 3 months 12. Patient has suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months 13. History of Kawasaki's disease 14. Patient has received a heart, lung, liver and/or kidney transplant 15. Patient on dialysis or expected to require hemodialysis within 12 months 16. Patient has chronic liver disease 17. Impaired renal function that places patient at risk of contrast induced renal failure 18. Ongoing sepsis, including active endocarditis. 19. Comorbidities associated with a life expectancy of less than 12months or there are factors making echo and clinical followup difficult (no permanent address, etc.) 20. Patient is currently participating in another investigational device or drug research study for which the followup period is not complete</criteria>
