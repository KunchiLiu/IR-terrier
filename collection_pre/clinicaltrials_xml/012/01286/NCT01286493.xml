	<brief_title>Immune Response After Booster Vaccination in HIV - Infected Patients Who Received Rabies Primary Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have learned from the previous studies that some HIV-infected patients especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had poor antibody response to rabies vaccination. Because of the role of the memory B cell, the investigators hypothesized that primary rabies immunization in HIV-infected patients could rise rapid anamnestic antibody response to ones after booster vaccination in case of re-exposure of rabies occur despite of their immunocompromised state.</detailed_description>
