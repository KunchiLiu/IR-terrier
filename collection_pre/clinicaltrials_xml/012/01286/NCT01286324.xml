	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an herb called chamomile can help to treat insomnia (difficulty in going to sleep or getting enough sleep) by increasing the amount of time that you sleep and/or improving the quality of your sleep. The study will also be looking at the effect of chamomile on day time fatigue and functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chamomile for Chronic Primary Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia, defined as the inability to initiate or maintain sleep or lack of restorative sleep, is the most prevalent sleep complaint in primary care. Insomnia is associated with decreased quality of life, work limitations and increased healthcare utilization. Currently there is no treatment for chronic insomnia that is readily available, affordable, without significant side-effects and demonstrated to be safe for long term use. Consequently, treatments that would fill this gap are needed. Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) has been used as a gentle sleep agent by herbalists for several hundred years. It has been studied in animals for its sedative potential and shows promise for treating insomnia. Currently, chamomile's sedative mechanisms of action are unknown, but are thought to be through the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, γ - aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, no study has examined chamomile's efficacy and safety for treating insomnia. The investigators propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of chamomile in primary care patients with chronic insomnia. Thirty-four patients will be randomized to either Chamomile High Grade Extract, three 5 mg tablets standardized to 0.4% (-)-α-bisabolol twice daily or placebo and will be followed for 28 days for changes in a sleep diary (sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep-onset latency and sleep quality), insomnia severity and sleep disturbances. Secondary endpoints include assessing changes in day time functioning (measures of global quality of life, depression and anxiety) and monitoring for any signs of toxicity. The investigators will also determine the feasibility of conducting a larger trial with this agent.</detailed_description>
