	<brief_summary>To assess attitudes toward screening for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) in the community. To develop a population based clinical risk factor prediction model for the diagnosis of BE and identify novel risk factors for BE which would make population based screening more efficient. This will be an important first step in identifying the target population for BE screening, another crucial component of making screening feasible and efficient</brief_summary>
