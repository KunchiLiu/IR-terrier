	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Cisapride for Improving Symptoms Associated With Gastroparesis in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient will know the name of assigned treatment) study to determine the effectiveness of cisapride tablets compared to placebo tablets (a tablet identical in appearance to cisapride but does not contain active drug) at improving symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis when administered orally (by mouth) to patients with insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Gastroparesis is a disorder also called delayed gastric emptying, in which the stomach takes too long to empty food into the small intestine for digestion. Symptoms of gastroparesis may include vomiting, nausea, early feeling of fullness after only a few bites of food, weight loss due to poor absorption of nutrients or low calorie intake, abdominal bloating, poor glycemic (blood sugar) control, lack of appetite, and pain in the stomach area. Patients will take study drug (one 10-mg tablet of cisapride, or one tablet of placebo), orally, 4 times a day, for a period of 8 weeks. Study drug will be taken approximately 15 minutes before each meal and, with a beverage, before going to bed.</detailed_description>
