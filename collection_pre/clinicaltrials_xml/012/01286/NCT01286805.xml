	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of a lumbar plexus block for arthroscopic hip surgery is superior to oral and intravenous opioid pain medications alone in treating pain. In addition, the study will examine whether lumbar plexus blocks reduce the total amount of pain medication needed, and therefore reduce the side effects of these medicines and increase patient satisfaction. It is hypothesized that addition of the lumbar plexus block will significantly reduce patients' postoperative pain.</brief_summary>
