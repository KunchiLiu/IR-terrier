	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the trial is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a cardiovascular disease quality improvement system that couples EMR-based patient identification with individually tailored patient messages. The study will test the hypothesis that that a tailored patient-directed approach to cardiovascular risk reduction integrated into patients' primary care delivery site will improve control of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other card iac risk factors more than routine care alone for patients at intermediate or high risk for cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
