	<brief_summary>Vibration therapy is used for different indications in rehabilitation and sports medicine. So far, vibration therapy has not been investigated within the ICU setting. The investigators created this setting to show safety and applicability of vibration therapy in ICU patients. 30 patients will be stimulated by vibration therapy on two separate days during their ICU stay. Three collectives of equal size will be observed: One with patients on mechanical ventilation without signs of infection or suspected intracranial pressure problems, a second one with patients on mechanical ventilation in addition to signs of systemic inflammation but absence of suspected intracranial pressure problems, and a third one with patients on mechanical ventilation, signs of systemic inflammation in addition to presence of controlled intracranial pressure problems. Typical parameters of hemodynamic status, intracranial pressure and energy metabolism will be recorded for a defined period of time before, during and after vibration therapy itself. Vibration therapy will be combined with protocol based physiotherapy. Our aim is to show the effects of vibration therapy in ICU patients and its safe applicability. ADDITION 06th of May 2011: Additionally we will perform euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and intervention on one day of ICU stay in 20 patients. Under clamp conditions we will perform a vibration therapy (ProMedVi Vibrosphere™) on patients' legs. On top we will perform electrical muscle stimulation (schwa-medico, MUSKELaktiv™) on one ventral upper leg, randomized chosen. Measuring the local skeletal muscle metabolism will be done by microdialysis in Vastus lateralis on both sides - comparing vibration therapy and vibration therapy combined with electrical muscle stimulation.</brief_summary>
