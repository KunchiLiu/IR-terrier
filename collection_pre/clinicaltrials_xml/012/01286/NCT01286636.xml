	<brief_summary>The investigators have developed a simple, accurate, and a point-of-care, computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) not only to detect the presence of sleep apnea but also to predict its severity. The CDSS is based on deploying an artificial neural network (ANN) derived from anthropomorphic and clinical characteristics. The investigators hypothesize that patients with severe OSA defined as AHI≥30 can be diagnosed with the use of ANN without undergoing a sleep study, and that empiric management with auto-CPAP has similar outcomes to those who undergo a formal sleep study.</brief_summary>
