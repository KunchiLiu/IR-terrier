	<brief_summary>Eltrombopag may improve the cell collection available for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant(ASCT). The overall goal is to determine if adding Eltrombopag to the standard ASCT will increase the number of blood cells collected and reduce the number of times blood needs to be collected. This study will also determine the highest dose of Eltrombopag that can be used without causing serious side effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive standard treatment for autologous stem cell transplant. Subjects will be assigned to receive no Eltrombopag or one of three dose levels of Eltrombopag. Subjects will receive oral Eltrombopag on days 2-15 of treatment.</detailed_description>
