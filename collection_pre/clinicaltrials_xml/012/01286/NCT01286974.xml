	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study to Access How the Body Absorbs and Removes Linifanib in Male Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to assess the mass balance of [14C]linifanib and the metabolic profiles of linifanib in 4 subjects with advanced solid tumors following a single oral dose. Subjects may continue on linifanib after completion of the metabolism study. The results of this study will determine the exposure of major metabolites and excretion pathway(s) of the parent drug and metabolites of linifanib in humans.</detailed_description>
