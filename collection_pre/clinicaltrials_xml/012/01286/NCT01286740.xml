	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase 2b study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF) STR, after switching from the efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF STR at baseline, in maintaining HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 12. HIV-infected patients were enrolled if they had received EFV/FTC/TDF for ≥ 3 months prior to study start, were experiencing safety or tolerability concerns (in particular, EFV-related intolerance), and wished to change to an alternate, better-tolerated regimen.</brief_summary>
