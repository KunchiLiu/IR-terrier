	<brief_summary>Blood pressure in hypertensive patients is rarely controlled to an optimal level by one drug alone, often a combination of two or more drugs is essential to achieve a sufficient antihypertensive effect. Therefore in Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) 2009 combination therapy is recommended. In JSH 2009 it is advised to start the combination therapy at a low dose, and to increase the dosage when the antihypertensive effect is not sufficient. In the Japanese long-term safety study, 259 patients received the T40/A5 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC), and after 6 weeks treatment 48 patients of them could not control their blood pressure (DBP =90) (U09-2494-01). For those patients who cannot control their blood pressure with T40/A5 mg FDC, a switch to a higher dose such as T80/A5 mg is recommended. In the overseas 4x4 factorial design trial, a clinically meaningful difference of the blood pressure lowering effect between T80/A5 mg free combination and T40/A5 mg free combination was shown (U07-3503-02). But the sponsor has no data that verifies this difference in Japanese patients. Thus, this clinical trial is being conducted to investigate the antihypertensive effect and safety of high dose T80/A5 mg FDC compared with low dose T40/A5 mg FDC in Japanese patients with essential hypertension. In this trial, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group comparison method is employed.</brief_summary>
