	<brief_summary>GSK2190915 is under development as an oral controller for the treatment of adult and pediatric asthma. This study is an open label, single and repeat dose escalation study, in children with asthma. It will investigate the pharmacokinetics of GSK2190915 in children, aged from 1 to 12 years old inclusive, to determine how the dosage regimen for GSK2190915 in a pediatric population should be adjusted to achieve approximately the same level of systemic exposure that is safe and effective in adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GSK2190915 Pediatric Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be recruited into 2 cohorts, Cohort 1 with children from 4 years of age to less than 12 years of age and cohort 2 with children from 1 year of age to less than 4 years of age. Cohort 1 is further subdivided, dependent on a subject's weight, which enables different dosing regimens and pharmacokinetic sampling within the cohort. There are 3 scheduled Pharmacokinetic and Safety Review meetings, which enable dose adjustment and dosing in the younger subjects through the study. Blood and urine are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. Safety will be assessed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, safety laboratory data and review of adverse events. Subjects will also perform PEF and Spirometry if assessed as capable by the study investigator.</detailed_description>

Any medical condition or circumstance making the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study. Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment. Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of screening and led to a change in asthma management. Administration of any vaccinations within 2 weeks of screening or during the study Parent/guardian has history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, substance abuse, or other condition which will limit the validity of consent to participate in this study.
