	<brief_summary>This open-label, multi-center study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Vemurafenib (RO5185426) in participants with metastatic or unresectable papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) positive for the BRAF V600 mutation and resistant to radioactive iodine therapy. Participants will receive vemurafenib 960 milligrams (mg) orally twice daily until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
