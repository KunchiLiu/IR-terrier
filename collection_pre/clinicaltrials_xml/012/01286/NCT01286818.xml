	<criteria>Participant is Japanese Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Has histologically or cytologically confirmed CRC Has metastatic disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection Has received no more than 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens in any setting (only 1 prior regimen for metastatic disease is permitted) Has received firstline combination therapy of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine for metastatic disease and has experienced disease progression during firstline therapy, or disease progression within 6 months after the last dose of firstline therapy, or discontinued part or all of firstline therapy due to toxicity and experienced disease progression within 6 months after the last dose of firstline therapy. Participants must have received a minimum of 2 doses of bevacizumab as part of a firstline regimen containing chemotherapy in order to enroll. Has adequate hepatic, renal, hematologic, and coagulation function The participant's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis. If urine dipstick or routine analysis indicates proteinuria ≥2+, then a 24hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate &lt;1000 milligrams (mg) of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study Has received bevacizumab within 28 days prior to study registration Has received chemotherapy within 21 days prior to study registration Has received any previous systemic therapy (other than a combination of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine) for firstline treatment of metastatic CRC The participant experienced any of the following during firstline therapy with a bevacizumabcontaining regimen: an arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic event; Grade 4 hypertension; Grade 4 proteinuria; a Grade 34 bleeding event; or bowel perforation Has received widefield (fulldose pelvic) radiotherapy within 28 days prior to study registration Has undergone major surgery within 28 days or subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to study registration Has elective or planned surgery to be conducted during the trial Has a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the past 12 months Has experienced any arterial thrombotic event within the past 12 months Participant is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin, lowmolecular weight heparin, or similar agents Participant is receiving chronic therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents [Aspirin up to 325 milligrams per day (mg/day) permitted] Has a significant bleeding disorder or has had a significant (Grade 3 or higher) bleeding event within 3 months prior to registration date Has a history of gastrointestinal perforation and/or fistulae within 6 months prior to registration date Has symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia Has uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite standard medical management Has a serious or nonhealing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to study registration Has an acute/subacute bowel obstruction or history of clinically significant chronic diarrhea Has a history of inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease requiring medical intervention within 12 months prior to registration date The participant has either peptic ulcer disease associated with a bleeding event or known active diverticulitis Has an active infection requiring antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral therapy Has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related illness Has known leptomeningeal or brain metastases or uncontrolled spinal cord compression Has a known history of Gilbert's Syndrome, or is known to have any of the following genotypes: uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1)*6/*6; UGT1A1*28/*28 or UGT1A1*6/*28 Has previous or concurrent malignancy, except for basal or squamous cell skin cancer and/or in situ carcinoma, or other solid tumors treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 3 years</criteria>
