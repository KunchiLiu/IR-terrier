	<brief_summary>Although drug therapies and pulmonary rehabilitation have greatly improved COPD symptoms, as many as 50% of patients with severe COPD have inadequately controlled dyspnea. Device-guided breathing is a behavioral intervention that guides respiratory rates into a therapeutic range; prolongation of the expiratory phase improves hyperinflation, the most significant driver of dyspnea in this population. Device-guided breathing, has no known side-effects, and may represent a cost effective adjunctive treatment for dyspnea in severe COPD.</brief_summary>
