	<brief_summary>Recent work showed that application of peripheral nerve and cortical stimulation independently can induce 10-15 % improvement in motor performance in patients with chronic stroke. The purpose of this study was to compare in post-stroke hemiplegic patients the effect on motor recovery of one session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) combined with a peripheral radial nerve electrical stimulation (rEPNS) to the paretic hand repeated 5 successive days with the effect of the same peripheral nerve stimulation combined with sham tDCS. Design: randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled clinical trial. Patients eligible for the study: Acute ischaemic stroke Primary outcome measure: Jebsen Taylor test Secondary outcome measures Nine peg hole test Hand tapping grip and wrist force Cortical excitability of Ipsilesional M1(TMS) Follow-up: 30 days</brief_summary>
