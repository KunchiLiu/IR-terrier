	<brief_summary>Children with developmental disabilities often sustain decreased range of motion in their extremities. The decrease in flexibility may be due to neuromuscular disorders such as spasticity or dystonia. Other causes may be imbalance in muscle strength surrounding a joint, leading to inappropriate habitual posture. Over time, muscle contracture may result for those muscle groups that are placed in a shortened position for an extended period of time. The most common site of muscle contractures among these children are gastrocnemius/soleus (lower limbs), and latissimus dorsi muscles (upper limbs). Muscle contractures can lead to further decline in functional abilities. Therefore, it is important to identify effective intervention strategies to enhance or maintain muscle flexibility in children with developmental dysfunctions. Commercially available endermotherapy device has been used to soften scar tissue following burn injuries. The mechanical stimulation applied may also have beneficial effects on relaxing the muscle tissue. The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine whether endermotherapy treatment has immediate effect in improving joint range of motion among children with developmental disabilities. The research hypothesis is that children in the endermotherapy group will have significantly more gain in ankle passive range of motion than those in the control group.</brief_summary>
