	<brief_summary>The proposed study tests the efficacy of using pager-assisted messages combined with nicotine patches in facilitating smoking cessation and relapse prevention in a 2-arm randomized clinical trial. The hypothesis is that the proportion of biochemically-verified quitters at 3 and 12 months in the study arm randomized to receive therapeutic messages on alphanumeric pagers for 3 months along with individual smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patches will be greater that the proportion of biochemically-verified quitters who receive only individual smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patches.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 224 current smokers were enrolled in a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial. Participants were community-living adult smokers of â‰¥10 cigarettes per day during the pre-enrollment week who were interested in quitting and recruited from the local area by means of print, media, and online advertisements. To be eligible, they needed to be smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day, aged 18 or older, motivated to quit smoking, prepared to set a quit date, willing to use nicotine patches, and able to come to therapy sessions and be followed by telephone. Participants in the pager treatment were provided with alpha-numeric pagers free of charge for three months. Using specially-designed communication software, text messages were sent to participants aimed at facilitating motivation to quit, cessation strategies, and coping skills to maintain abstinence. Participants in both treatment groups were seen for two 60-minute sessions of standard smoking cessation counseling, and received three follow-up phone calls and two months of nicotine patches.</detailed_description>
