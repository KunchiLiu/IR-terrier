	<brief_summary>The study involves the use of a targeted form of radiation, in addition to standard high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. The use of targeted radiation is designed to kill more multiple myeloma cells while avoiding the side effects of standard radiation. This type of targeted radiation (also known as radioimmunotherapy) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of a related disease, lymphoma under the trade name, Zevalin©. Zevalin© has been added to high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplants for patients with lymphoma and is now being studied in this clinical trial for patients with multiple myeloma. This trial is only available at Tufts Medical Center. The proposed clinical trial will test whether CD20-targeted radio-immunotherapy can be safe and effective when integrated into a standard regimen of myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in patients with measurable disease prior to high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zevalin for Patients With Incomplete Response to Chemo Prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with multiple myeloma scheduled for standard of care high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant who have an incomplete response to induction treatment (i.e. with measurable disease) following peripheral blood stem cell collection are candidates for participation on this trial. 90Y Zevalin targets CD20 expressed on the surface of mature B-cells and is FDA approved for relapsed/refractory low grade lymphoma. This is a single arm, phase II safety and efficacy study of 90-Y Zevalin in multiple myeloma. Subjects will receive cold antibody (Rituximab 100mg/m2) followed by 5 mCi test dose of 111-In Zevalin on transplant day -21. Gamma camera images are obtained 48 to 72 hours after 111-In Zevalin to document appropriate / expected distribution of radiotracer. On transplant day -14, subjects will receive another cold antibody dose followed by 90Y Zevalin 0.4 mg/kg (max 32 mCi) as single dose. Subjects are admitted for transplant on day -3 and proceed with institution standard high dose melphalan (200mg/m2) on day -2. Subjects are followed for safety for 6 weeks after transplant.</detailed_description>
