	<brief_summary>Morphine and related opioid analgesics are known to slow gastrointestinal (GI) motility and reduce intestinal secretion through their binding to μ opioid receptors (MORs) within the GI tract. The most common symptoms associated with the effects of opioids are constipation and nausea and/or vomiting. Moreover, constipation is a common and distressing side effect of long-term opioid therapy. The primary objective of this study was to compare ADL5945, a MOR antagonist, with placebo in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults taking long-term opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain.</brief_summary>
