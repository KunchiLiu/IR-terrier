	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Treatments involve high costs in terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded in vitro and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has demonstrated that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation through its action on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one carried out in an equine by the investigators research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy evidence proposed treatment protocol.This study is designed to evaluate therapeutic potential and safety of mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of osteoarthritis clinical manifestations.This study is designed to evaluate therapeutic potential and safety of mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of osteoarthritis clinical manifestations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Articular Cartilage Resurfacing With Mesenchymal Stem Cells In Osteoarthritis Of Knee Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesenchymal stem cells are pluripotent cells that can be obtained from various tissues .They have shown capabilities to differentiate into bone,cartilage,muscle,and adipose tissue, representing a new clinical strategy in regenerative medicine.An increasing number of reports have demonstrated effectiveness of percutaneous intra-articular infusion of MSCs in arthritic disease. In this study we perform a single intra articular injection of cultured mesenchymal stem cells in patients suffering from osteoarthritis, with the aim to assess its clinical safety and efficacy.Patients are assessed for response with MRI, X-Ray examination, WOMAC osteoarthritis index,VAS, and SF36 2,4,8 weeks and 6, and 12 months post infusion.</detailed_description>
