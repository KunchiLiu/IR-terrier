	<brief_summary>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to be effective to prevent alveolar growth arrest in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim is to treat the extremely premature infant with severe BPD to establish whether intratracheal instillation of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (ucMSCs) is safe and effective as a rescue treatment for severe BPD.</brief_summary>
