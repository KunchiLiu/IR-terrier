	<brief_summary>This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is a transversal study and corresponds to the recruitment of participants, which will last about two years. Three groups of gamblers will be constituted : Non-problematic gamblers (NPG), Problematic gamblers Not in Care (PGNC) and Problematic gamblers in Care (PGC).The second stage is a prospective 5-year follow-up study of the cohort (only the initial NPG and PGNC groups are concerned by the follow-up study), that consists on an annual follow-up evaluation. The main objective of the first stage of the study is to compare the characteristics of the three groups of gamblers on some socio-demographic and clinical data. These comparisons will allow us to identify, among all data, those that will be most likely to explain the evolution of the practice of gambling (appearance or resolution of a gambling problem), and recourse to specific care. These such isolated data will be tested in the second stage of the study, in order to determine those that are predictive factors of three steps of the gambling course of some gamblers : evolution of a controlled gambling practice into a problematic gambling practice, resolution of the problematic gambling practice without intervention of care, and first recourse to specific care.</brief_summary>
