	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect data prospectively on the safety and efficacy of the Laparoscopic Gastric Plication operation for patients with Severe or Morbid Obesity. The 95% confidence interval for average percentage of weight loss and body mass index will be computed at 6 months, one year and then annually. Analysis of comorbid conditions changes, quality of life and adverse events will be performed. With 50 subjects in the study, limited power is expected and no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) is a new restrictive bariatric surgical technique that has the potential to eliminate the complications associated with other restrictive procedures (i.e., gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy) by creating a restriction without the use of an implant and without performing gastric resection. LGP is notably similar to a sleeve gastrectomy in that it generates a gastric tube by means of eliminating the greater curvature but does so without gastric resection.</detailed_description>
