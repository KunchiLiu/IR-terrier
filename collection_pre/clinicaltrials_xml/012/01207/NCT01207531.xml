	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a common cause of death in intensive care unit, timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment directly affect the survival rate. MiRNA is a post-transcriptional small RNA which regulate mRNA expression. The present study was designed to screen several miRNA by microarray which evaluate the sepsis prognosis in order to be a new target for the treatment of sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MiRNAs Evaluate the Prognosis of Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a non-intervention, prospective observational study. Purpose of this sudy is to screening several miRNAs by microarray which can evaluate the prognosis of sepsis . We will collect serum samples from patients with sepsis in SICU, RICU and EICU of 301 Hospital since September 2009 , and then use the chip and qRT-PCR to Screen miRNAs which can evaluate the prognosis of sepsis, and statistical analysis the miRNAS expression correlation with SOFA score.</detailed_description>
