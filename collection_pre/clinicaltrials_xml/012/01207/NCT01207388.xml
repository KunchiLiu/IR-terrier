	<brief_title>Confirmatory Phase II Study of Blinatumomab (MT103) in Patients With Minimal Residual Disease of B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy and/or consolidation therapy is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of adult ALL. No standard treatments are available for patients with MRD-positive B-precursor ALL. Blinatumomab (MT103) is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct designed to link B cells and T cells resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against CD19 expressing cells. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether the bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab (MT103) is effective, safe and tolerable in the treatment of ALL patients with minimal residual disease. Participants will receive up to four 4-week cycles of intravenous blinatumomab treatment followed by an infusion-free period of 14 days. A safety follow-up will be performed 30 days after the end of the last infusion and efficacy follow-ups will occur until 24 months after treatment start. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the start of treatment for survival.</detailed_description>
