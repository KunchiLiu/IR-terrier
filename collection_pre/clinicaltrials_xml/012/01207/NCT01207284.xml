	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that a physical therapy intervention for foot and ankle of diabetic neuropathic individuals would affect positively the way they walk, lowering the harmful forces that these segments receive, that are associated mainly with lower range of movement, muscle weakness and loss of sensation. The participants will be randomly assigned into control group (regular treatment prescribed by their medical group) or into treatment group, that will receive 12 weeks of physical therapy intervention, twice a week, for 45 minutes each session. This will aim for increasing foot and ankle range of movement, muscle strength and improving sensory inputs.</brief_summary>
