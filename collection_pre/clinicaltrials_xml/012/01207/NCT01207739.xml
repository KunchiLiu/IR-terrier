	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to establish whether prolonged antibiotic treatment of patients diagnosed with proven or presumed PLD (as endorsed by the international ILADS guidelines) leads to better patient outcome than short-term treatment as endorsed by the Dutch CBO guidelines.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females who are 18 years or older. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception methods other than oral contraceptives during the study therapy period, since failure of oral contraceptives due to longterm antibiotic use has been described and doxycycline might be teratogenic. Patients with presumed or proven PLD. In this study, clinical suspicion of PLD is defined as complaints of musculoskeletal pain, arthritis or arthralgia, neuralgia or sensory disturbances (such as paresthesias or dysesthesias), neuropsychological or cognitive disorders, and persistent fatigue, that are: temporally related to an episode of erythema migrans or otherwise proven symptomatic Lyme disease (defined as within 4 months after erythema migrans as assessed by a physician, or positive biopsy, PCR, culture, intrathecal B. burgdorferi antibodies), OR accompanied by a positive B. burgdorferi IgG or IgM immunoblot (as defined by strict criteria in line with the European Union Concerted Action on Lyme Borreliosis (EUCALB)), regardless of prior ELISA IgG/IgM screening results. Subjects must sign a written informed consent form. Subjects with a known history of allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines, macrolides, hydroxychloroquine or ceftriaxone. Subjects who have had more than 5 days of antimicrobial therapy with activity against B. burgdorferi within the previous 4 weeks. Subjects with a presumed diagnosis of neuroborreliosis (CSF pleocytosis or intrathecal antibody production) for which intravenous antimicrobial therapy is required. Subjects with a known diagnosis of HIVseropositivity or other immune disorders. (No HIV serologic testing is required for the study). Subjects with positive syphilis serology or signs of other spirochetal diseases. Subjects with moderate or severe liver disease defined as alkaline phosphatase, ALAT, or ASAT greater than 3 times upper limit of normal. Subjects who are receiving and cannot discontinue cisapride, astemizole, terfenadine, barbiturates, phenytoin, or carbamazepine (The concentrations of these drugs may increase during clarithromycin therapy and/or lead to reduced availability of doxycycline). Subjects who are currently enrolled on other investigational drug trials or receiving investigational agents. Subjects who have been previously randomized into this study. Severe physical or psychiatric comorbidity that interferes with participation in the study protocol, including previous medical diagnosis of rheumatic conditions, chronic fatigue syndrome or chronic pain conditions as well as insufficient command of the Dutch language. Comorbidity that could (partially) account for the symptoms of the subject (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, anemia, hypothyroidism).</criteria>
