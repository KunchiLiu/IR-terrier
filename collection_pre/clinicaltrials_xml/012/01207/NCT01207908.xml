	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of IGF-1 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: DMD is a progressive degenerative muscle disorder for which there is no current cure. Glucocorticoids (GC) are often used to improve motor function and survival but have significant side effects such as growth failure, weight gain, insulin resistance and osteoporosis. IGF-1 stimulates both the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells and is thus important for muscle repair and regeneration. IGF-1 offers potential as a therapeutic agent for DMD as it may improve or preserve motor function and reduce GC side effects such as growth failure and insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
