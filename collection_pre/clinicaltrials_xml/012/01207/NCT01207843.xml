	<brief_summary>Hepatic candidiasis is a frequent complication in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Hepatic lesions may be detected by computerized tomographic (CT) scans, but there is no standardized CT protocol for the diagnosis and follow-up of hepatic candidiasis. The investigators compared the size of the fungal lesions in the chest and abdomen CT. The current analysis aimed to increase the value of CT for the diagnosis and the follow-up of hepatic candidiasis in daily routine.</brief_summary>
