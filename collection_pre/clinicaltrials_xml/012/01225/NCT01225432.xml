	<brief_summary>To assess the carryover effect of an innovative new gait training program on physiological and functional gait performance in persons with a traumatic lower extremity amputation. A second objective is to clarify the relationship between gait biomechanics (joint and sgment kinematics and energy cost.</brief_summary>
