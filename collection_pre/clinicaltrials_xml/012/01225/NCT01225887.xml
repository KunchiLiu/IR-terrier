	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nintedanib works in treating patients with endometrial cancer that has come back. Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nintedanib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer, who survive progression-free without going on a subsequent therapy against the disease for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial), treated with BIBF 1120 (nintedanib). II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of BIBF 1120 in this cohort of patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with BIBF 1120. OUTLINE: Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma, which is refractory to curative therapy or established treatments; histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required; patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patient must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III protocol or Rare Tumor protocol for the same patient population Patients must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Patients must have normal thyroid function; patients with a history of hypothyroidism are eligible, provided it is well controlled on medication Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection) Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration Patients must have had one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma; chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer will be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease Patients must have NOT received any noncytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agents, as part of their primary treatment or for management of recurrent or persistent disease; noncytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agents include (but are not limited to) monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and smallmolecule inhibitors of signal transduction; prior hormonal therapy is allowed; there is no limit on the number of prior hormonal therapies allowed Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN) Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio must be &lt; 1.0 gm; if UPC ratio &gt;= 1, collection of 24hour urine measurement of urine protein is recommended Bilirubin must be less than 1.5 X ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be less than 3 X ULN Alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 X ULN Prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal Electrocardiogram (EKG) must have corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt; 450 msec without evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia lasting more than 3 beats or ventricular fibrillation) Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information Patients must meet preentry requirements Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to the study entry; women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (two barrier methods of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she is to inform her treating physician immediately; all patients must be willing to take contraception up to three months after the final dose of BIBF 1120 Patients who have had prior therapy with BIBF 1120 Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies, are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last three years; patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis OTHER THAN for the treatment of endometrial cancer within the last three years are excluded; prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor OTHER THAN for the treatment of endometrial cancer within the last three years are excluded;
