	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are to identify outcome indicators of optimal care for brain injury patients, including pre-hospital care, prompt delivery to neurosurgical care and access to early rehabilitation services. Nova Scotia's centralized Neurosurgical services and integrated provincial Emergency Health Services provide a rich opportunity to construct a cohesive, integrated data management system. This system will allow us to answer important research questions related to the outcomes, care and prevention of brain trauma. Retrospective data collection The retrospective arm of the BTO study has created full data sets and care pathways from multiple sources covering the continuum of brain trauma care. Investigators continue to analyze this large amount of data and prepare it for publication. Prospective data Collection Patients with a major head injury (initial GCS 3-12), have been considered for enrollment in the BTO study.The prospective arm of the BTO study has 52 patients enrolled. Screening and Enrollment was complete on June 30, 2007. These patients are participating in long term follow up at 6, 12 and 24 months post injury for assessment of qualitative and quantitative outcomes. Completion of patient follow up will be in June 2009.</brief_summary>
