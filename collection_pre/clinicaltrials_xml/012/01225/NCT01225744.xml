	<brief_summary>A Phase II trial to demonstrate the response rate, using the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria, of patients with locally advanced / metastatic colorectal cancer treated with combination of irinotecan, oxaliplatin, UFT and cetuximab. ENDPOINTS Primary: Objective response rate (RECIST) Secondary: Progression free survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS) Toxicity (CTCAE), Resectability of liver, lung and pelvic disease after chemotherapy, Time to progression (TTP). POPULATION: The trial aims to recruit 50 patients with inoperable, metastatic colorectal cancer ELIGIBILITY: Histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma Normal haematology and adequate renal and liver function Written informed consent and able to attend follow-up for at least 3 months TREATMENT 4 weekly cycles of chemotherapy with alternating irinotecan (day 1) and oxaliplatin(day 15). Cetuximab every 2 weeks and oral UFT with Leucovorin for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. DURATION First patient recruited April 2009. Accrual to take place over 24 months Follow-up will continue until death or for a minimum of 3 years</brief_summary>
