	<brief_summary>This is an observational cohort study of virologic and immunologic outcome after at least 48 weeks of third line antiretroviral therapy. Upto 150 children at 8 Thai sites will be enrolled. Third line antiretroviral therapy in this study is defined as an antiretroviral (ARV) regimen in a patient who has failure or intolerance to first line NNRTI-based therapy and second line PI-based therapy. Such regimens may contain new drugs or drug classes such as darunavir, tipranavir, etravirine and raltegravir The knowledge gained from this study will help the Thai government in planning its strategy to provide third line ARV therapy to children within the national program.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the virological efficacy, as measured by the proportions of children with HIV RNA below 400 and 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks after initiating third line ARV therapy. Third line ARV therapy is defined as an ARV regimen in a patient who has failure or intolerance to first line NNRTI-based therapy and second line PI-based therapy. Such regimens may contain new drugs or drug classes such as darunavir, tipranavir, etravirine and raltegravir</detailed_description>
