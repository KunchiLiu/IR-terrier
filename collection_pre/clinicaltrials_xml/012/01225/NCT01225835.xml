	<brief_summary>This study is aimed to demonstrate that highly purified Menotrophin produces significant lower progesterone serum levels during the follicular phase in comparison to Follitropin alpha in the treatment of subfertile females undergoing an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and to investigate if the progesterone serum levels might be a useful predictor for the success rate of the ongoing pregnancy rates</brief_summary>
