	<brief_summary>Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a protein in the body which destabilizes blood vessels and is important in stimulating tumor blood vessels. There is evidence suggesting that Ang-2 may be important for the growth and progression of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PF- 04856884 (CVX-060) is a compound which binds Ang-2 and prevents its activity. The hypothesis is that PF-04856884 will be safe and effective in patients with recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).</brief_summary>

Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspiration or core biopsies within 7 days prior to therapy. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. Active gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by either hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena in prior 6 months. Hemoptysis &gt;Â½ teaspoon per day within 1 week of enrollment.
