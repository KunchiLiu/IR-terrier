	<brief_title>Gargling With Green Tea for Prophylaxis of Influenza Infection in Teenagers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza infection is the principal cause of acute respiratory illnesses and occurs in epidemic or pandemic worldwide. It spreads easily among high school students and from them to the rest of the community; therefore the prevention of influenza is very important. Experimental studies have revealed that some components of green tea can prevent influenza infection in vitro. In clinically, gargling with green tea catechins has been reported to have possibilities to preventing influenza infection in adults; however, little clinical evidence in teenagers has so far been existed. Based on this background, the investigators designed a randomized study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of gargling with green tea in preventing influenza infection among high school students.</detailed_description>
