Subjects with a significant systemic illness or illness localized to the areas of treatment. Subjects with previous history of nasal implants. Subjects with previous or current history of nasal infections.

Subjects who have smoked within the two weeks prior to surgery. Subjects who have had alcohol or illicit drugs one week prior to surgery. Subjects who have eaten or drank anything after midnight the night prior to surgery. Subjects with current history of chronic drug or alcohol abuse. History of autoimmune disease. Concurrent therapy that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study medication. Subjects who anticipate the need for surgery, other than the study procedure, or overnight hospitalization during the study. Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, have a history of poor cooperation, non compliance with medical treatment or unreliability.
