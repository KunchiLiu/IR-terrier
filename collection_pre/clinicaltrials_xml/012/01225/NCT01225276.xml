	<brief_summary>NewGam (current working title for a new IGIV formulation) is a newly developed human normal immunoglobulin solution ready for intravenous administration (IGIV). This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different dosages of NewGam 10% in patients with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Three Different Dosages of NewGam in Patients With CIDP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2/3 study that will take place in 2 stages. The primary objective of Stage 1 (Phase 2 dose-finding part)is to determine and select one dosage from three NewGam maintenance dosage arms in comparison with a placebo arm, based on the percentage of responders (response defined as a decrease, meaning improvement, in the adjusted INCAT disability score by at least 1 point). The selected NewGam dosage and placebo will be employed and compared in Stage 2. The primary objective of Stage 2 (Phase 3 confirmatory part) is to demonstrate superiority of the maintenance dosage regimen selected at study Stage 1 over placebo in patients with CIDP as assessed by the percentage of responders. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety (measured by number of adverse events)and efficacy of NewGam administration in patients with CIDP compared to baseline.</detailed_description>
