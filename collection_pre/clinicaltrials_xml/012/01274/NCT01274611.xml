	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two methods in the treatment of excessive underarm sweating (axillary hyperhidrosis): suction-curettage and Botox injections. Suction-curettage is a method in which the doctor will insert a suction tool into two small incisions in order to suction out the sweat-producing glands. It is similar to liposuction, but instead of suctioning out fat, the doctor suctions out the layer of the deep skin where the sweat glands are located. This method has been shown in some studies to effectively reduce underarm sweating for months at a time. Botox is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug that in small doses, paralyses muscles. It is most commonly and famously used in the treatment of facial wrinkles. However, it has also been approved to treat excessive sweating. When injected in areas that sweat excessively, sweating can be significantly reduced in that area for months at a time. This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.</brief_summary>
