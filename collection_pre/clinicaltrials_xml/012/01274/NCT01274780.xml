	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, open controlled trial in which naïve HIV-1 patients will be randomized to receive atazanavir / ritonavir or darunavir / ritonavir in combination with tenofovir / emtricitabine. They will be followed up during 96 weeks to determinate the cholesterol levels. Randomization will be stratified according to the values of the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol obtained during the screening visit (as they will be &lt;4.5 or ≥ 4.5).</brief_summary>
