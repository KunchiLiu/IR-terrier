	<brief_title>A Study for Disease Profiling of Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, longitudinal (participants are followed over long period of time with continuous or repeated observations of health outcomes) exploratory study (biomarkers, clinical and physiological parameters for participants with asthma and COPD are observed for the first time). This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will include healthy participants and participants with mild, moderate, and severe asthma. Part 2 will include healthy nonsmokers, healthy asymptomatic smokers, and participants with moderate and or severe COPD. Study participants will undergo medical tests that will include pulmonary function testing, assessment of airway reactivity, bronchoscopy procedure, blood samples for routine laboratory tests, biomarkers and DNA evaluation (for some study participants), induced sputum collection, and exhaled nitric oxide collection. Safety evaluations will includes assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examinations.</detailed_description>
