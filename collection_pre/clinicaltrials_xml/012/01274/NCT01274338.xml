	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies ipilimumab to see how well it works compared to high-dose interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with high-risk stage III-IV melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. It is not yet known whether ipilimumab is more effective than interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab or High-Dose Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage III-IV Melanoma That Has Been Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients randomized to receive post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab given at either 10 mg/kg (high dose ipilimumab; HIP) or 3 mg/kg (low dose ipilimumab: LIP) versus those randomized to receive high-dose interferon alfa-2b (HDI) utilizing a hierarchical design assessing HIP versus HDI first and LIP versus HDI second (if the first comparison is significant). II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients randomized to receive post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab given at either 10 mg/kg (HIP) or 3 mg/kg (LIP) versus those randomized to receive HDI utilizing a hierarchical design assessing HIP versus HDI first and LIP versus HDI second (if the first comparison is significant). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab therapy given at either 10 mg/kg (HIP) or 3 mg/kg (LIP). II. Among patients enrolled by Clinical Community Oncology programs (CCOPs), to compare the global quality of life (QOL) between the ipilimumab arms versus HDI using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General (G) form and to evaluate the effect of treatment-related side effects that may have an impact on the health-related domains of QOL using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-diarrhea (D) and FACT-biological response modifiers (BRM).

	<criteria>All patients must have diseasefree status documented by a complete physical examination and imaging studies within 4 weeks prior to randomization; imaging studies must include a total body positron emission tomography (PET)computed tomography (CT) scan (with or without brain) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT (if MRI is contraindicated); if PETCT cannot be done, CT of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be done If for some reason a CT cannot be done, an MRI may be done instead; any other imaging studies if performed (eg, bone scan) must show no evidence of disease Patients must have primary cutaneous melanoma that belong to one of the following American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stages (2009 AJCC Melanoma Staging System): Stage IIIB T14b N1a M0 T14b N2a M0 T14b N1b M0 T14b N2b M0 T14b N2c M0 Stage IIIC T14b N1b M0 T14b N2b M0 T14b N2c M0 Any T N3 M0 Stage IV M1a M1b NOTE: patients with stage IV melanoma must have normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and either distant skin, subcutaneous, lymph node, or lung metastases, but no other visceral metastases in order to be eligible; for patients with resected stage IV melanoma, LDH within the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) must be documented within 4 weeks prior to randomization Patients with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original primary cutaneous/unknown primary melanoma are allowed even if they don't fit the strict staging criteria, but only as follows: Recurrence in a regional lymph node basin after a prior complete lymph node dissection; relapsed disease must be completely surgically resected with free margins Recurrence in the form of intransit or satellite metastases or distant skin/subcutaneous, nodal, or lung metastases that are completely surgically resected with free margins Recurrence in a regional lymph node basin; relapsed disease must be completely surgically resected with free margins Patients with unknown primary melanoma (Tx) who present with cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal and/or lung metastases that are completely surgically resected with free margins are allowed; these patients are allowed even if they don't fit the strict staging criteria; for stage IV patients LDH within the institutional ULN must be documented within 4 weeks prior to randomization (M1c is not eligible) NOTE: all subjects should be classified as IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b including subjects with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original primary melanoma; that is the treating team/physician investigator should review an overall TNM status (that includes primary tumor presentation and disease recurrence status) and provide a designation of IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b Patients must be randomized within 84 days (12 weeks) of surgical resection; if more than one surgical procedure is required to render the patient diseasefree, the patient must be randomized within 12 weeks of the last surgery NOTE: patients with clinically positive lymph nodes for melanoma involvement or those with positive lymph nodes identified through lymphoscintigraphic and/or dye lymphographic techniques in the groin, axilla, or neck should have additional lymphadenectomy in those sites; the complete lymph node dissection procedure would be considered as the last surgery in counting the 84 days unless a subsequent surgical procedure(s) was clinically required to ensure the disease free status Patients must not have received any adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, biotherapy, or limb perfusion) after the resection(s) that make(s) them eligible for this trial NOTE: previous radiation therapy, including after the surgical resection, is allowed as long as 21 days have elapsed between the radiation and initiation of this adjuvant systemic therapy Prior treatment with anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies or prior CTLA4 inhibitor or agonist or prior clusters of differentiation (CD)137 agonist or prior interferonalfa is not allowed; other forms of prior treatment for melanoma (e.g., aldesleukin [IL2], antitumor vaccine, chemotherapy) are allowed if given before the resection(s) that make(s) the patient eligible for this trial, but these must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 Patients must not have an active infection requiring current treatment with parenteral antibiotics Patients must not have other significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric conditions or require any medication or treatment that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with compliance, make the administration of ipilimumab or HDI hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events (AEs), such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea; patients with a baseline of frequent diarrhea (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) are not eligible Patients should be carefully screened for depression at baseline and if there are indications or a history of depression it is strongly recommended that these patients be closely followed together with behavioral health or psychiatric medical support; patients with an established diagnosis of depression that, in the assessment of the investigator may make the administration of interferon (IFN)alfa or ipilimumab hazardous, should not be enrolled on this protocol; the risks and benefits of being treated with standard adjuvant IFNalfa should be weighed very carefully in consultation with behavioral health or psychiatry Patients must not have a documented history of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) or diverticulitis (history of diverticulosis is allowed) Patients must not have autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression that require current ongoing treatment with systemic corticosteroids (or other systemic immunosuppressants), including oral steroids (i.e., prednisone, dexamethasone) or continuous use of topical steroid creams or ointments or ophthalmologic steroids; a history of occasional (but not continuous) use of steroid inhalers is allowed; replacement doses of steroids for patients with adrenal insufficiency are allowed; patients who discontinue use of these classes of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization are eligible if, in the judgment of the treating physician investigator, the patient is not likely to require resumption of treatment with these classes of drugs during the study Exclusion from this study also includes patients with a history of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]);
