	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose Derived MSCs Transplantation in Patient With Spinal Cord Injury.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) represent an attractive and ethical cell source for stem cell therapy. With the recent demonstration of MSC homing properties, intravenous aplications of MSCs to cell-damaged diseases have increased. In a human clinical trial, eight male patients who had suffered a spinal cord injury were intravenously administered autologous hAdMSCs (4×10e8 cells) one time.</detailed_description>
