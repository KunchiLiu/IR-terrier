	<brief_summary>Frenotomy of tongue-tie is commonly performed to resolve breastfeeding difficulties, eg maternal nipple pain and infant's latching difficulties. The procedure carries minor discomfort for the infants. It is not known whether the use of topical benzocaine, a very bitter tasting material' applied to the tongue-tie would decrease the length of cry. We will measure the duration of crying in infants treated with topical benzocaine to the duration in those not treated with the mediation.</brief_summary>
