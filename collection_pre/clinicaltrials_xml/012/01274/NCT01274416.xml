	<brief_summary>The investigators are trying to learn the most effective way to treat an adolescent's eating disorder and how best to involve the parents or caregivers in this process. Typically, parents and their child are seen together in therapy. However, this can sometimes be difficult for both the parents and the adolescent. Both parents and adolescents have different concerns and are struggling with different aspects of the eating disorder. Therefore, the treatment in this study involves the parents in treatment, but does not have therapy sessions with the parents and child together. The purpose of this study is to develop this investigational type of treatment (separated family treatment), and see what works best for adolescents and their families. Participants meet with a therapist for 20 sessions over the course of 24 weeks. For the first 16 weeks families separate therapy sessions weekly. For the last 8 weeks families meet with the therapist bi-weekly. These bi-weekly sessions are conjoint - that is, adolescents and parents will meet with the therapist together. This is to help parents and adolescents come together as a family to continue to aid the adolescent in the treatment of his/her eating disorder. The investigators hypothesize that adolescents who receive ASFT will demonstrate improvement in eating disorder symptoms and body-mass index, that caregivers who participate in ASFT will demonstrate decreased distress and caregiver burden, that increases in psychological acceptance will be seen for both adolescents and caregivers post-treatment, and that treatment will be viewed as both credible and acceptable to both caregiver and adolescent</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acceptance-Based Separated Family Treatment for Adolescent Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to develop and gather preliminary data on an acceptance-based behavioral treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) that is delivered in a separated family format. The treatment will combine a parent's skills curriculum that has demonstrated preliminary effectiveness in the treatment of AN, with a novel adolescent component based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT has been found to be useful in the treatment of an array of psychological difficulties, and may be particularly well-suited for the cognitive and behavioral avoidance and rigidity that characterizes individuals with AN and their caregivers.</detailed_description>
