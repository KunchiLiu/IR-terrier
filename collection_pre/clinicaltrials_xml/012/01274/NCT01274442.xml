	<brief_summary>Patients that may participate in this case-control study underwent dental implant surgery in the University Hospital in Ghent in 2004-2007. According to one of our recent papers based on this patient group, 34/461 patients lost one or more implants. The goal is to invite these 34 patients, to update the anamnesis, to perform a brief clinical oral examination and to have a blood sample. The latter is necessary to identify relevant genetic polymorphisms of the patient that are associated with implant loss. Among the remaining patients that did not lose implants, another 34 'controls' will be invited for the same examinations.</brief_summary>
