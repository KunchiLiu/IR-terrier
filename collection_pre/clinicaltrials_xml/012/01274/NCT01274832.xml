	<brief_title>Prospective Study to Compare Results of STN-DBS Between Early Treated and Late-treated PD Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bilateral STN DBS is a powerful treatment for advanced Parkinson disease with Levodopa induced motor complications. The beneficial effects of STN stimulation on motor disability and quality of life have been proved. However, the mean delay before neurosurgery is currently 14 years after diagnosis, when medical treatment no longer controls PD symptoms and quality of life is already severely impaired. Aim of this study is to prospectively assess the effects of bilateral STN stimulation on motor signs, psychological and psychiatric aspects and quality of life in a group of 20 patients with PD who underwent surgery after 5 years from the onset of the disease. These results will be compared with those of a group of 20 patients with a PD history from more than 10 years. The two groups of patients will be evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 12 months from DBS implant; at each visit neurological and motor examinations were assessed and dedicated neuropsychological and psychiatric tests will be performed. Neurosurgery may be considered superior to medical treatment alone even in mild to moderate PD of 10 years duration, rather than a last resort in very advanced stages of the disease. Thanks to this study we could compare motor outcomes and cognitive aspects between DBS patients with a short and with long history of disease</detailed_description>
