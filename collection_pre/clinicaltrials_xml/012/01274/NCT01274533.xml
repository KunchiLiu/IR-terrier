	<brief_summary>This is a research study for subjects who have been diagnosed with Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma, a rare and aggressive peripheral T cell neoplasm caused by the virus HTLV1. Currently, there is no accepted standard therapy for this disease. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the use of the investigational drug lenalidomide in the treatment of Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma. Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide in HTLV-1 Adult T-Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective is to determine the efficacy of lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed or refractory HTLV 1 associated Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma. Efficacy will be assessed by measuring the response rate, tumor control rate, duration of response, time to progression and progression free survival. The Secondary Objective is to evaluate the safety of lenalidomide monotherapy as treatment for subjects with relapsed or refractory HTLV 1 associated Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. Relapsed or refractory HTLV1 associated Adult Tcell Leukemia/Lymphoma (Acute and lymphoma subtypes) All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy and surgery, must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment in this study. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 at study entry (see Appendix C). Laboratory test results within these ranges: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 50,000 /mm³ Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min by CockcroftGault formula (Appendix J). Patients with calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min and &lt; 60 mL/min will have a reduced starting dose of lenalidomide (see Section 5.4.2). Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN. Disease free of prior malignancies for ≥ 5 years with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "insitu" of the cervix or breast. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. See Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods, AND also Appendix B: Education and Counseling Guidance Document. Patients at high risk for DVT/PE must be able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin). Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide). Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. Evidence of laboratory TLS by CairoBishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (see Appendix H). Subjects may be enrolled upon correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. Any prior use of lenalidomide. Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments. Known positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis, type B or C. Recent DVT/PE requiring dose adjustments of anticoagulation within past 90 days</criteria>
