Subject has a history of seizures (other than infantile febrile seizures), a chronic or current tic disorder, a current diagnosis, and/or a known family history of Tourette's Disorder. Subject has a history of tics that are judged by the Investigator to be exclusionary. 8. Subject has a known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may place him/her at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug. 9. Subject has a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia. 10. Subject has any clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) or clinically significant laboratory abnormality. 11. Subject has current abnormal thyroid function.

Subject is taking other medications that have central nervous system (CNS) effects or affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant sympathomimetics, or are monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
