	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in participants with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, and elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) to assess the efficacy and safety of extended release (ER) niacin/laropiprant [ERN/LRPT (MK-0524A)] when added to the following ongoing lipid-modifying therapy (LMT): simvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin monotherapy, ezetimibe/simvastatin fixed dose combination (FDC), or any statin co-administered with ezetimibe. The study is based on the hypothesis that ERN/LRPT 2 g daily will be superior to placebo at lowering LDL-C at Week 12 of treatment.</brief_summary>
