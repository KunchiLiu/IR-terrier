	<brief_summary>The treatment of lupus nephritis with cyclophosphamide and steroids changed the prognosis of lupus nephritis in the early '80s. In recent years, alternative regimens have appeared in both the induction and maintenance with similar results at least to those offered by the classic pattern and possibly with fewer side effects, especially for long term. The association of prednison and mycophenolate has created large expectations to that effect, and is part of first-line therapeutic arsenal of lupus nephritis type III, IV and V. Despite the significant advances that have led to these treatments, the likelihood of complete remission after six months remains, according to the series of 8-13% and partial remission do not exceed 60% in papers published. In the last year, two articles have been published supporting the use of triple therapy (prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclosporine) in poor prognosis of lupus nephritis with hopefully better results than those obtained previously. In this study we try to compare the effectiveness of triple therapy, the therapy is now considered standard (prednisone, mycophenolate) in patients with lupus nephritis type III-IV-V</brief_summary>
