	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease (a long-lasting disease causing pain and swelling) associated with significant health problems. It is a difficult disease to manage as the disease is often unpredictable. RA causes inflammation (swelling) of the joints that can cause joint damage, deformity, and progressive disability and impairment. It is estimated that 1% of the world's population suffers from this disease. The purpose of this research study is to determine if a change in inflammation seen on the ultrasound is a good indicator of how subjects' rheumatoid arthritis is responding to treatment of subcutaneous abatacept at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.</brief_summary>
