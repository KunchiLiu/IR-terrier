	<brief_summary>This study is being done to look at the absolute bioavailability of fluticasone furoate and GW642444 inhalation powder when administered in healthy subjects. Bioavailability is determined by measuring the amount of the dose of inhaled medication that reaches the circulation; the amount of inhaled fluticasone furoate and GW642444 powder will be compared to the medication administered intravenously (where bioavailability is 100%).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Look at and Compare How Inhaled and Intravenous Fluticasone Furoate and GW642444 Are Processed by the Body in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluticasone furoate (FF), a novel glucocorticoid, and GW642444, a potent, inhaled longacting, beta2-receptor agonist (LABA), are currently under development in combination for use as a once-daily, inhaled treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). FF is also being developed as a stand-alone product for asthma and GW642444 is also being developed as a stand-alone product and in combination with a novel, long-acting muscarinic antagonist for the treatment of COPD. This study is being performed to determine the absolute bioavailability of both FF and GW642444 when delivered in combination from the novel dry powder inhaler.</detailed_description>
