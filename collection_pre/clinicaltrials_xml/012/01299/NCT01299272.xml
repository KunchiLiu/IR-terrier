	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether LY2216684 (12 mg to 18 mg once daily) is superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were initially partial responders to a SSRI in the prevention of re-emergence of depression symptoms in patients with MDD who met remission criterion during open label treatment and randomization criteria during a stabilization period. This trial consists of two distinct periods; an open label treatment period, which consists of two parts, 8 weeks open label with movement to 10-12 weeks open label stabilization IF patients are in remission at end of 8 weeks (open label for 18 to 20 weeks total) followed by a randomized blinded period for 24 to 26 weeks.</brief_summary>
