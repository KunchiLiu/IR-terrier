	<brief_summary>This study has two parts. In the first part, the efficacy and safety MK-0954E (losartan potassium 50 mg [L50] (+) hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg [H12.5] (+) amlodipine besylate 5mg [A5]) will be evaluated and compared to the efficacy and safety of MK-0954H (L50/H12.5) in Japanese participants. In the second part, the safety and tolerability of long-term use of open-label MK-0954E in participants with hypertension will be evaluated. The primary hypothesis is that MK-0954E is more effective in lowering mean trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment compared to MK-954H (L50/H12.5 mg) in Japanese participants with essential hypertension who are not adequately controlled following a 8-week treatment with filter period study drug of MK-954H.</brief_summary>
