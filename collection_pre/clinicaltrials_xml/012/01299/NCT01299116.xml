	<detailed_description>In this partially randomized patient preference study, women aged 18-29 seeking oral or injectable contraception will be offered an opportunity to try LARC instead; the FDA-approved options include two types of intrauterine products and one type of subdermal contraceptive implant. Over a 24-month period, the experiences of LARC users will be compared to the experiences of those opting for their initial short-acting method. It is expected that 38% of the participants using short-acting methods will stop using them during the first year and be at risk of unintended pregnancy. In contrast, less than 20% of LARC users will want to have their contraceptive removed. Continuation rates will be measured and pregnancies will be tallied in the two groups to document any differences that emerge.</detailed_description>
