	<brief_summary>The investigators will evaluate the effects of an integrated risk counseling program on behavioral and psychological outcomes in African American men and women in a randomized trial that is implemented and evaluated collaboratively through the West Philadelphia Consortium to Address Disparities. The specific aims of this research are as follows: 1. To evaluate the effects of integrated versus disease specific counseling on risk exposure behaviors. The investigators predict that compared to individuals who receive disease specific counseling, those who receive integrated counseling will report greater intake of fruits and vegetables and increased rates of physical activity. 2. To evaluate effects of integrated versus disease specific counseling on psychological outcomes. The investigators predict that compared to individuals who receive disease specific counseling, those who receive integrated counseling will report greater risk comprehension related to cancer and cardiovascular disease and will be more motivated to make behavioral changes. 3. To identify the mechanisms through which integrated risk counseling leads to behavioral change. The investigators predict that changes in risk exposure behaviors (e.g., diet and physical activity) will be mediated by increased risk comprehension and self-efficacy for diet and physical activity.</brief_summary>
