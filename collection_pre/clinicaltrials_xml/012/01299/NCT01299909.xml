	<brief_summary>The MTS2 study enrollment goal is N=240 adult smokers randomized to study treatments. The study design includes two randomized arms to compare matched intensive interventions and a third non-randomized option for participants who prefer not to enter an intensive intervention. It is expected that roughly 50% (120) will choose to be in the randomized intensive interventions and 50% (120) will choose to be in the non-intensive intervention. Participants who choose to be in an intensive intervention will be randomized to either Mindfulness Training for Smokers(MTS) (n = 60) or Integrated Training for Smokers (ITS)(n=60). Both MTS and ITS are smoking cessation interventions that provide 8 classes over a 6-week period and 2 weeks of nicotine patches. MTS provides and training in mindfulness whereas ITS provides training in quit smoking strategies and access to the Freedom From Smoking Online Premium Program. Participants who choose to be in a non-intensive intervention (estimated from prior recruitment data at n=120) will receive a phone-based intervention through the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line and 2 weeks of nicotine patches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Two on the Effectiveness of Mindfulness Training for Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MTS2 Study is funded for through a five-year K23 NIH training grant (appendix) awarded to Dr. James Davis, the Principal Investigator on this protocol. The study enrollment goal is N=240 adult smokers randomized to study treatments. Based on prior recruitment numbers, it is expected that roughly 50% (120) will choose to be in an intensive intervention and 50% (120) will choose to be in the non-intensive intervention. Participants who choose to be in an intensive intervention will be randomized to either MTS (n = 60) or ITS (n=60). MTS is a smoking cessation intervention that provides 8 mindfulness classes over a 6-week period. ITS will provide participants will access to the Freedom From Smoking Online Premium Program (at no cost) plus 8 smoking cessation classes over a 6-week period. Participants who choose to be in a non-intensive intervention (n=120) will receive a phone-based intervention through the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line. At the Orientation Meeting, participants who decide to enter the study will be allowed to choose whether they enter an intensive or the non-intensive intervention. Intensive intervention participants will attend an additional meeting called the Introductory Meeting where they are will undergo randomization into either the MTS or ITS. The Introductory Meeting will also provide instruction on the use of nicotine patches, smoking calendars and provide intervention materials. The study employs 3 study assessment visits. Study Visit 1 follows the Orientation Meeting, Study Visit 2 is 4-weeks post-quit, Study Visit 3 is 24-weeks post-quit. All participants will receive 2 weeks of free nicotine patches and $30 for attending each of the two post-quit study visits. The total time for the study including recruitment, intervention and participant follow-up for N = 240 will be three years. The study will recruit subjects from the Dane county region through the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CRTI). Recruitment will take place through flyers, television, newspaper and radio advertisements. The principal hypothesis for the study is that MTS compared to ITS will show significantly higher point prevalent Carbon Monoxide confirmed smoking abstinence rates at 4 and 24 weeks post quit. Secondary hypotheses is that study group compared to controls will show significant differences in questionnaire results that test distress, depression, anxiety, attentional control, mindfulness and quality of life and bio-physiological markers such as weight, breath holding and hair cortisol.</detailed_description>
