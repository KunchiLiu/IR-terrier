	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the potential beneficial cardiometabolic effect of moderate (5%) weight loss and progressive (5%, 10%, and 15%) weight loss in obese adults without diabetes. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups. Group 1: supervised weight loss group (low-calorie diet). Group 2: supervised weight maintenance group (normal diet). Of those assigned to group 1, half of the participants will lose 5% of their body weight and the other half will lose 5%, 10%, and 15% of their weight over time under the guidance of a dietitian. Research testing will be repeated at each time point (5%, 10%, and 15% weight loss). In group 2, research testing will be repeated after six months.</brief_summary>
