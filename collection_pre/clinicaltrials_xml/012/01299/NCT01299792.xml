	<brief_summary>Video-urodynamic investigations are regarded as the current standard diagnostics for neurogenic bladder dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury. This examination is exact, but time consuming, costly and associated with the risk of urinary tract infection. In patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostate hyperplasia, sonographic measurement of bladder wall thickness has been demonstrated to be able to replace urodynamic testing for the diagnosis of infravesical obstruction. Hypothesis: measurement of bladder wall thickness in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to spinal cord injury is closely related to the known risk factors for upper urinary tract deterioration (bladder compliance, detrusor leak point pressure) in this group of patients and can therefore replace urodynamic examination in selected cases.</brief_summary>
