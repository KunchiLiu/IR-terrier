	<brief_title>Project PARIS: Parents and Residents in Session</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A specific patient and family centered care module will be implemented in the context of an existing training rotation. This module includes a meeting between resident physicians (trainees) and parents of previously hospitalized children (members of the Family Faculty in our institution), monitored by a senior faculty member. Patient and family centered care will be discussed using predefined, manual-driven guidance. This meeting is followed by a discussion with the faculty member to identify core components of family-centered care as exemplified in the parent interview.</detailed_description>
