	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the incidence of peri-colonoscopy hyponatremia associated with PEG 3350 + sports drink (PEG-SD) versus PEG 3350-electrolyte solution + sodium sulfate + sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid (PEG-ELS). Hypothesis: As compared to PEG-SD, hyponatremia occurs significantly less often with PEG-ELS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults age 18 years or older scheduled for elective outpatient colonoscopy: 8am noon. Unable or unwilling to consent Pregnant Breast feeding Significant psychiatric illness &gt; 50% colon resection Bowel obstruction History of hyponatremia (Serum sodium &lt;135 mmol/L) End stage renal disease on dialysis History of chronic kidney disease (other than kidney stones) Decompensated cirrhosis, including: History of bleeding due to portal hypertension (varices, gastropathy, etc) within 3 months Hepatic encephalopathy (not controlled with medications) within 3 months Clinical presence of ascites Active cardiac disease Recent myocardial infarction (&lt;4weeks) Unstable angina Congestive heart failure NYHA Functional Class Stage III or IV Stage III: Marked limitation of activity. Less than ordinary activity (e.g. walking short distances, 20100 m) causes fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea. Comfortable at rest. Stage IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest.
