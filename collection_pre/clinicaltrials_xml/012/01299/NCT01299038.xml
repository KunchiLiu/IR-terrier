	<brief_summary>Research studies have shown a strong association between cancer and blood clots in the veins (also known as deep vein thrombosis). These blood clots can flow to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) which in severe cases may be life threatening. Studies have demonstrated that increases in microparticles may contribute to the development of deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients. The purpose of this research study is to see if rosuvastatin lowers the number of tissue factor bearing microparticles in the blood (TFMP). TFMP are small particles that are generated from different types of blood cells in the body. In people who have cancer, TFMP are thought to be generated from cancer cells and may represent a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Since no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will be "randomized" into the following study groups: Group 1 (regular dose of rosuvastatin) or Group 2 (higher dose of rosuvastatin). - Participants will take 1 pill of rosuvastatin every day for 4 weeks. Each 4 week period is called a cycle. - Participants will have a physical exam at baseline, on day 1 of starting rosuvastatin, and 2 month visits. Laboratory tests will be taken at baseline, on day 1 of starting rosuvastatin, 6 weeks and 2 months.</detailed_description>
