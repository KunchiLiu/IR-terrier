	<brief_summary>Severe burn is associated with a wide array of stress, metabolic, and physiologic processes in an attempt to restore homeostasis. The catecholamine induced stress response following severe burns is particularly exaggerated and manifests detrimentally as inflammation, insulin resistance, hypermetabolism, and associated profound protein catabolism. The investigators hypothesize that catecholamine blockade will lead to restored IR signaling and result in improved post-burn morbidity. The investigators will further determine the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects.</brief_summary>
