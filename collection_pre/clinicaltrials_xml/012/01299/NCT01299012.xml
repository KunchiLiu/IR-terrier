	<brief_title>Liraglutide as Additional Treatment in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation will be a retrospective chart review of in type 1 diabetics who have been treated with liraglutide. The study will be conducted at Diabetes-Endocrinology Center of WNY at Millard Fillmore Hospital, affiliated to the State University of New York at Buffalo. Study Population: 40 patients with type 1 diabetes on treatment with either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; also known as insulin pump) or multiple (four or more) injections of insulin per day on continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be included in the study. These patients with type 1 diabetes have been treated with liraglutide in addition to insulin. The investigators would retrospectively review their charts to evaluate decreases in fasting, postprandial and the overall mean glucose concentrations. The investigators will compare the mean fasting, the mean weekly glucose and the standard deviation of weekly blood glucose concentrations as recorded by continuous glucose monitoring prior to and following one week and 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide daily. In addition, the investigators will compare the time spent at glucose concentrations &gt;150 and 200mg/dl and &lt;70 and &lt;40 mg/dl. HbA1c levels before and after 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide daily will be compared.</detailed_description>
