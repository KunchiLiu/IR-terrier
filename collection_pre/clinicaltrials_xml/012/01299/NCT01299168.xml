	<brief_summary>The current standard for biopsy-based diagnoses of dysfunction of kidney transplants is the Banff Classification which represents arbitrary international consensus. Recent data-driven approaches using molecular and conventional technologies indicate that mere consensus produces frequently incorrect diagnoses with potential harm to patients due to inappropriate treatment. To address this unmet need and improve diagnostics in the area of organ transplantation, the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC) has developed a new diagnostic system that combines the molecular and histopathological features of transplant biopsies, plus clinical and laboratory parameters, to create the first Integrated Diagnostic System. The present study will validate and refine this system in 500 prospectively unselected biopsies for clinical indications from American, Canadian and European centres in addition to 300 biopsies already collected. Thus this is the extension of the INTERCOM study (INTERCOMEX). In addition to demonstrating the feasibility and value of this System in routine patient care and clinical trials, the study will develop and optimize a transparent and user-friendly reporting format to communicate this information to clinicians and obtain detailed feedback on how this system can best improve patient care.</brief_summary>
