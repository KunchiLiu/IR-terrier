NOTE: look for consistency between manual keratometry, autokeratometry and simulated keratometry measures to ensure "regular" astigmatism prior to enrollment. Subjects who wear contact lenses must discontinue its use for at least 2 weeks (soft contact lens) and at least 3 weeks (gas permeable contact lens) and until corneal topography shows stability prior to preoperative study measurements. are willing and able to attend postoperative examinations per protocol schedule are more than 21 years of age, of either gender and any race: require bilateral cataract extraction followed by posterior intraocular lens (IOL) implantation used as onlabel procedure be willing to have second eye surgery within one month of first eye surgery are in good ocular health, with the exception of cataracts are free of disease(s)/condition(s) listed in the "Precautions" section of the AcrySof IQ ReSTOR +3 and LENTIS Mplus package inserts are able to read and understand one of the following languages: Dutch or Spanish Planned multiple procedures, including limbal relaxing incision (LRI), during cataract/IOL implantation surgery An ocular disease and/or condition that may compromise visual acuity levels (i.e. glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, amblyopia, pupil abnormality such as corectopia, etc.) Previous corneal surgery and/or reshaping Clinically significant corneal endothelial dystrophy (e.g. Fuchs' dystrophy) History of corneal disease (eg. herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis, etc.) History of retinal detachment Subjects that have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase the operative risk or confound the results of this investigation (eg, immunocompromised, connective tissue disease, clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any other such disease or illness). suturing of incision required at time of surgery</criteria>
