	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled clinical trial tests the hypothesis that a selected stress reduction approach, the Transcendental Meditation program will reduce all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke in African American patients with coronary heart disease. Secondary hypotheses include effects on other cardiovascular clinical events, blood pressure and psychosocial stress.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Stress Reduction on Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality in African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this randomized controlled trial is to conduct a long-term evaluation of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program compared to health education (HE) on secondary prevention of clinical events in African American men and women with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients (N=201; mean age 59 yrs) were enrolled with documented CAD (i.e., coronary angiogram showing at least one artery with &gt; 50% stenosis). Patients were pretested at baseline and every 6-12 months for the duration of the study for incidence of clinical events, BP, BMI, medication usage, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial stress factors and intervention compliance. Subjects were followed for a maximum of 9.2 years (mean 5.4 years). The investigators hypothesize that a selected stress reduction intervention, the TM program compared with a health education control may significantly reduce risk for death, MI and stroke in African American men and women with CHD. If successful, the Transcendental Meditation program may be clinically useful in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in a high-risk population.</detailed_description>
