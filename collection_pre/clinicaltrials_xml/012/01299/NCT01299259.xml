	<brief_title>Improving Primary Care Follow-up for Patients With Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that patients diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) receive follow-up care within 72 hours of diagnosis. However, recent studies show that the majority of teenage girls diagnosed with PID do not receive this follow-up care within 72 hours. We hypothesize that text message reminders to girls diagnosed with PID in the emergency department (ED) will improve follow-up to their primary care provider (PCP) after being discharged from the ED.</detailed_description>
