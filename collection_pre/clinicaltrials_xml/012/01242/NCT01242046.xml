	<brief_summary>The key research question in this study is whether or not caffeine facilitates genital sexual arousal in women in the presence of an external erotic stimulus. Caffeine's impact on the human sexual response cycle has yet to be studied in the field, so the goal is to determine if this substance will have any impact on genital arousal well as potentially identify the mechanisms underlying its ability to do so. Considering that this will be a single blind study, a key goal of the project is to determine how participant expectations regarding what they ingest will impact their subjective sexual arousal. At present, we hypothesize that, as caffeine's stimulant properties increase a human's heart rate and blood pressure, caffeine intake will facilitate genital arousal.</brief_summary>
