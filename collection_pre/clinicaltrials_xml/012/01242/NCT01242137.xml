	<brief_summary>Glibenclamide is metabolized by the hepatic enzyme P450 CYP2C9 to less active form. Polymorphism of this enzyme demonstrated clinical significance when examined on other drugs from the sulfonylurea drug family, to whom Glibenclamide is included. The investigators assumption is that patients with less active alleles of the enzyme may show lower dose requirements of the drug for glycemic control, when compared to patients homozygotes to wild-type alleles.</brief_summary>
