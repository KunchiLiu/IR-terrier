	<criteria>1. Patient's written informed consent for &gt;or= 18 years of age before any assessment is performed. Parent or legal guardian's written informed consent and child's assent, if appropriate, are required before any assessment is performed for patients &lt; 18 years of age. 2. Male and female patients at least 4 years of age at the time of the screening visit. 3. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of TRAPS and a mutation of TNFRSF1A gene. Patients with low penetrance mutations, such as R92Q or P46L, can be included with mutual agreement between the investigator and Novartis. 4. Patients with a diagnosis of recurrent TRAPS must experience more than 6 episodes/year prior to receiving an effective biologic therapy and the duration of each episode lasted at least 8 days. For patients receiving biologic therapy, this criterion applies to prior to receiving the biologic therapy. 5. Patients who have been treated with anakinra must have demonstrated a partial or complete clinical response with an associated decrease in their inflammation markers (CRP and SAA). 6. Active TRAPS as evidenced by clinical signs and symptoms of active TRAPS (Physician's Global Assessment &gt;or= 2) and an elevated CRP &gt; 10mg/L (Normal CRP range &lt;or= 10 mg/L) and/or SAA &gt; 10 mg/L (Normal SAA range &lt;or= 10 mg/L) at time of first canakinumab treatment. 1. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL). 2. Women of childbearing potential, defined as premenarche females aged 8 years and above or all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, UNLESS they are women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means using a highly effective method of birth control (i.e. one that results in a less than 1% per year failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices [IUDs]; periodic abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] is not acceptable) or total abstinence at the discretion of the investigator in cases where the age, career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures compliance. Women of childbearing potential should be willing to use a reliable contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after study drug discontinuation. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. 3. History of being immunocompromised, including a positive HIV at screening (ELISA and Western blot) test result. 4. Positive QuantiFERON (QFTTB G InTube) test or positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test (&gt;or= 5 mm induration) at screening or within 2 month prior to the screening visit, according to the national guidelines. Patients with a positive PPD test (&gt;or= 5 mm induration) at screening may be enrolled only if they have either a negative chest xray or a negative QuantiFERON test. 5. Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to the start of the trial, during the trial, and up to 3 months following the last dose. 6. History of significant other medical conditions, which in the Investigator's opinion would exclude the patient from participating in this trial. 7. History of recurrent and/or evidence of active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection(s). 8. Use of prohibited therapies, any other investigational biologics within 8 weeks prior to the Baseline visit, any other investigational drugs, other than investigational biologic treatment, within 30 days (or 3 months for investigational monoclonal antibodies) or 5 halflives prior to the Baseline visit, whichever is longer 9. History of known hypersensitivity to canakinumab. 10. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
