	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to: • Determine the maximum tolerated dose of thalidomide used in conjunction with dose-intense melphalan, bortezomib and autologous (syngeneic) HSC support in the salvage therapy of patients who failed a prior treatment with dose-intense melphalan The secondary objectives of this study are to: - Determine the toxicities resulting from administration of combinations of thalidomide, bortezomib and melphalan - Determine the complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VgPR) rate in patients undergoing ASCT using thalidomide, bortezomib and melphalan - Evaluate the treatment-free interval after treatment with the combination of thalidomide, bortezomib and melphalan</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VELCADE™ (bortezomib) for Injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies. VELCADE is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and it is registered in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. By inhibiting a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple signaling pathways. The anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Thus, the mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its antitumor activity may vary among tumor types, and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ. Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999). In addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pink et al., 2002). Notably, bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics (McConkey et al., 1999). Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation, its attenuation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic effect, and possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects.</detailed_description>
