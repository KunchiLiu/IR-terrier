	<brief_summary>This an an open-label study to define the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose and confirm the clinical effective dose of palifosfamide-tris given intravenously in combination with etoposide and carboplatin in a wide range of cancers which etoposide and carboplatin are normally given. Once the maximum dose of palifosfamide-tris is determined,a Phase II study using the 3 agents combined will begin.</brief_summary>
