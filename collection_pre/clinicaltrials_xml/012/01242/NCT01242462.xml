	<brief_summary>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common respiratory disorder in preterm infants. Despite improved survival of extremely premature infants with RDS, complications related to mechanical ventilation still occur. This trial will attempt to maintain adequate gas exchange at a rapid rate, short inspiratory time, low tidal volume, and low peak inspiratory pressure in infants with respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. A cross over design will be used to test the hypothesis whether mid-frequency ventilation in preterm infants with RDS requiring mechanical ventilation will reduce the peak inspiratory pressure requirement when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
