	<detailed_description>During labor it is a common practice that the parturient is fastening and having fluid replacement through intravenous hydration (IVH), the rational being to avoid aspiration of gastric content in a situation of need for urgent intervention and general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. It is acceptable to infuse 125 ml per hour of a physiological solution that does not contain sugar, but the volume is not adjusted to the weight of mother, the level of effort or relaxation she is experiencing and it may well be below the required amount. From studies in the field of sport medicine it is clear that the amount of fluid reaching the muscle has an impact on the efficiency of the muscle at the level of tissue and the level of personal achievement in sports. Only few studies dealt with the amount and contents of IVH during labor that will be sufficient and meet all physiologic requirements of the parturient and her fetus.</detailed_description>
