	<brief_title>Self Help Intervention to Decrease Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress is a ubiquitous problem and a mediator of symptoms for a variety of medical conditions. Most medical diagnoses, procedures, and physician visits are associated with considerable stress. Excessive stress is associated with adverse medical outcomes, unhealthy coping mechanisms, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and overall a poor quality of life. No specific pharmacologic treatment is available for treating stress. Further, it is often difficult or sometimes impossible to change the reality of circumstances causing stress in an individual. Thus increasing individual coping mechanisms and ability of a person to handle stress, rather than changing the stressors itself might be a more feasible approach towards reducing stress. Several interventions are available to decrease stress. Majority of these programs entail extensive in-person training which impacts on widespread dissemination of the program. We are interested in applying an innovative approach toward stress management by testing the efficacy of a stand alone self help program offered in the form of a book with no in-person instructor time. Participants will receive a copy of the book, "Train Your Brain Engage Your Heart Transform Your Life" along with three handouts summarizing the contents of the book. This book describes the program of Attention and Interpretation therapy that is designed to help decrease stress and anxiety and has been developed at Mayo Clinic Rochester.</detailed_description>
