	<brief_summary>CACICOL20 is a biodegradable nanopolymer engineered to mimic glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfates. Applied to the corneal lesion, it replaces damaged heparan sulfates in the matrix scaffold. CACICOL20 binds to matrix proteins such as collagen and cytokines or endogenous growth factors of the cellular microenvironment. CACICOL20 provides a protective function and restores the matrix architecture. This produces a suitable spatial environment for cells to respond properly to the cascade of signals needed for tissue regeneration to resume. The ophthalmic solution, CACICOL20, used for corneal ulcers is very well tolerated both locally and generally, as proved by a pilot study which as been conducted at the "Hôpital des XV-XX" in Paris (France). It reduces the pain significantly and increases corneal ulcer healing (all ulcers treated were resistant to all other usual therapies). Therefore, the accuracy of a Randomized multicentric double blinded study to evaluate the efficacy of CACICOL20 versus placebo for chronic corneal ulcer healing has been shown and will begin mid-may 2010. In this study, CACICOL20 will be applied every 2 or 4 days for 3 months. The aim of the study is a double blinded comparison of complete chronic corneal ulcers healing rate within 3 months in 3 groups of patient double blinded randomized between CACICOL20 instillations distribution and physiological salt solution instillations distribution. The main judgment criteria is healing rate within 3 months defined as corneal ulcer complete closure.</brief_summary>
