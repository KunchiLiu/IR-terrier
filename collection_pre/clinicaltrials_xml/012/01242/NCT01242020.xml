	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test a method of imaging (taking a picture) of the abdomen (belly), neck, thigh and calf (lower leg) areas of the body, using ultrasound along with a drug which makes the pictures look clearer. Ultrasound is a type of imaging that uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of the human body. Two sets of pictures will be taken on two different days to see if the results are the same each time. DEFINITY® is a drug given intravenously (through the vein). DEFINITY® is approved by the FDA to be used as an ultrasound contrast agent (makes the pictures look clearer) while taking pictures of the heart. In this study, DEFINITY® will be used while taking pictures of blood vessels in your abdomen (belly), neck, thigh and calf (lower leg). Since this use of DEFINITY® is different than the use approved by the FDA, this study will be performed under an FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) application.</brief_summary>
