	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Despite the numerous advances in the field of in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), there still exists a maximum implantation rate per embryo transferred of about 30%. Next to the physiological and physic burden that comes with every IVF treatment cycle, implantation failure also adds up to the considerable costs associated with ART. Studies have shown, that minor intrauterine abnormalities can be found in 11-40% of the infertile women with a normal transvaginal sonography. Detection and treatment of these abnormalities by office hysteroscopy have led to a 9-13% increase in pregnancy rate. Therefore, it is increasingly advocated to screen all infertile women on intracavitary pathology prior to the start of IVF/ICSI. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the proposed study is to assess whether diagnosing and treating unsuspected intrauterine abnormalities by saline infusion sonography and/or routine office hysteroscopy prior to a first IVF/ICSI treatment cycle improves the cost-effectiveness of the fertility treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter randomized intervention study. POPULATION: Asymptomatic women, indicated for a first IVF/ICSI treatment cycle and a normal transvaginal ultrasonography. INTERVENTION: Participants will be randomized for a (SIS and) hysteroscopy with treatment-on-the spot of predefined intrauterine abnormalities versus no diagnostic work-up. In both groups standard IVF/ICSI treatment will be initiated. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate resulting in live birth achieved within 18 months of IVF/ICSI treatment after randomization (obtained in both treatment cycles with fresh embryos, as well as in subsequent cryo/thaw cycles) SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: - Cumulative implantation rate achieved within 18 months of IVF/ICSI treatment after randomization (obtained in both treatment cycles with fresh embryos, as well as in subsequent cryo/thaw cycles) - Cumulative miscarry rate within 18 months of IVF/ICSI treatment after randomization (obtained in both treatment cycles with fresh embryos, as well as in subsequent cryo/thaw cycles) - Cost calculations of, SIS, hysteroscopy procedures and the IVF treatment - Patient preference and tolerance of a SIS and diagnostic/therapeutic hysteroscopy procedure - Prevalence of unexpected intrauterine abnormalities - Diagnostic accuracy of SIS in diagnosing intrauterine abnormalities</brief_summary>
