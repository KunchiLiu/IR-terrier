	<brief_summary>The long term goal of the study entitled "Quit &amp; Fit" was to revise, evaluate, and disseminate the American Lung Association´s (ALA) teen smoking cessation program called Not On Tobacco (N—O—T), with an added physical activity module. The physical activity module was intended to encourage youth to adopt a more physically active lifestyle. Research showed that physical activity may increase the odds of smoking cessation. The general N—O—T program goals are to help adolescents quit smoking; reduce cigarette use (for participants who are unable to completely quit); increase healthy lifestyle behaviors; and improve life skills such as stress management, decision making, communication, and interpersonal skills. The primary aim of the current research project was to reduce smoking among West Virginia teens. A two—prong secondary aim was to (a) increase participants´ physical activity behavior by supplementing the intervention with a physical activity component and (b) assess the mediating/moderating impact of physical activity on cessation outcomes. If participants quit smoking, the likelihood that they will develop smoking—related diseases is diminished. Participating in this project may aid smoking cessation and therefore improve participants´ health. Research was conducted among 19 of the 123 West Virginia public high schools. 236 teens were recruited to participate in the study over 3 years. This study is a clinical behavioral trial using a 3-group design, with subsequent random assignment.</brief_summary>
