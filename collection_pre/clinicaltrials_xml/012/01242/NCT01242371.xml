	<brief_title>Double-Blind Trial of a Probiotic Supplement to Reduce the Symptoms of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the current study is: 1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a supplemental probiotic therapy, containing the microorganisms Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lanimalis subsp. lactis (BB12), for individuals with schizophrenia who have residual psychotic symptoms of at least moderate severity. Secondary aims of the study are: 2. To assess the effect of probiotic treatment on patients' gastrointestinal functioning 3. To study the effect of probiotic treatment in lowering the levels of antibodies to casein and gliadin. 4. To investigate the association between the efficacy of probiotic therapy and initial levels of antibodies to gliadin and casein.</detailed_description>

History of IV drug use. Primary diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence according to DSMIV criteria within the last three months. Participated in any investigational drug trial in the past 30 days. Pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period. Receipt of antibiotic medication within the previous 14 days (as anaerobic organisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract may be minimally affected by antibiotics). Documented celiac disease (as such persons should be on a glutenfree diet as this is the standard care). Of note, the investigators are not limiting the study to individuals with elevated levels of gliadin or casein antibodies as the investigators intend to look at these levels as a predictor of response.</criteria>
