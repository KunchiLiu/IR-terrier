History within one year prior to randomization of illicit drug use; 4. History of alcohol abuse at any time in the past; 5. Have received sulfasalazine, azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil, tetracycline, cyclosporine, gold, tacrolimus, sirolimus, or other disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) within 8 weeks of randomization; 6. Use of infliximab, adalimumab, abatacept, certolizumab, golimumab, or tocilizumab within 8 weeks of randomization; 7. Use of leflunomide within 6 months of randomization; 8. Use of etanercept or anakinra within 4 weeks of randomization; 9. Use of a Bcell depleting agent such as rituximab or ocrelizumab, or cytotoxic agents, such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, within one year of randomization; 10. Currently taking cytochrome P450 inhibitors including protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, or macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, or azole antifungals such as fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, or cimetidine, nefazodone, bergamottin (constituent of grapefruit juice), quercetin, aprepitant, or verapamil; 11. Currently taking cytochrome P450 inducers including St. John's wort, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazapine, phenobarbitol, or troglitazone; 12. Intraarticular, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid injection within 4 weeks of randomization; 13.

Evidence of tuberculosis (TB) based on chest X rays, tuberculin skin test, QuantiFERON®TB Gold test, or TSPOT®. 15. Presence of Felty's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, gout, or other autoimmune diseases; 16. Major surgery (including joint surgery) within 12 weeks prior to randomization; 17. The subject had an infection requiring antibiotic treatment within 4 weeks of randomization; 18. Subject has any evidence of hepatic disease; Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal; 19. Subject has any evidence of renal impairment; serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) based on the CockcroftGault equation &lt; 30 mL/min; 20. History or presence of any medical or psychiatric condition or disease, or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may place the subject at unacceptable risk for study participation and may prevent the subject from completing the study 21. Participated in any clinical study of an investigational product including CCX354C within 30 days or 5 times the half life of the agent, whichever is longer, prior to randomization</criteria>
