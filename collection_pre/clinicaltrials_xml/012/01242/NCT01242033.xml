	<brief_summary>Eight healthy adult subjects will be given a meal of one, two or four cups red raspberries, or two slices white bread with or without 200 mg vitamin C, after an overnight fast and consumption of a low polyphenol diet for two days. Blood samples will be taken at various time points over an eight hour period to measure oxidative stress and antioxidant levels in the blood. Each subject will attend 5 study visits with one week intervals and be given each meal in a random order. It is hypothesized that raspberry consumption at higher doses will greater protect against meal-induced oxidative stress compared to bread controls.</brief_summary>
