	<detailed_description>The study utilizes a telephone reporting system to self report lipid values and provide educational counseling regarding lifestyle modification methods to reduce cardiovascular risk. Study patients will be randomized to receive a home monitoring device and will be instructed on its use. Generic simvastatin will be given to reduce LDL levels in all groups. It is the hypothesis that those study patients receiving a home device will reach target LDL (goal LDL) more frequently than those randomized to usual care( no device).</detailed_description>
