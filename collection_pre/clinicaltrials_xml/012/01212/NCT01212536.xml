	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to compare the new paediatric Airtraq indirect optical laryngoscope with conventional direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in a randomised crossover study during routine anaesthesia. The investigators hypothesise that the Airtraq is as good as conventional laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation of infants and children. This will be an equivalence rather than a non-inferiority study.</brief_summary>
