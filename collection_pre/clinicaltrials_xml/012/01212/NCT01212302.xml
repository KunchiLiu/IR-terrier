	<brief_summary>Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) and clopidogrel is of great importance for treatment following coronary stenting. Unfortunately the variable platelet inhibitory effectiveness compromises the antithrombotic benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy. The aim of this prospective single centre study was to reduce the low response incidence of dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and clopidogrel based on a standardized therapy algorithm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Aspirin and Clopidogrel Therapy (BOchum CLopidogrel and Aspirin Plan)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelet function testing using whole blood aggregometry was performed 48 hours following coronary stenting (either acute coronary syndromes or stable coronary artery disease). The antiplatelet therapy included a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel and 500 mg ASA, followed by 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg ASA once daily. Clopidogrel low-response (CLR) and/or ASA (ASA low response) were treated according to a structured therapy plan.</detailed_description>
