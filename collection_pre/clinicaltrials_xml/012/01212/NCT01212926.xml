	<brief_summary>It is now accepted that the anticancer properties of anthracyclines were allowed in many malignancies improve the prognosis of affected populations. However, the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is responsible for an interruption of this treatment by alteration of potentially irreversible myocardial contraction and high mortality. An earlier detection of adverse myocardial anthracycline chemotherapy would allow the adaptation of the regimen by reducing the number of interruptions of antitumor and strengthening monitoring. Optimizing the therapeutic antitumor and generate an increase in survival of patients treated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection of Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity by Echocardiographic Analysis of Myocardial Deformation in 2D Strain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analysis of myocardial deformation in its longitudinal component, circumferential and radial, is a new echocardiographic technique for evaluating myocardial function, which has demonstrated its superiority compared to LVEF in many clinical situations. It therefore seems promising to evaluate this new tool in the earlier detection of adverse myocardial chemotherapy with anthracyclines. The ultimate goal is indeed to determine a reliable and reproducible parameter for cardiac toxicity diagnostic to avoid chemotherapy interruption, thus improving the survival of these patients. The main objective of this project is to evaluate the association between changes in myocardial deformation longitudinal 2D strain echocardiography between baseline and 6 weeks after initiation of anthracycline therapy for acute leukemia and the occurrence of impaired left ventricular function within 12 months after starting treatment. It is a prognostic study of clinical-looking, without randomization. The inclusion will take place over a period of 12 months with a total follow-up of 12 months. The analysis will focus on the identification of parameters predictive of alteration of Fe VG.</detailed_description>
