	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of carfilzomib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL),small lymphocytic lymphoma(SLL), or prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Carfilzomib in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) or Prolymphocytic Leukemia (PLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) / Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) and Prolymphocytic Leukemia (PLL). II. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of carfilzomib in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate efficacy of carfilzomib therapy in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) to justify future phase II studies. II. To determine the degree and duration of cellular proteosome inhibition induced by carfilzomib and relationship of this to pharmacodynamics, response and toxicity. III. To determine the pharmacokinetics (plasma and cellular) of carfilzomib and relationship of this to proteosome inhibition, pharmacodynamics, response, and toxicity.IV. To examine the effect of carfilzomib on pharmacodynamic parameters including cytokines, changes in downstream targets including NF-kappa B (p50/p65 binding; I-kappa B level, P-I-kappa B level,select target genes), p53 (p53 nuclear levels, p53 nuclear binding, and select target genes), ER stress proteins, and p73. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib.Patients receiving carfilzomib intra-venous(IV) over 30 minutes once daily, on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
