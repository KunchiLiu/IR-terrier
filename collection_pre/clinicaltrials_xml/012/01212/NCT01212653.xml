	<brief_summary>1. To determine the effect of Golimumab treatment on the number and function of Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) in Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) patients as a possible mechanism for the effect of this treatment on endothelial function. 2. To ascertain the effect of Golimumab treatment on , carotid intima-media thickness, vascular stiffness in Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) patients as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and Augmentation index (AIx). 3. To assess the clinical efficacy of Golimumab in Chinese Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) patients according to ASAS response criteria at month 3, 6 and 12. 4. To perform cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of the Golimumab in Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) patients, using clinic-base data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Anti-TNF (Alpha) Treatment on Vascular Stiffness in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will provide important data on the pathogenesis of vascular damage and possible mechanism by which potent anti-inflammatory treatment may reduce cardiovascular risk in Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) patients. Fifty patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) will be randomized to receive either Golimumab or Placebo for 12 months. Patients randomized to Placebo with worsening disease activity (failure to achieve Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS20)) at week 24 will be permitted to escape to open-label Golimumab. Clinical assessment, intima-media thickness, vascular stiffness and endothelial progenitor cells will be performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
