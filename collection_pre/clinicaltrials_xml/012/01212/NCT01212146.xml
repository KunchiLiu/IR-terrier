	<brief_summary>The aim of the present randomized double-blind controlled crossover study is to compare the effects of the 15-day consumption of artichokes enriched with the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei LMGP22043 with those of ordinary artichokes on treatment preference, satisfactory relief of symptoms, bowel habit and the modulation of SCFA production in a group of patients suffering from functional constipation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotic-enriched Artichoke in Functional Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional constipation is a common problem in westernized societies and is characterized by different gastrointestinal symptoms.Different therapeutic strategies have been proposed, but a new therapeutic approach for constipation could be based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by administering prebiotics and/or probiotics. Currently, probiotic products are mainly incorporated in fermented milk-based products or concentrated probiotic preparations. To enlarge the range of choice and to exploit the nutritional qualities of plant matrices, an innovative line of probiotic vegetable products such as artichokes has been developed. The use of these vegetables containing live probiotic strains can take advantage of some their peculiar features for growth and improved bacterial survival. Artichokes can, therefore, work as valid "active" vehicles for the transport and release of adequate amounts of bacterial populations.</detailed_description>
