	<brief_summary>Allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells (MG4101) were manufactured from normal healthy donor who underwent leukapheresis. These cells were processed based on a novel method for ex vivo activation and expansion using an irradiated and activated autologous feeder cell system. MG4101 has anti-tumor activities against various tumors including malignant lymphomas in vitro as well as in vivo tumor model.</brief_summary>
