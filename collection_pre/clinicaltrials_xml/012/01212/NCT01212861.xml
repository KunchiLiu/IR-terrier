	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and performance of the Suprachoroidal Dissection Instrument in creating a fistula between Schlemm's canal and the suprachoroidal space in refractory, open angle glaucoma subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment of Refractory Open Angle Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Suprachoroidal Dissection Instrument (SDI) is a manually operated surgical instrument designed for use within Schlemm's canal. The instrument can access Schlemm's canal through a small ab-externo dissection, allowing use in eyes with scarring due to previous surgery or trauma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Available for up to 3 years followup. Diagnosed with primary openangle, pseudoexfoliative, or pigmentary glaucoma or more than one glaucoma diagnosis of these types. Subject scheduled to undergo glaucoma surgery with the Suprachoroidal Dissection Instrument involving creation of fistula between Schlemm's canal and the suprachoroidal space without combined cataract surgery. Subject has failed at least one incisional glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy, tube shunt, deep sclerectomy, viscocanalostomy, canaloplasty) or angle surgery (Trabectome) OR Is not a candidate for conventional glaucoma surgery due to reasons such as the presence of scleral buckle or compromised conjunctiva. Subject has IOP ≥ 16 mm Hg on maximally tolerated medications within the six week (42 days) period prior to surgery. Visual field defect defined as mean deviation (MD) score worse than or equal to 10 dB on the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm [SITA] Standard 242 Humphrey Analysis during the 6 month period prior to surgery. OR Subject has vertical cuptodisk ratio ≥ 0.75 during the 6 month period prior to surgery. Significant lens opacities or patient is candidate for cataract surgery during the duration of the study. The patient had developmental glaucoma or a secondary glaucoma including steroidinduced, uveitic, or neovascular glaucoma (with the exception of pigmentary and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma). The patient has narrow angle component possibly associated with glaucoma in the operative eye. The subject has angle recession in the operative eye. Significant ocular disease other than glaucoma affecting the assessment of visual function.</criteria>
