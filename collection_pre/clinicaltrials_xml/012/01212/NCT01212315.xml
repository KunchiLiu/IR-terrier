	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if triclosan-coated sutures reduces wound infections after saphenous vein harvesting in CABG patients. Secondary objectives are the effect triclosan-coated sutures on sternal wound infections and a cost analysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The role of the suture material for the development of postoperative wound infection has been debated for many years. It has been reported that fewer bacteria adhere to monofilament polypropylene than braided polyester sutures in vitro but the results are opposed by a non-randomized clinical study where the use of monofilament sutures was identified as an independent risk factor for leg wound infections after CABG.</detailed_description>
