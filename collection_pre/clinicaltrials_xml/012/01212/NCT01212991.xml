	<criteria>Randomized, Double Blind Treatment Period: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH analogue or bilateral orchiectomy Progressive disease despite androgen deprivation therapy as defined by rising PSA levels or progressive soft tissue or bony disease No prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic from prostate cancer Severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbidity that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease History of another malignancy within the previous 5 years other than curatively treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer OpenLabel Treatment Period: The following inclusion criteria apply to patients receiving enzalutamide or placebo during doubleblind treatment. Eligible patients must meet all inclusion criteria. Received randomized doubleblind treatment in PREVAIL; Openlabel day 1 visit is within 6 months after this amendment is approved and becomes effective at the study site; Is willing to maintain androgen deprivation therapy with a gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist or has had a bilateral orchiectomy; The exclusion criteria apply only to patients starting new treatment with enzalutamide after receiving placebo as randomized treatment. Each patient must not meet any of the following criteria: Has taken commercially available enzalutamide (Xtandi); Severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbidity that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease</criteria>
