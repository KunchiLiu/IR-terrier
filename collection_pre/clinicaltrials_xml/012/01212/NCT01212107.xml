	<brief_summary>The study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 regimen of study drug that may be safely administered to patients with advanced and or metastatic cancer. The study consists of two parts: a dose escalation and a dose confirmation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of LY2874455 in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1, first human dose study</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer (solid tumors, lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) that is advanced and/or metastatic and for which all standard therapies have failed Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease Have given written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures Have adequate organ function including: Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) equal to or greater than 1.5 x 10(9)/L platelets equal to or greater than 100 x 10(9)/L, and hemoglobin equal to or greater than 8 g/dL. Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator. Initial treatment must not begin until 14 days after the erythrocyte transfusion Hepatic: Bilirubin equal to or less than 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) equal to or less than 2.5 times ULN. If the liver has tumor involvement, AST and ALT equaling equal to or less than 5 times ULN are acceptable Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.2 times ULN or calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 milliliters per minute using the Standard Cockcroft and Gault Creatinine Clearance Calculation Calcium and phosphate less than or equal to 1.1 times ULN Have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Have discontinued chemotherapy and cancerrelated hormonal therapy with commercially available agents for at least 21 days (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) and radiotherapy for at least 14 days prior to study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Hormone refractory prostate cancer patients receiving gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy or breast cancer patients on antiestrogen therapy (for example, an aromatase inhibitor) prior to entrance on the study may have that treatment continued while they are enrolled in the study Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use 2 medically approved contraceptive methods during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. Female patients must agree to use 2 medically acceptable methods of contraception, 1 being an oral contraceptive, dermal patch, or progestin (implantation or injection), and the other being a medically acceptable barrier method; alternatively, 2 medically acceptable barrier methods may be used. Medically acceptable barrier methods of contraception that may be used by the participant and/or his/her partner include: abstinence; diaphragm with spermicide; intrauterine device (IUD); condom together with foam, spermicide, or vaginal spermicidal suppository. Prohibited methods include the rhythm method, withdrawal, condoms alone, or diaphragm alone Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks Have received treatment with an investigational drug, which has not received regulatory approval for any indication, within 28 days of study treatment with LY2874455 Currently taking agents to control serum phosphate or calcium levels. This includes dietary restrictions Have medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable, asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastases is not required Have a history of major organ transplant (for example: heart, lungs, liver, and kidney) Have current acute leukemia Females who are pregnant or nursing An untreated or uncontrolled acute infection, including urinary tract infection, within 7 days of study entry Have Bazett's corrected QT (QTcB) greater than 470 msec (female) or greater than 450 msec (male), history of unexplained recurrent syncope, history of congenital long QT syndrome, family history of sudden death, or the presence in the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) of a conduction abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude safe participation in this study Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant Previously treated with LY2874455</criteria>
