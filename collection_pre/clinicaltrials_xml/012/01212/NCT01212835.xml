	<brief_summary>Silastic rings have been used around the gastric pouch in order to promote better weight loss after Roux-and-Y gastric bypass surgery ( RYGBP). However the investigators have shown that some patients developed gastroesophageal reflux disease after RYGBP in a previous study. The investigators hypothesized that the use of a silastic ring may play a role in promoting GERD after this operation.</brief_summary>
