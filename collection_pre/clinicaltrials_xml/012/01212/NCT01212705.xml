	<brief_summary>Sleep disordered breathing is common in patients with chronic heart failure. Adaptive servoventilation is a novel method of treatment central sleep apnoea, especially associated with Cheyne-Stokes-respiration. The aim of the study is to investigate effect of adaptive servoventilation on cardiac function, exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure.</brief_summary>
