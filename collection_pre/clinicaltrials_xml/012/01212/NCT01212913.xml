	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control at six months between the basal plus one and the biphasic insulin regimen. Secondary Objective: To demonstrate favorable outcome for basal plus over biphasic insulin when it comes to comparing when both hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target goal achievement and non-hypoglycemic event is taken into account.</brief_summary>
