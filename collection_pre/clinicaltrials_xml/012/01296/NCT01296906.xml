	<brief_summary>One of the nation's major health priorities, as outlined in Healthy People 2010, is to increase the proportion of children aged 19 to 35 months who have received all universally recommended vaccines. This study will compare two interventions for increasing immunization rates in this age group, one using well-studied primary care practice-based methods and the other using innovative technologies to increase immunization rates at the population-level. Results of this study will provide data that will be relevant nationally in guiding future investment of resources to increase up-to-date rates in young children prior to school entry. Hypothesis: Population-based approaches will be more effective than practice-based interventions at increasing immunizations among 19-35 month olds.</brief_summary>
