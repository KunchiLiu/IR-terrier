	<brief_summary>Tissue injury is associated with pain from the injured site (primary hyperalgesia) and pain from non-injured tissue in the vicinity of the trauma (secondary hyperalgesia). In the present study we investigate primary and secondary hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers following an experimental first degree burn injury. The objectives are: - to compare analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of two opioids (morphine and buprenorphine). - to investigate if these effects are related to the volunteers individual pain sensitivity</brief_summary>
