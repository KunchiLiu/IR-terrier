	<brief_summary>Although there is some evidence that whole body electromyostimulation(WB-EMS) affect bone via its acute and longitudinal effects on muscle mass and strength, the corresponding impact on bone density and falls in older adults has not been assessed yet. The investigators hypothesize that WB-EMS significantly affects bone parameters as assessed by DXA, and significantly reduce fall rate and ratio in a cohort of frail elderly women.</brief_summary>
