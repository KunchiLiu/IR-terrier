	<brief_summary>Given that the uncinate process is the gatekeeper of the sinuses, we hypothesize that inflammation of the uncinate process is associated with decreased ventilation and drainage of the paranasal sinuses and consequently with the inflammatory process occuring in the sinuses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Significance of the Uncinate Process Histopathology in Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to gain insight into the histopathological changes of the uncinate process in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis through comparison of its mucosal and bony elements with those of the normal uncinate process without chronic inflammation (unpublished data: Gilead Berger, Ephraim Eviatar, Tatiana Kogan, Roee Landsberg).</detailed_description>
