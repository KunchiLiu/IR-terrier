	<brief_summary>This study was done to look at the level of Depo-Provera, an injectable birth control, in the blood to see whether it is affected by the anti-HIV drug Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r]). It is not known whether taking Depo-Provera together with Kaletra changes the amount of Kaletra in blood. Therefore, this study also looked at the levels of HIV and Kaletra before and after receiving a shot of Depo-Provera. This study evaluated the safety of Depo-Provera and Kaletra when they are used together. In addition to what is stated above, this study also explored any effect of Depo-Provera on the immune system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between DMPA and LPV/r Among HIV-Infected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study objective was addressed by calculating the Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) from week 0 (prior to DMPA injection) to week 12 (twelve weeks after DMPA injection) in our study participants. DMPA was supplied and administered as part of the protocol, however Kaletra was not. It was required that participants already be on a Kaletra based regimen prior to entering the study, as described in the eligibility criteria. Arm A of AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) A5093, which consisted of 14 participants who were administered DMPA without Kaletra, was used as reference data.</detailed_description>
