	<brief_summary>This study is being done to compare the effectiveness and safety of two treatment paradigms (oral sitagliptin with or without glimepiride versus liraglutide with or without increased dosing) for the treatment of participants with Type 2 Diabetes that is not adequately controlled with metformin alone. The primary hypothesis postulated that the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants treated with a sitagliptin-based treatment is non-inferior to that of participants treated with a liraglutide-based treatment.</brief_summary>
