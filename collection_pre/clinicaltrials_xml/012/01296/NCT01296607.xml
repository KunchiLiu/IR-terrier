	<brief_summary>Impairment of the heart's pumping capacity (heart failure) remains a major clinical problem with a poor prognosis and the search for novel treatments remains an important area of research. Urocortins are proteins that appear to increase blood flow and heart pumping activity. There has been particular interest in the role of Urocortins 2 &amp; 3 (subtypes of Urocortins) in heart failure. In this study, we will examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (in particular the onset-offset of action and reproducibility of vasodilator effects) of Urocortins 2 &amp; 3 on forearm arterial blood flow healthy volunteers. Utilising the well-established technique of 'forearm venous occlusion plethysmography', we will be able to focus on the local effects of urocortins on arterial blood flow in forearm vessels, without affecting this system in the body as a whole.</brief_summary>
