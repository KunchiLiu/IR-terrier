	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/II study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032. The Phase I portion will be divided into two stages. During Stage 1, GDC-0032 will be administered every day orally (PO) and at escalating doses in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. During Stage 2, GDC-0032 will be administered alone or as combination therapy within indication-specific cohorts. In Phase II of the study, the efficacy and safety of the combination GDC-0032 and fulvestrant will be evaluated in post-menopausal female participants with locally advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase I (Cohorts A through D, G, H, T, and X): Histologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy or NHL that has progressed or failed to respond to at least one prior regimen and are not candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit Phase I (Cohorts E and F): Postmenopausal females with locally advanced or metastatic hormone receptorpositive breast cancer that has progressed or failed to respond to at least one prior endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting Phase I (Cohorts J through S): Postmenopausal females with HER2negative, hormonereceptor positive breast cancer that has progressed or failed to response to at least one prior endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting Phase II: Postmenopausal female patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2negative, hormone receptorpositive breast cancer Phase I (Cohorts A through S) and Phase II: Evaluable or measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) Phase I (Cohort T): Greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion on computed tomography (CT) scan Phase I (Cohort X): Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 at Screening Life expectancy of &gt;/= 12 weeks Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for both men and women while participating in the study Known and untreated, or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or requiring treatment) Active congestive heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication Participants requiring any daily supplemental oxygen Active inflammatory disease requiring immunosuppressants, including small or large intestinal inflammation such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Treatment with chemotherapy less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 3 weeks before study treatment Oral endocrine therapy &lt;/= 2 weeks before study treatment Treatment with investigational drug &lt;/= 3 weeks or 5 halflives before study treatment Treatment with biologic therapy &lt;/= 3 weeks before study treatment Treatment with kinase inhibitors &lt;/= 2 weeks before study treatment Radiation therapy (other than radiation to bony metastases) as cancer therapy &lt;/= 4 weeks before study treatment Palliative radiation therapy to bony metastases &lt;/= 2 weeks before study treatment Major surgery &lt;/= 4 weeks before study treatment Any other diseases, active or uncontrolled pulmonary dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, that may affect the interpretation of the results, or renders the participant at high risk from treatment complications</criteria>
