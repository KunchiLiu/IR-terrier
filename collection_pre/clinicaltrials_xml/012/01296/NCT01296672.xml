	<brief_summary>The investigators will propose a novel method to improve prostate cancer screening with PSA, using a 3-month treatment with finasteride, a drug used to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and proven to reduce a man's risk of developing prostate cancer. The investigators will also examine three additional promising tests that may further improve diagnosis of prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3 Month Finasteride Challenge Test Can Significantly Improve the Performance of Screening for Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this proposal is to determine if a 5-alpha reductase 'challenge' improves screening performance of PSA and DRE in men who are scheduled for prostate biopsy. Currently a higher PSA level leads to a recommendation for prostate biopsy, causing hundreds of thousands of unnecessary biopsies annually in the U.S. We will show that a three-month treatment with finasteride for men with high PSA levels will better predict the man who should have a prostate biopsy. PSA performance after finasteride 'challenge' will also be compared with new tests for prostate cancer. Finasteride is supplied by Merck and Company, Incorporated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Risk of prostate cancer 2060% calculated with the online Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) prostate cancer risk calculator. (www.prostatecancerriskcalculator.com). PSA value must be obtained within 3 months prior to study entry. A description of the frequency of these individuals in the population is provided in Specific Aim 2 2. Patient has been recommended to undergo and plans to have a prostate biopsy. 3. Patient is willing to delay prostate biopsy for a 3month finasteride vs placebo treatment. 4. No allergy to finasteride or other five alpha reductase inhibitors. 5. Patient is willing to take finasteride vs placebo 5 mg orally daily for 3month treatment period. 6. Age 55 or older. (This age is selected as the PCPT risk calculator is only valid for this age range.) 1. Risk of cancer greater than 60% or less than 20%. 2. Prior history of prostate cancer. 3. Prior treatment with finasteride or dutasteride in the past 6 months 4. Younger than age 55.</criteria>
