	<brief_summary>Despite the long tradition of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies there are hardly any interventional trials on type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hence this pilot study aims to investigate the influence of a two weeks integrative inpatient therapy on the quality of life in 50 patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy. Integrative treatment includes aspects of conventional and traditional European and Chinese medicine, mind-body medicine, physical therapy and lifestyle modification (nutrition advices, stress management and exercise training). The observational design intends four measurement points: tree months before (T0), directly before (T1), directly after treatment (T2) and three months follow-up (T3). The subjective evaluation of the neuropathy-related quality of life was combined with neurophysiologic instruments (QST), to measure neuropathic symptoms. Also pain intensity, locus of control, interpretation of illness, coping style, anxiety/depression, life satisfaction and several biomarkers (HbA1c, ABI, WHR and BMI) are measured. In addition a qualitative interview should give a view to patient perspective of therapy process.</brief_summary>
