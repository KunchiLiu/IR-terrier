	<brief_title>Telemedicine To Provide Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outpatient Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant advances in gastroenterology have led the field to grow into a number of advanced subspecialties: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), motility, therapeutic endoscopy, and transplant hepatology. Telemedicine, the application of information technology in support of health care delivery from a distance, has been employed with good success in various chronic conditions with excellent patient satisfaction. Primary Aim: Our primary study endpoint was measuring patient clinical experience between two groups: A telemedicine remote clinic visit and a standard "in-house" visit. Secondary Aim: To compare standard clinic metrics including clinic wait time, patient throughput, and appointment time between the two groups.</detailed_description>
