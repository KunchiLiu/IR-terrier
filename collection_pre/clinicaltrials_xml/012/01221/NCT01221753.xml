	<brief_summary>In this research study, the investigators are studying whether a reduced dose of radiation when given with standard doses of chemotherapy can reduce side effects without compromising control of the cancer. An approved treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is initial chemotherapy followed by radiation and chemotherapy together. This treatment is effective but has many immediate and long-term side effects. People who have squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SSCHN) that is related to an infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) have been shown to have a high response to this treatment along with a high cure rate. The investigators think that by reducing the intensity of this treatment, they may be able to reduce immediate and long-term side effects which may lead to long term improvements in quality of life and function.</brief_summary>
