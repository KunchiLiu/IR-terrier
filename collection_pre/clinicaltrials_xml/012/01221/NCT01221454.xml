	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of allogenic bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation in patients with liver failure caused by hepatitis B infection. The evaluation of the efficacy includes the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin (ALB), prealbumin(PA), liver histological improvement before and 1 week to 1 year after transplantation. Child-Pugh scores, MELD scores and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously.</brief_summary>
