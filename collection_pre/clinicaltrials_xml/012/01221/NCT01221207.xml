	<brief_summary>Aim 1. To compare the effectiveness of total contact casts (TCC), removable cast walkers (RCW) and instant total contact casts (ITCC) to heal diabetic foot ulcers in a 20 week randomized clinical trial of 225 patients in community care in three university medical center diabetes clinics. Aim 2. To compare the frequency of complications such as soft tissue and bone infections, iatrogenic wounds, falls and fall related injuries, and amputations among patients treated with TCC, ITCC and RCW to heal diabetic foot ulcers. Aim 3. To compare patient compliance and level of activity among TCC, ITCC, RCW treatment groups. Using computerized activity monitors which time-stamp each step, we will evaluate both degree and magnitude of activity between groups. Aim 4. To evaluate the cost of diabetic foot ulcer-related treatment and complications during the course of therapy.</brief_summary>
