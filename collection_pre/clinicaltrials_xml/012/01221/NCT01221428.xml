	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Infusion for Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis is characterized as chronic and nonspecific inflammation of gastroenteritis tract．Nowadays，etiology and pathogenesis of UC have been unclear．Recent basic research has been revealed that stem cell can settle down in epithelium of gastroenteritis tract，which provide a hope for treating the disease.We hope umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells could not only address the need for epithelial cell replacement but also control of the autoimmune response to mocous membrane of colon.</detailed_description>
