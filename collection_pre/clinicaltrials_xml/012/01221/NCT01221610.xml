	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 50 years, 2. Informed consent signed by patient prior to randomization 3. Single or sequential de novo or restenotic lesions (stenosis ≥ 70% diameter reduction or occlusion) in the femoropopliteal arteries ≥ 30 mm and ≤ 200 mm long 4. Rutherford Class 2 5 in the target limb 5. Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD) 3 7 mm, based on visual estimation 6. Inflow free from flowlimiting lesion (&lt; 50% stenosis) confirmed by angiography. Patients with flowlimiting inflow lesions (&gt; 50% stenosis) can be included if lesion has been treated successfully before the index procedure 7. At least one nonoccluded crural vessel (eg without significant stenosis) with angiographically documented runoff to the foot 8. Successful wire crossing of the lesion 9. Willingness to comply with all specified followup evaluations 10. Male or negative pregnancy test of women in childbearing age 1. Comorbid conditions limiting life expectancy ≤ 1 year 2. Patient currently participating in another clinical trial 3. Lesions which are untreatable with PTA or other interventional techniques 4. The target stenosis is located distal to a stenosis ≥ 50% that cannot be pretreated because the drug coating could get lost during crossing the proximal lesion 5. Thrombus in the target vessel, documented by angiography 6. Target lesion is severely calcified, documented by angiography 7. Prior bypass surgery of target vessel 8. Previously implanted stent in the target lesion 9. Treatment of bifurcation required 10. Planned amputation of the target limb 11. Flowlimiting (&gt; 50% DS) Inflow lesion proximal to target lesion, left untreated 12. Failure to obtain &lt;30% residual stenosis in a preexisting haemodynamically significant (&gt;50% DS) inflow lesion in the ipsilateral iliac or proximal SFA. (DEB or DES not allowed for the treatment of inflow lesion) 13. Additional hemodynamically relevant proximal and distal lesions with stenosis ≥ 50 %, except iliac arteries, are excluded. Iliac artery lesion treatments have to be successful with a residual stenosis ≤ 30 % 14. Haemorrhagic diathesis or another disorder such as gastrointestinal ulceration or cerebral circulatory disorders which restrict the use of platelet aggregation inhibitor therapy and anticoagulation therapy 15. Phenprocoumon intake 16. Impaired renal function (creatinine ≥ 2.0 2.5 mg/dl), according to investigator assessment 17. Known allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately controlled with premedication 18. Allergy, intolerance or hypersensitivity to Paclitaxel structurally or related compounds and/or to the delivery matrix nButyryl trinhexyl citrate (BTHC)</criteria>
