	<criteria>1. Diagnose: suspected CML (hematology and/or myelogram and/or immunophenotyping and/or Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase [LAP]) to be confirmed, after, by cytogenetic and/or molecular biology. OBS: only CML Ph+ newlydiagnose in chronic or accelerate phase; resistant CML Ph+ to Interferon α (INFα), Hydroxyurea and/or lowdose ARAC in chronic or accelerate phase; CML Ph+ with cytogenetic relapse after BMT, that didn't use Imatinib previously, in chronic or accelerate phase. 2. Female patients of childbearing age, should have pregnancy test (blood βhCG) performed before treatment initiation. Effective contraception must be used. Pregnant women won't be included. 3. Karnofsky and Lansky scale: ≥40. 4. Life expectation &gt; 8 weeks. 5. Laboratory: renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1,5 x ULN and/or Clearance ≥70 ml/min/1,73m2), hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ 1,5 x ULN, TGP &lt; 3 x ULN and albumin &gt; 2 g/dl. 6. CNS toxicity ≤ II 7. Cardiac function: normal ejection fraction. 8. Signed ICF by child legal responsible. 1. Patient receiving any other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). 2. Pregnant patient or breastfeeding. 3. Patient considered incapable to follow purposed treatment. 4. Patients with molecular relapsed. 5. Medications: Colony stimulating: it cannot be administered at least 1 week before treatment. Anticonvulsants: Imatinib is metabolized by P450 enzyme, thereby subject cannot receive drug that activates the P450 system. The anticonvulsants allowed are valproic acid and benzodiazepines. Anticoagulants: The use of warfarin (Marevan) is not allowed. If anticoagulant is needed, lowmolecularweight heparin (LMWH) can be used. Avoid anticoagulants with platelets &lt; 50000. INFΑ 48h before D1. Hydroxyurea 24h before D1. ARAC doses &gt;100 mg/m2 for 57 days, 14 days before D1. Anthracyclines, Mitoxantrone or Etoposide 21 days before D1. Any other chemotherapeutic agent 28 days before D1. Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) 6 weeks before D1.</criteria>
