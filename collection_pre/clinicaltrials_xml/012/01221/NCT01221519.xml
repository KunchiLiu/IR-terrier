Males or females of nonchildbearing potential (postmenopausal, and/or have undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy/ tubal ligation) aged ≥18 years. Females will be defined as postmenopausal if last menstruation period was &gt;1 year ago and serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is within the postmenopausal range, or if age &gt;50 years and with last menstruation period &gt;2 years ago. A confirmed clinical diagnosis of T2DM for at least 1 year, treated with metformin as a single treatment or in combination with one other oral antidiabetic (ie, DPPIV inhibitor or SU) for at least 2 months prior to screening. Doses of antidiabetic treatment should have been stable for at least 1 month prior to screening. Treatment with at least 1000mg of Metformin for 2 months and being stable on the Metformin Therapy for 1 month Hb A1c &gt;6.5% (international standard) at enrolment. Body mass index (BMI) between ≥19 and ≤42 kg/m2. Clinically significant illness or clinically relevant trauma, as judged by the Investigator, within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of AZD1656 Participation in another clinical study during the 30 days prior to screening or intake of another investigational drug within 30 days (or at least 5 x t1/2 of the drug) prior to the first administration of AZD1656. History of, or ongoing, ischemic heart disease or heart failure. Stroke, transitory ischemic attack, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease within the last 6 months. Clinically significant abnormalities in ECG, clinical chemistry, hematology or urinalysis results. Positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis C virus.</criteria>
