	<brief_title>The Effects of Denosumab on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Midazolam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 27 subjects (Group A: 18; Group B: 9) will receive a 2 mg oral dose of midazolam on day 1 followed by a 24 hour PK collection. Subjects randomized to Group A will receive a single 60 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of denosumab on day 2 administered in the abdomen. On study day 16, another 2 mg oral dose of midazolam will be administered to all subjects (Groups A and B) followed by a 24 hour PK collection. The primary analysis to determine the effect of denosumab on the PK of midazolam will be based on data from subjects in Group A only.</detailed_description>
