	<brief_summary>Current protective clothing of any kind, especially the nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protective garments, amplify thermal stress because of the inherent properties of the clothing material. High insulation coefficient and low water vapor permeability of the protective cloth limit the ability of sweat to readily evaporate, which consequently result with a significant elevation of body temperature and with excessive body fluid loss (because of inefficient sweating) that might result with significant dehydration. Combat soldiers require to perform intense physical activities under hostile environmental conditions, including in contaminated areas that need the use of protective garments. The ability to fulfill a mission derives from the soldier's professionalism and from his physiological limits. It is well established that wearing protective garments affect tolerance time (TT) and performance. To operate in contaminated areas suitable protective garments should be worn. The inherent characteristics of the current protective garments limit, however, the effective working periods with such an ensemble, which is further aggravated in hot climate. Thus, in an attempt to increase TT and enhance work effectiveness, improved protective garments, which result with a lessened heat-stress, are under different stages of development. The relative influence of air permeability properties, garment weight and garment construction on heat stress and physiological strain will be investigated. The results will be quantified in terms of body temperatures, heart rate, fluid balance, subjective sensation and the maximum wear time (if necessary extrapolated).</brief_summary>
