	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine a possible input of C11-Choline PET/CT in identification and localization of a parathyroid adenoma (PTA). Preoperative localization of a PTA has been previously documented in multiple series, and is usually based on scintigraphy and on US. Currently, the conventional technique for localization of a PTA is a dual-isotope scan with Tc99m-MIBI and Tc99m pertechnetate. This study is acquired over at least 3 hours, includes two i.v. injections and the patient has to stay 15-30 min per acquisition under the camera. In addition, there is no anatomical imaging and further correlation with US is usually recommended. In contrast, PET/CT study with C11-Choline takes as long as 10 min., includes one injection, and provides data of higher resolution of functional (PET) and anatomical imaging (CT). Furthermore, dosimetric data shows that the total effective dose from Tc99mMIBI and Tc99m pertechnetate injection is (without CT): 0.5957 rem; and from C11-Choline injection and CT of a chest is: 0.3128 - 0.8628rem.</brief_summary>
