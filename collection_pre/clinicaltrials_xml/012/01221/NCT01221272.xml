	<brief_summary>This study enrolled participants with documented exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in order to evaluate whether ranolazine, when taken prior to exercise, can improve blood flow to the heart (myocardial perfusion), as assessed by exercise-induced myocardial perfusion defect size (PDS) and total perfusion deficit (TPD), using gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). This was a 2-period crossover study. The last dose of each period must have been taken 3-4 hours prior to conduct of the exercise SPECT MPI. After the research exercise SPECT MPI was performed at the end of Period 1, participants discontinued the treatment they were randomized to for that period and began the other treatment in Period 2.</brief_summary>
