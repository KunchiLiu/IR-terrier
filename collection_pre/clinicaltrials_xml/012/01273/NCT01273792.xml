	<brief_title>Investigation of Biomarkers in Susac Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Susac Syndrome is a rare disease characterized by encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion and sensorineural deafness. The pathogenesis is not yet clear, an autoimmune endotheliopathy is discussed. Because of the variable and often incomplete clinical presentation, the establishment of the diagnosis is often delayed or even completely missed. The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers that facilitate the reliable and prompt establishment of the diagnosis. Patients with a definite diagnosis of Susac syndrome and healthy subjects as controls are investigated. Furthermore, the correlation of serological markers with structural retinal and cerebral changes will contribute to clarification of the pathogenesis of Susac syndrome.</detailed_description>
