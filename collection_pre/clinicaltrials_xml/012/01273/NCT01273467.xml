	<brief_title>A Safety and Tolerability Study of 42037788 (Referred to as CNTO 0007) Compared With Placebo in Patients Who Have Experienced Ischemic Cerebral Infarction (Also Known as Stroke)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first-in-human (FIH) study of 42037788 (referred to as CNTO 0007), a cell therapy being tested to see if it may be useful in treating patients with ischemic cerebral infarction also known as stroke. Patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive a single dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo (identical in appearance to CNTO 0007 but does not contain cells) by intravenous (IV) infusion (injection directly into a vein). Patients and study staff will not know if patients are assigned CNTO 0007 or the placebo. The study will be conducted in 2 stages (Stage A and Stage B). In Stage A, the highest dose of CNTO 0007 that does not cause unacceptable side effects, referred to as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined to and administered to patients in Stage B of the study. In Stage A, 5 (up to 7) cohorts (groups) of 4-8 patients each will be administered a single IV infusion of CNTO 0007 or placebo 1-5 days (depending on cohort) after stroke (the first cohort of patients will receive the lowest dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo and each subsequent cohort will be administered a higher dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo until the MTD is determined). In Stage B, patients will be administered a single IV infusion of the MTD within a specified number of days after stroke.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke, as defined by the protocol (If a woman, must be postmenopausal, defined as having no menses for the 18 months before study start. Premenopausal, surgicallysterilized women must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening before CNTO 0007 or placebo administration) Patients must be able to remain as inpatients for at least 3 days postinfusion for intensive safety monitoring Patients must receive standard poststroke care before the infusion begins and after treatment with experimental product, including but not limited to appropriate secondary prevention measure such as blood pressure and cholesterol control and antiplatelet agents, unless contraindicated Patient must have no clinical evidence of worsening stroke in the last 24 hours prior to the start of the infusion of study treatment Patients must have general medical condition consistent with expected survival for at least 1 year. Presence or history of any clinically significant disease, medical condition, or treatment intervention as determined by the Investigator Need for supplementary oxygen for cardiorespiratory reasons or respirator dependency. If supplementary oxygen is not needed for cardiopulmonary reasons but given on a routine basis, it is not exclusionary Presence or history of alcohol or drug abuse as defined by the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV) within 1 year before the screening phase.</criteria>
