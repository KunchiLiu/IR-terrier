	<brief_title>Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Mild Alzheimer's Patients and Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD) cases are with 15 millions worldwide the largest fraction of all AD cases. Most patients are cared for by their family at home. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are very common in AD, even as early as in mild AD: About 90% of all mild AD cases experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, most frequently depression, anxiety, and irritability. These symptoms are associated with greater morbidity, reduced quality of life for the patient, increased burden and depression for the caregiver, higher costs of care, and nursing home placement. Thus, interventions aimed at treating these symptoms could have a tremendous effect on pa-tients, caregivers, and society. This study is a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a comprehensive CBT-based, multi-component treatment programme consisting of eight modules (diagnosis and goal-setting; psycho-education; engagement in pleasant activities; cognitive restructuring; life review; training caregiver in behavior management techniques; interventions for the caregiver; couples counseling) and 20 sessions. This trial aims at significantly reducing depressive and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in the AD patients, and secondary in reducing burden and depressive symptoms of the caregivers. Patients with AD alone or mixed AD and vascular dementia that are in the mild stage and suffer under any neuropsychiatric symptom will be included. The patients and their caregiver will be randomized to either the CBT-based intervention or to the control condition that receives treatment as usual (TAU).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients have to meet NINCDSADRDA criteria for probable or possible AD (McKhann et al., 1984). Mixed Alzheimer and Vascular dementia cases will also be included. Only AD cases with a mild dementia severity will be included, determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (i.e. scores of 0.5 or 1, Morris, 1993) and by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (i.e. scores of 20 or more, Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975). The patient must suffer under any noncognitive symptom that motivates him to accept psychotherapeutic help. A caregiver must be available to take part in most of the therapy sessions. concomitant alcohol or drug addiction and a history of a malignant disease, severe organ failure, metabolic or hematologic disorders, neurosurgery or neurological condition such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, postencephalitic and postconcussional syndrome</criteria>
