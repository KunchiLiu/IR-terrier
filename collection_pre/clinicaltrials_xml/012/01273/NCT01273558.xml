	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the results from two methods used to determine the renal threshold for glucose excretion (defined as the lowest plasma glucose concentration at which appreciable amounts of glucose appear in the urine) in untreated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are treated with 100 mg once-daily canigliflozin for 8 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Two Methods for Determining the Renal Threshold for Glucose in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (patients will know if they are receiving treatment and the identity of the treatment) study that will compare renal threshold of glucose (RTG) values obtained by 2 different methods: an established method (ie, the stepwise hyperglycemic clamp method) and a new method (the mixed meal tolerance test [MMTT] method). The RTG is defined as the lowest plasma glucose concentration at which appreciable amounts of glucose appear in the urine. Each method for determining the RTG value will be performed in untreated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in patients with T2DM who are treated with canagliflozin 100 mg once daily for 8 days. Canagliflozin (a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with T2DM. Patients will not take study drug (canagliflozin 100 mg overencapsulated tablets) in Part 1 of the study. In Part 2 of the study, patients will take study drug once daily on Study Days 1 through 8.</detailed_description>
