	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of Metformin and Canagliflozin in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned) single-center study of canagliflozin and metformin in healthy adult volunteers. Canagliflozin (a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metformin is an approved treatment for patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin will be administered orally (by mouth) as a single 300-mg tablet on Days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and metformin will be administered orally as two 1,000 mg tablets on Days 1 and 8. Both canagliflozin and metformin tablets will be taken with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water.</detailed_description>
