	<detailed_description>This study is a single blind prospective randomized trial. To measure and compare the effectiveness intra-operative topical gentamicin application in tension-free inguinal hernia repair in contrast to intravenous peri-operative prophylactic cefazolin sodium and combination of gentamicin and cephazolin this study is designed. The patients are grouped randomly in to two groups: - Group1;intravenous cefazolin sodium - Group2;topical gentamicin - Group3:topical gentamicin and intravenous cefazolin sodium As a control group we decided to use the data of control groups ( without any prophylactic agent usage ) of previous studies done in our clinic and medical data base reviews.</detailed_description>
