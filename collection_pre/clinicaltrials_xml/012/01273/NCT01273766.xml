	<brief_title>Deferasirox in Treating Iron Overload Caused By Blood Transfusions in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effects of the iron-chelating agent deferasirox on changes in: neutrophil function; macrophage function; lymphocyte function. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of chelation on the incidence of bacterial, viral and fungal infections documented by clinical, microbiologically-proven versus radiologically-proven criteria. II. To determine the effect of iron chelation on mortality and morbidity with incidence of the following parameters: Need for hospitalization; Duration of hospitalization; Need for ventilatory support; Need for exchange transfusion/apheresis; Need for treatment with antifungals or antibiotics for documented infections. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral deferasirox once daily for up to 6 months or until blood counts recover in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
