	<brief_summary>Lateral epicondylitis is a painful overuse condition also described as lateral elbow tendinopathy. As at the Achilles tendon or the patella tendon, lateral elbow tendinopathy has striking clinically and histologically similarities. As such, neovascularisation closely related to pain-mediating fibers are encountered. Eccentric painful exercise is of clinical use in Achilles and patella tendinopathy. We sought to evaluate the clinical effect of a painful eccentric training (supination and pronation) with or without a orthopedic elbow brace in lateral epicondylitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eccentric Training With or Without Elbow Brace for Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two study arms are planned with both groups performed a home-based eccentric training using a Thera-Band Flex-Bar device. Supination and pronation are performed with each position on hold for 2s with 15 repetitions. This is repeated in three sets of 15 repetitions each twice daily. In other words, 6x15 repetitions of supination and pronation per day are suggested in the eccentric training using the Thera-Band Flex-Bar. The combination group performs the same eccentric training. In addition, patients wear a orthopedic elbow brace (Epi-Hit) in order to overcome the elbow pain. This is a clinical trial, thus pain reduction on a visual analogue scale is the primary outcome parameter. Evaluation will be performed after 12 weeks of intervention.</detailed_description>
