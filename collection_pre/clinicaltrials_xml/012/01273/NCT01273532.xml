	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a 100-mg tapentadol (CG5503) dose administered as two 50-mg ER, TRF tablets relative to one 100-mg ER TRF tablet in healthy Japanese male participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Bioequivalence of 50-mg Tapentadol (CG5503) Dose Administered as Two 50-mg Tablets Relative to One 100-mg Tablet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), 2-way crossover study (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial). All participants will receive a single 100-mg dose of tapentadol (CG5503) during 2 periods, in randomized order, as two 50-mg TRF tablets and one 100-mg TRF tablet. All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following treatments, 1 in each period: Treatment A: two tapentadol (CG5503) ER 50-mg TRF tablets, administered as a single oral dose under fasted condition Treatment B: one tapentadol (CG5503) ER 100-mg TRF tablet, administered as a single oral dose under fasted condition Each period will be separated by 7 - 14 days</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Japanese participants who have resided outside of Japan for no more than 5 years and whose parents and maternal and paternal grandparents are Japanese, as determined by participant's verbal report Deemed healthy on the basis of prestudy physical examination, medical history (including smoking habits), 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, serology and hematology) performed within 21 days before study drug administration.
