	<brief_summary>This observational study will evaluate the clinical benefit of Zemplar (paricalcitol injection) in daily routine practice in end-stage renal disease patients with severe over-reactivity of parathyroid glands. Participants will be followed for 6 months. Data will be collected from participants initiated on Zemplar therapy according to standard of care. The time to achieving the maintenance dose of Zemplar (paricalcitol injection), the proportion of participants achieving target parathyroid hormone levels, and prevalence of elevated serum calcium and phosphate levels will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study to Evaluate the Time to Achieving the Maintenance Dose of Zemplar® (Paricalcitol Injection) in the Treatment of Patients Suffering From End-stage Renal Disease and Severe Over-reactivity of the Parathyroid Glands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective data collection started at initial dosing with Zemplar (paricalcitol injection) and ended up to 6 months later. If available, retrospective data on vitamin D treatment as well as on the incidence of hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia in the 6 months leading up to paricalcitol treatment were also collected. Eight visits were planned for documentation of prospective data. In accordance with the non-interventional character of the study, only diagnostic and monitoring procedures were applied which are part of the routine medical care of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</detailed_description>

Willing to sign the patient information and informed consent form, 3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 patient receiving haemodialysis with a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), whose intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level is: between 500800 pg/mL with at least two abruption of conventional vitamin D therapy due to elevated serum calcium level (i.e. &gt; 2.4 mmol/L) in the medical history, or higher than 800 pg/mL and parathyroidectomy is contraindicated. 4.
