	<brief_title>Treatment of Actinic Keratoses of the Face With Imiquimod 3.75% Cream Followed by Photodynamic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses are common skin lesions associated with solar ultraviolet radiation exposure. Some actinic keratoses may develop into skin cancers. Imiquimod 3.75% cream is an approved treatment for actinic keratoses that utilizes a regimen of application to the entire face or balding scalp of up to 2 packets of cream daily for two 2-week cycles, separated by a 2-week no treatment interval. Photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 20% topical solution is also an approved treatment for actinic keratoses. ALA is applied to actinic keratoses, and after an incubation period, is excited with light. Although approved as a lesion-directed treatment for actinic keratoses, treatment of a field (e.g. face) with photodynamic therapy is commonly performed. Treatment with photodynamic therapy followed by imiquimod 5% cream has been reported in patients with actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma and Bowen's disease, and treatment with imiquimod 5% cream followed by photodynamic therapy in patients with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. There are, however, no prior studies on the safety and/or efficacy of using topical imiquimod 3.75% in conjunction with photodynamic therapy in the treatment of actinic keratoses. This study will use an open-label parallel cohort design in which all patients will received treatment with imiquimod 3.75% cream, and subsequently will be randomized to either photodynamic therapy or observation.</detailed_description>
