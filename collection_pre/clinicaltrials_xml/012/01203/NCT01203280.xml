	<brief_summary>Most boxing injuries occurs over head and neck which leads to potentially acute or chronic head and neck injuries. Patients with whiplash injury has been reported, reflected by increased body sway and reduced ability to overcome challenging balance tasks. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the fitness and balance outcomes between the boxers and the control group, and boxers undergoing posterior-neck icing effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Icing Effects on Neck Functions of the Boxers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries are common in boxing, occurring most often to the head, neck, face, and hands. Traumatic minor cervical strains are common place in high-impact sports and premature degenerative changes have been documented in sports people exposed to recurrent impact trauma or repetitive forces. Whiplash injury may result in extensive trauma to muscles and ligamentous structures within the cervical spine . Many of these structures, particularly the muscles, contain mechanoreceptors that play a key role in position sense. Studies have shown that head and neck position sense may become impaired following whiplash injury. Subsequently, poor movement patterns, together with the perpetuation of pain and other symptoms may develop. Posture control is achieved by integration of sensory inputs emanating from somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems. Patients with whiplash injury has been reported, reflected by increased body sway and reduced ability to overcome challenging balance tasks. In this study we have attempted to evaluate the influence of boxing on balance performances, isometric strength and flexibility; furthermore, evaluate the therapeutic effect of ice massage on boxers.</detailed_description>
