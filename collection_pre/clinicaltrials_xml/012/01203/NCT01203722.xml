	<brief_summary>If transplantation using mismatched unrelated donors or non-first-degree relatives could be performed with an acceptable toxicity profile, an important unmet need would be served. Towards this goal, the current study extends our platform of nonmyeloablative, partially HLA-mismatched BMT to the use of such donors, investigating up to several postgrafting immunosuppression regimens that incorporate high-dose Cy. Of central interest is the incorporation of sirolimus into this postgrafting immunosuppression regimen. The primary goal is to identify a transplant regimen associated with acceptable rates of severe acute GVHD and NRM by Day 100.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient 1. Patient age 0.575 years 2. Absence of a suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donor who is molecularly matched at HLAA, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. 3. Absence of a suitable partially HLAmismatched (haploidentical), firstdegree related donor. 4. Eligible diagnoses: 1. Relapsed or refractory acute leukemia in second or subsequent remission, with remission defined as &lt;5% bone marrow blasts morphologically 2. Poorrisk acute leukemia in first remission, with remission defined as &lt;5% bone marrow blasts morphologically: AML with at least one of the following: AML arising from MDS or a myeloproliferative disorder, or secondary AML Presence of Flt3 internal tandem duplications Poorrisk cytogenetics: Complex karyotype [&gt; 3 abnormalities], inv(3), t(3;3), t(6;9), MLL rearrangement with the exception of t(9;11), or abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7 Primary refractory disease ALL (leukemia and/or lymphoma) with at least one of the following: Adverse cytogenetics such as t(9;22), t(1;19), t(4;11), or MLL rearrangement Clear evidence of hypodiploidy Primary refractory disease Biphenotypic leukemia 3. MDS with at least one of the following poorrisk features: Poorrisk cytogenetics (7/7q minus or complex cytogenetics) IPSS score of INT2 or greater Treatmentrelated MDS MDS diagnosed before age 21 years Progression on or lack of response to standard DNAmethyltransferase inhibitor therapy Lifethreatening cytopenias, including those generally requiring greater than weekly transfusions 4. Interferon or imatinibrefractory CML in first chronic phase, or nonblast crisis CML beyond first chronic phase. 5. Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative disease. 6. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. 7. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. 8. Lowgrade nonHodgkin lymphoma (including SLL and CLL) or plasma cell neoplasm that has progressed after at least two prior therapies (excluding single agent rituximab and single agent steroids), or in the case of lymphoma undergone histologic conversion 9. Poorrisk CLL or SLL 10. Aggressive nonHodgkin lymphoma as follows, provided there is stable disease or better to last therapy: NK or NKT cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma, or subcutaneous panniculitic Tcell lymphoma Hodgkin or aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma that has failed at least one multiagent regimen, and the patient is either ineligible for autologous BMT or autologous BMT is not recommended. Eligible subtypes of aggressive nonHodgkin lymphoma include: mantle cell lymphoma follicular grade 3 lymphoma diffuse large Bcell lymphoma or its subtypes, excluding primary CNS lymphoma primary mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma large Bcell lymphoma, unspecified anaplastic large cell lymphoma, excluding skinonly disease peripheral Tcell lymphoma, including angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma Burkitt's lymphoma or atypical Burkitt's lymphoma (highgrade Bcell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large Bcell lymphoma and Burkitt's), in complete remission 5. Patients with CLL, SLL, or prolymphocytic leukemia must have &lt; 20% bone marrow involvement by malignancy (to lower risk of graft rejection). 6. One of the following, in order to lower risk of graft rejection: Cytotoxic chemotherapy, an adequate course of 5azacitidine or decitabine, or alemtuzumab within 3 months prior to start of conditioning; or Previous BMT within 6 months prior to start of conditioning. NOTE:Patients who have received treatment outside of these windows may be eligible if it is deemed sufficient to reduce graft rejection risk; this will be decided on a casebycase basis by the PI or coPI. 7. Any previous BMT must have occurred at least 3 months prior to start of conditioning. 8. Adequate endorgan function. 9. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 or Karnofsky or Lansky score &gt; 60 Patient 1. Not pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. HIV positive. 3. No uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. 4. No previous allogeneic BMT (syngeneic BMT permissible). 5. Active extramedullary leukemia or known active CNS involvement by malignancy. Such disease treated into remission is permitted. Donor 1. Potential donors consist of: Unrelated donors Seconddegree relatives First cousins 2. The donor and recipient must be identical at at least 5 HLA alleles based on high resolution typing of HLAA, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1, with at least one allele matched for a HLA class I gene (HLAA, B, or Cw) and at least one allele matched for a class II gene (HLADRB1 or DQB1). 3. Meets institutional selection criteria and medically fit to donate. 4. Lack of recipient antidonor HLA antibody. Note: In some instances, low level, noncytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a casebycase basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors. Pheresis to reduce antiHLA antibodies is permissible; however eligibility to proceed with the transplant regimen would be contingent upon the result. Donor 1. Donor must not be HLA identical to the recipient. 2. Has not donated blood products to recipient.</criteria>
