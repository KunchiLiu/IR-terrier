	<brief_summary>This is a phase II study of allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) followed reduced toxicity conditioning with once daily intravenous Busulfex and fludarabine in patients with relapsed/chemotherapy refractory Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Once Daily Targeted Intravenous (IV) Busulfex as Part of Reduced-toxicity Conditioning for Patients With Refractory Lymphomas Undergoing Allogeneic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study hopes to learn if giving intravenous (IV) busulfan with fludarabine before (as a conditioning regimen) allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPC) is safe and helps patients with Non—Hodgkin´s Lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin´s Lymphoma (HL). An HPC transplant takes cells from a donor´s bone marrow and, after chemotherapy treatment with a conditioning regimen, infuses the donor´s cells into the patient´s body. Busulfan is a strong drug that suppresses the immune system and fludarabine is a chemotherapy (cancer fighting) drug. These drugs can stop the growth of cancer cells by breaking the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or genetic material which is necessary for the growth of both healthy and cancer cells. The use of IV busulfan with fludarabine as a conditioning regimen prior to HPC transplant is investigational (not approved by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). Busulfan is only given once daily by IV in this study, which is also not approved by the FDA. Patients in this study will go through standard procedures for their disease like medical history, physical exam, blood tests, Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram, bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and lung functions test. Patients will be asked to donate additional blood and bone marrow for this study and for potential future research on their blood related to this study. Because of the normal procedures for HPC transplants patients in this study will be hospitalized for 4 to 6 weeks or longer and will make frequent trips to the clinic to visit the study doctor for supervision for at least one year. Each patient will also have to have a central venous catheter inserted into a large vein above the heart. This is used to give the drugs and to take blood samples. Participation in this study will last about two years. The study expects to enroll 32 patients and will open to at least two collaborating institutions in the future. Upon initial Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval enrollment will only occur at West Virginia University (WVU). The IRB will be notified before enrollment occurs at other institutions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients aged 1870 years of age are eligible. 2. Eligible histologies include: Bcell, Tcell or NKcell NHL refractory to frontline or salvage therapy defined as failure to achieve complete or partial remission according to standard criteria. Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma relapsing within 12 months of finishing a rituximab containing first line chemotherapy regimen (regardless of response to salvage chemotherapy)or with evidence of cmyc. Primary refractory NHL (regardless of response to salvage chemotherapy). Hodgkin lymphoma which is chemorefractory after at least two prior therapies. Hodgkin and NHL in an untreated relapse. Transformed NHL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing Richter's transformation (regardless of response to last chemotherapy). Patients with chemosensitive relapsed NHLs or Hodgkin lymphoma, but considered ineligible for curative therapy with autologous transplantation, because of (a) inability to collect stem cells, (b) prior autografting, (c) presence of myelodysplasia or (d) histology not considered curable with autografting in opinion of treating physician will be eligible. 3. All patients must have at least one suitable HLAmatched sibling or volunteer unrelated donor available (according to institutional guidelines). HLA typing should be performed at least at serological level for HLAA, B, and C and at allele level for HLADRB1. One antigen or allele level mismatch will be permitted between the donor and the recipient; however each donor/recipient pair must match at HLADRB1 at allele level. 4. Patient must be able to provide informed consent. 5. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%. No uncontrolled arrhythmias or uncontrolled New York Heart Association class IIIIV heart failure. 6. Bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 x normal; and absence of hepatic cirrhosis. 7. Adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine clearance of ≥ 40% of normal calculated by CockcroftGault equation. 8. DLCO (diffusion capacity; corrected for hemoglobin) or forced expiratory volume (FEV1) ≥ 50% of predicted. 9. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70. 10. A negative pregnancy test will be required for all women of child bearing potential. Breast feeding is not permitted. 1. Patients eligible for potentially curative therapy with autologous transplantation. 2. Patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma. 3. Patients with positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. 4. Clinical evidence of uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection at the time of transplant conditioning. 5. Prior allogeneic transplantation.</criteria>
