	<brief_summary>This study is an expanded Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trial base on the safety data obtained from the phase 1 clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of 60mcg/30mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in people aged 16 and older who failed to respond to routine administration of 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and to explore the optimizing immunizing dose and immune procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Immunogenicity and Safety of 60mcg/30mcg Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines in People Who Failed to Respond to Routine Administration of Hepatitis B Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most effective method to prevent hepatitis B virus infection is to receive the vaccination of hepatitis b vaccine to get the protective antibody anti-HBs. Both the blood-derived hepatitis B vaccine and the recombinant hepatitis B vaccines have been proved to be effective and safe since the application in 1981 and 1989 respectively. Previous passive or active immunization testes indicated that the lowest effective level of anti-HBs for prevention of infection is 10mIU/ml. However there are still some recipients can't generate expected level of anti-HBs after the vaccinations. In adults, there are 5% to 10% recipients will failed to respond to routine administration of 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines, and those nonresponders are susceptible population even after the vaccinations. In this study, a recipient whose peak period (1 month after vaccination) levels of anti-HBs is lower than 10mIU/ml after finishing the vaccinations of 3 dose 10mcg hepatitis b vaccines is called nonresponders. Nowadays, a lot tests are conducted on nonresponders to help them generate the protective antibody anti-HBs, including increase the antigen dosage of vaccines, increase the injections of vaccines, change the route of inoculation and the use of adjuvant. Unfortunately, these previous studies can not get coincident and persuasive outcomes due to the small sample size and poor representativeness. This study is plan to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of 60mcg/30mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in people aged 16 and older who failed to respond to routine administration of 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and to provide the scientific evidences for the revaccination strategy in China.</detailed_description>
