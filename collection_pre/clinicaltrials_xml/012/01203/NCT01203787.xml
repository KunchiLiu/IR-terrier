	<brief_summary>Open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sorafenib dose ramp-up (starting at a lower dose and then gradually increasing the dose) versus standard Sorafenib dosing in subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Dose Ramp-Up in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study that investigates the impact of a dose ramp-up strategy for sorafenib in patients with HCC. Clinical trial and post-marketing data suggest that sorafenib dose reductions and discontinuations due to adverse events are common and limit the drug's effectiveness. It is our hypothesis that a dose escalation strategy for sorafenib will improve the tolerability and allow a greater percentage of patients to remain on drug. The primary end-point of the study is the total accumulated and median daily dose of sorafenib delivered at month 2 and 4.</detailed_description>

Men should use adequate birth control for at least three months after the last administration of sorafenib. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. INR&lt; 2.3.

For patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation of sorafenib and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of care, until INR is stable.
