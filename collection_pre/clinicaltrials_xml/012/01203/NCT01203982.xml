	<brief_title>Effect of Intensive Lipid Lowering Treatment Compared to Moderate Lipid Lowering Treatment on Carotid Intima-media Thickness (CIMT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to measure the effect of moderate (5mg) and intensive (40mg) lipid-lowering treatment with rosuvastatin on the carotid intima-media thickness as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk and to obtain whether CIMT correlated with the plaque components in coronary arteries evaluated with Intravascular Ultrasound Virtual Histology (IVUS-VH).</detailed_description>
