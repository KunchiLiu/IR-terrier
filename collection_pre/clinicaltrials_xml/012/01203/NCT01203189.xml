	<brief_title>Seborrheic Dermatitis: Ketoconazole 2% Foam Versus Ketoconazole 2% Shampoo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A wide variety of topical vehicles are available for medications that treat scalp disorders. Proper vehicle selection is important when managing scalp conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, because the efficacy of these treatments depends largely on compliance and the amount of active ingredient delivered to the scalp. It is therefore important to prescribe vehicles that are easy to apply and cause the least amount of disruption to the patients' pre-existing hair care practices. One of the most common rate limiting hair care practices among different cultures is wash frequency. Literature shows African American women are more likely to wash their hair less than once weekly versus Caucasian women. We hypothesize certain vehicles, such as foam preparations which do not require hair washing, will be more efficacious in African American women with seborrheic dermatitis than shampoo preparations.</detailed_description>
