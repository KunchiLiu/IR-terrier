	<brief_summary>This study is carried out to see how Caucasian patients with lung cancer which has EGFR mutation will respond to gefitinib (IRESSA™) as a first line treatment. Safety data will also be collected and analysed to confirm that treatment with gefitinib is safe and well tolerated.</brief_summary>
