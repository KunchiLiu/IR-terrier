	<brief_summary>This investigation is designed with the hypothesis that combined PV Antral Isolation and Ablation of Complex Fractionated Electrograms (PVI+CFE) approach will offer a higher success rate compared to the Wide Circumferential Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation (PVI) approach and to the Combined PV Antral Isolation and Empiric Linear Ablation (PVI+Lines) approach.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients age is18 years or greater; Patients undergoing a firsttime ablation procedure for AF; Patients with persistent AF; Persistent AF will be defined as a sustained episode lasting &gt; 7 days and less than 3 years. Patients with symptomatic AF that is refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medication; At least one episode of persistent AF must have been documented by ECG, holter, loop recorder, telemetry, trans telephonic monitoring (TTM), or implantable device within last 2 years of enrollment in this investigation; Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in this investigation; and Patients must be willing and able to comply with all periablation and followup requirements. Patients with paroxysmal AF; Patients with longstanding persistent AF; Patients for whom cardioversion or sinus rhythm will never be attempted/pursued; Patients with AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause; Patients with contraindications to systemic anticoagulation with heparin or coumadin or a direct thrombin inhibitor; Patients with left atrial size â‰¥ 60 mm (2D echocardiography, parasternal long axis view); and Patients who are pregnant.</criteria>
