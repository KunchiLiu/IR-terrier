	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Latinos With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the General Medical Sector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project seeks to lay the foundation for an effectiveness trial that will lead to the advancement of CBT based treatments for GAD among Spanish-speaking Latinos, particularly Puerto Ricans. This area of research is important in light of the limited treatment options currently available for Spanish-speakers with GAD and the long-term negative consequences of this condition. Participants in this study are recruited in general health settings. Patients meeting criteria for enrollment will be randomly assigned to receive either cognitive behavior based therapy or treatment as usual. Assessments for all participants will be collected at baseline, post-treatment, and at two months follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
