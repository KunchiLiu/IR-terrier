	<brief_summary>In this trial dose reduced conditioning is compared to standard conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from related or unrelated donors in patients with MDS or secondary AML. Conditioning is the very high dose chemotherapy treatment that is given in the days before the stem cell transplant. The hypothesis is that a dose reduced conditioning will reduce the non-relapse mortality from 40% to 20% at one year after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
