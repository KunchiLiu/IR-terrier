	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy men or women aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive). Women must be of nonchildbearing potential or must have been stable on a highly effective contraceptive method for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and be willing to continue on the chosen contraceptive method, with additional use of a condom by male partners, until 3 months after last dose. Female subjects should have a negative pregnancy test at Visit 2 and date of last menstruation consistent of nonpregnancy Ability to metabolise AZD8848 (an in vitro screening assay will determine metabolic activity in a blood sample taken at Visit 1 using a predefined limit) Any clinically significant disease or disorder Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination Structural abnormalities of the nose or nasal disorder symptomatic enough to cause significant nasal obstruction Ongoing pregnancy or lactation Abnormal immune function</criteria>
