	<brief_summary>The prevalence of endometrial polyp is 24% in the general population but is much higher in postmenopausal women. The incidence of malignant or pre-malignant findings in endometrial polyps ranges from 2 to 10% in menopausal women. Removal of endometrial polyps in postmenopausal symptomatic women is the standard of care, same goes for asymptomatic women with risk factors for endometrial malignancy, however treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial polyp but no risk factors is disputable.

	<brief_title>Incidence of Malignant and Premalignant Endometrial Polyp in Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial polyp is a common finding in postmenopausal women. The prevalence of endometrial polyps is 24% in the general population, but is much higher in postmenopausal in compare to premenopausal women. The incidence of malignant or pre-malignant findings in endometrial polyps ranges from 0.5 to 4.8% in the general population and from 2 to 10% in menopausal women. There is an increased risk for malignant or pre-malignant polyp in postmenopausal women and it correlates with age. Removal of endometrial polyps in postmenopausal symptomatic (bleeding, pain, vaginal discharge) women is the standard of care, same goes for asymptomatic women with risk factors (e.g., hypertension, history of breast, ovary, endometrial or colon cancer, Tamoxifen or estrogen treatment, over-weight, no ovulation, previous endometrial hyperplasia) due to a relatively high risk for malignancy. However treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women endometrial polyp but no risk factors is disputable. Article published in the recent years introduced a similar rate of involvement of malignant and pre-malignant changes in polyps removed from post-menopausal women, symptomatic and asymptomatic (3.2% versus 3.9%, respectively). In light of ambiguity in literature regarding the rate of malignant and pre-malignant findings in polyps in asymptomatic post-menopausal women, and in light of the fact that all major studies in this field were made retrospectively, we are asking to conduct a prospective study in order to evaluate and compare the incidence of malignant and pre-malignant changes in symptomatic and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial polyp</detailed_description>
