	<criteria>Males and females of nonchildbearing potential ≥50 years of age (at the time of signing the informed consent document) with documented IPF Diagnosis of IPF based on current ATS/ERS guidelines Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT and/or UIP pattern on histopathology (ie surgical lung biopsy), and Exclusion of known causes of interstitial lung disease (such as environmental exposure, connective tissue disease and drug toxicity), Or UIP pattern on surgical lung biopsy required if HRCT is inconsistent with UIP FVC : &lt; 50% predicted &gt;90% predicted DLco:&lt; 25% predicted &gt;90% predicted Saturated oxygen (SpO2) of &lt;92% (room air [sea level] at rest). SpO2 of &lt; 88% (room air [≥ 5,000 feet above sea level (1524 meters]) at rest) Use of any cytotoxic/immunosuppressive agent (other than prednisone ≤ 12.5 mg/day or equivalent) including, but not limited to, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporine within 4 weeks of screening Use of any cytokine modulators: Use of any biologic agent (such as etanercept, adalimumab, efalizumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab) within 12 weeks or five halflives of screening, and in the case of rituximab, use within 24 weeks of screening or no recovery of CD 19positive B lymphocytes if the last dose of rituximab has been more than 24 weeks prior to screening Alefacept within 24 months of randomization Use of any therapy targeted to treat IPF (including but not limited to dpenicillamine, endothelium receptor antagonist [eg bosentan, ambrisentan], interferon gamma1B, pirfenidone) within 4 weeks of screening Use of nacetylcysteine (NAC) for IPF (≥1800 mg/day) within 4 weeks of screening Use of any investigational drug within one month of screening, or 5 PD/PK half lives, if known (whichever is longer) Current smoker</criteria>
