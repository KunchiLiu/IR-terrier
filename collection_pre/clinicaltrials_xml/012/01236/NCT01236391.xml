	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in participants with relapsed or refractory MCL. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of a fixed daily dosing regimen (560 mg daily) of PCI-32765 in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of PCI-32765 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, monotherapy study in subjects with histologically documented MCL who have relapsed after ≥ 1 (but not &gt; 5) prior treatment regimens. All subjects meeting eligibility criteria will receive PCI-32765 capsules at a dosage of 560 mg/day once daily for a 28-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or enrollment in a long-term extension study, whichever occurs earlier.</detailed_description>
