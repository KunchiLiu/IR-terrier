	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the relationship between the dimensions of the aorta (the large artery taking off the heart) and blood pressure during cardiac surgery. Measurements of the aorta are obtained by an ultrasound-based imaging technique called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which is routinely performed during cardiac surgery. TEE is an instrument used to monitor the heart and is standard of practice at Weill Cornell Medical College.</detailed_description>
