	<brief_title>Computer-Guided Glucose Management Systems in Treating Patients With Hyperglycemia Who Have Undergone Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the ability of computer-guided glucose management system (CGGMS) algorithms to control glucose within or close to current University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) intensive care unit (ICU) targets (100 to 140 mg/dl) in non-critically ill bone marrow transplant (BMT) adult (age &gt;= 18 years) patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive blood glucose management with intravenous (IV) insulin using Glucommander.</detailed_description>
