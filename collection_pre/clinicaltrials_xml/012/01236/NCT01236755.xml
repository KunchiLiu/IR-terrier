	<brief_title>Discontinuation of Lens Wear in New Ortho-k Children (DOEE2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children wearing ortho-k have been shown to have slower rate of myopic progression than those wearing single-vision spectacles (Cho et al. 2005) or soft lenses (Walline et al. 2009). Younger myopic children (aged 6-10 years old) may have the faster increase in myopia than old myopic children (aged 11-15 years old), i.e. the rate of myopic progression may be different in different age groups and in children with different refractive status (Edwards 1999; Fan et al. 2004; Cheng et al. 2007). Although the refractive correction with ortho-k has been well documented, it is unknown whether the efficiency and reversibility of ortho-k for myopic reduction as well as myopic control are similar in children of different age and refractive groups. In this 14-month study, the eyeball length in 45 younger (6-10 years old) and 45 older (11-15 years old) myopic children before and after ortho-k will be evaluated. Eyeball elongation will be determined for the first 7 months when single-vision glasses will be prescribed (Phase I) and the next 7 months when ortho-k will be prescribed (Phase I). Rate of myopic progression will be determined and compared between the two groups of children in the two phases.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age: between 6 to 15 years old Myopia: between 1.50D and 4.50D in at least one eye Spherical equivalent (SE): between 1.00D to 4.50D in both eyes Astigmatism: ≤ 3.00D of axes 180 +/ 30 or ≤ 1.00D of other axes; and the amount is less than refractive sphere Anisometropia: ≤ 1.50D in both refractive sphere, refractive cylinder and SE Best corrected monocular visual acuity: equal to or better than 0.10 in logMAR scale in both eyes Willingness to wear contact lenses or spectacles on a daily basis Can obtain good orthok results with the study lenses Availability for followup for at least 14 months Strabismus at distance or near Contraindication for contact lens wear and orthok (e.g. limbus to limbus corneal cylinder and dislocated corneal apex Systemic or ocular conditions which may affect contact lens wear (e.g. allergy and medication) Systemic or ocular conditions which may affect refractive development (e.g. Down syndrome, ptosis) Prior experience with the use of rigid lenses (including orthok) Prior experience with myopia control treatment (e.g. refractive therapy or progressive spectacles) Noncompliance to the follow up schedule Noncompliance to the use of the prescribed optical correction Poor ocular response to orthok lens wear Significant residual refractive error after orthok treatment resulting in poor unaided vision (worse than 0.18 in logMAR scale)</criteria>
