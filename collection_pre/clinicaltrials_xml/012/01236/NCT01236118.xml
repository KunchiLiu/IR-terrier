	<criteria>Participants who have received 7 injections of LY2439821 subcutaneously in the 30, 80, or 180mg dose cohorts, or 11 injections in the 240mg loading dose/120mg onceaweek maintenance dose group, and completed the followup period (14 weeks) in Study I1FJERHAL ((NCT01253265). Ambulatory male or female participants. Male participants: Agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study including barrier contraceptives or a monogamous relationship with a partner who is not child bearing. Female participants: Are women who test negative for pregnancy at the time of entry based on a pregnancy test and are not breast feeding. Women of child bearing potential must agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study. Participants who have been treated with methotrexate (MTX) throughout Study I1FJERHAL (NCT01253265). Bucillamine, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine are allowed to be administered in addition to MTX. In such a case, the participant needs to have been on a stable dose of the drug(s) throughout Study I1FJERHAL (NCT01253265) and I1FJERHAM. Participants who have given written informed consent approved by the Sponsor and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) governing the investigational site. Participants who have had, during Study I1FJERHAL (NCT01253265), any safety event including having a recent, ongoing, or serious infection, a serious drug reaction, or any adverse event (AE) that caused discontinuation from treatment , that in the opinion of the investigator poses an unacceptable risk to participation in this study. Participants who have any of the following abnormalities of clinical laboratory test results by Week 26 of Study I1FJERHAL (NCT01253265): Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/microliters (μL); Lymphocyte count &lt;500 cells/μL; or White Blood Cells (WBC) count &lt;2000 cells/μL</criteria>
