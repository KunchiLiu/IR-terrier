Patients must have a Karnofsky status 50 or above. Operable patients are not excluded. Patients with tumors of grade greater than T1. Porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrin or porphyrinlike compounds. WBC &lt;2,000; platelet count &lt;50,000, prothrombin time 1.5 times above the upper normal limit. Patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function (total serum bilirubin &gt;3.0 mg/d, serum creatinine &gt;3 mg%, alkaline phosphatase (hepatic) or SGOT &gt;3 times the upper normal limit. Patients on concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be excluded as well as those having received prior treatment for the esophageal cancer within 4 weeks of enrollment. If the patient has cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer they must be deemed disease free by their treating physician.</criteria>
