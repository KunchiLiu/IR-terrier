	<brief_summary>Voclosporin is an investigational medication previously studied to prevent acute rejection in patients who receive a kidney transplant. This study is a compassionate release program where subjects previously participating in the study entitled A Phase 2B, Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label, Concentration Controlled, Safety Study of ISA247 and Tacrolimus (Prograf®) in denovo Renal Transplant Patients (ISA05-01)" may be eligible to continue to receive voclosporin despite the Phase 2B study being terminated by the sponsor. Under the compassionate release program, subjects previously taking voclosporin may continue to receive the study medication until the drug is FDA-approved and commercially available in the United States.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Voclosporin is an investigational medication previously studied to prevent acute rejection in patients who receive a kidney transplant. This study is a compassionate release program where subjects previously participating in the study entitled A Phase 2B, Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label, Concentration Controlled, Safety Study of ISA247 and Tacrolimus (Prograf®) in denovo Renal Transplant Patients (ISA05-01)" may be eligible to continue to receive voclosporin despite the Phase 2B study being terminated by the sponsor. Under the compassionate release program, subjects previously taking voclosporin may continue to receive the study medication until the drug is FDA-approved and commercially available in the United States. Subjects will receive voclosporin and will be followed in an outpatient setting. After their initial visit, patients will return for follow-up at least every 3 months (through month 24) and then every 6 months (beginning at month 24). Safety and efficacy measurements will be taken at appropriate time points as outlined in the table below. Trough voclosporin measurements will be collected at least every 3 months (through month 24) and then every 6 months (beginning at month 24) or more frequently at clinic visits as appropriate (as indicated by clinical events (such as rejection, infection, adverse event) or concomitant administration of an interacting medication. Patient and graft survival data will be collected on an annual basis for safety reporting.</detailed_description>
