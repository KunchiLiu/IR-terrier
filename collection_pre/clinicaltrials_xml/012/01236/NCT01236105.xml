	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of activated charcoal and dosing time on the absorption of LY2624803 in healthy subjects. In this crossover study, there are three treatments with a washout period of at least 7 days in between treatments. Each subject will participate in all three treatments with random assignment to the treatment sequence.</brief_summary>

Have given written informed consent approved by Lilly and the ethical review board governing the site. Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 90 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or device or offlabel use of a drug or device (other than the study drug used in this study), or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. Have known allergies to LY2624803 or related compounds. Are persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating LY2624803. Have an abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study. Have an abnormal blood pressure as determined by the investigator. Have a history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal (except appendectomy), endocrine, hematological, dermatological, venereal, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs, of constituting a risk when taking the study medication, or of interfering with the interpretation of data.

A history of a single febrile convulsion is acceptable. Show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease.

Have donated blood of more than 500 milliliters (mL) within the last 3 months prior to screening. Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 28 units per week (males) and 21 units per week (females), and are subjects unwilling to stop alcohol consumption from 48 hours prior to admission until discharge from the unit for each treatment period, and to limit alcohol intake to a maximum of 2 units/day between treatment periods.
