	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the probable benefit of CryoValve SG Aortic Human Heart Valve used in pediatric patients as an aortic valve replacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CryoValve® SG Aortic Human Heart Valve Combination Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CryoValve SG aortic human heart valve is recovered from deceased human donors, treated with the SynerGraft® (SG) process,which is designed to reduce the donor cells present on the graft. The valve is then cryopreserved for storage until use. Removing cells from the heart valve has been shown to reduce a component of the immune response after implant compared to a standard allograft valve. However, it is not known how this affects the long-term durability of the valve.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients implanted with a CryoValve SGAV as an aortic valve replacement. Patients who were ≤ 21 years of age at the time of implant. Patients in whom the CryoValve SGAV was used as a patch or a nonvalved conduit. Patients implanted with a CryoValve SGAV as a pulmonary valve replacement. Patients that were ≥ 22 years of age at the time of implant.</criteria>
