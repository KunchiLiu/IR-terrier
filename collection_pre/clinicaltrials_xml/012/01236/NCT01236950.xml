	<brief_summary>The use of mouthrinses may be of relevance as a complement to daily dental hygiene procedures, especially for patients who do not comply with a proper mechanical removal of dental plaque. Essential oils and delmopinol mouthrinses are effective to reduce dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis. Also an effect on dental bacteria can be found. The study hypothesis states that there are no differences between the mouthrinses on the reduction of gingivitis and dental plaque accumulation as well on the bacterial counts of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.</brief_summary>
