	<brief_summary>With the aging of the Canadian population, older workers are accounting for more and more of the working-age population. Despite recent interest in cognitive training, there are currently no validated programs that specifically target individuals in the work force. The investigators will conduct a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the previously developed Memory at Work program. The investigators will recruit 60 individuals and randomly assign them to the active intervention or a control intervention. The investigators will examine outcomes related to knowledge, behavioral change, self-efficacy, objective memory, and workplace productivity. The investigators expect larger improvements on these measures in the active relative to the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Memory at Work Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pre-test/post-test randomized controlled trial. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will undergo baseline testing that involves completing questionnaires and objective cognitive tests. Participants will then be randomly assigned (by coin toss) to the intervention or control group. After participating in their respective workshops, both groups will undergo immediate post-testing and 1-month follow-up post testing. After the final assessment, the control group will be given the opportunity to participate in the intervention workshop. No further testing of this group will occur, as there will no longer be a comparable control group.</detailed_description>
