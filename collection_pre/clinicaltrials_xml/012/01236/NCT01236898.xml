	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate pharmacokinetics and safety of N-acetylneuraminic acid in patients with Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) - hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM). Dosages are 800mg single and three times a day and 800mg 3 times a day for 5 consecutive days. N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid in serum and urine are measured before and after oral administration of N-acetylneuraminic acid.</brief_summary>
