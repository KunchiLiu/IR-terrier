	<brief_summary>Knee replacement is an effective treatment in late-stage osteoarthritis. It reduces pain and improves quality of life. There is, however, limited data concerning its results in older people and on its effect on how patients survive in regular activities of daily living (ADL), such as bathing and shopping. In this study, the results of knee replacement are evaluated from the point of view of disability in everyday activities and self-rated health. Moreover, association with ADL performance and clinical knee scores and severity of osteoarthritis are assessed.</brief_summary>
