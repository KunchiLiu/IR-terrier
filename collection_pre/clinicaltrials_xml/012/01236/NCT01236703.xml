	<brief_summary>CRP and PCT are not valid parameters of early infection in particularly postoperative patients. (Sanders et al., A&amp;A, June 2006, Vol.102; Katja et al., Shock, February 2001, Vol 15.2) Better detection systems for SIRS and sepsis are urgently required. ICIS® (Sysmex intensive care infection score) and ICPS® (Sysmex intensive care prognostic score) are two new score-systems depending on detectable cellular response of the innate immune system in human peripheral blood. The purpose of this observational study is to determine if these scores are superior in early differentiation between non-infectious SIRS and infectious SIRS (sepsis) in postoperative patients. Furthermore, the applicability of the scores for triggering start and ending of anti-infective therapy will be examined.</brief_summary>
