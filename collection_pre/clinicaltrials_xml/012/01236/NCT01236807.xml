	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if MR Perfusion Imaging is non-inferior to coronary angiography with measurement of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) in guiding management of patients with stable chest pain. - All patients will undergo an MR Perfusion Imaging test. - Further management will be guided by the result of the cardiac MRI in half of the patients (chosen by random). - The other half will undergo coronary angiography with measurement of FFR. The result of this test alone will guide their further management. The result of the initial MR Perfusion test will not be available to the treating doctors of this group. - All patients will receive optimal medical therapy (OMT) - All patients will undergo follow-up to find out if they have any relevant heart related events.</brief_summary>
