	<brief_summary>This trial is to study the efficacy of nab-PC vs. GC and evaluate toxicity of nab-PC in advanced squamous cell cancer of lung. The correlation between the efficacy of nab-PC and some biomarkers is also to be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nab-Paclitaxel Treatment in Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Albumin-bound paclitaxel(nab-P) utilizes the albumin binding proteins,such as (gp60)/caveolin-1 (CAV1) and SPARC(secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), achieving high intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation. It is reported that CAV1 is overexpressed in squamous cell cancer(SQC), so it is possible that nab-PC is more highly active than GC in SQC of lung.</detailed_description>
