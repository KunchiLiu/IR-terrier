	<brief_summary>Sirolimus, 1 mg, white, triangular tablets (RapamuneÂ®) was approved on 03 April 2007 in China for prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplantation. A pharmacokinetic (PK) study to be conducted in renal allograft recipients was requested by State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) to provide further guidance for clinical use. To minimize risk to patients, this study is designed to collect blood PK samples from renal allograft recipients who are currently under sirolimus (1 mg tablets) treatment with or without concomitant medication(s). PK samples will be collected from these patients to characterize the steady state PK of sirolimus during sirolimus maintenance therapy. This study will not involve any changes to the established treatment regimen for the patients who enroll in the study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, above 18 years of age and Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.0 to 25.0 kg/m2, inclusive; Subjects must have received a primary or secondary renal allograft for at least 2 months prior to Screening; Subjects must be currently taking Rapamune tablets for prophylaxis of renal rejection. The dosages of any medications must be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to screening and continue with no change until completion of the last PK sample collection. Acute rejection or vascular rejection episode in the 4 weeks prior to Screening; or patients dependent on dialysis; or inadequate renal function (in the opinion of the investigator); Recipients of multiple organ transplants (i.e., prior or concurrent transplantation of any organs other than renal transplant); Current use of strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks prior to collection of the first PK sample and until collection of the final PK sample; Any clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality, in the judgment of the investigator.</criteria>
