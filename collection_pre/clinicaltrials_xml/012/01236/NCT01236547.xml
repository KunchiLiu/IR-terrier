	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and paclitaxel with or without pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and paclitaxel are more effective when given with pazopanib hydrochloride in treating thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and Paclitaxel With or Without Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety of IMRT, paclitaxel, and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) suspension. (Run-in component) II. To evaluate and compare overall survival at 1 year from study registration. (Phase II component) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate local-regional control at 6 and 12 months. (Phase II component) II. To evaluate the rate of grade 4 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 [CTCAE, v. 4.0]) hemorrhage, grade 4 febrile neutropenia, or any grade 5 adverse event assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the induction or concurrent treatment components of the protocol regimen. (Phase II component) III. To evaluate the rates of other adverse events (CTCAE, v. 4.0) assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the induction or concurrent treatment components of the protocol regimen. (Phase II component) IV. To evaluate the rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxicity during the induction or concurrent treatment components of the protocol regimen. (Phase II component) V. To evaluate response (as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) of the primary site following the treatment component in subjects with measurable disease prior to chemoradiation. (Phase II component) OUTLINE: RUN-IN COMPONENT: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 2-3 weeks. Patients then receive concurrent paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD for 6-7 weeks (or until radiation treatment is completed) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 5 days per week for 6.5 weeks (total of 66 Gy in 33 fractions). Beginning 25-31 days after the completion of IMRT, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses (for patients with no measurable disease) or continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (for patients with measurable disease). RANDOMIZED PHASE II COMPONENT: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD for 2-3 weeks. Patients then receive concurrent paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD for 6-7 weeks (or until radiation treatment is completed) and IMRT 5 days per week for 6.5 weeks (total of 66 Gy in 33 fractions). Beginning 25-31 days after the completion of IMRT, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses (for patients with no measurable disease) or continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (for patients with measurable disease). ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and placebo PO QD for 2-3 weeks. Patients then receive concurrent paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and placebo PO QD for 6-7 weeks (or until radiation treatment is completed) and IMRT 5 days per week for 6.5 weeks (total of 66 Gy in 33 fractions). Beginning 25-31 days after the completion of IMRT, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly and placebo PO QD. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses (for patients with no measurable disease) or continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (for patients with measurable disease). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer (a diagnosis that is noted to be "consistent with anaplastic thyroid cancer" with the presence of a thyroid mass is acceptable) Note: tissue collection for central review is mandatory, but central review is not required for eligibility; treatment will be started prior to central review If there was a total or partial thyroidectomy completed within 3 months of enrollment, the surgical specimen must show the area of anaplastic thyroid cancer to be at least 1 cm in greatest dimension The following minimum diagnostic workup is required: History/physical examination within 2 weeks prior to registration Imaging of neck and brain (computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and chest/abdominal imaging (chest xray or chest CT scan, or full body positron emission tomography [PET]/CT are acceptable) within 4 weeks prior to registration Note: the CT scan of the neck must be done with contrast or if an MRI is done, with gadolinium; therefore, the CT portion of a full body PET/CT has to be a high resolution CT to be acceptable for eligibility Abdominal imaging must cover the liver and adrenal glands; therefore, separate imaging is not required if these areas are covered by a chest CT scan Electrocardiogram within 10 days prior to registration Zubrod performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 cells/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3 Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 9.0 g/dL (Note: the use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb &gt;= 9.0 g/dL is acceptable) Total bilirubin &lt;
