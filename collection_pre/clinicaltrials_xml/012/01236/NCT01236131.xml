	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to identify the microorganisms present in the endometrial samples obtained from women with or without evidence of endometritis using a combination of culture methods, rRNA sequencing and whole genomic sequencing. The overarching aim of these studies is to identify the etiology of endometritis. The investigators will define the role of fastidious anaerobic microorganisms in the etiology of PID, and assess whether antibiotic treatment regimens used for the treatment of PID have activity against the novel organisms linked with pelvic infections.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This is a laboratory research study involving the use of biologic specimens only. Specimens (endometrial biopsy samples) collected from subjects who meet the inclusion criteria for PRO10010159 and PRO10010112 will be utilized for this study. Specimens (endometrial biopsy samples) that are collected from subjects enrolled in PRO10010159 and PRO10010112 that are insufficient will not be included in this study.</criteria>
