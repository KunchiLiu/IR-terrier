	<brief_summary>It is difficult to obtain patient's compliance with regular interproximal dental hygiene. Dental floss is recognized as an effective procedure to remove dental plaque and prevent gingivitis in the space between teeth, but it is difficult to use and most patients do no do it regularly. Essential oils mouthrinse acts on dental plaque bacteria and helps on gingivitis prevention. These properties may be of interest to control dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis in interproximal areas. The study hypothesis states that there are no differences between the use of an essential oils mouthrinse and dental floss on the reduction of dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis.</brief_summary>
