	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Nimodipine to Prevent Mild Cognitive Impairment After Acute Ischemic Strokes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>656 patients diagnosed with acute cerebral ischemia disease (onset≤7d) based on ICD-10 and CT/MRI criteria, who have cognitive impairment meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be included and randomized into nimodipine treatment group and the controlled group.Evaluations of cognitive function will be taken at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.</detailed_description>
