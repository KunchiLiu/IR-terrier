	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial of CS-1008 which is a humanized monoclonal antibody. This trial explores where CS-1008 distributes in the body, and the activity of CS-1008 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to give patients with metastatic colorectal cancer a series of different CS-1008 antibody doses in order to: - Study how the dose of CS-1008 effects where the CS-1008 distributes in the body (biodistribution), how long it circulates in blood (pharmacokinetics) and how much attaches to tumour (tumour uptake). These issues are studied after the initial infusion of 111In-CS-1008 (CS-1008 tagged with a small amount of radioactive Indium - also called Indium-111 or 111In), and also during and after a cycle of weekly infusions of CS-1008 antibody. - Study changes in the function (metabolism) of tumour cells following CS-1008 administration. - Assess whether repeat doses of CS-1008 cause shrinkage of the tumour. - Study whether experimental treatment with CS-1008 changes chemicals in the blood that may indicate tumour cell death (serum apoptosis biomarkers) and/or tumour response to treatment (serum tumour biomarkers (CEA - carcinoembryonic antigen)).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Imaging and Pharmacodynamic Trial of CS-1008 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a clinical trial of a laboratory produced humanised monoclonal antibody called CS-1008. CS-1008 binds to a receptor found on cancer cells called death receptor 5 (DR5 receptor) which, when stimulated, can cause the cancer cell to be destroyed by a process called apoptosis. CS-1008 could be an important potential therapeutic in patients with colorectal cancer and other cancers. The purpose of this study is to: - Primarily - Determine the influence of CS-1008 dose on initial biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and tumour uptake of 111-In-CS-1008 (CS-1008 tagged with a small amount of radioactive Indium - also called Indium-111) following single infusion of CS-1008, and determine changes in these parameters following continuous sequential doses of CS-1008. - Secondarily - Determine changes in tumour metabolism following CS-1008 administration - Describe anti-tumour response to CS-1008 in metastatic colorectal cancer. - Determine changes in serum apoptosis biomarkers and serum tumour response markers following treatment with CS‐1008. Research design and methods: This is a non-randomised, open label, single site (Austin Hospital), dose cohort study of CS-1008 in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who have received at least one previous regimen of chemotherapy treatment for metastatic disease. Consenting, eligible patients will each receive a course of seven doses of CS-1008, given weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes. The initial infusion of CS-1008 is trace labeled with Indium-111 (111In-CS-1008). Ten to 25 patients will be treated in cohorts in which the allocated initial and sequential weekly doses of CS-1008 are assessed. Each of the five dose level cohorts will be made up of two patients and are expandable to five patients if additional information about biodistribution and/or pharmacokinetics of the cohort dose is required. The initial 111In-CS-1008 dose is followed by gamma camera imaging for biodistribution and tumour uptake studies and with blood sampling over a 10 day period to evaluate pharmacokinetics and serum biomarkers. Weekly infusions of CS-1008 will subsequently occur. The day 36 infusion of CS-1008 will also be trace labeled with 111In, with subsequent gamma camera imaging for biodistribution and tumour uptake and blood sampling for pharmacokinetics and serum apoptosis biomarkers. Patients are reassessed for disease status (by RECIST v1.1), serum tumour biomarkers (CEA - carcinoembryonic antigen) and for development of human-anti-CS-1008-antibody development (HAHA) between day 44-50 (end of cycle/study visit). Patients are assessed for changes in the tumour metabolism following CS-1008 administration with 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline, day 15 and end of cycle one. Patients with stable disease or better at the day 44-50 reassessment may continue weekly CS-1008 until disease progression in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or until the patient or treating physician requests cessation of treatment.</detailed_description>

Within the last 1 week prior to first study drug administration, laboratory parameters for vital functions should be in the normal range. Non clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are generally permitted, except for the following which must be within the ranges specified: Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 90 x 10^9/L INR ≤ 1.5 Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2 x normal upper limit (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases) Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 55mL/min (CockcroftGault formula) Active central nervous system metastases. Definitively treated metastases are allowed if stable for 6 weeks off therapy. Known immunodeficiency or HIV positivity. Serious illnesses e.g. serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders, or any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with ability of the patient to fulfill the study requirements. Other malignancy, except nonmelanoma skin cancer, within 3 years prior to first study drug administration, that in the opinion of the investigator has &gt;10% risk of relapse within 12 months. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration. Regular corticosteroid, NSAID (other than paracetamol or lowdose aspirin) or other immunosuppressive treatment within 3 weeks prior to first drug administration. Intermittent dosing of corticosteroid or NSAID permitted if less than 4 doses within a 3 day period.
