	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetic patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (study population) and healthy volunteers (control population). Inclusion Criteria: Age over 18 years; type-2 diabetes; NPDR levels 10, 20 and 35/47 (ETDRS severity scale); and an area of retinal leakage of at least 25% of the RLA map (macular area). Exclusion Criteria: Presence of media opacity; vitreous syneresis or posterior vitreous detachment, and; previous photocoagulation treatments or any type of intraocular surgery or intravitreal medications; and other retinal pathologies.</detailed_description>
