	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of RFQMR therapy in remyelination in cases of Multiple sclerosis. The evaluation will be done based on MRI findings, by clinical/ neurological examination and by assessment of quality of life before and after completion of therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transmembrane Potential (TMP) is one of the known cellular signalling pathways regulating synthesis of various proteins like those responsible for programmed cell death (e.g., p53 group) at the appropriate time in living cells. Many illnesses like cancer and degenerative diseases are linked to disturbances in transmembrane potential and protein transcription process.(Cone CD, 1970) The protein responsible for production of myelin by the oligodendrocytes is Connexin 32. It has been established that in cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) this protein is not synthesized by the oligodendrocytes thus leading to non-repair of the demyelination process in the Central Nervous System (CNS) (Scherer SS et al., 1995; Sargiannidou I et al., 2009; Bondurand N et al., 2001). This causes the fibrotic damage and plaque formation and consequent signs and symptoms of MS. RFQMR therapy addresses this process of stimulation of Oligodendrocytes to synthesize Connexin 32 thus causing remyelination. RFQMR therapy is delivered with CYTOTRON®. This device is a long body, wide bore machine with 864 guns, with near field antennae and parabolic reflector delivery system. The device is capable of producing a wide range of dosimetry, involving multiple modulations in both fixed and variable proton density dosimetry. Appropriately modulated multi-harmonic Radio Frequency (RF) signals in the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used in altering the cell signaling process using the TMP pathways, thus able to tackle systemic disorders. Generically known as Rotational Field Quantum Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (RFQMR), it is a technology that is made to deliver highly complex quantum instantaneous Nuclear Magnetic Resonance beams in the RF bands and its harmonics ranging from 3KHz to 300 MHz with a near field delivery using specialized antenna in the presence of high instantaneous magnetic field.</detailed_description>
