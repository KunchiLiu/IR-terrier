	<brief_summary>Inhibition of CXCL8 activity might represent a relevant therapeutic target to prevent injury occurring after pancreatic islet transplantation. Reparixin is a novel and specific inhibitor of CXCL8. This study is designed to explore the efficacy of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in type 1 diabetes patients (T1D).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reparixin in Pancreatic Islet Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic islet transplantation has become a feasible option in the treatment of T1D which offers advantages over whole pancreas transplantation. However to date insulin independence can be obtained in most cases only after the patient has received repeated infusions from several donors. A non-specific immune response, mediated predominantly by innate inflammatory processes, coupled with specific cellular immune responses, possibly promoted by early inflammation, play a major role in the loss of transplanted islets from the liver. PMNs have been found to be the predominant cell types infiltrating in vitro the islets. In this regard, CXCL8 has been shown to be expressed by human islets and could play a crucial role in triggering the inflammatory reaction. Thus, CXCL8 might represent a relevant therapeutic target to prevent early graft failure. The efficacy of reparixin in improving graft outcome in mice models of intrahepatic islet transplantation, as well as the safety shown in human phase 1 and 2 studies, provide a rationale for a clinical study aimed at evaluating the effect of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in T1D patients.</detailed_description>

Planned intrahepatic islet transplantation alone from a nonliving donor with brain death. Planned infusion of 4000 to 7000 islet equivalent (IEQ)/kg body weight. Patients willing and able to comply with the protocol procedures for the duration of the study, including scheduled followup visits and examinations. Patients given written informed consent, prior to any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Exclusion criteria: Recipients of any previous transplant, except from recipients of a previous pancreatic islet transplantation that has failed, are off immunosuppression since at least 1 year and have negative antiHLA.
