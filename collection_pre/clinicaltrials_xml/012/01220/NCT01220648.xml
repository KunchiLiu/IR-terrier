	<criteria>Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CMLCP) at screening Initial diagnosis of CML cytogenetically confirmed by the presence of the Ph+ metaphases from the bone marrow Patients who have been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 6 months (1 month represents 28 days) after switch from previous CML treatments Patients who have been treated with stable dosing of 2x400mg nilotinib within the last month before start of study treatment No grade 34 CTC toxicities on nilotinib alone in the last month preceding the start of the study regimen Patients who are considered Ph because they do not have a confirmed cytogenetic diagnosis of the t(9;22) translocation in their bone marrow metaphases Evidence of a point mutation within the BCRABL gene leading to a clinically relevant amino acid exchange in the kinase domain at position T315 (gatekeeper mutation T315I) Impaired cardiac function Severe or uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e. uncontrolled diabetes, active or uncontrolled infection). Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
