	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of CollaRx® Bupivacaine Implant in Men After Open Laparotomy Herniorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal herniorrhaphy is a common surgery; and common surgical methods used include laparoscopic and open placement of synthetic mesh. The use of synthetic mesh can greatly reduce the risk of hernia recurrence regardless of the method used for its placement. Managing postoperative pain and preventing morbidity after open mesh herniorrhaphy remain considerable medical challenges. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile. Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery. This study will assess pain intensity after surgery in patients who receive either the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant or a plain collagen sponge.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Man ≥ 18 years Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 19 and ≤ 40 kg/m2. Has a planned unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy (open laparotomy, tension free technique) to be performed according to standard surgical technique under general anesthesia. Has a known hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics, opioids, or bovine products. Scheduled for bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy. Undergone a prior herniorrhaphy on the side scheduled for repair. Undergone major surgery within 3 mos of the scheduled herniorrhaphy. Has cardiac arrhythmias or atrioventricular (AV) conduction disorders. Concomitantly uses antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone, lidocaine), propranolol, or strong/moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors or inducers (eg, macrolide antibiotics and grapefruit juice). Used long acting analgesics within 24 hours of surgery. Short acting analgesics such as acetaminophen may be used on the day of surgery but are subject to preoperative restrictions for oral intake.</criteria>
