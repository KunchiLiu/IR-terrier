	<detailed_description>The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to extend previous findings regarding the impact of a brief cognitive behavioral treatment for chronic nightmares by examining the emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and health-related changes following treatment. Experiencing a traumatic event may initiate or exacerbate the occurrence of nightmares. Indeed, sleep disturbance, including nightmares, is considered a hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nightmares have been related to a variety of factors including stress, medications, trauma, and substance use. Among veterans, especially combat veterans or those reporting sexual assaults, symptoms of traumatic stress and nightmares are extremely common. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of nightmare treatment in a veteran population, and the impact of nightmare treatment on suicidal ideation has never been assessed. Imagery Rehearsal Treatment (IRT) has received increased attention in the past decade for use with chronic nightmares. Studies suggest that the treatment is promising for the reduction of frequency and intensity of chronic nightmares in trauma exposed persons and may have a generalized impact on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression and quality/quantity of sleep, although there is mixed evidence for sleep improvement among veterans. The principal investigator has completed two randomized controlled trials of a modified version of IRT, Exposure, Rescripting, and Relaxation Treatment (ERRT) and is currently conducting a third randomized controlled trial (Davis, 2008; Davis &amp; Wright, 2007). The current randomized controlled trial is comparing ERRT to an active treatment (relaxation). Results demonstrated positive treatment response. Although these trials have included some veteran participants, veterans have not been studied as a group using this protocol. The purpose of this prospective study is to conduct a pre- and post-treatment comparison of suicidal ideation and posttraumatic, depressive, and health symptoms in a single group of veterans.</detailed_description>
