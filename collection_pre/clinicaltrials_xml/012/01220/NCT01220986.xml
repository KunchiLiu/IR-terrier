	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to characterize Kupffer cell activity and activation of the innate immune response in the early phase of liver regeneration after right hepatectomy. The investigators hypothesise that liver regeneration after right hepatectomy in humans is associated with Kupffer cell activation and initiation of the innate immune response and that impaired liver regeneration, liver failure and sepsis following liver resection are associated with Kupffer cell dysfunction and an impaired innate immune response. The objectives for this study are to characterise Kupffer cell activity and the innate immune response in human liver before and after right hepatectomy.</brief_summary>
