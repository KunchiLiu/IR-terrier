	<brief_summary>Background: It is now generally accepted that an active lifestyle is beneficial for cognition, but can these benefits be transmitted for the active pregnant woman to her unborn child? This has been demonstrated in rats where the pups born of mothers who exercised during pregnancy had increased hippocampal neurogenesis and better memory and learning capabilities. Human studies tend to confirm this by looking at behavioral results, ie. better orientation and state regulation skills in newborns. The aim of the present study is to verify this on the electrophysiological level and to determine the effects of an active lifestyle during pregnancy on the newborn's brain development. Methods: 60 pregnant women will be included in a randomized controlled trial. The exercise group will be asked to exercise a minimum of 20 minutes, 3 times per week, at a minimal intensity of 55% of their maximal aerobic capacity. The control group will not be given exercise counselling. Newborns' brain activity will be recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) 10 days post partum. The primary outcome measure will be the amplitude and latency of the mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) that can be used to investigate the auditory sensory memory.</brief_summary>
