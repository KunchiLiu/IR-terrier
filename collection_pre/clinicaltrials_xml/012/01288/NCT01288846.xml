	<detailed_description>Furthermore is to be recorded how the investigators find information about medicine use by the reception when they do not follow the patient and how long it takes to find the right medicine list. The record of the changes made during hospital stay is examined, whether they are justified in the discharge summaries and whether they are described in the medical list.

Hypothesis: Medicine list is missing at admission by &gt; 50% of patients admitted acutely into hospital. Medicine List at admission, when available, is often incomplete. When the medication list is not available at admission, its content is often incomplete even after the staff at reception have tried to gather information from different sources. Changes of regular medication is not always present in the discharge summaries. The changes are not always justified in the discharge summaries. The GP often do not correct the medication list in the journal to the discharge summary. The GP does not give the patient an updated printout of the list at the first medical consultation after admission.</detailed_description>
