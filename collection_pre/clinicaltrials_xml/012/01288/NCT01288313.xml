	<brief_title>Effect of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Supplementation on Human Milk Composition of Lactating Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>n-3 and n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are essential particularly to neurodevelopment of newborn infants. Many variations in essential PUFA and LCPUFA content of human milk are observed according to countries and dietary habits of the mothers. Maternal diet supplementation of LCPUFA of lactating women may increase LCPUFA human milk according to consensus recommendations. This clinical trial is performed to evaluate the effect of different of consumption of n-3 fatty acids (linolenic acid) in different forms (oils or margarine) in the human milk composition. Each diet will last 30 days. During the first period of 15 days, the mothers will receive mediterranean diet based on olive oil. Then, lactating women will be randomised into four groups : one group will receive olive oil (standard group), one group supplemented in rapeseed oil, one group with n-3 margarine and one group with diet associating rapeseed oil and n-3 margarine.Human milk will be collected during the first breastfeeding of the day (10 ml) at three times : Days 0 corresponding to the usual diet , at day 15 after the Mediterranean diet and at day 30, after the study diet.</detailed_description>
