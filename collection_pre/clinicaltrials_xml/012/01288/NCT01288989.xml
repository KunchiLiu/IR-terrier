	<brief_summary>A dose escalation study to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMC-3C5 in subjects with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Anti-VEGFR-3 Monoclonal Antibody IMC-3C5 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study will enroll approximately 40 subjects. The actual sample size will vary depending on how many subjects are needed to obtain at least 3 complete subjects per cohort. IMC-3C5 will initially be administered once every week (Cohorts 1-4) in a dose escalated manner. The starting dose will be 5mg/kg weekly (Cohort 1). Dose escalation will proceed to 10mg/kg (Cohort 2), 20 mg/kg (Cohort 3), and 30mg/kg (Cohort 4). Based on an analysis of the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of weekly dosing, subjects may be enrolled sequentially into 2 every-other-week dose cohorts (Cohorts 5-6, 20mg/kg and 30mg/kg). Intermediate doses may also be used.</detailed_description>
