	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity Study of CNTO 6785 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the volunteer, physician, or study staff will know the identity of the assigned treatment), study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (blood levels of drug) and immunogenicity (development of antibodies to the drug) of a single dose of CNTO 6785 administered to healthy adult volunteers intravenously (in the vein) or by subcutaneous (under the skin) administration to healthy adult volunteers.This will be the first administration of CNTO 6785 to humans; therefore, no clinical experience is available. Healthy volunteers will receive a single dose of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of CNTO 6785 or placebo as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) (injection into a blood vessel) infusion or a single dose of 3 mg/kg of CNTO 6785 administered in up to 3 subcutaneous (under the skin) (SC) injections.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy adult volunteer with no clinically significant abnormalities as determined by the investigator (study physician) Have a body mass index (BMI) between 1930 kg/m2 Be a nonsmoker for at least 6 months prior to study participation Women must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile Currently have or have a history of any clinically significant medical illness or medical disorders (includes malignancies or serious infections) that the investigator (study physician) considers should exclude the volunteer from the study Major surgery or significant trauma within 12 weeks of screening Any volunteer who plans to undergo elective surgery within 4 weeks prior to study agent administration and through the end of the study Consumes, on average, more than approximately 500 mg/day of caffeine (as contained in 5 cups of tea or coffee or 8 cans of soda or other caffeinated products per day).</criteria>
