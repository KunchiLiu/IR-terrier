	<brief_title>Is a Knee Arthroscopy of Any Benefit for the Middleaged Patient With Meniscal Symptoms?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are no studies proving a significant positive effect of a knee arthroscopy in middleaged patients with meniscal symptoms in excess of a structured rehabilitation program. In this study consecutive patients aged 45-64 years referred to the orthopaedic department at the University hospital Linköping for a suspected meniscal injury will be randomised to a rehabilitation program or a knee arthroscopy + the same rehabilitation program. Functional tests will be performed by a physiotherapist. There will be patient administrated questionaries sent out after 3 and 12 month.</detailed_description>
