	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether increased pressure in the head is elevated in people who suffer from High Altitude Headache. We hypothesise that head pressure will be elevated in people with High Altitude Headache.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High Altitude Headache is the primary symptom of Acute Mountain Sickness. However, at present the reason why some individuals suffer from High Altitude Headache and others do not remains unknown. It is widely believed that elevated pressure within the brain leads to stretching of pain sensitive fibres and thus headache. However, evidence of raised intracranial pressure during High Altitude Headache is currently unavailable. Therefore, this study aims to examine a proxy measure of intracranial pressure (Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter) in persons visiting High Altitude, half of whom have been given the drug acetazolamide that is known to reduce headache symptoms.</detailed_description>
