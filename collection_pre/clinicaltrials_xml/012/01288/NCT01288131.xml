	<brief_summary>Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEpo) has been used to treat renal anemia and improve morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease. Subcutaneous use of r-HuEpo causes immunogenicity and develops anti-r-HuEpo associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). The treatment of anti-r-HuEpo associated pure red cell aplasia is controversial. The investigators aim to evaluate the treatment for anti-r-HuEpo associated pure red cell aplasia in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Anti-r-HuEpo Associated Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recombinant human erythropoietin was the first biotherapeutic medicinal product derived from recombinant DNA technology for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although r-HuEpo raises hemoglobin levels in CKD and improves morbidity associated with anemia in CKD patients, the adverse immunological effect of r-HuEpo administered subcutaneously can result in anti-r-HuEpo associated PRCA. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of two treatment protocol, cyclosporine combined with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide combined with prednisolone for treatment of anti-r-HuEpo associated PRCA.</detailed_description>
