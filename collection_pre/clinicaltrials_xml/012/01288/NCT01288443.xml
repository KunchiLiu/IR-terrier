	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo in participants with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.59 mmol/L) on ongoing stable atorvastatin therapy. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid levels after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab - To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of study participation depended on the status of the participant at screening: - For participants receiving atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, the study participation was to be approximately 21 weeks including a screening period of 1 week, a double-blind treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks. - For participants receiving a lipid-lowering treatment other than atorvastatin or not at stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, or drug naive participants, the study participation was to be approximately 27 weeks including a screening period of 1 week, a run-in treatment period with atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg at a stable dose of 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
