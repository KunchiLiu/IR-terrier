	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a) and ribavirin in genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who failed to respond to previous interferon (IFN)-based therapy in Japan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of TMC435 in Genotype 1, Hepatitis C-infected Participants Who Failed to Respond to Previous IFN-based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 (also referred to as jnj-38733214-aaa) in combination with the standard of care (SoC) therapy consisting of peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a ) and ribavirin (RBV) administered according to the manufacturer's prescribing information in adult, genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who failed to respond to previous interferon (IFN)-based therapy in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of TMC435 by the proportion of participants with undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). Participants will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus PegIFNα-2a (P) and RBV P) followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with PR OR participants will receive 24 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus PR followed by 24 weeks of treatment with PR. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally (via the mouth). Treatment with PR will last 24 or 48 weeks: Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0 mL solution with 180 mcg PegIFNα-2a and will be injected by a syringe under the skin once weekly. Ribavirin is given as 200-mg tablets (daily dose: 600-1000 mg based on body weight), and taken orally by mouth two times a day after meals. Participants will receive oral capsules of TMC435 (100 mg) once daily up to Week 12 or 24.</detailed_description>
