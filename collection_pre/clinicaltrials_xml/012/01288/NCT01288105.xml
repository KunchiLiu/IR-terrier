	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the impact of OCT and IVUS-guided management of patients with prior DES implantation who need major non-cardiac surgery and discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy on the perioperative (1 week prior to surgery until 30 days post surgery) incidence of major adverse cardiac events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Optical Coherence Tomography to Determine the Optimal Management of Patients With Drug-eluting Stents Who Need Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who receive drug-eluting stents (DES) and subsequently require non-cardiac surgery have increased risk for perioperative stent thrombosis, especially when antiplatelet therapy discontinuation is required. Perioperative administration of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may decrease the stent thrombosis risk, but it is cumbersome and carries high cost. Stents that have been endothelialized by optical coherence tomography (OCT) are likely to have low risk for perioperative stent thrombosis and therefore intensive management strategies, such as "bridging with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor" would not be required. The current study will assess whether OCT utilization can help optimize the preoperative management of DES patients requiring major non-cardiac surgery. The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the impact of OCT and IVUS-guided management of patients with prior DES implantation who need major non-cardiac surgery and discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy on the perioperative (1 week prior to surgery until 30 days post surgery) incidence of major adverse cardiac events. The hypothesis is that OCT and IVUS-guided treatment will have low incidence (≤10%) of perioperative major adverse cardiac events.
