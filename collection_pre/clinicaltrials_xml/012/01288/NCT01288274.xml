	<brief_title>Community Based Distribution of Injectable Contraceptives in Tigray, Ethiopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this project was to increase contraceptive prevalence and reduce the current high unmet need for family planning in rural areas of Ethiopia. In addition, the project was intended to provide evidence to policy makers to expand community based distribution (CBD) of the injectible contraceptive, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), in both Tigray and other regions of Ethiopia where community based reproductive health agents (CBRHAs) or other community health workers (CHWs) are present. Following from that, the specific aims of this project were to: - Provide evidence that CBRHAs can safely and effectively distribute and facilitate supply of DMPA to rural women - Demonstrate that CBRHAs can deliver DMPA with the same safety, effectiveness, and acceptability outcomes as HEWs - Increase access to DMPA by using CBRHAs</detailed_description>
