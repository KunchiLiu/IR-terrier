	<brief_summary>Donors with favorable KIR B haplotype gene content have yielded reduced relapse risk and improved leukemia free survival (LFS) in retrospective analyses of unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Specifically, donors with more KIR B gene content and those who are homozygous for the centromeric (Cen) B haplotype genes (as opposed to the telomeric (Tel) genes confer the most protective effect. This study proposes to prospectively test and validate the utility and effectiveness of further informing URD identification and selection by KIR genotyping as a supplement to HLA matching and the other variables known or suspected to indicate the best URD for a patient. Hypotheses: 1. Favorable KIR donors will improve protection against relapse and improve leukemia free survival (LFS) after URD HCT for AML. 2. Directed study procedures for rapid KIR genotyping and reporting to searching Transplant Centers (TC) can inform donor search and selection without delay in donor availability for HCT.</brief_summary>

In situations where the preferred (best &gt; better &gt; neutral) KIR donor is not selected in favor of a less favorable KIR genotype donor, the center will report one or more defined reasons (donor age; gender; parity; CMV status; ABO status; availability/logistics; other) for the choice (among equivalently HLA matched donors).</criteria>
