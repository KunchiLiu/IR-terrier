	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared with placebo when co-administered with 80 mg of atorvastatin after 8 weeks of treatment in participants with LDL-C ≥ 100mg/dL (≥ 2.59 mmol/L) on atorvastatin 10 mg. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid levels in comparison with placebo, when co-administered with 80 mg of atorvastatin after 8 weeks of treatment. - To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab when co-administered with a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg) versus atorvastatin 10 mg. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab when co-administered with 2 different doses of atorvastatin. - To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of study participation depended on the status of the patient at screening: - For participants receiving atorvastatin 10 mg at stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, the study participation was to be approximately 17 weeks including a screening period of 1 week, a double-blind treatment period of 8 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks. - For participants receiving a lipid lowering treatment other than atorvastatin/ or not at stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, or drug naive participants, the study participation was to be approximately 23 weeks with a screening period of 1 week, a run-in treatment period with atorvastatin 10 mg of 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 8 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participants receiving a lipidlowering treatment other than atorvastatin/ or not at stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening, or drug naive participants with primary hypercholesterolemia if they are likely to have lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.59 mmol/L) at the end of the 6week runin treatment period on atorvastatin therapy OR Participants with primary hypercholesterolemia treated with stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and likely to have lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.59 mmol/L) at the screening visit. Exclusion criteria: 1. LDLC &lt; 100 mg/dL (&lt; 2.59 mmol/L) at Week 1 (V1): After the runin period on atorvastatin 10 mg for participants receiving a lipid lowering treatment other than atorvastatin/ or not at stable dose of atorvastatin 10 mg for at least 6 weeks prior to the screening period, or drug naive participants. OR At the first visit for participants who are being treated with atorvastatin 10 mg at stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to screening visit. 2. Participants not previously instructed on a cholesterollowering diet. 3. Participants with type 1 diabetes. 4. Participants with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin. 5. Participants with type 2 diabetes and with an HbA1c ≥ 8.5% at screening visit (considered poorly controlled). 6. Laboratory findings measured before randomization: Triglycerides (TG) &gt; 350 mg/dL (&gt; 3.95 mmol/L) at screening visit. Positive serum or urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential. 7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 8. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method.
