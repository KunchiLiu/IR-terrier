	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single arm, phase II study with a 2-stage design and Bayesian interim monitoring to investigate the safety and efficacy of BEZ235 in patients with progressive metastatic HR+ HER2- breast cancer who have received at least one prior line of endocrine therapy and two to three prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients will be stratified into 3 groups according to their PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase) pathway activation status.</brief_summary>
