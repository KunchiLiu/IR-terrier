	<brief_summary>After immunization, particularly in older persons, some people are protected from disease by a vaccine and others are not. The investigators believe that this variable response may be due to overproduction of molecules that suppress development of immunity (antibodies and cell mediated immunity). Normally, these molecules are produced to make sure that immunity is regulated in just the right way for the body as a whole, and to prevent autoimmune disease. However, with aging, the immune system may have difficulty in proper immune regulation. Over production of immunosuppressive molecules after vaccination may interfere with the effects of a vaccine. For example when elderly individuals are immunized against zoster with a licensed vaccine, Zostavax, the vaccine is effective in only about 50 to 60%. The investigators will compare blood levels of antibodies, cellular immunity, and immunosuppressive molecules in recipients of Zostavax to see if there is a correlation between development low immunity and high levels of immunosuppressive molecules.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytokine Production and Immunity to Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) in Elderly Recipients of Zoster Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to determine whether there is a relationship between production of immunosuppressive cytokines (such as IL-10) an lower levels of immunity to Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) after vaccination, the investigators will obtain blood samples before and 3-5 times after immunization to determine the immunity to VZV and the levels of certain cytokines. The first blood samples will be obtained before the vaccine is given, as baseline values. The vaccine being used is the licensed vaccine, Zostavax, which is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be administered to all relatively healthy individuals over the age of 50. This study does not concern vaccine safety or effectiveness. As a benefit to vaccines, the vaccine is administered at no charge to the subject.</detailed_description>
