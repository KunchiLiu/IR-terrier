	<brief_summary>Patients with multiple myeloma have seen their survival rate strongly improved with the use of new anti angiogenic agents. Among them, the new chemotherapy with thalidomide or lenalinomide are frequently successfully suggested in therapeutic protocol such as MPT however they can strongly increase the risk of venous thrombo embolic disease (DVT and PTE) up to 20%. In these conditions, a prevention of this risk can be proposed by physician with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulants or antiplatelets agents. Pending the new recommendations on the management of VTED, the purpose of this study is to describe in real life conditions the management by oncologists of the thrombo embolic risk for such patients</brief_summary>
