	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether operation and fixation with a metal plate gives better result from the patient's perspective than plaster treatment in elderly patients with a displaced wrist fracture.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will perform a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing open reduction and internal fixation with a volar plate with closed reduction and plaster treatment in elderly patients with a displaced Colles' fracture in order to test the null hypothesis that the patient-perceived result is equal after conservative or operative treatment. Secondary outcomes are objective physical measurements.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unilateral unstable dislocated dorsally angulated fracture of the distal radius (radial shortening ≥4 mm and/or dorsal angulation ≥20°). Previous displaced fracture of the distal radius. Additional fractures of the upper extremities, an open fracture, terminal disease, patient not fit for surgery, unwilling or unable to cooperate with followup (advanced dementia (SPMSQ&lt;5), psychiatric illness, alcohol abuse).</criteria>
