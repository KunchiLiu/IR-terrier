	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is a collection of related risk factors that predispose to the development of type 2 diabetes Mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The investigators will examine the hypothesis that the metabolic and genomic characteristics of patients with metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes that are at risk for developing complications differ from each other and can be detected using specific biomarkers in blood or in the exhaled breath. Early detection of these individuals will enable personalized treatment to prevent and treat diabetes and its complications</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breath samples will be collected in inert respiratory bag from diabetic and healthy volunteers, and analyzed using a chamber containing nano-chemical sensors. These samples together with blood samples will additionally be characterized using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy "GC-MS".</detailed_description>
