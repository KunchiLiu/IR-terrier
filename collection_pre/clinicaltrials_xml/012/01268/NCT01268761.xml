	<brief_title>GnRH Antagonist for Treatment of Early Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious complication of ovarian stimulation protocols. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist administration in the luteal phase was recently proposed as a new approach for the management of patients with established severe OHSS We analyze the response of egg donors with moderate- severe early ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after a GnRH antagonist stimulation protocol to the administration of a daily doses of GnRH antagonist (Cetrorelix 0.25) during 7 days after the second day of oocyte retrieval compared with placebo (saline solution).</detailed_description>
