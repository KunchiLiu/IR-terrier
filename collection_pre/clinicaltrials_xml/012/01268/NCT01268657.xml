	<brief_title>Intervention for Anxiety After Falls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls are the most commonly occurring cause of traumatic injury among older adults. For many, the consequences include reduced mobility, difficulty performing basic self-care, social isolation, deteriorating health, or even death. Most interventions for falls do not address anxiety in the aftermath of falling. After an initial study assessment, participants will complete 8 home-based sessions of a Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT). The sessions will be led by a study clinician who will cover the 5 intervention components:(a) education (learning about anxiety and the rationale for treatment); (b) relaxation training (learning skills to reduce tension); (c) cognitive restructuring (learning skills needed to cope better with distressing thoughts); (d) behavioral activation (learning to initiate healthy activity); and (e) exposure (coaching in how to confront avoided thoughts, situations, and people). Participants will also complete assessments following completion of the intervention and 3 months after completion of the intervention.</detailed_description>
