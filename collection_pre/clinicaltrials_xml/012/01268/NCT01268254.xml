	<brief_summary>The investigators will evaluate 100 regular red wine consumer men and 100 abstainers men from 50 years-old to 70 years-old by coronary risk prevalence, mood status, anthropometric measures, daily caloric ingest, lipid profile, carotid intimal media thickness, brachial flow mediate dilatation, coronary tomographic angiography and leucocyte telomere length. The sample size has been calculated expecting that regular red wine ingestion would lead to a five year old younger vascular ageing indexes measured by carotid intimal media thickness, coronary artery calcium scores and leucocyte telomere length longer than those abstainers subjects at same age. The investigators hypothesized that regular wine consumers present less coronary lesion and coronary calcium score on coronary tomographic angiography, lower carotid intimal media thickness and higher mean telomere length due the benefice of wine.</brief_summary>
