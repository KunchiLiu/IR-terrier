	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, open-label, dose escalation study of patients with alpha-mannosidosis. 10 patients will be enrolled in this study receiving intravenous infusions of Lamazym. In order to avoid development of delayed hypersensitivity all patients will continue weekly treatment at the designated dose until the Safety Committee approves transfer to the rhLAMAN-03 protocol. It is the hypothesis that Lamazym is safe to use.</brief_summary>
