	<brief_summary>Healthy subjects with low Vitamin D levels will be randomly assigned to either Vitamin D replacement or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Insulin sensitivity will be measured before and after the intervention, and the changes will be compared between the two groups. This will help us understand if Vitamin D replacement improves insulin sensitivity. Serum Retinol Binding Protein 4 levels will also be measured to see if changes in insulin sensitivity are mediated by RBP4.</brief_summary>
