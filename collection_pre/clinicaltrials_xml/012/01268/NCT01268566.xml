	<brief_title>A Study of MEDI-575 in Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the antitumor activity, safety, and pharmacology of MEDI-575 in adult subjects with first recurrence of GBM. Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled to determine the preliminary efficacy profile of MEDI-575 in the treatment of subjects with first recurrence of GBM. Subjects will receive MEDI-575 as a 60-minute IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days until disease progression, initiation of alternative anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons for subject withdrawal. The primary assessment of antitumor activity is PFS-6; tumor response and progression will be determined using Updated Response Assessment Criteria of High Grade Gliomas- Neuro-Oncology Working Group v.1. Approximately 15 investigational sites in the United States will participate in this study. All subjects will be followed every 3 months for the duration of the trial (defined as 9 months from the date the last subject is entered into the trial or when the sponsor stops the study.</detailed_description>
