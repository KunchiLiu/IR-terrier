	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis can be defined as an abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree due to repeated cycles of inflammation and infection, resulting in progressive loss of lung function. The surgical treatment by pulmonary resection or even lung transplantation is indicated in cases of bronchiectasis primary nonresponsive to appropriate medical treatment, or when associated with serious complications. There are few literature data on the influence of bronchiectasis in exercise capacity, quality of life and functional capacity, and the impact of lung resection in patients with this diagnosis. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate prospectively the impact of lung resection on exercise capacity in patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of lung resection on quality of life and lung function and to analyze the the presence of predictors of postoperative functional deterioration and the occurrence of complications.</brief_summary>
