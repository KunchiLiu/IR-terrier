	<brief_summary>Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is a rare disease beginning during childhood and treated with immunosuppressants (i.e. steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine). Renal function of patients suffering from severe, steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome with failure or toxic side effects of other immunosuppressant treatments is a major matter of concern. Cyclosporine endangers renal parenchyma (fibrosis) in these patients who must take this treatment for years. At the same time, low doses of cyclosporine allow proteinuria to reappear, which provokes degradation of renal function by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Some recent data lead to the conclusion that Rituximab may be effective in such a disease, with a cyclosporin sparing effect. Purpose The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Rituximab versus placebo in the treatment of pediatric patients suffering from severe cyclosporine-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Abstract Patients will be included in the study in a period of remission of proteinuria. Two infusions of Rituximab - at the dose of 375 mg/mÂ²- or placebo will be administered at one week of interval. Other immunosuppressant treatments will be gradually tapered off with the same tapering pattern in both groups. In case of relapse of nephrotic syndrome, the blinding code will be broken. Rituximab will then be infused to patients having received placebo.</brief_summary>
