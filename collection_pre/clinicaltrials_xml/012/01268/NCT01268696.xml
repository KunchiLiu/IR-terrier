	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The exact mechanisms of the complex pathways of metabolic syndrome are not yet completely known. The pathophysiology is extremely complex and has been only partially elucidated. Most patients are older, obese, sedentary, and have a degree of insulin resistance. Stress can also be a contributing factor. The most important factors are: weight, genetics, aging, sedentary lifestyle,excess caloric intake. In our study we will assess the role of some polymorphisms in the pathology of metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
