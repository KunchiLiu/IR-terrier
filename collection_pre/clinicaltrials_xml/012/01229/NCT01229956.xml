	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer the in laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether the pattern of global and TSG-specific promoter CpG island hypermethylation and gene silencing that we have shown characterizes MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) infant bilineage ALL is also characteristic of other subsets of MLL-r leukemia. OUTLINE: Previously collected cryopreserved cells from diagnosis are analyzed for promoter methylation via HELP arrays, gene expression arrays, and RT-qPCR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 samples (8 from each of 4 biologically defined cohorts) will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
