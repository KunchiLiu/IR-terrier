	<brief_summary>Catheter ablation with isolation of the pulmonary veins has proven to be an effective treatment option in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In patients who have a relapse of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after one ablation procedure the investigators compare the reisolation of all pulmonary veins to reisolation plus an anterior left atrial line.</brief_summary>
