	<brief_summary>This study is conducted at Odense University Hospital(OUH) in collaboration with Institute of Clinical Biomechanics and Sport Science, University of Southern Denmark and Clinical Institute, University of Southern Denmark Aim: To evaluate the effect of implant design on postoperative total leg muscle function recovery and gait in hip replacement patients. Design: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial where patients are randomized into (A) total hip arthroplasty surgery (THA) or (B) resurfacing total hip replacement surgery (RTHA). Pre-surgery assessment and follow-up will be conducted at 8, 26 and 52 wks post-surgery.</brief_summary>
