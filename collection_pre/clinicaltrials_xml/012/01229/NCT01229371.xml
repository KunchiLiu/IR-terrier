	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the humoral immune response and safety of the parenteral formulation of the 2010/2011-season virosomal subunit influenza vaccine Inflexal V using two different HA antigen suppliers (AdImmune and CSL), in groups of young and elderly adults, using the EMA (European Medicines Agency) regulation as a guideline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study to Assess Influenza Vaccine Formulated With Haemagglutinin (HA) Antigen From Two Suppliers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity and safety of the parenteral formulation of the 2010/2011-season influenza vaccine, Inflexal V, using HA antigen obtained from 2 different production facilities, and to compare the immunogenicity of both formulations to pre-defined EMA criteria for the annual relicensing of seasonal influenza vaccines. The evaluation will be done in young adults and elderly.</detailed_description>
