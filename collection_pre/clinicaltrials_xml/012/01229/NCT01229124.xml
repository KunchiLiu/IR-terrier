	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in RNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying RNA biomarkers in tissue samples from infants with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RNA Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Infants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Sequence the microRNAs present in 20 infant AML samples as a pilot study. - Compare microRNAs present in infant AML samples to infant ALL samples that are being concurrently sequenced in a separate study to identify lineage- and translocation-specific microRNAs. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Previously collected cryopreserved cells from diagnosis are sequenced using reverse transcriptase-PCR.</detailed_description>
