	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of AKR963 compared to placebo and active comparator in lowering fasting triglyceride levels in patients with very high fasting triglyceride levels ≥ 500 and ≤ 1500 mg/dL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study to Treat Subjects With Severe Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increases in triglyceride concentrations have been correlated with increased risk for pancreatitis as well as for coronary heart disease (Ginsberg 2001, 2002). The incidence rates for major coronary events in the Munster Heart Study increased from 4.4% among Subjects with baseline TG concentrations under 200 mg/dL to 9.3% among Subjects with TG concentrations in the 200-399 mg/dL range, and up to 13.2% in Subjects with TG levels ranging from 400-799 mg/dL (Assmann 1996).</detailed_description>
