	<criteria>Male subjects between 0 and &lt;12 years of age. Diagnosed with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C &lt;1%), and pretreated for a minimum of 20 to 50 exposure days. Have evidence of vaccination against hepatitis A and B (or presence of antibodies against hepatitis A and B due to either a previous infection or prior immunisation), as documented in the medical notes at enrolment. The subject and/or legal guardian understand(s) the nature of the study and has/have given written informed consent to participate in the study and is/are willing to comply with the protocol. For all subjects at Day 1: Are actively bleeding. Have received an infusion of any FVIII product, cryoprecipitate, whole blood, plasma or desmopressin acetate in the 4 days prior to their dosing within the PK component. Have a known history of, or who are suspected of having FVIII inhibitors. Have received aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 7 days of administration of the IMP. Have an impaired liver function ie, bilirubin &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or aspartate/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) &gt;2.5 x ULN (referring to limits of the laboratory that performs the determination) at Screening. Are human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]1/2 antibody positive with a viral load of &gt;200/µL. Suffer from an acute or chronic medical condition, other than haemophilia A, which may, in the opinion of the Investigator, affect the conduct of the study. Suffering from von Willebrand disease (VWD) with von Willebrand factor: ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) level &lt;50 IU/dL at Screening. Have a known or suspected hypersensitivity or previous evidence of severe side effects to a plasmaderived FVIII product or to human albumin. Have participated in a clinical study or used an investigational compound in another study (eg, a new chemical entity not registered for clinical use) in the 3 months preceding the first day of IMP administration, or are planning to enter such a study during the study period. Unwillingness and/or inability to comply with the study requirements.</criteria>
