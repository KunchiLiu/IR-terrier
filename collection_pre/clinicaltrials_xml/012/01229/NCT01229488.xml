	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of the OcuMetrics system to measure oxygen on the surface of the eye. Oxygen is important to the health of the cornea. The proposed instrument will take advantage of phosphorescent dyes that are sensitive to oxygen concentrations to monitor oxygen concentrations on the surface of the eye. This will have obvious applications in eye research and contact lens testing.</brief_summary>
