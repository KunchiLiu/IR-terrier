	<brief_summary>Catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a challenging procedure. Even in experienced centres, repeat interventions are necessary in up to 70 of patients to achieve sinus rhythm at a long-term follow-up. While there is a consensus to perform pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as a cornerstone for the ablation of paroxysmal and persistent AF ablation, different additional ablation strategies are used to achieve a modification of the substrate that perpetuates the arrhythmia: linear lesions (anterior and roof lines) or ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE). In the stepwise approach PVI, CFAE ablation and/or LL are combined according to the presenting arrhythmia during procedure. The aim of the study is to determine whether there is a difference in terms of freedom from arrhythmia between a stepwise approach and a linear ablation for repeat procedure in patient with recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
