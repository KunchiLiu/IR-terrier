	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well everolimus and octreotide acetate with or without bevacizumab works in treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that cannot be removed by surgery and have spread nearby or to other places in the body. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Octreotide acetate may interfere with and slow the growth of tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab and everolimus also may stop the growth of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving everolimus and octreotide acetate together is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus and Octreotide Acetate With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: l. To assess the progression-free survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with everolimus alone or everolimus plus bevacizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) among treatment arms shown to be efficacious. II. To estimate the overall tumor response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with one of two novel regimens. III. To estimate the overall biochemical response rate (as measured by plasma chromogranin A levels) in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with these regimens. IV. To assess the toxicity of each regimen in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. V. To assess the overall survival of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive everolimus and octreotide acetate as in Arm I. Patients also receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologic documentation of welldifferentiated or moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumor from either a primary or metastatic site If different histologic classification schemes are used, equivalent histologic classifications (for example "grade 1", "lowgrade", or "intermediategrade") are allowed Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma or small cell carcinoma are excluded Documentation from a metastatic disease site is sufficient if there is clinical evidence of a pancreatic primary site Locally unresectable or metastatic disease Patients must have either histologic documentation of a pancreatic primary site, or clinical evidence of a pancreatic neuroendocrine primary tumor as determined by the treating physician Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., gastrinoma, VIPoma) in whom a pancreatic or peripancreatic primary site is strongly suspected are also eligible Patients must have evidence of disease (measurable or nonmeasurable) with evidence of progression within the past 12 months Measurable disease: Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 2 cm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 1 cm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan Nonmeasurable disease: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter &lt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or &lt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly nonmeasurable lesions; lesions that are considered nonmeasurable include the following: Bone lesions Leptomeningeal disease Ascites Pleural/pericardial effusion Inflammatory breast disease Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis Abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques Cystic lesions No prior treatment with bevacizumab, everolimus, or other mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors Other prior treatments, including but not limited to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, alpha interferon, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, external beam radiation therapy, and radiopeptide therapy are allowed There is no limit on the number of prior treatment regimens Any prior treatment (with the exception of octreotide) must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment Prior treatment with embolization or ablative therapies is allowed if measurable disease remains outside of the treated area There is no limit on the prior number of procedures Treatment with somatostatin analogs is a requirement of the study Patients receiving octreotide at the time of study entry may continue at the same dose level for the duration of the study Patients not receiving octreotide will initiate treatment according to study guidelines Prior progression on somatostatin analogs or a negative octreotide scan does not exclude patient participation in this study Patients should have completed any major surgery &gt;= 4 weeks from start of treatment Patients must have completed any minor surgery &gt;= 2 weeks prior to start of treatment Patients must have fully recovered from the procedure Insertion of a vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week prior to registration or during protocol therapy No concurrent condition resulting in immune compromise, including chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immuno suppressive agents No active or severe liver disease (e.g., acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis);
