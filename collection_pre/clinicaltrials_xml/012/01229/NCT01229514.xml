	<brief_summary>General anesthetic medications have been shown to cause neuronal cell death in the brains of infant rodents. Ethanol and general anesthetics both act on NMDA and GABA receptors,and appear to have similar mechanisms of toxicity in the immature rodent brain. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a technique developed for mapping brain activation and has been utilized to examine how the brains of children with a history of early exposure to ethanol function differently from children without such a history. This study will utilize fMRI to look for specific changes in brain activation patterns in children with a history of early exposure to general anesthesia, as compared to children without such exposure.</brief_summary>
