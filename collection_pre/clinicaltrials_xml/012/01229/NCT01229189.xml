	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Vitamin D Supplementation to Pregnant Women and Their Infants in Pakistan.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are proposing a community based introduction of vitamin D supplementation and we intend to understand the complex relationship between vitamin D, the growth factors and maternal and infant anthropometric variables and hope to unravel the reasons of vitamin D deficiency in our population. The investigators expect that if vitamin D is supplemented to pregnant women and their newborn infants it will inevitably replenish the micronutrient stores and aid to resolve the maternal and neonatal morbidity due to Vitamin D deficiency.</detailed_description>
