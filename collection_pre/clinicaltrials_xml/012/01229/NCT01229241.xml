	<brief_title>Assessment of Systemic Pharmacokinetics of Levobupivacaine and Ropivacaine During Continuous Epidural Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In literature the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine is widely demonstrated, like the minor toxicity of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine at the same anesthetic potency. The are actually no studies in humans confronting levobupivacaine and ropivacaine under the aspect of efficacy and toxicity.The aim of the study is the assessment of the systemic absorption of local anesthetics during continuous epidural infusion for postoperative pain control. Primary outcome: Assessment of the plasmatic equimolar concentrations of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine during continuous epidural infusion Secondary outcome: Assessment of the safety level of the local anesthetic (major difference between haematic concentration of the local anesthetic and neuro-cardiotoxic dose). Difference of the analgesic efficacy between levobupivacaine and ropivacaine. Differences in collateral effects due to the local anesthetic: hypotension and sensitive block. Prospective randomized double-blinded clinical trial</detailed_description>
