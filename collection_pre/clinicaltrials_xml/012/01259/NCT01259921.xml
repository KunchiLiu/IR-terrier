	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether neurofeedback (NF) training can significantly reduce the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in individuals with significant affect dysregulation and chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. The primary aims of this study include: 1. To examine whether NF has the potential to significantly reduce symptoms of PTSD. 2. To examine whether NF training can specifically target the area of affect regulation. 3. To examine the mechanism of NF through elucidating the relationship between affect regulation and PTSD symptom change.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EEG Biofeedback in the Treatment of Chronic Treatment-Resistant PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deficits in affect regulation are associated with a high rate of treatment failure to well-established evidence-based treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and deficits in this domain are most frequently found in individuals with chronic treatment-resistant PTSD. Aside from one psychological treatment intervention for adult female survivors of child sexual abuse, no published study has targeted improving affect regulation in treatment refractory PTSD. The aim of this study is to test and refine EEG neurofeedback (NF) as an effective treatment for PTSD associated with high levels of affect dysregulation. We believe improved affect regulation will lead to an overall improvement in functioning by addressing deficits in executive functioning in PTSD. Primary Aim: The primary goal of the research is to refine and evaluate NF training for adults with treatment-resistant PTSD, specifically targeting the domain of affect regulation. We will evaluate the following questions: 1. Will NF decrease chronic PTSD symptoms in a treatment-resistant sample of adults with childhood onset PTSD, as measured with the CAPS and the DTS? Hypothesis 1: Subjects in the active treatment condition will show significantly greater decreases on the CAPS and DTS than subjects in the placebo condition. 2. Will NF improve affect regulation, as measured by the IASC? Hypothesis 2: Subjects in the active treatment condition will show significantly greater improvement on the affect dysregulation subscale of the IASC than individuals in the placebo condition. 3. Will affect regulation, as measured by the IASC, mediate the relationship of NF training and PTSD, as measured with the DTS? Hypothesis 3: The affect dysregulation subscale of the IASC will significantly mediate the relationship between NF and DTS scores while DTS scores will not significantly mediate affect dysregulation.</detailed_description>
