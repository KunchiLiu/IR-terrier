	<criteria>1. 1. Clinical symptoms: presence of chronic pulmonary/systemic symptoms lasting â‰¥ six weeks. 2. Radiological findings: Evidence of slowly progressive pulmonary lesions over weeksmonths including cavities with surrounding inflammation. presence of intracavitary mass with a surrounding crescent of air,and presence of pleural thickening in peripheral lesions. 3.
