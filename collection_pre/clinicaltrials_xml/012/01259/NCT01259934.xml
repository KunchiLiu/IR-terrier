	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of giving adjuvant treatment with intermediate doses of interferon-alpha2b to patients operated for high risk melanoma. Patients are randomly assigned to either observation only or interferon treatment for 2 different durations. The outcome with respect to overall survival, relapse-free survival, side effects and quality of life is analysed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nordic Adjuvant IFN Melanoma Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open multicenter, prospective randomised phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of two different schedules of Interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) administered in an adjuvant setting after adequate surgery in high risk cutaneous melanoma patients (T4N0M0/TxN1-2M0). The patients have been operated for either a thick primary melanoma (&gt; 4 mm) without evidence of distant metastasis or have undergone surgery for regional lymph node metastases. The study consists of a control arm (A) and two treatment arms, B and C. The outcome in arms B and C with adjuvant treatment with IFN-alpha2b will be compared to the outcome of arm A in which the patients will only be observed after the surgery. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints are relapse-free survival, safety-toxicity and health-related quality of life.</detailed_description>
