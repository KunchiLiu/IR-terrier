	<brief_title>Examine Plasma Concentrations of Buprenorphine Following Reapplication of Buprenorphine Transdermal System (BTDS) After Variable Application Site Rest Periods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum application site rest period that ensures that reapplication of BTDS 10 to the same site in the deltoid region does not result in increased absorption of drug in normal healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
