	<criteria>Is at least 50 years old Has a urinary disturbance associated with severe BPH and has a total IPSS score 20 or higher Has a QoL score of 3 or higher Has a urine volume of 120mL or greater and a Qmax of below 15mL/sec Has a PRV of below 100mL Voluntarily decides to participate in this trial and sign with informed consent form Has been administered silodosin Has been administered an α1Aadrenoceptor blocker within one month Has been prescribed antiandrogens except 5αreductase inhibitors within a year Has had phytotherapy within 3 months Has had prostatectomy Has had intrapelvic radiation therapy Has had transurethral microwave hyperthermia of transurethral needle ablation Is suspected to have implications that are likely to affect urine passing such as neurogenic bladder, bladder calculus or active urinary tract infection (UTI). Is conducting selfcatherterization Has a renal impairment with a serum creatinine of 2.0mg/dL or greater Has severe hepatic disorders (hepatic insufficiency, cirrhosis, jaundice, hepatoma) or has a total bilirubin of 2.5mg/dl or higher or has AST/ALT 2.5 times higher than the normal (upper) level Has suffered from a severe arrhythmia, cardiac failure, cardiac infarction, unstable angina, cerebral infarction within 6 months Has experienced allergy to α1 receptor blockers Has orthostatic hypotension around the time of Screening Visit Has participated in other clinical trials within 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit Has a Prostate specific antigen(PSA) of higher 10ng/mL or has been diagnosed with tumor identified by a biopsy even though he has a PSA of lower 10ng/mL (Patient who has been administered 5αreductase inhibitors for more than 3 months are presumed to have 2 times higher than their actual PSA levels) Has been taking unstable dosing of 5αreductase inhibitors like finasteride or dutasteride for the past 3 months or is expected to change the dosage during the trial.</criteria>
