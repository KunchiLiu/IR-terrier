	<brief_summary>This project will be a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of an internet-administered smoking cessation treatment for overweight and obese smokers. Research on internet-administered behavioral treatments for smoking cessation has found that compared to control treatments (e.g., self-help materials), cessation rates in internet-administered treatments are significantly higher. Research testing the applicability of these treatments to overweight and obese individuals has not yet been conducted. Given that a substantial portion of smokers are also overweight and at elevated cardiovascular risk, there is a need for directed treatment efforts for this group. The current trial proposes to be the first to test the effectiveness of internet-administered smoking cessation treatment for overweight and obese (BMIâ‰¥25) smokers. Adult participants will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of internet-administered treatment consisting of either: a) standard smoking cessation treatment with general health education, or b) standard smoking cessation treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for weight concerns. Participants in both conditions will receive open-label treatment with the 21 mg transdermal nicotine patch.</brief_summary>
