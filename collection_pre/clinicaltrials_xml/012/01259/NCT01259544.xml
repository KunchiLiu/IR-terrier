	<brief_title>BreathIDÂ® Test: A Non-invasive Modality to Detect Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to assess the pancreatic exocrine insufficiency using a 13C labeled di-peptide breath tests in patients with chronic pancreatitis(CP) and show correlation with secretin stimulated endoscopic Pancreatic Function Test (ePFT). Furthermore, a second purpose is to assess the ability to differentiate between non patients with chronic pancreatitis and those without. Approximately 30 subjects will be tested with both methods within two weeks of each other.</detailed_description>
