	<brief_summary>Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 when given together with erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hsp90 Inhibitor AUY922 and Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 followed by a phase II study. Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 IV over 1 hour once weekly and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
