	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if weight loss in patients undergoing Roux en Y gastric bypass procedures has any effect on breast density as measured by mammography and breast MRI. OUTLINE: GROUP I: Participants undergo mammography and MRI at baseline and 1 year. Participants also undergo gastric bypass surgery.
