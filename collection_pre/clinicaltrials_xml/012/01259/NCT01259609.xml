	<brief_title>Changes in Ciliary Body Thickness in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema After Vitrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A diabetic macular edema group consisted of diabetic patients who underwent PPV for diffuse diabetic macular edema. A epiretinal membrane group, a surgical control group, consisted of non-diabetic patients with epiretinal membrane who underwent pars plana vitrectomy. A healthy control was also included for the comparison of preoperative ciliary body thickness. Ciliary body thickness was measured using ultrasound biomicroscopy, and central macular thickness was determined using optical coherence tomography. The visual outcome, ciliary body thickness, and central macular thickness were compared between groups before and 1, 2, and 4 months after pars plana vitrectomy and the correlations between the central macular thickness and ciliary body thickness and best corrected visual acuity were determined.</detailed_description>
