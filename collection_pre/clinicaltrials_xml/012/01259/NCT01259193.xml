	<brief_summary>Sorafenib ,an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting several tyrosine-kinase receptors with antiangiogenesis and antiproliferation of HCC, is the first approved target therapy for HCC. Zoledronic acid is used for treatment of bone metastasis of diverse malignant cancer. Emerging data suggest that zoledronic acid may also exhibit anticancer properties. The objectives of the study is to evaluate the safety of Sorafenib combined with Zoledronic Acid and to evaluate overall survival and time to progression.</brief_summary>
