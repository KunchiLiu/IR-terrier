	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Ending Self-Stigma (ESS), a 9-session group intervention designed to assist veterans with serious mental illness to develop skills (SMI) to effectively cope with stigma and minimize the internalization of stigmatizing beliefs and stereotypes, is more effective in reducing internalized stigma and its associated effects than an active comparison group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Internalized Stigma in People With Serious Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes about mental illness are prevalent and exposure to stigma is common among people with mental illness. The negative effects of stigma are compounded when a veteran with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) internalizes these stigmatizing assumptions and stereotypes. Internalized stigma refers to the process in which a person with mental illness cognitively or emotionally absorbs negative messages or stereotypes about mental illness and comes to believe them and apply them to him/herself. Internalized stigma is evident among veterans with SMI and can lead to decreased self-efficacy, increased depression, social withdrawal, and curtailed pursuit of recovery goals. Objectives: The investigators developed Ending Self Stigma (ESS), a 9-session group intervention to assist veterans with SMI to develop skills to effectively cope with stigma and minimize the internalization of stigmatizing beliefs and stereotypes. The primary objectives of this project are to compare the effects of ESS to a general health and wellness group in: 1) reducing internalized stigma and 2) improving proximal psychosocial outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, belonging, recovery orientation). Secondary objectives include assessing the effects of ESS on improving distal psychosocial outcomes (e.g., quality of life, social functioning) and examining if improvements are maintained 6-months post-treatment. Methods: This study is a randomized trial of veterans with SMI receiving outpatient mental health services from three VA Medical Centers. Participants are randomly assigned to ESS or a general health and wellness group, which they attend once a week for 9 weeks. ESS focuses on teaching strategies/tools to help participants address self-stigma. The health and wellness group focuses on providing information/ education to help participants better manage health-related concerns (e.g. physical activity, nutrition). Participants complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-months post-treatment. A two-level mixed effects model with adjustment for baseline response will be used to address the primary and secondary aims. Qualitative data on veterans' experiences of and strategies for coping with internalized stigma are being collected from a subset of veterans from both conditions to compare experiences of veterans in both groups and explore any reasons for ESS drop-out. Status: Data collection for the project is completed. Analysis of 6-month post-treatment assessments and qualitative interviews are currently being conducted.</detailed_description>
