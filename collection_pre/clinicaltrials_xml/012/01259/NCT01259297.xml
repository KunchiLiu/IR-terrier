	<brief_summary>This study was planned to provide new information regarding the role of aliskiren (with or without additional therapy with a diuretic or a Calcium channel blockers (CCB)) in elderly individuals (≥ 65 years) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 to 159 mmHg, in preventing major cardiovascular (CV) events and on global measures of physical, executive and cognitive function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Aliskiren in the Prevention of Major Cardiovascular Events in Elderly People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was 2x2 factorial design study with 2 strata. As per protocol, the first co- Primary analysis as well as secondary analysis were aliskiren based regimen vs non-aliskiren based regimen. All aliskiren based arm were combined into the aliskiren based regimen and all non-aliskiren based arms were combined into non-aliskiren based regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Systolic blood pressure 130 159 mmHg with any one of the following (1, 2 or 3): 1. Men and women aged ≥ 65 years if they have at least one of the following: (secondary prevention) Coronary heart disease Previous myocardial infarction or Stable angina or unstable angina with documented multivessel coronary artery disease, &gt; 50% stenosis in at least 2 major coronary arteries on coronary angiography, or positive stress test (ECG or nuclear perfusion scintogram), or Multivessel PCI, or Multivessel CABG surgery &gt; 4 years prior to informed consent, or with recurrent angina or ischemia following surgery Stroke/TIA Previous documented stroke or documented TIA &lt; 1 year before informed consent Peripheral artery disease Previous limb bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or Previous limb or foot amputation, or History of intermittent claudication, with an ankle:arm BP ratio ≤ 0.80 on at least one side, or significant peripheral artery stenosis (&gt; 50%) documented by angiography or noninvasive testing Diabetes mellitus: Highrisk diabetics with evidence of endorgan damage 2. Men and women aged ≥ 65 years with no history of CVD, and with at least 1 CV risk factor (primary prevention): History of dyslipidemia, defined as LDL cholesterol &gt; 3.5 mmol/L (135 mg/dL) or HDL&lt; 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in women or &lt; 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) in men or total cholesterol/HDL ratio &gt; 5 History of current or recent smoking (regular tobacco use within 5 years) Abdominal adiposity defined as waist/hip ratio ≥ 0.90 in women and ≥ 0.95 in men History of dysglycemia defined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG fasting plasma glucose 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L [101 to 124 mg/dL]), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT fasting plasma glucose &lt; 7 mmol/L [126 mg/dL] but 2 hour glucose 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L [140 to 198 mg/dL]) or type 2 diabetes Renal dysfunction: eGFR&lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 but &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 (MDRD formula) and/or microalbuminurea/macroalbuminurea Clinical evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy 3. Men and women aged ≥ 70 years if they do not have any of the above (primary prevention) 1. Current treatment with aliskiren, an ACEinhibitor, an ARB or an aldosterone antagonist and unable to discontinue this therapy in those without clinical vascular disease. Individuals with CVD or type 2 diabetes and/or renal dysfunction may receive an ACEinhibitor or an ARB, but not both, contraindications to Aliskiren, Amlodipine or Hydrochlorothiazide. 2. Use of both thiazide diuretic and amlodipine or another calcium channel blocker. Patients on only one of these two classes of drugs are eligible 3. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg) 4. Symptomatic heart failure, requiring the use of loop diuretics 5. Hemodynamically significant primary valvular or outflow tract obstruction (e.g. aortic or mitral valve stenosis, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, malfunctioning prosthetic valve). Constrictive pericarditis. Complex congenital heart disease. 6. Acute stroke &lt; 3 months or TIA ≤ 7 days before informed consent, acute coronary syndrome &lt; 1 months before informed consent 7. Planned cardiac surgery or angioplasty &lt; 3 months after informed consent or having had the procedure &lt; 3 months before informed consent 8. Severe renal impairment eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m2 (MDRD formula); known renal artery stenosis ; serum potassium ≥ 5.3 mmol/L 9. Chronic liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis, esophageal varices, portocaval shunt or persistent hepatitis) or abnormal liver function, i.e., alanine transaminase (ALT) or AST &gt; 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) 10. Concurrent treatment with cyclosporine or quinidine; chronic use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase2 (COX 2) inhibitors in patients with eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 (MDRD formula) 11. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases 12. Other serious condition(s) likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the study. Significant psychiatric illness, senility, dementia, alcohol or substance abuse, which could impair the ability to provide informed consent and to adhere to the study procedures</criteria>
