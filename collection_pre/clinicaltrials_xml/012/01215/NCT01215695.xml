	<brief_summary>We propose to enroll 140 subjects scheduled for elective or urgent/emergent surgery with general anesthesia including endotracheal intubation. Patients qualify for the trial if they are considered a difficult airway case as determined by measurement of common predictive indices for difficult intubation (see inclusion criteria). All patients will be intubated with a GVL. Patients will be randomly assigned to either having their ETT placed with use of a pre-formed stylet provided by the manufacturer of the GVL (control group) or with a flexible, disposable tracheoscope (aScope, Ambu, Denmark) (intervention group). The randomization will be stratified as to whether patients are categorized as predicted difficult airway or have an immobilized cervical spine (C-collar in place).</brief_summary>
