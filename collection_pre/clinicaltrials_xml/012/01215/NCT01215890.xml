	<brief_summary>The occurrence of bone loss in Crohn's disease patients is an important clinical problem for both patients with and without active disease. While therapy does exist for treatment and prevention of low BMD, evidence of its efficacy in Crohn's disease patients is lacking. The current standard of therapy in Canada for the treatment of osteoporosis is etidronate, with adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of risedronate, compared to placebo, administered once-weekly, in the treatment of low BMD of the spine and hip in patients with Crohn's disease at 12 months, based on an intention-to-treat analysis.</brief_summary>
