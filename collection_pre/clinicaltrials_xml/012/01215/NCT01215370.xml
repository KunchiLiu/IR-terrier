	<brief_summary>The main objective is to investigate the postprandial effect of arginine-rich protein (i.e. pea-protein) on metabolic control, inflammation and endothelial function after a high-fat meal in subjects with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pea Protein and Postprandial Response (PEA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arginine is potential interesting considering the metabolic syndrome. Studies so far indicated both long-term effects, as well as acute - postprandial - actions; especially when metabolism is already challenged, e.g. in diabetic patients or after a high-fat meal. If arginine-rich proteins are equally effective is not known. Therefore we are interested in the effect of (arginine rich) protein on postprandial (dys)metabolism, inflammation and endothelial function, within 6 hours after a meal.</detailed_description>
