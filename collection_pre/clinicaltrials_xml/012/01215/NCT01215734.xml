	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1: The safety profile in adult allogeneic stem cell hematopoietic transplant (SCT) recipients after high dose (HD) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) will not be significantly different from adult stem cell transplant recipients receiving standard dose (SD) TIV. - Specific Aim 1: To compare safety profile of high dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine to standard dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Hypothesis 2: Adult stem cell transplant recipients who received the higher dose trivalent influenza vaccine will have a greater frequency of (at least a 4-fold) rise in antibody titers to influenza antigens compared to those who receive standard dose trivalent influenza vaccine. - Specific Aim 2: To compare humoral immune responses of adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients influenza virus antigens included in trivalent influenza vaccine after high dose or standard dose trivalent influenza vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who are &gt;6 posttransplant greater than or equal to 18 years of age Available for duration of study If patients are on immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of graft versus host disease (GVHD): only those on stable doses for at least 4 weeks or on tapering doses will be eligible. History of hypersensitivity to previous influenza vaccination or hypersensitivity to eggs/egg protein History of GuillainBarre syndrome Evidence of hematologic malignancy or disease relapse posttransplant (mixed chimerisms and molecular evidence of disease is permitted) Nonallogeneic (e.g. autologous) hematopoietic SCT recipients History of receiving 2011 2012 influenza vaccine History of proven influenza disease after September 1, 2011. Pregnant females Have any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place them at an unacceptable risk of injury or render them unable to meet the requirements of the protocol Have any condition that the investigator believes may interfere with successful completion of the study Platelet count less than 50,000 cells/Î¼L History of known infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C History of known latex hypersensitivity</criteria>
