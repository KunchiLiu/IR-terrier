	<brief_summary>This Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging study is designed to explore the relationship between HT-0712 dose level and inhibition of brain phosphodiesterase-4 activity, in order to optimize the dosage regimens utilized in subsequent trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Inhibition of [11C]R-rolipram Binding to Brain Phosphodiesterase - 4 (PDE-4) by HT-0712</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this project is to demonstrate the inhibition of human brain PDE4 by HT-0712, by measuring the inhibition of [11C]R-rolipram binding, a radiotracer which also binds to and inhibits PDE4. Plasma samples will be drawn to determine if there is a relationship between plasma pharmacokinetics of HT-0712 and its pharmacodynamic effect, as determined through the inhibition of [11C]R-rolipram binding in the brain.</detailed_description>
