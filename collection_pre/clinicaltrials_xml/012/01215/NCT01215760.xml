	<brief_summary>Objectives: To develop a protocol for early treatment using sensory reeducation through the mirror after surgical reconstruction of the median nerve and / or ulnar hand, and its comparison with the evolution of the return of skin sensitivity after a not early rehabilitation which will be conducted by physiotherapists, with blinding of the evaluators.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensory Reeducation in Peripheral Nerve Injuries of Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes in the cerebral cortex begins soon after peripheral nerve injury resulting in overlapping cortical areas on adjacent as a result of the absence of stimuli in the area of cortical representation of the injured nerve. Sensibility reeducation is a process of reprogramming the brain through a progressive learning proposing feed the somatosensory cortex with alternative stimulus to preserve the cortical map of the hand and facilitate the sensory recovery. This study is based on the hypothesis that sensory reeducation starting in the first days after surgery by training with the mirror promotes greater preservation of the cortical map of the original hand, with better functional results. We also believe that sensory reeducation performed early with the mirror will enhance the return of sensibility, emphasizing functional reorganization with less alteration of the cortical map of the hand. Metodology: Will be included patients over 18 with injury of the median and/or ulnar nerve at the first week after surgery. Patients will be randomized into an early group with the use of mirror and a classic group of sensory reeducation. In evaluating the Rosen score will be used with motor, sensory and pain/discomfort components. The assessment instruments used were: Semmes Weinstein monofilaments, Jamar速 and Pinch Gauge速 dynamometer, goniometry, shape and texture identification (STI), Sollerman test, Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH), two points discriminator and numeric pain scale.</detailed_description>
