	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare the glycaemic control when subjects initiate a biphasic insulin aspart 30 treatment followed by an intensified treatment if treatment target of HbA1c below 7% is not reached by OAD (oral anti-diabetic drugs) alone.</brief_summary>
