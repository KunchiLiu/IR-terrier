	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Determine if Ecopipam Can Reduce Urges to Gamble</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if ecopipam is able to stop urges to gamble in patients diagnosed with Pathological Gambling. Nerves communicate with each other by releasing chemicals called "neurotransmitters". One of these neurotransmitters in the brain is called "dopamine". After dopamine is released by the nerve it "talks" to other nerves by interacting with receptors that are unique to that neurotransmitter. Ecopipam is a drug that selectively blocks one family of dopamine receptors. Some scientists believe that the urge to gamble is related to having too much dopamine in the brain. By blocking the receptors that dopamine uses, ecopipam may be able to relieve the urge to gamble.</detailed_description>
