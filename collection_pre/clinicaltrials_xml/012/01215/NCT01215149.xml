	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ad26.ENVA.01 and Ad35-ENV in low-risk for HIV-uninfected healthy adults administered in heterologous and homologous prime-boost regimens at different time intervals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Ad26-ENVA and Ad35-ENV HIV Vaccines in Healthy HIV-uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the order of vector priming and boosting (Ad26 versus Ad35), the timing of boost (3 versus 6 months) and the homologous versus heterologous regimen at the 3-month time interval. Groups A-D will be enrolled in Boston, MA, USA, Groups E-H will be enrolled at the East African Clinical Research Centres and Groups I-L will be enrolled at the South African Clinical Research Centres. Volunteers will be screened up to 56 days before vaccination and will be followed for 12 months after the second vaccination. Approximately 212 volunteers will be randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo within a group (A-L); Groups A-D, Groups E-H and Groups I-L will be randomized separately. Up to 7% over-enrolment (approximately 15 volunteers) will be allowed to facilitate enrolment.</detailed_description>

Exclusion Criteria Confirmed HIV1 or HIV2 infection; Any clinically relevant abnormality on history or examination including history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease; use of systemic corticosteroids (the use of topical or inhaled steroids is permitted); immunosuppressive, anticancer, antituberculosis or other medications considered significant by the investigator within the previous 6 months; Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that is considered progressive, or in the opinion of the investigator, makes the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study; Reported risky behaviour for HIV infection within 12 months prior to vaccination, as defined by the protocol If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy within 4 months after last vaccination; or lactating; Asthma requiring highdose oral or inhaled corticosteroids; Fever &gt; 100.4° F/38.0° C within 72 hours prior to vaccine administration; Bleeding disorder that was diagnosed by a physician (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder that requires special precautions) (Note: A volunteer who states that he or she has easy bruising or bleeding, but does not have a formal diagnosis and has IM injections and blood draws without any adverse experience is eligible); History of splenectomy; Any abnormal laboratory parameters as defined by the protocol; Receipt of liveattenuated vaccine within the previous 60 days or planned receipt within 60 days after vaccination with Investigational Product (within 14 days for live attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]); or receipt of other vaccine (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal), allergy treatment with antigen injections or tuberculin skin test within the previous 14 days or planned receipt within 14 days after vaccination with Investigational Product; Receipt of blood transfusion or bloodderived products within the previous 3 months; Participation in another clinical trial of an Investigational Product currently, within the previous 3 months or expected participation during this study; Receipt of another investigational HIV vaccine candidate (Note: receipt of an HIV vaccine control or placebo will not exclude a volunteer from participation if documentation is available and the Medical Monitor gives approval); History of severe local or systemic reactogenicity to vaccines (e.g., anaphylaxis, respiratory difficulty, angioedema); Confirmed diagnosis of active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or active syphilis; Seizure disorder: A participant who has had a seizure in the last 3 years is excluded.
