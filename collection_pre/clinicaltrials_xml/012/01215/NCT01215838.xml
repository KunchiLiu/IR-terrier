	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer, is the seventh most common cause of cancer mortality in the US. The incidence rate of HCC is increasing along with the incidence of Hepatitis B and C which are known to promote HCC. Patients have a better prognosis (survival outlook) if HCC is found and treated at an early stage. MRI is the best imaging modality for diagnosing HCC. This study will compare standard MRIs and MRIs performed with a newly developed MR protocol to determine if it is possible to more confidently diagnose HCC.</detailed_description>
