	<detailed_description>The extention of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the surgical treatment of muscle-invasive, clinically locally bladder cancer is not yet standardized. There are no data from prospective studies on the prognostic significance of regional lymphadenectomy. Results of retrospective studies suggest, that the prognosis of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer can be improved by extending the limits of pelvic lymphadenectomy. Furthermore it could be demonstrated in a prospective study that the pattern of metastasis of bladder cancer has a high variability. About two-thirds of lymph node metastases are found outside the normally cleared areas of lymphadenectomy. In his study patients will be randomized into arms with limited versus extended lymphadenectomy. The limited lymphadenectomy includes the removal of the obturatorical and external iliac lymph nodes, the extended one includes the removal of all lymph nodes between pelvic floor and the departure of the inferior mesenteric artery. The primary objective of the study is to record the progression-free survival. Secondary study objectives include the creation of a standard for the surgical treatment and development of quality criteria and implementation of those into international guidelines. The indication for adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced tumors is not affected.</detailed_description>
