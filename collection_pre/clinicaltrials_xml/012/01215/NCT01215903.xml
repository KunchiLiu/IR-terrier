	<brief_summary>The present study was conducted to test whether a fish gelatin supplement combined with an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement can exert beneficial and sex-specific effects on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, indicators of insulin secretion, blood pressure, lipid metabolism, inflammation and energy intake in obese or overweight insulin-resistant men and women. The investigators hypothesis is that fish gelatin improves insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, lipid profile and reduces inflammation in obese or overweight insulin-resistant men and women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fish Gelatin Supplement and Omega-3 Supplement in Obese or Overweight Subjects With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An important number of recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on cardiovascular disease risk factors such as reduced triglycerides, decreased platelet aggregation, plaque stabilization, antiarrhythmic effects, and reduced blood pressure. Dietary fish protein has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity by 30% in insulin-resistant obese or overweight human subjects. In addition, an increasing number of studies describe and demonstrate the physiological and metabolic variations between men and women in regard to CVD and their risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, but the data are still limited. In agreement with the recent findings, this study was conducted to evaluate the combined and synergistic effects of omega-3 and fish protein supplements on insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obese or overweight insulin-resistant men and women having some or all the metabolic syndrome criteria including a deteriorated lipid profile, high blood pressure and high waist circumference in a free living situation.</detailed_description>
