	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate bias, precision and accuracy of new cystatin C and creatinine based equations for GFR estimation compared with 51Cr-EDTA (chromium-51 labeled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) measured GFR in patients with diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate bias, precision and accuracy of new cystatin C and creatinine based equations for GFR estimation compared with 51Cr-EDTA measured GFR in patients with diabetes. Additional, we will check which equation detects better the reduction of renal function over the time, in patients with diabetes. Finally, we will investigate if cystatin C levels can be influenced by factors other than GFR</detailed_description>
