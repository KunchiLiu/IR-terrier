	<brief_title>First-line Everolimus +/- Paclitaxel for Cisplatin-ineligible Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study Patients will be enrolled into one of two parallel cohorts: - Cohort 1: impaired renal function AND poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days). Everolimus 10 mg orally daily - Cohort 2: impaired renal function OR poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days). Everolimus 10 mg orally daily + IV Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, 8, 15 Restaging evaluations will be performed after every 2 cycles. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Karnofsky performance status 60-70% Life Expectancy: Not specified Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 - Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL - Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3 - INR ≤ 1.5 (Anticoagulants are allowed if target INR ≤ 1.5 on a stable dose of warfarin or on a stable dose of Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for at least 2 weeks prior to registration for protocol therapy). - Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L - Fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN. - Fasting serum glucose &lt; 1.5 x ULN Hepatic: - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN - Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (unless liver metastases, then ≤ 5 x ULN) Renal: - Calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 using the Cockcroft-Gault formula Cardiovascular: - No symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV. - No unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological proof of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis (urothelial carcinoma). Histology may be mixed, but still requires a component of TCC. Measurable disease according to RECIST and obtained by imaging within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. Must be ineligible for cisplatin, based on the following, within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. Prior radiation therapy is allowed to &lt; 25% of the bone marrow. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information. Age &gt; 18 years at the time of consent. Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to use an effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the time consent is signed until 8 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to prior to registration for protocol therapy. Females must not be breastfeeding. No prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting is allowed if completed at least 12 months prior to registration for protocol therapy. No active CNS metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis. No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or adequately treated squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, Gleason ≤ grade 7 prostate cancers (treated definitively with no evidence of PSA progression), or other cancer for which the patient has been diseasefree for at least 5 years. No treatment with any anticancer therapy or investigational agent within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. No known hypersensitivity to any protocol treatment. No prior treatment with mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus). No history of immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week prior to registration for protocol therapy or during study period. No severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air. No uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN. No active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections. No liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis. No known history of HIV seropositivity. No impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection). No active, bleeding diathesis. No history of major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or significant traumatic injury within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy.</criteria>
