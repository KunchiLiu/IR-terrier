	<brief_summary>The investigators propose that the translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4GI may be involved in resolution of acute inflammation (regardless of age). Furthermore, the investigators suggest that differences in translation initiation factors state of activation may contribute to inflammation. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that differences in translation initiation factors state of activation may underlie the immune compromised state of the very elderly affording additional explanation for the heightened morbidity from infection in this group. In the current study the investigators aim to test these hypotheses by measuring the levels of eIF4E and eIF4G, their regulators, and targets in elderly (65-84yrs) and very elderly (85yrs&lt;) patients hospitalized at Meir hospital for acute infection and after their recovery (detailed in study design).</brief_summary>
