	<brief_summary>The intravenously administered taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, alone and in combination with other chemotherapy agents are active in patients with advanced and metastatic bladder cancer, and agents of this class are a promising treatment option for some patients. Tesetaxel is an orally administered taxane that is in development as treatment for subjects with advanced cancers. This study is being conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of tesetaxel administered to patients previously treated with chemotherapy for progressive metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.</brief_summary>
