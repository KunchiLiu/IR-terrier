	<detailed_description>Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined from demographic information, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests within 3 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study will be admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Urine collection is scheduled drug 24 hour before midazolam administration. Subjects will be dosed study drug via intravenous around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects performed scheduled procedures including clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and pharmacokinetic samplings. Subjects will be discharged on Day 2, and visited Clinical Trials Center on Day 5-7 for ketoconazole administration. Subjects will be admitted on Day 7 for period 2. Subjects performed scheduled period 2 (ketoconazole co-administration phase), and period 3 (rifampicin co-administration phase) procedure. Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 30-32).</detailed_description>
