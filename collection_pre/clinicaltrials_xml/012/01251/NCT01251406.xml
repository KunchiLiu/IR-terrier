	<brief_summary>The mortality of chronic heart failure patients remains high. Recombinant human Neuregulin-1 (rhNRG-1, also called Neucardin) is a 61 amino acid peptide that acts directly on damaged heart muscle cells to restore their structure and function. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of rhNRG-1 to treat stable chronic heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Human Neuregulin-1 to Treat Stable Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study will assess the safety and efficacy of rhNRG-1 also known as Neucardin as a treatment for stable chronic heart failure. A total of 120 subjects, who have chronic heart failure with a NYHA classification of II or III, and are on a stable regimen of ACEI/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), beta-blocker, and/or diuretic for at least 3 months prior to receiving study medication and anticipated to remain on the stable regimen through the treatment period can enroll as per specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be hospitalized for 10 days during the treatment period and will be infused subcutaneously with rhNRG-1 or placebo.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years. Male or female subjects. Have chronic heart failure defined as NYHA classification of II or III. Be on a stable regimen of ACEI/ARB and/or betablocker 3 months prior to receiving study medication and are expected to remain on a stable HF medication regime throughout the duration of the trial. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 35% as determined at screening by 2D echocardiography. Is able to understand and provide informed consent. If subject has dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease or corrected valvular heart disease, and had surgery to repair or replace value, the surgery must have been performed 3 months prior to receiving study medication and the surgical area is functioning normally. Proper birth control must be used at least 3 weeks prior to the study (women only), during the infusion period of study drug (men and women), 4weeks after study drug administration (men and women) and the remaining 11 months in the study followup (women). Women must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. No greater than mild pericardial effusion &lt; 0.5 cm on echocardiography (roughly corresponds to &lt; 100 mL). Have an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD). The ICD should have been implanted at least 3 months prior to receiving study medication. Patients should undergo interrogation of their ICDs between 1 and 7 days before randomization to drug for the previous thirty (30) days. This interrogation would include surveillance for ventricular arrhythmias as well as assessment of ICD discharge(s) and/or antitachycardia pacing. Has chronic heart failure classified as NYHA Class I or IV. Has a history of any malignancy or positive test as specified in the precancer screening. Have other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator preclude participation in the study, e.g. serious comorbidity, known or suspected substance abuse or noncompliance. Has a body weight &gt;350lbs. Has had any cause hospitalization 30 days prior to screening.</criteria>
