	<brief_summary>VEGF inhibition by BEV may induce a change in tumor invasiveness and treatment failure is often associated with remote metastases. BEV may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Cediranib, a pan-VEGF inhibitor has shown promising results in recurrent GBM. VEGF-blocking with small molecules may overcome the mechanism of resistance, and response to BIBF-1120 in such circumstances may open a new treatment option in GBM. In additional, recurrent glioblastomas have an extremely poor prognosis, so innovative therapies are needed.</brief_summary>

Persistence of clinically relevant therapy related toxicity from previous chemo and/or radiotherapy Treatment with other investigational drugs or treatment in another clinical trial within the past 4 weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with the trial Therapeutic anticoagulation( except lowdose heparin and/or heparin flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous devise) or antiplatelet therapy (except for lowdose therapy with acetylsalicylic acid&lt;325mg per day Major injuries within the past 10 days prior to start of study treatment with incomplete wound healing and/or planned surgery during the ontreatment study period History of clinically significant haemorrhagic or thromboembolic event in the past 6 months Known inherited predisposition to bleeding or thrombosis Significant cardiovascular diseases ( i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, history of infarction within the past 12 months prior to start of study treatment, congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II, serious cardiac arrhythmia, pericardial effusion) Proteinuria CTCAE grade 2 or greater Hepatic function: total bilirubin outside of normal limits; ALT or AST &gt; 1.5 ULN Coagulation parameters: International normalised ratio ( INR) &gt; 2, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; 50% of deviation of institutional ULN Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC) &lt; 1500/ml, platelets &lt; 100000/ml, Haemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dl Other malignancies within the past 5 years other then basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Active serious infections in particular if requiring systemic antibiotic or antimicrobial therapy Active or chronic hepatitis C and/or B infection Gastrointestinal disorders or abnormalities that would interfere with absorption of the study drug Serious illness or concomitant nononcological disease such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or active ulcers (gastrointestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.
