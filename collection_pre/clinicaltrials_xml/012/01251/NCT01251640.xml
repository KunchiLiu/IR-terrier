Phase I: Dose escalation study investigating 20, 30 and 50 mg BAY86-9766 plus gemcitabine (1000mg/m2); determination of maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose. Phase II: Determination of response (RECIST 1.1; primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints: response duration, disease control rate, time to progression, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability. Tumor assessments at Screening and than every 8 weeks.; Safety evaluations at Screening and weekly throughout the study; Safety follow-up visit 30 days after the last dose of study treatment; Survival follow up monthly for up to 8 month after LPFV.</brief_summary>
