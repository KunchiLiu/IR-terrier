	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study will assess the effect on disease remission of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) versus current best practice non-biologic DMARD therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who are randomly assigned to the RoActemra/Actemra treatment group will receive 8 mg/kg RoActemra/Actemra intravenously every 4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months.</brief_summary>
