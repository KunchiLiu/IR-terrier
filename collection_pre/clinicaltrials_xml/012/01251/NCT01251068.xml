	<brief_summary>Near infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility of noninvasive and continuous bedside investigation of cerebral oxygenation in newborn infants. Using this technique we investigated the relationship between changes in cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics, and changes in some physiological variables during blood transfusion in anaemic preterm infants.</brief_summary>
