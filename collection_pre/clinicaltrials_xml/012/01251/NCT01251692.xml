	<brief_title>Phototherapeutic Keratectomy (PTK) on Recurrent Corneal Erosions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective chart review of 26 eyes of 23 patients with recurrent corneal erosions treated by PTK from 1996 to 2000 was performed. All eyes had failed to respond to conventional therapy. Data regarding the preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), symptomatic relief, incidence of recurrence, and complications arising from the laser treatment were analyzed. The mean duration of symptoms prior to PTK was 18 months (range, 8 to 36 months). The corneal epithelium was debrided, and laser ablation was performed to a depth of 5 micron with an ablation zone of 7 to 9 mm, using the Technolas 217C Plano Scan excimer laser. Mean postoperative follow-up was 12 years (range, 10 to 14 years).</detailed_description>
