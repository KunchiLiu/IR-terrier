	<brief_summary>This is an assessment of efficacy and safety of three different doses of pegylated recombinant asparaginase (PEG-rASNase) in comparison to Oncaspar® during treatment of adults with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This study will provide first data for determining specific asparaginase doses to yield various durations of L-asparagine (ASN) depletion which are required within different treatment phases of ALL therapy.</brief_summary>
