	<brief_summary>PURPOSE The goal of the present project is to unravel the importance of bile acid-induced GLP-1 secretion (via the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5) in human physiology. In the present study the investigators examine the GLP-1 secretion in healthy subjects and cholecystectomised patients. Thereby the investigators aim to show, that cholecystectomised patients have reduced bileflow after a meal, and as a consequence exhibit a diminished GLP-1 response as compared to healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
