	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a relevant public health problem and obesity has been associated as the major risk factor. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is an effective method to treat severe obesity, and its metabolic benefits can lead to early and complete remission of T2DM, even before a considerable weight loss. We have hypothesized that intestinal anatomic changes may change intestinal genes expression related to glycemic control. The knowledge of mechanisms mediating the glycemic control after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and it site of action in bowel may eventually help to develop alternative, less invasive and safer surgery for the treatment of T2DM, as well as drug development for the newly targets identified.</brief_summary>
