	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to test whether a culturally-tailored in-office based intervention have impact on increasing Chinese physician's recommendation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to their nonadherent Chinese patients. Special aims are to: 1. Evaluate the efficacy of a culturally-tailored physician intervention on increasing non-adherent Chinese American's patients' CRC screening rate. 2. Identify factors that mediate or moderate the intervention effects. For example, patients who hold an eastern cultural view or are less acculturated will be more likely to benefit from the intervention than patients who hold a western view or who are more acculturated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Physician-Based Trial to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Chinese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial aiming to test the effect of the culturally-tailored in-office based intervention on physicians. A total of 24 Chinese physicians in the Washington DC and Philadelphia areas and a total of 24 eligible Chinese patients from each physician will be recruited for this study. Physicians and their patients are randomized into two groups: A and B. Physician in the intervention group (A) will receive mailed printed materials including a CRC physician guide, patient brochure, flip chart and a poster and two sessions of in-office training aimed to reinforce learning of the topic covered by the mailed materials and provide physicians with hands-on experience in using communication skills with standardized patients. Physicians in the control group (B) will receive nothing until the end of the study. Patients will be followed 12-month later after their completion of the baseline survey and their self-reported CRC screening status will be verified by chart audit.</detailed_description>
