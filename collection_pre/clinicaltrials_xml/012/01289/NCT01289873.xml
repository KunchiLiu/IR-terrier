	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how common oral HPV infections are in college women. The investigators also will find out what risk factors are associated with having oral HPV infections. The investigators hypothesize that approximately 3% of women will have oral HPV, and that HPV will be associated with oral sexual behaviors and with smoking behaviors. Finally, for those women with oral HPV- the investigators will determine whether the infections are persistent (still present) at 3-, 6-, and 12-months after the initial diagnosis.</brief_summary>
