	<brief_summary>This is a study to evaluate the efficacy (effectiveness) and the safety of regorafenib when given in combination with chemotherapy mFOLFOX6 as first line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). mFOLFOX6 is an approved chemotherapy. Regorafenib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) multi-targeted kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By specifically targeting these proteins, regorafenib may stop cancer growth. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning. The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the rate of response, i.e. the disease getting smaller. The aim is to show that the therapy of colorectal cancer with mFOLFOX6 in combination with regorafenib improves the response rate observed for the standard therapy only.</brief_summary>
