	<criteria>Male or female (nonchildbearing potential) subjects ≥ 18 years of age. Ability to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any trialrelated procedures, and ability, in the opinion of the principal investigator, to comply with all the requirements of the trial. Male and female subjects who are surgically sterile; female subjects who have been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone sample at Screening); or male subjects who agree to remain abstinent or to practice doublebarrier forms of birth control and refrain from sperm donation from trial Screening through 90 days from the last dose of the investigational medicinal product. Body weight within ± 35% of ideal body weight as defined in the 1983 Metropolitan Height and Weight Tables (see Appendix 4, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6). Minimum body weight no less than 50 kg. Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Normal Renal Function Subjects who are in good health as determined by a medical history, physical examination, serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, hepatitis B and C tests, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing. Creatinine clearance &gt; 80 mL/min indicating normal renal function. Inclusion Criteria for Renally Impaired Subjects Renally impaired subjects may be taking medications which, in the opinion of the clinical investigator and sponsor, are believed to be therapeutic for the subjects (but do not affect OPC34712 absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination). Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP2D6 are not allowed. Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min indicating severe renal impairment. Subjects with renal impairment should have relatively stable renal function as determined by creatinine clearance and otherwise be in generally good health. Clinically significant abnormality in past medical history, or at the screening physical examination, that in the investigator's or sponsor's opinion may place the subject at risk or interfere with outcome variables including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drug. Any surgical or medical condition (active or chronic) that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion, or any other condition that may place the subject at risk. History of drug and/or alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to Screening. A positive urine alcohol test and/or urine drug screen for substance of abuse at Screening or upon checkin to the trial site. The donation of blood or plasma within 30 days prior to dosing. Any history of significant bleeding or hemorrhagic tendencies. History of or current hepatitis or carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis C antibodies (antiHCV). History of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or determined human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive at Screening. Use of an investigational drug or product, or participation in a drug trial within 30 days prior to dosing. Previous exposure to OPC34712. History of clinically significant drug allergies or sensitivities. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to administration of trial medication for all female subjects. Subjects who have a supine pulse rate, after resting for ≥ 3 minutes, outside the range of 40 to 90 bpm. The sponsor may allow exceptions if they are not deemed clinically significant. Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Subjects Clinically significant abnormal findings in the serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results obtained at Screening or Day 1. Use of prescription, overthecounter, herbal medication or vitamin supplements within 14 days prior to dosing and antibiotics within 30 days prior to dosing. The sponsor may allow exceptions only if the medication's administration is deemed unlikely to impact the pharmacokinetic result. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP2D6 are not allowed. Subjects who have supine, sitting, or standing blood pressure, after resting for ≥ 3 minutes, higher than 130/80 mmHg or lower than 100/50 mmHg. The sponsor may allow exceptions if they are not deemed clinically significant. Exclusion Criteria for Renally Impaired Subjects Subjects that have undergone a renal transplant. Renally impaired subjects may be taking medications which, in the opinion of the clinical investigator and sponsor, are believed to be therapeutic for the subjects (but do not affect OPC34712 absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination). Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP2D6 are not allowed. Clinically significant abnormal findings in the serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results obtained at Screening or Day 1, other than those associated with underlying renal conditions and other stable medical conditions consistent with the disease processes. Subject requiring dialysis or expected to require dialysis within 45 days. Subjects who have supine, sitting, or standing blood pressure, after resting for ≥ 3 minutes, higher than 160/95 mmHg or lower than 100/50 mmHg. The sponsor may allow exceptions if they are not deemed clinically significant. Subjects with evidence of delirium. Clinically relevant changes on electrocardiogram such as any atrioventricular block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec (for both male and female subjects), or with a QTcF interval ≥ 450 msec. Any subject who, in the opinion of the sponsor or the investigator, should not participate in the trial. Consumption of alcohol and/or food and beverages containing methylxanthines, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, or Seville orange juice within 72 hours prior to dosing. Use of any drug known or suspected of inhibiting or stimulating hepatic drug metabolism enzymes within 30 days prior to Screening. Exposure to any substances known to stimulate hepatic microsomal enzymes within 30 days prior to Screening through the end of the trial (eg, occupational exposure to pesticides, organic solvents). History of serious mental disorders. Major surgery of the digestive tract (excluding appendectomy).</criteria>
