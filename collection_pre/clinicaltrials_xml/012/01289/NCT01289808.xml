	<brief_summary>Glucose has analgesic and calming effects in newborns. To date, it is not known whether the beneficial effects extend to care giving procedures that are performed after painful procedures. The investigators objective is to determine the effect of glucose 25% analgesia for procedural pain on infant pain responses during a subsequent care giving procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Infant Response To A Routine Care Procedure After Glucose 25% Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain in the newborn and young infant is a source of stress for the infant, family and care providers. During hospitalization, a neonate undergoes a number of necessary procedures that may be either painful or cause discomfort to the baby. Pain experienced during the neonatal period is known to have long term effects on the baby. The red-reflex test is a routine examination performed on a neonate after birth and once again before discharge from the hospital. The examination causes discomfort to the infant. Glucose has analgesic and calming effects in newborns. To date, it is not known whether the beneficial effects extend to care giving procedures that are performed after painful procedures. Our objective is to determine the effect of glucose 25% analgesia for procedural pain on infant pain responses during a subsequent care giving procedure.</detailed_description>
