	<brief_title>Endothelial Function and Progenitor Cells in Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endothelial dysfunction is a key component of atherosclerosis which contributes to the development of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. However, endothelial dysfunction (ED) is not established as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. As a novelty the proposed trial investigates the following variety of indirect markers of endothelial function in acute ischemic stroke: circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), endothelial microparticles (EMP), ENDOPAT (RH- PAT ratio) in two regards: 1. time after ischemic events (&lt; 48h, Days 4-5, day 7 or at discharge) 2. etiological stroke subtypes It is not known whether these parameters are changed after acute cerebral ischemia and could possibly serve as specific target for treatment.</detailed_description>
