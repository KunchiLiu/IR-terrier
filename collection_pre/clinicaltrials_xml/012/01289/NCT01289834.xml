	<brief_summary>The purpose of this scientific study is to compare early migration of hip prostheses in respect to the bone in order to determine whether there is a clinical difference between the two investigated bone cements (which one is best suited for cementation of hip prostheses).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Migration and Bone Density Study Comparing Hi-Fatigue Bone Cement and Palacos Bone Cement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled clinical trial on 50 hybrid hips age above 70 years to the described two surgical procedures will be performed at Aarhus University hospital by two orthopaedic consultants. Randomization in 10 blocks of ten patients distributed with five patients for Palacos Cement and five patients for Hi-Fatigue Cement. - 25 CPT femoral stems fixed with Hi-Fatigue Bone Cement. - 25 CPT femoral stems fixed with Palacos Bone Cement. All patients will be operated by the postero-lateral approach. The post-operative treatment and training will not differ from the standard.</detailed_description>
