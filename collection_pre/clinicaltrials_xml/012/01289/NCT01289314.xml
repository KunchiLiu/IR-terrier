	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the occurrence and intensity of pelvic pain as well as patient satisfaction and quality of life after total laparoscopic and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. Design: Prospective randomised trial. Null hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference in occurrence and intensity of pelvic pain following TLH compared with following LSH. Null hypothesis 2: There is no significant difference in patient satisfaction and quality of life following TLH compared with following LSH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Outcomes Following Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Laparoscopic Supracervical Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample: 62 consecutive premenopausal women referred to the department for hysterectomy on the basis of a benign condition. The expected mean pain reduction (m) in the LSH group: 3.32, sd (s): 2.71.24 A difference in mean pain reduction (d) equal to 1 sd is considered a clinically important improvement (standardised difference d/s=1). Number of women required (power 90 % and a level of significance 0.05): 62 patients. Methods: The study participants are randomised to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 31), or laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (n = 31).</detailed_description>
