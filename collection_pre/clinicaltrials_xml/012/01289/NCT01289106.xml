	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study include 1) to compare the seroconversion rate of an intensive standard-dose regimen (0, 1, 2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (0,1 and 6 months), and 2) to compare the seroconversion rate of an intensive double-dose regimen (40 μg at 0,1,2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (20 μg at 0,1 and 6 months) of HBV vaccine in HIV-infected adult patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Dose and Schedule of Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccination in HIV-infected Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV and HBV share similar risk factors and routes of transmission. HIV/HBV coinfection is associated with greater chance of chronic HBV carrier state, higher level of HBV replication and increasing its potential for transmission. Currently, there are no concrete data to determine the best HBV vaccination schedule in HIV-infected patients. Standard HBV vaccination (20 μg at 0, 1 and 6 months) gives seroconversion rate of 33-63% in HIV-infected individuals compared with &gt;90% in healthy individuals. This study aims to compare the efficacy of an intensive standard-dose regimen (0, 1, 2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (0,1 and 6 months) and to compare the seroconversion rate of an intensive double-dose regimen (40 μg at 0,1,2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (20 μg at 0,1 and 6 months) of HBV vaccine in HIV-infected adult patients with CD4 level above 200 permm3 and suppressed viral load.</detailed_description>
