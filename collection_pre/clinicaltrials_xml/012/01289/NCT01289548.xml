	<brief_title>Effect of Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning on Renal Function in Patients Undergoing Living Donor Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induced renal failure after kidney transplantation is a common clinical problem associated with a high morbidity and mortality. To reduce the adverse effects of IRI after organ transplantation various strategies aimed at the different pathophysiological processes of IRI have been investigated. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is one such strategy where brief IRI of one organ protects other organs from sustained IRI. Many studies have shown that RIPC protects heart, muscle flaps, stomach, liver, lungs, and kidneys from IRI. RIPC of the limb with a tourniquet is a safe and convenient method of preconditioning organs against IRI. However, the efficacy of RIPC in patients undergoing living donor kidney transplantation need to be established and mechanism of early and late RIPC, such as whether the donor should undergo remote preconditioning or the recipient, need to be investigated.</detailed_description>
