	<brief_summary>Patients for whom treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin was unsuccessful represent a category of patients for whom there is currently no worthwhile therapeutic alternative. Several studies have shown that there is a relation between plasma ribavirin concentrations and treatment response. Adequate ribavirin plasma concentrations, especially during the first 12 weeks of treatment, should be associated with a better chance of response to the treatment. The strategy for this study will be to use a loading dose of ribavirin before beginning the treatment with peg-interferon, thereby allowing for optimal ribavirin concentrations to be reached, and possibly improving the effectiveness of the treatment.</brief_summary>
