	<brief_summary>Precise activity assessment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is essential to determine the extent and severity of the disease for further specific therapy. Nevertheless, despite ongoing developments in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, the final diagnosis still relies on the interpretation of histopathological features of intestinal biopsies taken during the endoscopic examination. Recently, endocytoscopy (EC) was introduced as a new endoscopic imaging modality, enabling microscopic imaging within the mucosal layer of the gut at a magnification level of up to 1400-fold.</brief_summary>
