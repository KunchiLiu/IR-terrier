	<brief_summary>This is a prospective multi-center, open-label, single arm, Phase II study to investigate the safety and efficacy of BKM120 in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma whose disease progressed on or after a first-line antineoplastic treatment. Patients will receive BKM120 orally at a dose of 100 mg/day. Availability of tumor specimen (either archival tissue or a fixed fresh biopsy) is mandatory for assessment of the PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) pathway activation status.</brief_summary>
