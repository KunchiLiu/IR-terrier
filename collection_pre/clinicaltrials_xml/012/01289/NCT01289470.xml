	<brief_summary>An observational study designed to evaluate the performance of a new Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) tissue oximeter device in the clinical setting, including a cerebral sensor and peripheral sensor. Fifty patients who are undergoing open-heart surgery will be enrolled and tissue oximetry measurement will be collected throughout the surgical procedure and for up to 24 hours following surgery. Tissue oximeter measurement of the brain and skeletal tissue will be added to the standard intra-operative patient monitoring. Measures of delirium will be collected using a standardized questionnaire. The relationship between cerebral oximetry measures and delirium scores will be explored.</brief_summary>
