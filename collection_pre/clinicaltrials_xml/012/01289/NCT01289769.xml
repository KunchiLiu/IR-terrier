	<brief_title>The Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Hemodynamic Response During Double Lumen Endotracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation are mediated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The hemodynamic responses resulting from sympathetic nervous system stimulation are tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, increased intraocular pressure, increased intracranial pressure, bronchospasm and myocardial ischemia. Tachycardia is one of the major predictor of intraoperative myocardial ischemia and causes an imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Although hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and intubation is transient, these effect may be harmful to patients suffering from myocardial and cerebrovascular diseases. The placement of double lumen endotracheal tube may produce similar or greater pressor response than endotracheal tube because of larger sizes and greater carinal stimulation.</detailed_description>
