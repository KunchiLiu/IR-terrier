	<brief_title>SMART: A Social and Mobile Weight Control Program for Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The focus of the SMART study is to develop an intervention to promote weight loss in overweight or obese young adults. The investigators will recruit college and university students to evaluate the effects of SMART on weight status and other metabolic, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes up to and including 24 months. The Primary aim of the study is to evaluate between condition differences in weight status at 24 months. Secondary aims will assess the impact of the SMART intervention on: Diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, quality of life and depression at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months; Anthropometric measures (BP, waist circumference) at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months; Differences in weight status at 6, 18 and 24 months; Level of satisfaction and amount of use of the intervention components. These aims will be applied to overweight/obese young adults. Among overweight/obese young adults, the investigators will determine whether SMART produces weight loss.</detailed_description>
