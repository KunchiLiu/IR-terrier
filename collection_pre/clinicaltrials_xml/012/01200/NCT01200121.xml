	<brief_summary>Malignant ascites represents a severe clinical problem for physicians and patients being confronted with this common symptom of advanced-stage gastrointestinal cancer. Unfortunately, there is no standardized and evidence-based treatment for malignant ascites and therapies which are commonly being used are only temporarily effective. Newer modes of therapy, such as the application of the tri-functional antibody catumaxomab, are associated with significant side effects and are limited to patients in stages of good overall performance. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for more effective, longer-lasting, and less toxic modes of treatment for peritoneal effusions caused by gastrointestinal cancers. Preclinical data strongly suggest that bevacizumab might be a very effective agent for the treatment of malignant ascites, which is in large part caused by the hyperpermeability-promoting factor VEGF. Emerging clinical results from cancer patients with malignant ascites treated with bevacizumab add further support to this idea. Bevacizumab has been tested in a variety of large clinical trials, has a good toxicity profile, and is effective in a number of human cancers underlying malignant ascites. In the present study, Bevacizumab will be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion at an absolute standardized dosage of 400 mg. This dosage was chosen because it is comparable to the approved standard dosage for intravenous administration which was also used in both studies reporting the successful and safe intraperitoneal administration of Bevacizumab to patients with malignant ascites. Finally, a standardized dosage seems more practical in the particular patient population treated in this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age &gt;= 18 years 2. Written informed consent has been obtained prior to inclu¬sion into the study 3. Patient is capable and willing to comply with the study 4. Histologically confirmed esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, cholangiocellular, hepatocellular, or colorectal carcinoma 5. Cytologically confirmed ascites OR diagnosis of an exsudate (total protein in ascites &gt; 30 g/l) clinically suggestive for malignant ascites OR morphological diagnosis of peritoneal carcinosis by CT , MRT or ultrasound 6. Ascites clinically judged as not responsive to conventional systemic therapies for primary malignancy 7. Ascites clinically judged as not responsive to diuretics 8. At the time of inclusion paracentesis required at least twice within past 4 weeks. 9. Before inclusion of the patient into the study, a 4week screening period will allow for a stringent evaluation of the patient regarding fulfillment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Importantly, no treatments for malignant ascites other than paracentesis and diuretics are allowed during the 4week screening period. 10. ECOG performance score 03 11. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks 12.

Patients with &gt;= 2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis, who demonstrate &lt; 2.0 g of protein/24 h on 24h urine collection 1. Concomitant malignancies other than gastrointestinal cancers (Patients with curatively treated basal and squamous cell carcino¬ma of the skin and / or insitu carci¬noma of the cervix are eli¬gible). 2.

Transudative ascites (total protein in ascites &lt; 30 g/l) 5. Parallel treatment with antitumor agents other than the study medication from inclusion into the study until safety followup. Chemotherapy may be continued if started before screening phase ( 4 weeks before inclusion). Parallel Treatment with Bevacizumab i.v. is not allowed. 6. Therapy naïve patients 7.

With the only exception of full dose (INR &gt; 1.5) oral coumarinderived anticoagulants, the use of full dose anticoagulants is allowed as long as the INR or a PTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard in the institution) and the patient has been on a stable dose for at least two weeks at the time of randomisation. 26.
