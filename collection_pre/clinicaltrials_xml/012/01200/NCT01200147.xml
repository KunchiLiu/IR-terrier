	<brief_summary>Dysphagia is a common reason for referal to the investigators Gastoenterology service. As many as 14% of patients undergoing radiological studies for dysphagia are found to have schatzki rings. Current recommendations for treatment of patients with symptomatic Schatzki rings are based on ancedotal experience and uncontrolled studies. The only randomized study on comparison of techniques the investigators were able to locate was published in 2000 and included only 26 patients. This study demonstrated that the biopsy techinque was as effective as and better tolerated than the standard dilation technique. Considering that the cost and time required for dilatation is greater than the basic biopsy technique, significant cost savings could be achieved using the biopsy technique. As well, patient satisfaction is an important factor considering that Schatzki rings can recur and repeated endoscopy is often required. Therefore, a study that shows a technique to be as or better than the current standard in effectiveness, cost, time, and patient comfort could lead to shift in current practice.</brief_summary>
