	<brief_summary>In summary, the investigators propose to integrate fMRI assessments within a clinical trial of quetiapine XR in patients with melancholic depression in order to test the predictions that: 1. quetiapine XR treatment will be effective and safe for patients with major depression with melancholic features 2. successful treatment with quetiapine XR will be associated with normalization of limbic areas associated with increased salivary cortisol response to a stressful task as well as normalization on the emotional faces task differences in the melancholic group compared with healthy volunteers. 3. successful treatment with quetiapine XR will be associated with normalization of the salivary cortisol response to the stressful math task (i.e. there will be a diminished post-treatment mean AUC for cortisol secretion after the stress task compared to the pre-treatment AUC values in the patient group)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with major depression (N=20) will be recruited for the 8-week clinical trial of quetiapine XR 100 - 300 mg (flexible dosing). Patients who consent to participate will be referred for an initial fMRI scanning session prior to the initiation of quetiapine XR. Baseline fMRI will be obtained during the index assessment prior to initiating quetiapine XR therapy and then will be re-acquired at the final study visit at 8 weeks (the time of scheduled visits). Ten demographically matched healthy subjects will receive the same fMRI investigations on two occasions in order to provide a healthy baseline comparison to permit interpretation of the patient findings (e.g., whether initial and final fMRI measures in patients are abnormal and to control for any adaptation to the task that may normally occur).</detailed_description>
