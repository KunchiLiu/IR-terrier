	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of posaconazole and micafungin in preventing fungal infections after chemotherapy for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. When people take chemotherapy, they are more likely to get infections. Posaconazole has been approved for the prevention of fungal infections in patients who receive induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Posaconazole is available only as an oral suspension and has to be given with food. After chemotherapy, many patients are not able to tolerate food or oral medication because of severe mucositis. Patients unable to tolerate food and oral medications cannot take posaconazole. Micafungin is an antifungal medication that is given only intravenously. Micafungin is approved for the treatment of certain fungal infections and for preventing fungal infections in patients who receive bone marrow transplant. The investigators know that micafungin is safe. Micafungin has not been tested for the prevention of fungal infections in patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Because micafungin is given by vein, it can be given even in patients who cannot take food or medications by mouth after chemotherapy. In this study the investigators want to compare micafungin to posaconazole when given for the prevention of fungal infections in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects of greater than or equal to 18 years of age of either sex and of any race. Disease definition: Anticipated or documented prolonged neutropenia (ANC&lt;500/mm3 [0.5x109/L]) at baseline or likely to develop within 3 to 5 days and lasting for at least 7 days due to: Intensive induction chemotherapy for new diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving standard anthracycline based chemotherapy Reinduction of acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia after primary relapse Myelodysplastic syndromes requiring induction (myelosuppressive) chemotherapy Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test as per MSKCC guidelines. Able to swallow oral medications Subjects with history of presumed or proven invasive fungal infection within 30 days of randomization. Subjects who are taking the following: Drugs known to interact with posaconazole and that may lead to lifethreatening side effects (terfenadine, cisapride, and ebastine at entry or within 24 hours before entry, or astemizole at entry or within 10 days before entry); b. Drugs known to lower the serum concentration/efficacy of posaconazole: cimetidine, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, barbiturates, and isoniazid at entry or within 24 hours before entry; c. Subjects who are planned to receive &gt; 2mg flat dose of vinca alkaloids. Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to azole agents. Subjects with renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance less than 20 mL/minute at baseline or likely to require dialysis during the study). Subjects having an electrocardiogram with a prolonged QTc interval by manual reading: QTc greater than 490 msec. Subjects with moderate or severe liver dysfunction at baseline, defined as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or a total bilirubin level greater than 3 times the ULN. Subjects who are undergoing reinduction chemotherapy and have participated in this study during their first induction chemotherapy. Subjects who will be receiving dasatinib.</criteria>
