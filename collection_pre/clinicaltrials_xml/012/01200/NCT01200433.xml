	<brief_summary>The investigators will evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on cerebral blood flow and brain oxygenation during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery. Specifically, the investigators will test the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine is non-inferior to propofol for cerebral blood flow as measured by transcranial Doppler and brain oxygenation as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy.</brief_summary>
