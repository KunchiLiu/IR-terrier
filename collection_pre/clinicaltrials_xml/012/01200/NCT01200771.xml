	<brief_summary>Fever of unknown origin (FUO) and chronic inflammatory syndrome could be seen in many affections. The diagnostic process is still a challenge and could not be specified yet after several clinical studies performed by trained teams using two levels diagnostic procedures. For this reason, the diagnosis involves many additional and expensive tests such as computed tomography (CT scan), scintigraphic imaging, endoscopy, biopsy. There is no evidence-based recommendation for the diagnostic work-up of FUO or chronic inflammatory syndrome. Positron emission tomography with 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose combined with CT scan (FDG-PET/CT) is widely used in malignant diseases and seems to be promising for the diagnosis of inflammatory disorders. Its role has not been yet clearly defined in the investigation of FUO and chronic inflammatory syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of the PET in the Diagnosis Strategy of FUO or Inflammatory Syndrome in Immunocompetent Patients FUO-TEP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients with FUO and chronic inflammatory syndrome will undergo FDG-PET/CT and conventional morphologic imaging modalities. Results of these two diagnostic procedures in identifying diagnostic clues will be compared. We assume FDG-PET/CT could be safer and more helpful to reach early final diagnosis in patients with FUO and chronic inflammatory syndrome than conventional morphologic imaging modalities</detailed_description>
