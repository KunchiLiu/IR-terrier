	<brief_title>Effect of Additional Clofazimine on Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) Reactions in Leprosy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clofazimine is an anti-bacterial agent used to treat leprosy; it is a normal component of WHO-recommended multi-drug therapy (MDT). It is also known to have a beneficial effect in one of the common immunological reactions that occur in leprosy, known as erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL. When MDT was reduced in length from 24 to 12 months, evidence suggests that ENL became worse. This study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial examining the effect of giving an additional year of clofazimine after completion of MDT. The endpoints are the incidence and severity of ENL over a period of 3 years in the 2 groups.</detailed_description>
