	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a) and ribavirin in genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who relapsed after previous interferon (IFN)-based therapy in Japan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of TMC435 in Genotype 1, Hepatitis C-infected Patients Who Relapsed After Previous Interferon (IFN)-Based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination with the standard of care (SoC), PegIFNα-2a (P) and ribavirin (R), in adult, genotype 1 HCV-infected participants who relapsed after previous IFN-based therapy in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of TMC435 by the percentage of participants with undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). Participants will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus PR followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with PR. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally (via the mouth). Treatment with PR will last 24 or 48 weeks. Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0 mL solution with 180 µg PegIFNα-2a and will be injected by a syringe under the skin once weekly. Ribavirin is given as 200-mg tablets (daily dose: 600-1000 mg), taken orally two times a day after meals. The participants will receive oral capsules of TMC435 (100 mg) once daily up to Week 12.</detailed_description>
