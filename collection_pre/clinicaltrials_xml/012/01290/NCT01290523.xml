	<criteria>Diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with liverdominant disease. Diagnosis may be made by histo or cytopathology, or by clinical and imaging criteria. The cancer is unresectable. All patients must be off all chemotherapeutic regimens for 30 days prior to and 30 days after TheraSphere treatment. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02. Age 18 years or older. Able to understand informed consent. Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of radiation to the lungs on either: single TheraSphere administration; or cumulative delivery of radiation to the lungs greater than 50 Gy over multiple treatments. Evidence of any detectable Tc99m macroaggregated albumin flow to the stomach or duodenum, after application of established angiographic techniques to stop such flow. Previous radiation therapy to the lungs and/or to the upper abdomen Pregnancy Symptomatic lung disease. Significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent lifethreatening outcome. Active uncontrolled infection Any pretreatment laboratory findings within 30 days of treatment demonstrating: Aspartate or alanine aminotransferase level greater than 5 times upper normal limit. Serum bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dl Infiltrative tumor on imaging Tumor volume greater than 70% of liver volume Tumor volume greater than 50% of liver volume and serum albumin level less than 3 mg/dL</criteria>
