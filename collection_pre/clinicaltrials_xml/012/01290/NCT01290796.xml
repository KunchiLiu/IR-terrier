	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Ajust™ in Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence (UI), or the complaint of any involuntary loss of urine, ranges in severity from the occasional leaking urine during actions resulting in increased abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercise, etc.) to sudden, unpredictable strong urges to void. Female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is attributed to a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. A recent review of literature describing the prevalence of UI calculated the median prevalence of female UI to be 27.6% (4.8-58.4%), with the prevalence of significant incontinence increasing with age. The prevalent cause of UI was further categorized into stress (50%), mixed (32%) and urge (14%). Nonsurgical treatment of female SUI has traditionally been limited to alpha-adrenergic agonists and estrogens, pelvic floor exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and behavior modification1. Options for surgical treatment consists of periurethral injections of bulking agents, transvaginal suspensions, retropubic suspensions, slings and sphincter prostheses. The Ajust™ Adjustable Single-Incision Sling is a fully adjustable single-incision sling that anchors in the transobturator membranes, anatomically sufficient spaces for support of the urethra.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female, age at least 18 years Have signed an Informed Consent Form Has been diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence as documented by: a minimum 30degree urethral deflection, considered to be a candidate for transobturator repair by consulting surgeon (investigator), has a positive CST Desires surgical correction of SUI using the Ajust™ Adjustable SingleIncision Sling Patient is actively participating in any other genitourinary clinical trial of an experimental drug or device Patient is known to be pregnant or desiring future childbearing Patient has a known urinary tract infection, or known infection in the operative field at the time of device implantation Patient is unable to have their anticoagulation therapy suspended for the completion of the surgical procedure Patient requires concurrent correction of pelvic organ prolapse Patient has a history of previous sling procedure Patient has known history of detrusor overactivity demonstrated by urodynamics Patient has known urinary retention Patient has a current genitourinary fistula or urinary diverticulum Patient has a prior history of pelvic radiation Patient has a MESA urge symptom score (% of total possible urge score) that is greater than their MESA stress symptom score (% of total possible stress score) Any condition in the opinion of the Investigator that would preclude the use of the Ajust™ Adjustable SingleIncision Sling, or preclude the subject from completing the followup requirements</criteria>
