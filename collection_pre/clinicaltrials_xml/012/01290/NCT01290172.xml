	<brief_summary>This study is a 5 day, single-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Somatostatin used as inflow modulator in liver transplantation. Patient systemic and hepatic dynamics will be collected and recorded at predefined time-points. To evaluate the ischemia-reperfusion injury, it is planned to perform liver biopsies at two different time-points to compare the liver structure and proteomic variations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent Cirrhotic patients with established clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) defined as an increase in hepatic venous pressure gradient &gt;= 10 mmHg Recipients who are 1870 years of age receiving a primary liver transplant from a brain dead donor or living donor Whole liver grafts and partial liver grafts can be included Patients who are recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, or have previously received an organ or tissue transplant that may not be completely resolved by thrombectomy HIV positive patients Patients with known history of portal thrombosis or diagnosed at the time of transplantation that may not be completely resolved by thrombectomy. Patients included in the preoperative assessment without a CSPH at the time of the first intraoperative measurement of portal pressure Patients with low portal perfusion (=&lt; 90 ml/min*100 g of LV) measured at the time of operation. Portal flows above this limit can be excluded in the eventuality that, after infusion, the portal perfusion falls below this limit Patients with portopulmonary hypertension Patients with known cardiac arrhythmias Recipients of cardiacdead donors Fulminant hepatic failure patients</criteria>
