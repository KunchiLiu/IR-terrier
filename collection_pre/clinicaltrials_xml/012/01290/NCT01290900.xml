	<brief_summary>This is a single dose study in healthy male volunteers to investigate the effect of high doses of ceftazidime NXL104 (CAZ104) or ceftaroline fosamil NXL104 (CXL104) on the QT interval</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision of signed informed consent prior to any study specific procedures Healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years (inclusive) with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture Have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2 and a body weight between 60 and 100 kg Be a nonsmoker or exsmoker who has stopped smoking (or using other nicotine products) for more than 3 months prior to the start of the study History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in the study Any clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, clinical chemistry, haematology or urinalysis results as judged by the Investigator Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest, defined as any of the following: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 mmHg, Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg, Heart rate less than 40 or greater than 85 beats per minute at Visit 1 Prolonged QTcF &gt;450 ms or shortened QTcF &lt;340 ms Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes. This includes volunteers with any of the following: Clinically significant PR (PQ) interval prolongation, Intermittent second or third degree AV block (Mobitz II type 1, Wenchebach during sleep is not disqualifying), Incomplete, full or intermittent bundle branch block (QRS less than 110 ms with normal QRS and T wave morphology is acceptable if there is no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy), Abnormal T wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead</criteria>
