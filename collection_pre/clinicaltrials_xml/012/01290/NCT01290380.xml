	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of ASA404 on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism on the respective probe drugs caffeine, diclofenac, simvastatin, and omeprazole, respectively. This will be accomplished by the simultaneous administration of four substrates as part of a cocktail in order to characterize the potential for in-vivo drug-drug interactions. This cocktail approach has been proposed per FDA guidance as a screening tool for potential in-vivo drug-drug interactions Compared to the individual administration of specific probes in multiple studies, simultaneous administration of multiple in-vivo probes of drug-metabolizing enzymes offer several distinct advantages such as minimizing the confounding influence of inter-individual and intra-individual variability over time. Substrates for the CYP enzymes were chosen based on the FDA guidance recommendations taking into account that 1. The substrates are specific for the individual CYP enzymes, 2. There are no interactions among these substrates; and 3. The study will be conducted in a sufficient number of subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologicallyproven and radiologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom treatment with an investigational agent alone or in combination with docetaxel or placlitaxel +carboplatin is appropriate; Body Mass Index (BMI) must be within the range of 1830; A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed since the last treatment with other cancer therapies, (i.e. endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, ect); Willing and able to remain in the clinic for at least 2 days (the night before dosing and the night after dosing 24 hours) for the 3 x's receiving the cocktail (on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 during the Patients having CNS metastases. (Patients having any clinical signs of CNS metastases must have a CT or MRI of the brain performed to rule out CNS metastases in order to be eligible for the study participation. Patients who have had brain metastases surgically removed or irradiated with no active residual disease confirmed by imaging are allowed) Patients who have not recovered from all acute radiotherapyrelated toxicities; Prior exposure to Vascular Disrupting Agents (VDAs) or other vascular targeting agents Right bundle branch block (RBBB), complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), bifascicular block (right bundle branch block with either left anterior hemiblock or left posterior hemiblock) Concomitant use of drugs with a risk of QT prolongation and/or causing torsade de pointes If patient will be treated with paclitaxel: Known allergy or hypersensitivity to platinumcontaining drugs, taxanes, other drugs formulated in Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) or any known excipients of these drugs Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions while taking paclitaxel and therefore are not considered effective contraceptive methods for this study when used as a single agent. Patients taking oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives who are not willing or otherwise unable to use a concomitant barrier method will be excluded. The Investigator shall counsel the patient accordingly.
