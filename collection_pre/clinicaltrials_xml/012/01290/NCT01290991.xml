	<detailed_description>Subjects will be 18 to 40 years with an osteochondral defects of the knee.They will be candidates for allograft and Augment Bone Graft will be added to the procedure. The safety of Augment Bone Graft plus allograft for osteochondral defects of the knee will be evaluated by type, frequency, severity and relatedness of adverse events to the device for a minimum of 24 weeks.Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be performed at 1,12 and 42 weeks to evaluate device integrity and surgical treatment of osteochondral defects. Computed tomography will be done at week 1 and week 24 to determine the healing status of the osteochondral defect.</detailed_description>
