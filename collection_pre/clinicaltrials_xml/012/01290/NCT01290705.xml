	<brief_title>Dosage-dependence of Graded Exercise Therapy in Patients With Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise therapy is widely used in the conservative treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), but there is still no consensus on recommending any specific rehabilitation program. This study evaluates two different therapeutic exercise regimens in patients with PFPS and their effect on pain at rest and function. Supervised exercise therapy will be applied in both groups three times a week over a 3-month period with individually tailored and graded exercise programs, differing between groups in terms of number of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, and time spent on performing aerobic exercises.</detailed_description>
