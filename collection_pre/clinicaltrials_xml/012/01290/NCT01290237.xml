	<brief_summary>Vancomycin is an antibiotic administered to children or adults for many types of infections. While it has been used to treat infections of children for more than 50 years we are still not completely certain about the best dose to use when starting treatment with this medication. This study is intended to evaluate whether giving a new higher dose of vancomycin for the first dose will help us get to the desired amount in the body more quickly then the usual first dose. Half of the patients would get the new higher dose and the other half of patients will get the typical first dose. Only the first dose is changed and all doses that follow are the same in both groups and are doses typically used for children.</brief_summary>
