	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Scrambler therapy may help relieve pain from peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MC5-A scrambler therapy works in reducing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MC5-A Scrambler Therapy in Reducing Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the feasibility of studying scrambler therapy versus a sham procedure for the alleviation of lower extremity chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain prospective pilot experience with recommended scrambler therapy, with regards to treatment efficacy to determine effect size estimates, patient related outcome measurement tools that we use in this trial, tolerability, and analgesic use. OUTLINE: Patients undergo a sham procedure on the back or scrambler therapy on both lower extremities for up to 30 minutes with the Calmare MC5-A device and cutaneous electrode patches applied above and below the area of pain on days 1 and 2. Patients continue scrambler therapy for 10 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Received neurotoxic chemotherapy (including taxanessuch as paclitaxel or docetaxel, or platinumbased compounds such as carboplatin or cisplatinum or oxaliplatin, or vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine, or vinorelbine, or proteosome inhibitors such as bortezomib); Note: this neurotoxic chemotherapy must have been completed more than 3 months prior to when they enter this trial Pain or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in the feet of &gt;= 1 month (30 days) duration attributed to chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy, for which the patient wants intervention Participants have to relate that numbness, tingling or pain in their toes/feet was at least a four out of ten problem during the prior week, on a 010 scale where zero was no problem and ten was the worst possible problem Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) = 0, 1, or 2 Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months (90 days) Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance Provide informed written consent No change in scheduled analgesic agents for at least one week Pregnant women CIPN troubles in the lower extremities more proximal to the mid calf Patients with implantable drug delivery systems, e.g. Medtronic Synchromed Patients with heart stents or metal implants such as pacemakers, automatic defibrillators, aneurysm clips, vena cava clips and skull plates; (metal implants for orthopedic repair, e.g. pins, clips, plates, cages, joint replacements are allowed as are central venous access devices) Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within the past six months Patients with history of epilepsy, brain damage, use of anticonvulsants, symptomatic brain metastases Other identified causes of painful lower extremity paresthesias existing prior to chemotherapy (e.g., radiation or malignant plexopathy, lumbar or cervical radiculopathy, preexisting peripheral neuropathy of another etiology: B12 deficiency, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome [AIDS], monoclonal gammopathy, diabetes, heavy metal poisoning amyloidosis, syphilis, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, inherited neuropathy, etc.) Skin conditions such as open sores that would prevent proper application of the electrodes Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigators might compromise the objectives of the study Prior treatment with Calmare MC5A therapy for any reason or knowledge of application procedure</criteria>
