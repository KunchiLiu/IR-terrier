	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a new orange juice-based beverage enriched in fiber and selected phenolic compounds (mainly flavanones) on features of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk factors related to inflammation and antioxidant defense system in overweight and obese adult humans. This study hypothesizes that consumption of an orange juice-based beverage enriched in fiber and selected phenolic compounds (mainly flavanones)would improve lipid levels and lipid metabolism,blood pressure and the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) index.</brief_summary>
