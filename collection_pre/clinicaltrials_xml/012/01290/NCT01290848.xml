	<brief_summary>This project will evaluate the effectiveness of the Take TIME health promotion campaign. The Take TIME (Tobacco free, Injury free, Moving daily, Eating healthy) campaign will target parents and caregivers of children up to 8 years of age. The study will help answer the following research questions 1. Are community organizations able and willing to deliver a health-promotion campaign targeting young children? 2. What impact does the Take TIME campaign have on the readiness of the community to support healthy childhoods? 3. What impact does the Take TIME campaign have on awareness and achievement of healthier lifestyles for young children? 4. Can health promotion initiatives be "institutionalized" within the Municipality and community organizations so that the campaign will continue beyond the study period? 5. Are changes in awareness and/or behaviour related to exposure to the Take TIME campaign?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Health Promotion Campaign Targeting Caregivers of Young Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Take TIME initiative will be developed and delivered in conjunction with the Township of Uxbridge and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario. The Durham Region Health Department, the Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport, and 35 schools and community organizations have also agreed to collaborate on project activities. The health promotion campaign will occur from October 15, 2010 until May 31, 2011. The campaign activities were developed from the input of parents and programme/care providers gathered during the planning phase of this research. The impact of the Take TIME campaign will be evaluated in two ways. The overall readiness of the community to support healthy childhoods will be evaluated using the Community Readiness Model, which relies on a series of interviews with key individuals in leadership positions. Awareness and current behaviour among community members will be assessed through the completion of telephone surveys of randomly selected households. Each of these evaluations will be completed twice, before and after delivery of the Take TIME campaign. The pre-campaign evaluations will be completed in September 2010. The post-campaign evaluations, using the same procedures, will be completed in June 2011.</detailed_description>
