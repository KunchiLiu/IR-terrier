	<brief_summary>The objective of this Phase I trial is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of two capsules of dabigatran etexilate made from two different drug product batches. The reference batch is dabigatran etexilate hard capsules 150 mg using the currently approved capsule shell (Qualicaps). The test batch is dabigatran etexilate 150 mg hard capsules using a new capsule shell (Capsugel). The test batch is the drug product intended for future commercial use.</brief_summary>
