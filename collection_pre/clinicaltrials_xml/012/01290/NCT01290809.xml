	<brief_summary>Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients constitute a significant proportion of the lung cancer population. The prognosis of these patients has improved over the years due the introduction of combined modality treatment, including high-dose chemo-radiotherapy. The brain, however, remains one of the major sites of failure. Patients with brain metastasis suffer from a variety of neurological, cognitive and emotional difficulties that are known to adversely affect the health-related quality of life. Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) can prevent or delay the development of brain metastasis, and as such can improve neurological disease-free survival and consequently health-related quality of life. But survival is short, and toxicities are real, as PCI in itself can also induce adverse effects. The cognitive adverse effects of PCI are not sufficiently illuminated and documented, due to the lack of formal and systematic evaluation in patient populations expected to have short survival. Also, recent attempts to reduce cognitive side effects of PCI by the application of hippocampal-avoidance PCI in order to prevent memory deficits have not been fully evaluated yet. Before PCI can be offered routinely to stage III NSCLC patients in daily practice, the costs and benefits of this therapy should be investigated properly, to allow for well-informed treatment choices.</brief_summary>
