	<brief_summary>Trial design: - Phase III, FOLFIRI versus FOLF(HA)iri (the FOLFIRI regimen with "Hyaluronic acid-Irinotecan" or "HA-Irinotecan") regimen. - Patients with mCRC (metastatic colorectal cancer), 2nd/3rd line irinotecan naïve. - Randomized 1:1, double-blinded, multi-centre, multi-national (Australia, Bulgaria, Poland, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom). - Dosing regimen: - Irinotecan (180 mg/m2) or HA-Irinotecan (180 mg/m2), IV, over 90 minutes, day 1 (in patients &gt; 75 years of age, the irinotecan and HA-Irinotecan dose in must be reduced to 150 mg/m2). - Leucovorin, 400 mg/m2, or levoleucovorin, 200 mg/m2, IV over 90 minutes with irinotecan. - 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 400 mg/m2 IV bolus day 1, then 1200 mg/m2/day x 2 days (total 2400 mg/m2 over 46-48 hours) continuous infusion. - Repeat every 2 weeks for 8 months. - Patient accrual over approximately 12-14 months. - Monitoring to 18 months post-randomization. - 390 patients. - Progression Free Survival (PFS) primary endpoint. - Safety analysis on the initial 20 patients.</brief_summary>

Locally advanced or recurrent disease only. Unsuitability for irinotecan including known Gilbert's syndrome, active inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea greater than or equal to grade 2. Abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy within the last 12 months. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
