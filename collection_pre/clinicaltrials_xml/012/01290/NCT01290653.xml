	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effect of two different techniques (dry needling and Strain-counterstrain manual technique) on the upper trapezius myofascial trigger point (MTP). Subjects with active or latent MTP in this location of the muscle will be identified and will be randomly assigned to one out of three groups: dry needling, strain-counterstrain or placebo manual technique. Pain pressure threshold, provoked pain, pain at rest, neck disability and electromyography (EMG) activity of the upper trapezius will be registered before and after six sessions of treatment.</brief_summary>
