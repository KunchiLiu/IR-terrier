	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of a chronic care model (CCM) based quality improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 2) adherence to CKD guidelines. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a CCM based quality improvement program for patients with CKD and assess potential mechanisms for the intervention's effect. Hypothesis: Implementing a CCM based quality improvement program including system level support in the form of collaborative care, a CKD registry, and provider education will 1) reduce systolic BP in patients with poorly controlled hypertension, 2) increase the percentage of patients appropriately monitored for metabolic complications, and 3) decrease the rate of catheter use in patients initiating dialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Chronic Care Model Based Quality Improvement (QI) Program to Improve the Care of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Plan: The experimental design is a prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of a Chronic Care Model (CCM) based quality improvement program on CKD guideline adherence. The intervention will focus on three main goals: 1) reduction of BP to target levels, 2) appropriate monitoring of patients for metabolic complications of CKD, and 3) reduced use of dialysis catheters in patients initiating dialysis. The CKD CCM QI program will include a lecture on CKD guidelines and hypertension to all CBOC providers and a centrally located pharmacist with access to the CKD registry. Methodology: Veterans receive primary care at Community Based Outpatient Centers (CBOCs) throughout Northeast Ohio. Patients with CKD who receive their primary care at a Northeast Ohio CBOC will be eligible for the study. The hypothesis was formulated before data collection.</detailed_description>
