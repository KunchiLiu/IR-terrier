	<brief_summary>This study will analyze the tibio-femoral and patellofemoral (motion) and mechanics (forces) of participants having a normal knee or a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using one or two different (TKA) devices Low Contract Stress (LCS) Posterior Stabilizing (PS) Rotating Platform (RP) Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). All knees will be analyzed using an image matching technique that will convert a two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic image into a three-dimensional (3D) image. In conjunction with the fluoroscopic analysis, electromyography (EMG) data, and ground reaction force (GRF) data will all be allow for a complete analysis of the knee joints. These results will help the orthopaedic community better understand knee motion so they can improve testing on existing implants and develop future implants that will further enhance patients' lives.</brief_summary>
