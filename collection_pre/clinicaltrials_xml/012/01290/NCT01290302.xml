	<criteria>Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures. Patients with one of the following myelodysplastic syndrome of the following FrenchAmerican British (FAB) subtypes: refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, or requiring transfusion), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBT), or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL); myelofibrosis; chronic myeloid leukemia; or chronic lymphocytic leukemia who's physician feels should receive azacitidine. Male or female patients aged at least 18 years. ECOG Performance Status 02. Life expectancy &gt; or = to 3 months. Adequate organ function, including the following: Hepatic Total bilirubin &lt; or = to 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate transaminases (AST) and alanine transaminases (ALT) &lt; or = to 2 x ULN and Renal Serum creatinine &lt; or = to 1.5 x ULN. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must be using at least one form of contraception as approved by the Investigator for 4 weeks prior to the study and 4 months after the last dose of azacitidine. Male patients must use a form of barrier contraception approved by the investigator during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of azacitidine. Hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol. Anticipated need for RBC or platelet transfusion 2 days prior to or up to 2 days after treatment initiation. Chemotherapy (excluding previous azacitidine treatment) or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of randomization (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Significant electrophysical abnormalities in pretrial EKG. Present history of locally advanced or metastatic malignant disease or leukemia. Use of recreational drugs or history of drug addiction, within the prior 6 months. Known history of a positive hepatitis screen, including hepatitis B surface antigens or HCV antibodies. Known history of HIV or syphilis. History of clinically significant adverse events due to chemotherapy, radiotherapy or investigational agents. Presence of an advanced malignant hepatic tumor. Presence of an ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorder, or any other serious uncontrolled medical disorders. Presence of any significant central nervous system or psychiatric disorder(s) that would hamper the patients compliance. Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to study entry. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients or any patient with childbearing potential not using adequate contraception.</criteria>
