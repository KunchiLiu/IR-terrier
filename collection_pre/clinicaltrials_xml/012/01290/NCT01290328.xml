	<brief_title>Study of Epoetin Alfa to Treat Anemia After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia has become an increasingly recognized problem in kidney transplant recipients, and erythropoietin is often prescribed as treatment despite limited data regarding outcomes. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated correction of anemia with erythropoietin in patients with chronic kidney disease (pre-transplant) and patients on dialysis. No large clinical trials of erythropoietin treatment have been done in anemic kidney transplant recipients, however. The investigators hypothesize that when used for the treatment of post-transplant anemia, Epoetin Alfa increases hemoglobin (Hb). The investigators further hypothesize that Epoetin Alfa suppresses pathogenic alloimmunity directed at the kidney transplant and as a consequence, prevents immune-mediated injury and thereby preserves renal function. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of post-transplant anemia with Epoetin Alfa also results in improved patient-reported outcomes (quality of life) and decreased left ventricular mass. In order to test these hypotheses, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of Epoetin Alfa in anemic kidney transplant recipients (9.0 &lt; Hb &lt; 11.0). 100 study subjects will be randomized to either treatment with Epoetin Alfa at a starting dose of 150 units/kg/week or no treatment (50 subjects/arm). The primary outcome of change in Hb will be measured by CBC at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of enrollment. Secondary outcomes to be measured include change in renal function (eGFR), change in T cell phenotype, change in patient-reported outcomes (SF-36 form), and change in left ventricular mass (by cardiac MRI).</detailed_description>
