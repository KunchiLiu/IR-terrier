	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitor sitagliptin is effective in the treatment of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). We hypothesize that sitagliptin will improve meal-stimulated insulin secretion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin in Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, no clinical trials have been conducted using the DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is characterized initially by post-prandial hyperglycemia, with normal fasting sugars. As the disease progresses, fasting hyperglycemia develops. As sitagliptin augments post-prandial insulin release, while avoiding fasting hypoglycemia, it may be an alternative therapy for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes in individuals who do not yet require basal insulin therapy.</detailed_description>
