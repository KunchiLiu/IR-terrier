	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of a 48-week treatment with two doses of tiotropium bromide compared to placebo in adolescent patients with moderate persistent asthma. Efficacy and safety will be assessed by measuring lung function parameters and evaluating the effects on asthma exacerbations, on Quality of life, on health care resource utilisation an on the number of adverse events.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. All patients and their parents (or legally accepted caregiver) must sign and date an informed consent consistent with ICHGCP guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in the trial. 2. Male or female patients between 12 and 17 years of age. 3. All patients must have at least a 3 months history of asthma at the time of enrolment into the trial. The diagnosis of asthma has to be confirmed at visit 1 with a bronchodilator reversibility test. 4. All patients must have been on maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a stable medium dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1. 5. All patients must be symptomatic (partly controlled) at Visit 1 (screening) and at randomisation defined by an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) mean score of more than or equal to 1.5. 6. All patients must have a prebronchodilator FEV1 more than or equal to 60% and less than or equal to 90% of predicted normal at Visit 1. Variation of absolute FEV1 values of Visit 1 as compared to Visit 2 must be within ± 30%. 7. All patients must have an increase in FEV1 of equal or above 12% and 200 mL after 400 µg salbutamol (albuterol) at Visit 1. If patients in the lower age range (e.g., 12 to 14 year olds) exhibit a very small total lung volume, positive reversibility testing might be based solely on the relative (12%) postbronchodilator response. 8. All patients should be neversmokers or exsmokers who stopped smoking at least one year prior to enrolment. 9. Patients should be able to use the Respimat® inhaler correctly. 10. Patients must be able to perform all trial related procedures including technically acceptable spirometric manoeuvres. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with a significant disease other than asthma. 2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal screening haematology or blood chemistry 3. Patients with a history of congenital or acquired heart disease, and/or have been hospitalised for cardiac syncope or failure during the past year. 4. Patients with any unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or a change in drug therapy within the past year. 5. Patients with malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years. 6. Patients with lung diseases other than asthma (e.g. Cystic Fibrosis). In case of expremature infants, a history of significant bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be regarded as exclusion criterion. 7. Patients with known active tuberculosis. 8. Patients with significant alcohol or drug abuse within the past two years. 9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. 10. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the 6 weeks prior to the screening visit (Visit 1). 11. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, Benzalkonium chloride (BAC), Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acis (EDTA) or any other components of the tiotropium inhalation solution. 12. Pregnant or nursing adolescent female patients 13. Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control. 14. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 15. Patients who have been treated with longacting anticholinergics (e.g. tiotropium Spiriva) within four weeks prior to screening (Visit 1). 16. Patients who are unable to comply with pulmonary medication restrictions prior to randomisation. 17. Patients who have been treated with AntiIgE treatment (Omalizumab Xolair) within the last 6 months prior to screening. 18. Patients who have been treated with systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1). 19. Patients who have been treated with longacting theophylline preparations within 2 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1) or during the runin period 20. Patients who have been treated with other nonapproved and according to international guidelines not recommended ¿experimental¿ drugs for routine asthma therapy. 21. Patients with any acute asthma exacerbation or respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 22. Patients requiring 10 or more puffs of rescue medication (salbutamol/albuterol) per day on more than 2 consecutive days during the runin period. 23. Patients who have previously been randomised in this trial or are currently participating in another study. 24. Patients who are being treated with oral betablocker medication. 25. Patients with a known narrowangle glaucoma, or any other disease where anticholinergic treatment is contraindicated. 26. Patients with renal impairment, as defined by a creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Body Surface Area as calculated by Schwartz formula.</criteria>
