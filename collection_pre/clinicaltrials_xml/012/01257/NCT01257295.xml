	<brief_summary>Dietary fibers likely have a role in body weight management. They may increase satiety and, as a consequence, reduce energy intake during the next meal. There are, however, many different types of dietary fiber, which have diverse physical properties and can therefore impact these outcomes differently. It is, however, unclear whether dietary fibers with different properties lead to differences in energy intake during the next meal. The objective of this study is to study the effect of pectin in 4 different physicochemical states on ad libitum energy intake and possible underlying mechanisms; i.e. gastrointestinal hormones, gastric emptying rate, feelings of satiety and the method of fiber supplementation. We hypothesize that viscous and gelling fibers will reduce ad libitum energy intake compared to low viscous and low gelling fibers.</brief_summary>
