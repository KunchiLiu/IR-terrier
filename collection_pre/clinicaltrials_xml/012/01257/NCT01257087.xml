	<brief_summary>Obesity surgery is very effective in improving or even curing Type 2 Diabetes in patients with obesity. Many patients stop or reduce their medication after surgery and this can happen fairly quickly. The investigators do not know whether strict control of blood glucose/sugar after the operation makes any difference in the long term. Additionally many patients prefer their blood sugars to be a "bit high" because they are afraid of hypos.A number of studies have described patients whose eye, nerve and kidney disease has deteriorated when high sugars are controlled very quickly. The investigators want to ensure that surgery provides maximum benefit and remains safe in patients with diabetes. This study will help us decide if the investigators should be strict with blood glucose after obesity surgery operations or not and whether obesity surgery is safe for the eye, nerve and kidney complications of diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resolution of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Intensive vs. Conventional Glycaemic Control After Obesity Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects would be randomised into intensive glycaemic control and conventional glycaemic control after obesity surgery. Data on complications of diabetes such as eye, nerve and kidney will be collected before obesity surgery and 1 year after surgery.</detailed_description>
