	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the function results between two methods for surgically repairing rectoceles: vaginal versus endo-anal surgery. Our working hypothesis is that the relatively new type of endo-anal surgery will result in better voiding function compared to the traditional vaginal surgery.</brief_summary>
