	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Firebird 2 Stent in Treatment of Complex Coronary Lesions in Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is an international multi-center prospective clinical registry research, for evaluating the efficacy and safety of Firebird 2 cobalt-chromium alloyed sirolimus-eluting stent in treatment of complex coronary lesions in diabetes. As planned, about 57 research centers all over China, Latin America and Asia-Pacific areas will be involved and, 1300 patients will be enrolled into this research. The implanted stents must all be Firebird2 cobalt-chromium alloyed sirolimus-eluting stent. The patient enrollment will last for 12 months. Clinical follow-up will be done respectively for 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months and 36 months. All quitted patients during the study will not be replaced with any substitutes, but categorized in the enrollment failure column. The researcher must state clear the reason of nonenrollment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Definitely diagnosed type 2 DM either before or during the current hospitalization and with complex coronary lesions The coronary lesion is complied with the definition of complex type. (defined by protocol) The investigator admitted patients which are suitable for implanting Firebird2 CoCralloyed Sirolimuseluting stent(SES) Patient or his/ her legal supervisor are provided with informed consents. Women during pregnancy and breastfeeding; STsegment elevated MI occurred within 1 week; Graft lesion after the coronary artery bypass graft(CABG) operation; Patient with other brand of stent implanted; LVEF ≤ 35%; Renal insufficiency before operation (Serum creatinine ≥ 177umol/L) Impaired fasting glucose（6.0mmol/L～7.0mmol/L）or impaired glucose tolerance（OGTT 2h blood glucose 7.8mmol/L～11.1mmol/L）patient; Recent PCI within 6 months or previous intravascular radiotherapy; Predicted life span is less than 12 months; Patient allergic to the following materials: aspirin, heparin, Clopidogrel, CoCr alloy, contrast agent or sirolimus. Recent participation of trial medication or other device study without endpoints completion or it is clinically interfering FIRE2－DIABETES study endpoints. Considered by other investigators unsuitable for implanting Firebird2 CoCralloyed SES Patients could not obey the study rules, such as not understanding the study manner, scope or its outcome, not cooperative, not providing the informed consent, not accepting followup, not finishing the whole study procedure.</criteria>
