	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has not been fully elucidated. The most widely supported theory implicates insulin resistance as the key mechanism leading to hepatic steatosis, and perhaps also to steatohepatitis. Selenoprotein P(SeP) is a secretory protein primarily produced by the liver. Previous studies demonstrated that SeP, a liver-derived secretory protein, causes insulin resistance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the different Sep levels between healthy normal group and NAFLD group.</brief_summary>
