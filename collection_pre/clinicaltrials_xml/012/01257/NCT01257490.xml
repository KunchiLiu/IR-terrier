	<brief_summary>This study recruited cigarette smokers under supervision in community corrections (e.g., probation, parole, drug courts, etc.) in the Birmingham, Alabama area. Smokers received 12 weeks of bupropion treatment and brief physician advice to quit smoking or 12 weeks of bupropion treatment and 4 sessions of intensive counseling around smoking cessation. The study was stratified on race such that equal proportions of African Americans and Caucasians were enrolled in the two study groups. It was hypothesized that smokers receiving intensive counseling will have higher quit rates compared to smokers receiving brief advice to quit.</brief_summary>
