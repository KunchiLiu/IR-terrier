	<brief_title>Clinical Trial on the Effects of Bifidobacterium Infantis in Active Celiac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: This exploratory study has been designed to determine the effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis vs. placebo orally administered over a period of 3 weeks on clinical features, Quality of Life parameters (QoL), intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers of patients having serological evidences of CD (positive serological markers). The testing period will be approximately three weeks between the results of serological testing and before the intestinal biopsy procedure during which time subjects are consuming a gluten-containing diet. Study Design: A 3-weeks duration, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study plan in ambulatory (non-hospitalized outpatients) patients, with 2 parallel groups. Treatment arms will be as follows: A). Placebo 2 capsules 3 times daily (morning, evening and night). B). Probiotics (Bifidobacterium infantis) 2 capsules 3 times per day (morning, evening and night).</detailed_description>

Patients with hemoglobin levels less than 8.5 g/dL or who had donated blood in the last 56 days or donated a unit of plasma in the last 7 days. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the prior 2 years. Individuals taking "prohibited" medications in relation to the study (see point 6, previous section).
