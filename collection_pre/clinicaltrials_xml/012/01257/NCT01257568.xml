	<brief_summary>This study will be an evaluation of the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System for primary total hip replacement (THR) with a cementless application in a consecutive series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria. Subjects will be evaluated for freedom of hip revision at 5 years and clinical outcomes for up to 10 years after surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patient has signed an IRB approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form. Patient is a male or nonpregnant female age 18 years or older at time of study device implantation. Patient has primary diagnosis of NonInflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD). Patient is a candidate for a primary cementless total hip replacement. Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation. Patient's operative femur templates to Rejuvenate® Modular Stem size 712. Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected hip joint at time of study device implantation. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device. Patient is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a metabolic disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days). Patient requires revision surgery of a previously implanted total hip replacement or hip fusion to the affected joint. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials. Patient is a prisoner.</criteria>
