	<brief_summary>A randomized controlled trial of a commercially available homeopathic cold remedy will be conducted. A total of 400 children, 2-5 years old, diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection will be randomized to receive either the homeopathic remedy or placebo. Parents of study children will administer 5 ml of the study medication up to 6 times per day as needed to treat cold symptoms. One hour after giving a dose the parent will rate change in symptoms (for up to the first 10 doses). In addition, parents will rate their child's overall symptom severity and functional status over the first 3 days of the cold. It is postulated that children receiving the active homeopathic remedy will have better symptom relief and that their symptom severity and functional status will improve more rapidly than those receiving placebo.</brief_summary>
