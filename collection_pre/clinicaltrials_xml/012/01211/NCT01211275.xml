	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of axitinib, a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, on tissue and clinical outcome in combination with chemotherapy given to patients with mesothelioma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Chemotherapy With of Without Axitinib in Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the effects of the addition of axitinib to standard chemotherapy on tissue samples with respect to micro-vessel density (MVD): expression of VEGF-Receptor; PDGF receptor expression; extent of necrosis and apoptosis. To determine the safety of the addition of axitinib (to a maximum of the recommended dose of maximally 2 x 10 mg per day) to the standard treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed. To determine the feasibility of performing a (second) thoracoscopy after 10 weeks of the combination treatment with cisplatin, pemetrexed and axitinib. Serum samples will be collected and tested for inhibiting effects in a tube formation and spheroid sprouting assay.</detailed_description>
