	<brief_summary>Context: The treatment of alcoholism is a challenge for psychiatrists and patients. Some studies have shown that alcohol alters the environment of the membranes, mainly by modifying their permeability through the lipid fraction. These lipids are known as essential fatty acids (EFA) because they are obtained only through the diet, as the human body is unable to synthesize them. Linolenic acid (LA), or omega 6, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or omega 3, are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Finally, ethanol changes the absorption and metabolism of PUFAs, and it's supplementation may be helpful for alcohol dependence recovery. Objective: to assess the effectiveness of PUFAs supplementation in the treatment of alcohol dependent patients.</brief_summary>
