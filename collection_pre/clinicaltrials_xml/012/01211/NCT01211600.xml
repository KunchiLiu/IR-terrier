	<brief_summary>To determine whether the rate of wound complications differs based on method of closure of skin incision (staples vs. suture) after cesarean delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cesarean Trial of Staples vs. Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite this large number of cesareans performed annually, there is a paucity of data to suggest which technique is superior for closure of the skin incision with regards to wound complications, including wound separation and infection. As the morbidity associated with a cesarean delivery is usually related to wound complications, especially infection, we feel that it is important to examine this outcome by comparing the current skin closure techniques: staples versus suture.</detailed_description>
