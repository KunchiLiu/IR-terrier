	<brief_summary>Candida albicans is the most common and important clinical fungal pathogen. Our previous surveillance disclosed that fluconazole could induce different morphological changes in clinical strains. Our current study on C. albicans causing candiuria disclosed that renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure and uremia were risk factors of treatment failure. However, we also found results of E-test drug susceptible test could not predict outcome. Hence, retrospective analysis of 31 months period, cases that had C. albicans inducing candidemia were reviewed and 60 cases were enrolled for morphological study and potential virulent gene analysis. This study is designed to clarity the clinical meaning of morphological form and virulent genes on candidemia. To do this study is probably helpful for treatment of candidiasis.</brief_summary>
