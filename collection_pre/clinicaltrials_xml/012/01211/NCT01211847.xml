	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Diazoxide Choline to Treat Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population will consist of Statin-naive and Statin-treated subjects, all without diabetes mellitus, with fasting triglyceride levels in the range of ≥ 500 mg/dL and &lt; 1500 mg/dL. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: DCCR and Placebo Approximately 44 subjects will be enrolled in the study and stratified by Statin use at a 1:1 ratio in each treatment group,</detailed_description>
