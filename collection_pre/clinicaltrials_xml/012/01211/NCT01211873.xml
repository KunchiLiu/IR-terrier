	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of DOTAREM® in MRI of Central Nervous System (CNS) Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study involving the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents called Dotarem®. The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy (how well does it work) of Dotarem® when used for taking images of the brain and spine. The results of the MRI will be compared to the results of images taken without Dotarem®.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult subject and pediatric subjects (aged greater than or equal to two (2) years). Is referred for a contrastenhanced MRI of the CNS based on the results of a previous imaging procedure. Female of childbearing potential patients must have effective contraception (contraceptive pill or intrauterine device) or be surgically sterilized or postmenopausal (minimum 12 months amenorrhea), or have a documented negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study MRI. Has been fully informed about the study, and has consented to participate. Having acute or chronic grade IV or V renal insufficiency. Known class III/IV congestive heart failure. Suffering from long QT syndrome. Unstable health condition or circumstances (e.g. suffering from severe claustrophobia). Having any contraindications to MRI such as a pacemaker, magnetic material or any other conditions that would preclude proximity to a strong magnetic field. Known allergy to Gadolinium chelates. Having received any contrast agent within 3 days prior to study contrast administration, or is scheduled to receive any contrast agent within 24 hours after the study contrast administration. Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant during the trial. Previously participated in this trial. Having participated within 30 days in another clinical trial involving an investigational drug. Any condition which, based on the investigator's clinical judgement, would prevent the patient from completing all trial assessments and visits.
