	<brief_summary>The investigators are examining different treatment strategies of helping patients with PTSD and addiction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated vs Sequential Treatment for PTSD and Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that Veterans in the integrated conditions will show greater reductions in substance abuse and PTSD symptom severity at the end of treatment and at 6 and 9 month follow-ups. The investigators further hypothesize that offering Veterans Prolonged Exposure (PE) at the onset of treatment in the integrated condition will leader to greater retention and satisfaction than in the sequential treatment design.</detailed_description>
