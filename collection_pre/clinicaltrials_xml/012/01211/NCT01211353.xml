	<detailed_description>Excessive drinking among OEF/OIF veterans represents an important public health problem for both the veterans themselves and those with whom they interact. The objective of this research is to better understand how to reduce hazardous drinking among this group by assessing the effectiveness of a low-cost, computer-delivered preventative program. It is hypothesized that an intervention that provides personalized feedback about drinking behaviors will be more effective than an education-only control condition at reducing alcohol use and negative alcohol-related consequences.</detailed_description>
