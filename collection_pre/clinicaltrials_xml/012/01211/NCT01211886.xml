	<brief_summary>Admission BNP was a useful marker for diagnosing and predicting type IV cardio-renal syndrome type IV in patients with chronic kidney disease admitted to the ICU for acute heart failure in a retrospective study. Therefore, we aim to prospectively investigate the utility of serum BNP in evaluating the treatment adequacy and predicting future cardiac events in patients with type IV CRS.</brief_summary>
