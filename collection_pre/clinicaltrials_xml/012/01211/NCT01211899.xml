	<brief_summary>Data on 4G/5G polymorphism of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene are limited in Asian patients with sepsis. Therefore, the investigators aim to prospectively investigate the incidence of 4G/5G polymorphism and its relationship with disseminated intravascluar coagulatin in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.</brief_summary>
