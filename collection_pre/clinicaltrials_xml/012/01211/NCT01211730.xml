	<brief_summary>Many but not all studies have shown improvement in morbidity and mortality with intensive glycemic management postoperatively. In this study, the investigators propose to determine whether improved glycemic control using intensive insulin treatment immediately postoperatively will improve outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplant using a prospective, controlled, randomized, parallel-group study design targeting two different glucose levels, 140 and 180 mg/dL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Glycemic Control on Liver Transplantation Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies have shown improvement in morbidity and mortality with intensive glycemic management postoperatively. However, some recent studies have not been able to reproduce these benefits and have raised the issue of adverse consequences of hypoglycemia associated with intensive therapy. Our own data show an association of increased graft rejection proportional to postoperative glucose levels in patients who have undergone a liver transplant. Preliminary data suggest that this may improved by better glycemic control using the Glucose Management Service here at Northwestern. In this study, we propose to determine whether improved glycemic control using intensive insulin treatment immediately postoperatively will improve outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplant using a prospective, controlled, randomized, parallel-group study design targeting two different glucose levels, 140 and 180 mg/dL. Postoperative glucose management with insulin will be supervised by the Glucose Management Service as is routine, with the only research aspect being the two different glucose targets and the outcome analysis with liver transplant rejection as the primary outcome and infections and hypoglycemia being the principle secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>
