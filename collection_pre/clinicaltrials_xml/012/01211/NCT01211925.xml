	<brief_title>Distal Venous Arterialisation of Ischemic Limb</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to estimate validity of distal venous arterialisation (DVA) as a limb salvage procedure. This prospective randomized study reported early results of 30 unreconstructible patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) treated during 2009 year at Clinic for vascular surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade. Patients were divided in two groups, 10 treated with DVA and 20 conservatively (CT) using antiplatelet drugs.</detailed_description>
