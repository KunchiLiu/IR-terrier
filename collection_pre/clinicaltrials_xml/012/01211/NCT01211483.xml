	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b/2 study. In Phase 1b, subjects will know the treatment they are receiving. Subjects will receive Erlotinib + U3-1287. The Phase 1b portion will determine if adding U3-1287 to Erlotinib will be safe in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who fail prior treatment. In the Phase 2 portion, subjects will be blinded to the treatments they are receiving. Subjects will receive either Erlotinib alone or Erlotinib + U3-1287. The Phase 2 portion will determine if adding U3-1287 to Erlotinib will be safe and improve survival in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who failed the first treatment.</brief_summary>
