	<detailed_description>This proposal is for a pilot study that will inform the conduct of a prospective, blinded randomized controlled trial designed to determine the cost effectiveness of an algorithm for pre operative cardiac risk stratification that uses coronary CT angiography. In addition perioperative and long-term cardiac event rate will be recorded to determine if there is any difference in these rates between the 2 groups.</detailed_description>
