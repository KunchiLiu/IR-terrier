	<brief_summary>Whole body vibration has been found to be useful in promoting bone health, balance, and muscle performance in older adults. The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine whether whole body vibration (WBV) has immediate beneficial effect in neuromotor performance in patients with stroke. It is hypothesized that a single session of WBV will induce significant improvement in leg muscle strength in people with chronic stroke.</brief_summary>
