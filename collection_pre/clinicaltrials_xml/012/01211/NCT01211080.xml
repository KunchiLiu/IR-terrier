	<brief_summary>Propranolol use for infancy hemangiomas is of world wide interest due to low cost and presumed efficacy. The investigators hypothesized that the drug ist highly active against growing hemangiomas in problematic sites and that there are little side effects. This observational study was undertaken in an uncontrolled fashion to determine sample size, design and and tools for a later randomized controlled trial on propranolol versus physical therapy (i.e.cryotherapy) which is the most prevalent treatment for the condition. During this initial series side effects and relevant design aspects became evident which warrant expedited reporting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Off Label Use of Propranolol for Infancy Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment modalities: The investigators employed the "best-guess"-dose from the literature at 2 mg/kg/day divided into three daily oral administrations. Individualized capsules were manufactured from Propranolol tablets by the hospital pharmacies and dissolved in sweetened tea before use. Treatment was started at 1mg/kg/day and routinely increased after 24 hrs. or later when three subsequent doses had been tolerated without bradycardia (&lt; 70 bpm when sleeping) or other unwanted events. No other medical treatment was admitted. Physical treatment (cryotherapy, interstitial laser) was administered in parallel to propranolol in 16 patients with threatening hemangiomas (severe impediments to function or cosmesis requiring immediate reduction). Surveillance and adverse event (AE) reporting: Pretreatment monitoring included a 24 hr ECG (in KKB a 2 minute rhythm strip), pulse, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and echocardiography. All patients were kept at a cardiac monitor. Blood pressure was monitored 6 hourly and blood glucose was assayed twice with each new dose at one hour after drug ingestion. If the patient has had 3 full doses the investigators repeated the 24 hr ECG and the echocardiography. Bradycardia and Hypotension events were defined according to the age dependent standards , Side effects/adverse events were defined according to ICH guidelines and screened for as events leading to either a physician contract and a medical measure (dose reduction, ÃŸ-mimetic or other medication). Lesion evaluation: Hemangioma size was measured with calipers before and after the completed therapy at the end of the 8th month of life. Thickness was checked with a 7.5 mHz linear array pediatric probe. For evaluation of their cosmesis the lesions were documented with 2 photos each (white balanced flash and ambiance light) before and after treatment (standardized to 30 cm distance, circa 2 Mb resolution). Images were shown at the same week to 3 examiners being unaware whether images were taken pre- or post treatment. This was repeated twice at two weeks interval. As there is no validated hemangioma specific assessment tool a rating form was compiled in an expert discussion from validated scar and burns scales: Categorical items included "Vascularity" and "Height" from the Vancouver Scar Scale , "Irregularity" from the Hamilton burn scar rating form for photographic analysis and the "matte/shiny" classification from the Manchester Scar Scale . A 10 cm plastic surgery visual analogue scale provided non-categorical data on overall appearance.</detailed_description>
