	<brief_summary>The ACTIVE Intervention to Improve Hospice Caregiver Pain Management The major goal of this project is to implement and test this promising intervention in three hospice programs. The mixed methods evaluation of this RCT will provide evidence-based data for a tested intervention manual that hospice staff members can use to integrate the intervention into their practices. We will rigorously test the effectiveness of the ACTIVE intervention (RQ1). We will investigate whether the assessment of the ICG perception of pain management will identify those who will benefit most (RQ2) and whether changes in the perceptions of informal caregivers will result in improvement of patient pain (RQ3). With a cost effective intervention (RQ4, 5) and an understanding for a translation plan (RQ6, 7), involving the informal caregivers and patients (when able) on the IDT team can become the standard of care. This intervention may have the potential to influence not only hospice care but also care for other patients experiencing chronic or terminal pain.</brief_summary>
