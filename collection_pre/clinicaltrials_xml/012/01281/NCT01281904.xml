	<brief_summary>There are over 2 million breast cancer survivors today. Persistent Cancer-Related fatigue (PCRF), a state of being tired or weary, is one of the most common and distressing symptoms experienced by breast cancer (BC) survivors. Rates of significant PCRF in BC survivors range from 30% to 82% within the first 5-years of diagnosis and there are few treatment options for PCRF and these treatments require the availability of a trained practitioner, are associated with significant costs, pose a sizeable burden for the patient, or have unacceptable side-effects. Acupressure is a technique derived from acupuncture, a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In acupressure, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points by the hand, elbow, or with various devices to treat disease. Pilot studies have demonstrated that self-administered acupressure can significantly decrease PCRF by as much as 70% in cancer survivors. Acupressure can also have positive effects on sleep quality in cancer patients and other chronically ill populations. Self-administered acupressure is a non-toxic and inexpensive treatment that requires minimal instruction. It also requires little effort and time on the part of the patient to successfully complete. Thus, acupressure appears to be a promising treatment for PCRF and associated symptoms. The investigators are conducting a single-blind, placebo controlled study to examine the specific effect of two opposing acupressure treatments compared to standard of care. The goal of this study is to determine the benefit of acupressure on treating persistent fatigue experience by many patients after completing their cancer treatment. Study patients will be randomized into one of three groups: two different types of acupressure or a standard of care arm. For those participants randomized to receive acupressure, the technique will be taught to them by a study nurse trained by an acupressure specialist. Participants will be asked to perform the acupressure daily over the next six weeks, during which time they will record their fatigue and be asked to wear an activity monitor to have their daily activity levels monitored.</brief_summary>
