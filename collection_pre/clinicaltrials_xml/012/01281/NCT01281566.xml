	<brief_title>A Study of Cisapride in Premature Infants With Feeding Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind study where the identity of the treatment assigned (Cisapride or placebo) will not be known to the patient's legal guardian or any study staff involved with the study. Patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either the drug Cisapride or a placebo (a placebo is identical in appearance to Cisapride but does not contain Cisapride or any active drug) to see if Cisapride is effective in improving feeding problems (referred to as feeding intolerance) in premature newborn infants who cannot tolerate oral feeding by mouth or through a tube going directly to the stomach or intestine. Patients will be given either cisapride at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg or placebo as a liquid suspension through a tube from the nose to the stomach (referred to as a nasogastric tube) 15 minutes before feeding once every 6 hours (or 4 times a day referred to as a q.i.d. schedule).</detailed_description>
