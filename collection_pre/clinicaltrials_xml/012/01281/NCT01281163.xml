	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of lapatinib ditosylate and Akt inhibitor MK2206 in treating women with metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib ditosylate and Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate and Akt Inhibitor MK2206 in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of continuous daily administration of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) in combination with weekly administration of MK2206 (AKT inhibitor MK2206) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer. II. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for this administration schedule. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK2206 and lapatinib, each given alone and in the combination. II. To evaluate potential pharmacogenetic influence of the candidate drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters on the PK of MK2206 and lapatinib. III. To evaluate the change in select breast cancer biomarkers in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-signaling pathways, (e.g., phosphorylated [p]PTEN, PTEN, pAkt, Akt, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (pGSK)3-beta, GSK3-beta), Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (e.g., activated beta-catenin (ABC), beta-catenin), and pHER2. IV. To evaluate the change in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) biomarkers, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 and cluster of differentiation (CD) 44+/CD24-, before and after 2 weeks of treatment with the combination of MK2206 and lapatinib at the MTD. The percent change in BCSCs in tumor biopsies will also be evaluated. V. To determine tumor response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and by percent change in BCSCs within the tumor before vs after 2 weeks of combination treatment. VI. To perform genomic profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after 2 weeks of treatment with the combination of MK2206 and lapatinib at the MTD. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by an expansion cohort study. Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 and 15-28 of course 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Patients also receive AKT inhibitor MK2206 PO QD on days 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

these medications must have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on this study; erythropoietin (Epo) and darbepoetin (Darbepo) are allowed Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen) Patients with a prior history of seizures Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial if the mets have been stable for less than one month and/or if they are on active steroid treatment Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK2206, lapatinib, or other agents used in study Preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of MK2206 for induction of hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or at risk for hyperglycemia are not to be excluded from trials with MK2206, but the hyperglycemia should be well controlled on oral agents before the patient enters the trial Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in corrected QT (QTc) interval during MK2206 treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a safety concern while on MK2206 therapy; patients with baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt;470 msec (female) will be excluded from entry on study; a list of medications that may cause QTc interval prolongation are listed, and should be avoided by patients entering on trial Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK2206; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets Patients enrolled on the MTD cohort who do not have accessible tumor or who refuse serial biopsies Due to a high incidence of bradycardia observed in early trials of MK2206, patients with significant bundle branch block, or bradycardia related to cardiac disease, should be excluded from the trial</criteria>
