	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the association between acid reflux and cell changes in Barrett's esophagus. Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that controlled acid reflux is associated with lesser degree of stromal activation. Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that stromal fibroblast derived growth factors drive BE epithelial proliferation.</brief_summary>
