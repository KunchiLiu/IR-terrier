	<brief_title>Primary Care Physician's Wishes and Influencing Factors Toward Provision of Integrated Health Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population is aging rapidly in Taiwan. It has been estimated that 15 years from now, the elderly population will comprise over 20% of the general population. Within an aging population, the prevalence of chronic illnesses can be expected to increase, and these patients with multiple chronic illnesses will likely need a larger allocation of available resources with the national health care system. In contrast to a highly-specialized medical environment, integrated health care, with its multitude of health and medical services including diagnosis, treatment, convalescence, rehabilitation, and health promotion, can provide a more efficient synergism between the necessary aspects of delivery, supply, management and organization. Literature has shown that multi-disciplinary, well-managed chronic illness management can increase the convenience of patient medical visits and also decrease medical costs. To provide patients with multiple chronic illnesses more suitable, efficient, and higher quality medical care, and to decrease redundant or ill-advised medications or procedures, as well as to encourage medical systems to further incorporate integrated services to advance the ideal of holistic care, the Bureau of National Health Insurance issued the a decree on September 15th, 2009, named "Integrated care model and medical system-based integration plan". This questionnaire-based study was focused on understanding primary care physician's wish toward provision of integrated health care, associated knowledge and attitude, and analysis of influencing factors affecting their choices.</detailed_description>
