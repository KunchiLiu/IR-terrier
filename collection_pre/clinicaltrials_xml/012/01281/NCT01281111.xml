	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of different doses and dosing regimens of BG00012 administered with and without ASA compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternate Dosing Regimens of BG00012 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical safety margins for BG00012 allow for a maximum daily dose of 720 mg daily. The study will use a variety of clinical scales, including a flushing scale derived from a validated questionnaire [Norquist 2007], to better understand the safety and tolerability of several doses and dosing regimens of BG00012 up to a total daily dose of 720 mg. The etiology of BG00012-induced flushing will be assessed by collecting relevant biomarker data and the impact of ASA on flushing will be evaluated. Assessments relating to GI symptoms will also be performed.</detailed_description>
