	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will prospectively analyze the reduction of urinary oxalate excretion under the treatment with PLP in dosages of 5mg/kg/day up to 20 mg/kg/day and serum level response relationship with PLP as an i.v. solution used orally in 12 patients with primary hyperoxaluria type I as an inherited autosomal-recessive-disorder leading to increased endogenous oxalate production, urolithiasis and end stage renal disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documentation of diagnosis of PH I by any one of the following: Liver biopsy confirmation of deficient liver specific peroxisomal alanineglyoxylate aminotransferase, (AGT or mislocalization of AGT from peroxisomes to mitochondria) Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a known mutation in the causative gene (AGXT) for PH I Male or female subjects between 5 years and 60 years of age Renal function defined as an estimated GFR &gt; 60 ml/min normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area Subjects receiving pyridoxalphosphate before the study must be willing to discontinue therapy with pyridoxalphosphate for a wash out phase of at least 4 weeks but always until normalization of serum pyridoxalphosphate levels Written informed consent from patients and/or legally acceptable representatives Pregnant or lactating women Women of childbearing potential who are not using a highly effective contraception method with a pearlindex &lt; 1. Highly effective contraception methods are oral, transdermal, injectable, or implanted contraceptives, IUD, abstinence, or sterile sexual partner and must agree to continue using such precautions during the pyridoxalphosphate study Subjects post liver or kidney transplantation or combined transplantation Chronic diarrhoea with the risk of malabsorption Any other abnormal finding such as physical examination or laboratory evaluation, in the opinion of the investigator, is indicative of a disease that would compromise the safety taking pyridoxalphosphate per os and the absorption Subjects participating in other clinical trials with investigational products 4 weeks prior to trial entry, during the trial and 4 weeks after the trial Subjects who are unable to take the trial medication Subjects who are unable to collect 24hour urine samples or follow other study procedures Subjects who are under treatment with LDopa, Isoniazid, DPenicillamine (interactions between these drugs and pyridoxalphosphate are known and might influence serum pyridoxalphosphate levels) Subjects with known allergies to substances of contents (e.g. Potassium sorbet, raspberry syrup) Subjects confined to an institution on judicial or official behalf Subjects who are in dependency to the sponsor or the PI of the trial</criteria>
