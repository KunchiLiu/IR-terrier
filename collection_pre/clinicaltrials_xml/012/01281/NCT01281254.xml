	<brief_summary>To determine if AMG 386 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is superior to placebo plus PLD as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) The hypothesis for this study is that AMG 386 plus PLD will prolong PFS compared to placebo plus PLD in women with recurrent partially platinum sensitive or resistant epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
