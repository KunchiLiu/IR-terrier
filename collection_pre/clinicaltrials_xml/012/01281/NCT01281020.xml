	<brief_summary>A 6-month, parallel, non-interventional trial investigating the level of adherence and the impact of dosing in open-angle glaucoma patients who receive either unfixed therapy with latanoprost once in the evening and timolol twice daily, or latanoprost/timolol fixed combination therapy once in the evening. All patients participating in this observational study will be monitored for their adherence with the use of Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). At the end of treatment periods treatment satisfaction will be assessed with selected questions from the Treatment Satisfaction Survey-Intraocular Pressure survey. This study will monitor objectively, for the first time, adherence and intraocular pressure control with fixed versus unfixed therapy. Finally it will help us to elucidate the impact of dosing (once-a-day versus three-times-daily) on the level of adherence in glaucoma.</brief_summary>
