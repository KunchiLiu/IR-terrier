	<brief_summary>The investigators hope to establish whether or not the diode laser, a longer-wavelength laser, is effective in treating keratosis pilaris, and hopefully opening a door into the discussion and management of this skin condition. The primary outcome of interest is the difference in the overall blind rater severity scores of the treated versus the untreated sites. The secondary outcome of interest is the change in the patient's self-rated severity score of the treated site. To account for potential natural disease progression or regression, the investigators will also compare patient mean changes to the mean changes in severity scores of the untreated site.</brief_summary>
