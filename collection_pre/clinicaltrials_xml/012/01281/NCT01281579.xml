	<brief_title>A Single and Multiple Dose Study of Canagliflozin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (volunteers and study staff will know the name and dose of the treatment assigned), single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy adult volunteers. Canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
