	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the change in plasma levels of adiponectin and Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) in type 2 diabetes patients after 12 weeks of treatment with Amaryl-M Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess the role of Amaryl-M in the change of plasma levels of adiponectin and ADMA in type 2 diabetes patients after 8 weeks of therapy 2. To evaluate the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) change after 8 and 12 weeks of therapy with Amaryl-M 3. To evaluate the efficacy of Amaryl-M in the improvement of patients glycemic level (Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)) 4. To evaluate the change of Tumor Necrosis Factor - Alfa (TNF-Alfa) after 12 weeks of therapy with Amaryl-M 5. To evaluate the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) change after 12 weeks of therapy with Amaryl-M 6. To evaluate the HOMA-Î² change after 12 weeks of therapy with Amaryl-M 7. To evaluate the relationship between adiponectin and ADMA level with FBG or HbA1c level</brief_summary>
