	<brief_summary>The purpose if to find out if analgesia with bilateral ultrasound-guided Tranversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block with Ropivacaine 0.5% is better than analgesia with local infiltration of trochar sites with Ropivacaine 0.5% in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our hypothesis is that in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, bilateral TAP blocks will reduce postoperative pain scores when compared to conventional postoperative pain control with local infiltration of trochar insertion sites.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient ages 1864 2. American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status I, II or III 3. Inpatients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy at Ben Taub General Hospital 1. Open cholecystectomy excluded due to increased levels of pain in open procedures 2. Scheduled for ambulatory surgery 3. Renal dysfunction (Serum Cr &gt; 1.2) excluded due to potential altered metabolism of anesthetic and pain medications 4. Coagulopathy or anticoagulation increased risk of bleeding from nerve block injection 5. Allergy or contraindication to any of the study medications or anesthetic agents 6. Chronic opioid analgesic use at home excluded due to potential difficulty in assessing pain caused by the procedure alone 7. Patient inability to properly describe postoperative pain to investigators (language barrier, dementia, delirium, psychiatric disorder) 8. Pregnancy 9. Prisoners 10. Patient or surgeon refusal</criteria>
