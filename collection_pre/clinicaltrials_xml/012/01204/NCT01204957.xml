Rates of breast cancer double even after just ten years among Japanese women who migrate to the US. Diet is thought to be an important factor, and the investigators were interested in whether dietary seaweed, with and without soy supplements, could influence known biomarkers of breast cancer risk in American women.</brief_summary>
