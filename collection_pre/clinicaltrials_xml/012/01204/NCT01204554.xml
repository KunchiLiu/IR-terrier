	<brief_title>Microcirculation in Perforator Flaps. Enhancing Tissue Survival</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perforator flaps are increasingly used in reconstructive surgery both as pedicled and free flaps, mostly because of reduced donor site morbidity and superior aesthetic result. However, the there is still much to learn about the hemodynamic changes within these flaps.The aim of the present study is to assess the microcirculatory changes in the distal part of the perforator flap using ICG fluorescence angiography.</detailed_description>
