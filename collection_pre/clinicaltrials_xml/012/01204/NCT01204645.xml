	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10-18% of the adult population and is becoming recognized as one of the most serious disorders causing increased risk for cardiovascular disease and death. In patients with ischemic heart disease 26% have increased creatinine, which rises to 40% if patients also have diabetes mellitus. Risk increases as renal function diminishes, and just slowing the rate of decline in renal function would have a tremendous impact on health and morbidity. This association is commonly termed the Cardiorenal Syndrome, though it is caused by a much more complex interplay between major pathogenetic pathways such as glucose metabolism and diabetes, systemic and tissue inflammation, tissue metabolism, coagulation, mineral metabolism, sympathetic activation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, endothelial dysfunction, lipid metabolism, fetal programming etc. Karolinska Institutet recently merged basic and clinical researchers in all these fields, creating a Karolinska Kardiorenal Theme Centre; ultimately aiming to explore the syndrome and provide improved care for the individual patient. The investigators road to success: - Creating a Biobank (blood, DNA, plasma) from the majority of all hosptalized patients with ACS in Stockholm county - Stockholmheartbank. - This Theme Center include all teaching hospitals associated with Karolinska Institutet; Danderyd University Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and SÃ¶dersjukhuset University Hospital. Together theses hospitals serve as emergency hospitals for 1.9 million people. The investigators are aiming at creating a biobank from all patients admitted for an acute coronary event (about 2.300/yr), which is a unique asset for molecular and genetic research as well as observational and intervention studies. - The investigators have access to the National registry with 100% coverage, that contains data on all patients admitted to Stockholms coronary care units since 1995. - To ensure translation in to clinical practice, most of the researchers are also MD:s, and several are clinically active. - The clinical network facilitates the development of novel therapies and translational research. - Steering groups for Education and a Clinical Practice implementation program.</brief_summary>
