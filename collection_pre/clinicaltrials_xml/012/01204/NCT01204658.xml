	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and persistence of two formulations of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A [high dose (HD) or low dose (LD)] given as a 3-dose primary vaccination course during the first 6 months of life followed by a booster dose at 12-15 months of age when co-administered with Infanrix hexa™ and compared to the vaccination with Synflorix™ and with Prevnar 13™ similarly co-administered with the Infanrix hexa™ vaccine.</detailed_description>

Written informed consent obtained from the parents/LAR(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the study period starting from 30 days before each dose and ending 30 days after each dose of vaccine(s), with the exception of licensed flu vaccines. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Previous vaccination against S. pneumoniae since birth. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or any chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 38.0°C on rectal setting or &gt;= 37.5°C on oral or axillary setting. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.
