	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cixutumumab when given together with everolimus and octreotide acetate in treating patients with advanced low- or intermediate-grade neuroendocrine cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, may find tumor cells and help carry tumor-killing substances to them. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Octreotide acetate may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of neuroendocrine cancer. Giving cixutumumab together with everolimus and octreotide acetate may be a better treatment for neuroendocrine cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cixutumumab, Everolimus, and Octreotide Acetate in Treating Patients With Advanced Low to Intermediate Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To recommend a phase 2 dose for the combination of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) and everolimus, given with octreotide long-acting release (LAR) (octreotide acetate), in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of IMC-A12 given once every 21 days in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR. III. To evaluate pharmacodynamic markers in blood, and tumor tissue. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety profile of IMC-A12 and everolimus with octreotide LAR. II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of IMC-A12 and everolimus as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore baseline molecular marker and drug-induced molecular marker changes that may predict clinical outcome. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cixutumumab. Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes and octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

patients with neuroendocrine tumors associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome will be eligible Patients must have disease that is amenable to computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (U/S) guided biopsies; patients must agree to undergo 2 biopsies; the disease identified for biopsy cannot be the only site of measurable disease Patients must be registered in the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) institutional database prior to treatment with study drug Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1 Leukocytes &gt;

oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives are not considered effective for this study; if barrier contraceptives are being used, these must be continued for the specified time by both sexes; women are considered to be of childbearing potential if they have not undergone surgical sterilization (laparoscopic tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy) or have not reached menopause, defined as amenorrhea persisting for at least twelve consecutive months;
