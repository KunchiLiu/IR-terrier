	<brief_summary>This study investigates the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with BAY86-9766 and sorafenib in patients with liver cancer. Safety will be determined by laboratory and other evaluations. Efficacy of the combination BAY86-9766 and sorafenib will be determined by disease control rate, overall survival, time to progression, response rate and duration of response.</brief_summary>
