	<brief_summary>GATE 1 is an open-label, non-comparative, multicentric study evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of the combined use of Gemcitabine, Trastuzumab and Erlotinib as a first-line chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The patients will be treated intravenously with Gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 for 30 min. For the first eight weeks, Gemcitabine will be administered once weekly for 7 weeks followed by one week of rest. Subsequently, Gemcitabine will be administered once weekly for three weeks followed by one week of rest. Trastuzumab will be administered once a week at a dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 min. at D1 and then at 2 mg/kg over 30 min. for the subsequent infusions. Erlotinib will be administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/day from C1D1. The patients will be subjected to research for the EGFR, HER2 and KRAS status.</brief_summary>
