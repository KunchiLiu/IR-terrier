	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the response rate of single agent zoledronic acid using a composite of criteria including the EORTC modified RECIST criteria and the EORTC tumor response criteria for 18F-FDG PET scans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Bisphosphonate Therapy (Zoledronic Acid) in Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma (UAB 0901)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will examine the effect of bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in patients with malignant mesothelioma. Evaluation will be limited to patients with standard (CT scans) and functional instruments (FDG PET Scans) of tumor assessment after the administration of standard doses of zoledronic acid (4 mg IV every 3 weeks). We will also explore the biologic effect of zoledronic acid in patients using new serum markers as well as several blood level markers.</detailed_description>
