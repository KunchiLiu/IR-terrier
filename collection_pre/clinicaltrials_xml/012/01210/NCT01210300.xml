	<brief_summary>The incidence of caesarean section (CS) has increased globally. Taiwan's statistics report a higher incidence of repeat CS compared to vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC). This is concerning, as repeat CS are associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, and neonatal respiratory problems. VBAC is an approach which reduces the likelihood of such birth complications. However, there is limited information about Taiwanese women's decision regarding VBAC and their participation in decision-making. There is also a gap in literature about information for women about CS and VBAC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour will theoretically underpin the study. A qualitative descriptive design using purposive sampling of 20 Taiwanese pregnant women who have previously had a CS with a live baby will be recruited from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. In-depth interviews will be carried out in three phases: (1) between 34 weeks to 38 weeks of women's pregnancy; (2) on the third day after childbirth; and (3) at the fourth week after birth, the end of confinement. Boyatzis' Data Driven approach will be adopted to thematically analyze the data.</detailed_description>
