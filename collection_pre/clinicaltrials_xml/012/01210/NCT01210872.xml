	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information over time about patients' quality-of-life and satisfaction with care may help doctors plan the best treatment and help patients live more comfortably. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying quality-of-life assessment in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality-Of-Life Assessment in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Treated With Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the impact of quality-of-life assessment in routine oncology practice on satisfaction with care, health-related quality-of-life, and toxicity in patients with primary nonmetastatic head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. Secondary - To evaluate the feasibility of using quality-of-life tools in routine oncology practice. - To evaluate the impact on the occurrence of toxicity. - To determine the impact on overall survival. - To study the concordance between the toxicity reported by the clinician and those reported by the patient quality-of-life questionnaires. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to sex, tumor localization, and TNM stage. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC tools only, including EORTC QLQ-SAT32, EORTC QLQ-C30, and specific module QLQ-H&amp;N35/Euroqol EQ-5D) before each consultation with the clinician for one year. - Arm II: Patients undergo standard follow-up care comprising consultation with the clinician for one year. After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then at 2 years.</detailed_description>
