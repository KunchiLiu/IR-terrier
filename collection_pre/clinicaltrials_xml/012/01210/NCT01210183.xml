	<brief_summary>Dextrose injection in end-stage knee arthritis will cause growth of cartilage cells in a particular area of complete cartilage loss. Dextrose concentration will be 12.5%. Cartilage status will be monitored by pre and post treatment arthroscopy views with specialized (methylene blue) staining for cartilage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Response of Stage IV Knee Osteoarthritis to Serial 12.5% Dextrose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historical, compliance, examination,anesthetic injection, radiographic and arthroscopic screening will be completed. One month after arthroscopy completion, the intervention phase will begin. INTERVENTION - Injection of 12.5% dextrose at 0, 1 and 2 months. - Stand up without using only the non-injected leg for 3 days after each injection. - Avoid running and squatting as feasible. - Ensure that the injected knee descends stairs first ascends stairs last for 3 days. - May take Acetaminophen. - No NSAIDS for 2 days before and 10 days after a treatment. PRN NSAIDs only. - No glucosamine or chondroitin should be taken. SECOND ARTHROSCOPY TIMING - A minimum of 4 months after first arthroscopy, when schedulable. - After a minimum of 3 monthly injections of dextrose 12.5% . METHOD OF ARTHROSCOPY - Only the medial compartment will be entered to minimize trauma. - Methylene blue will be applied and allowed to remain in knee for 5 minutes prior to flush. - A standardized method video scan of the medial femoral compartment will be conducted. - At second arthroscopy, the area of heaviest cartilage growth, if any, in the base of the Out-IV lesion will be biopsied with a Jamshidi needle at a 45 degree angle. (Limited by the optics of single port entry ). - Biopsy, if taken, will be sent for decortication to enable specimen to be cut, safranin O application to determine proteoglycan production, polarized light to differentiate fibrous from hyaline cartilage, and immunohistologic straining for Type I and Type Ii cartilage.</detailed_description>
