	<brief_summary>Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is one of the most common injuries in sports. There is a unique style of socks that have become popular in Japan among athletes that could also improve postural control. The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of five-toed socks on dynamic postural control in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Five-Toed Socks on Postural Control Among Active Individuals Who Have Chronic Ankle Instabilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is one of the most common injuries in sports. Ankle braces and orthotic insoles also have been shown to influence the neuromuscular control system by enhancing the proprioceptive and cutaneous afferent inputs to the central nerve system; thereby improving postural control. There is a unique style of socks that have become popular in Japan among athletes that could also improve postural control by enhancing cutaneous afferent inputs from the plantar surface of the foot and toes. The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of five-toed socks on dynamic postural control in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability.</detailed_description>
