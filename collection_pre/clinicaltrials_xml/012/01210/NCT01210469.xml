	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Two Treatments on Posture and Balance in Elderly Women With Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decrease in postural control and muscle strength in lower limbs have been identified as major risk factors for falls in older people. Exercises have proven effective in decreasing risk factors in healthy elderly, but little is known about the effects of interventions with exercise in the elderly with osteoporosis. Objective: To compare the efficacy of two exercise programs - the first consisting of balance training and muscle strength and the second consisting of balance training and muscle stretching exercises - to improve postural control in elderly women with osteoporosis. Methods: Fifty elderly aged 65 or older, with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, were randomized into 3 groups: Strength Group (n = 17) performed balance training with muscle strengthening; Stretching Group (n = 17) performed balance training with stretching; and Control Group (n =16) did not do activity. The groups trained for 8 weeks, with sessions of about 60 minutes, twice a week. Postural control was evaluated by Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction for Balance (CTSIBm) and Limits of Stability test (LOS) in Balance Master force plate, the functional balance by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), muscle strength by dynamometry, the shortening of the hamstrings by goniometry and posture by PAS/SAPO (Postural Assessment Software).</detailed_description>
