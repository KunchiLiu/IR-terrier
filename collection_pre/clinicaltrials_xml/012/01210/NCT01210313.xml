	<brief_title>Physical Activity for Reduction of Recurrence Rate After Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Localised Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this phase II pilot project the feasibility of a defined medical physical activity should be verified for increased physical conversation. The study is conducted multicentric (single group) with a study population of 30 patients. After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy the patients will participate a defined physical training, 3 times per week within a time period of 52 weeks. Planned study duration 2 years.</detailed_description>
