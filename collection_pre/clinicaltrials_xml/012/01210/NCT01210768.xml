	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To evaluate the disease-free survival (DFS) in the two randomized arms after therapy with LC vs. EC in chemo-naive Her2-patients with stage I or II breast cancer Secondary objectives: - To assess the overall survival (OS) - To establish the safety profile by assessing the toxicities and tolerability - To assess the quality of life (QoL) - To evaluate survival correlation with biomarkers expression.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>histologically confirmed invasive, but noninflammatory, breast adenocarcinoma with stage I or II (if N0, T must be &gt;1cm) disease Her2negative on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study performance status of ECOG 0, 1 female, age between 20 and 70 years life expectancy of at least one year ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document Her2 3+ overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC), or Her2 amplification on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study previous or current systemic malignancy with the exception of curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ, unless there has been a diseasefree interval of at least 5 years Patients who have received prior chemotherapy inadequate hematological function defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC)less than 1,500/mm3, and platelets less than 100,000/mm3 inadequate hepatic function defined as: serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range (ULN) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 2.5 times the ULN inadequate renal function defined as serum creatinine greater than 1.5 times the ULN left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% confirmed by multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram concomitant illness that might be aggregated by chemotherapy or interfere study assessment. For examples, active, non controlled infection (such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, infectious tuberculosis) or other active, noncontrolled disease such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia, unstable diabetes mellitus, and active peptic ulcer patients who are presence of liver cirrhosis or are HBV/HCV carrier participation in another clinical trial with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to entry pregnant or breast feeding women fertile women of childbearing potential unless using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method throughout the treatment period and for three months following cessation of treatment</criteria>
