	<brief_title>Physiological Brain Atlas Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study proposes the enrollment of candidates undergoing a deep brain stimulator (DBS) implant. Data will be collected before, during and after surgery and will be electronically entered into the Atlas database where it will be stored indefinitely. The purpose of the study is to create an Atlas to store physiological information utilizing non-rigid MRI normalization algorithms. In addition to collating and analyzing the physiological atlas in a statistical manner that allows the surgeon to predict optimal targeting locations for DBS implants based on multiple physiological variables, including pre-operative severity of disease, intraoperative neurophysiological observations, and post-operative response to DBS stimulation therapy.</detailed_description>
