	<criteria>1. Women: A confirmed exonic mutation within the αGalactosidase gene Men: A confirmed exonic mutation within the αGalactosidas gene and/or reduced α Galactosidase activity 2. Female patients ≥ 25 yearsold and male patients ≥ 25 yearsold 3. The patient has not received enzyme replacement therapy for treatment of Fabry disease 4. The patient must have voluntarily signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)approved informed consent form after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained and discussed with the patient 5. The patient has already mild symptoms of Fabry disease presented in at least one minor organ involvement, e.g. proteinuria 1, mild cardiac symptoms not needing treatment yet, pain attacks, gastrointestinal symptoms or history of TIA. 1. The patient has received ERT or investigational product(s) for any reason within 30 days prior to study entry. 2. Any contraindication for MRIdiagnosis 3. Incompatibility to MRI contrast agent (elevated serum creatinine according to SPC of contrast medium) The patient is unable to comply with the protocol, e.g., has a clinically relevant medical condition making implementation of the protocol difficult; has an uncooperative attitude; is unable to return for study evaluations; or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study, as determined by the investigator. 4. Planned ERT within the next 24 months (nevertheless if a ERT becomes medically necessary in the observational period ERT might be introduced)</criteria>
