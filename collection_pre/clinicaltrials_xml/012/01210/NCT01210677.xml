	<brief_summary>There are no published clinical consensus guidelines on the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis. Corticosteroid therapy is advocated by some experts, but is based on small observational studies, with varied clinical response. Objectives of this trial: - to systemically assess the response of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis, to treatment with corticosteroids - to identify the clinical predictors of response to treatment with corticosteroids - to assess the utility of imaging with PET and MRI to predict response to treatment with corticosteroids - to determine the prevalence of cardiac sarcoidosis in young patients with unexplained heart block and in patients with unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular tachycardia - to use the data from this pilot study to assess the need, feasibility, and sample size for a larger multicentre trial</brief_summary>
