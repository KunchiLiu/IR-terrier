	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been established as therapy for severe forms of Parkinson's disease and other indications. A common target for stimulation is the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Nevertheless, there is no agreement on the mechanisms how DBS leads to clinical improvement. The project aims to describe the variability of target coordinates in the patient group and to relate it to clinical outcome as documented in standardized questionaires. - Trial with surgical intervention</brief_summary>
