	<brief_summary>This was a randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate clinical efficacy and feasibility of hatha yoga as a mono-therapy for major depression. Investigators recruited 38 adults in San Francisco meeting criteria for major depression of mild-to-moderate severity, per structured psychiatric interview and scores of 14-28 on Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At screening, individuals engaged in psychotherapy, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, herbal/nutraceutical mood therapies, or mind-body practices were excluded. Twenty participants were randomized to 90-minute hatha yoga practice groups twice weekly for 8 weeks. Eighteen participants were randomized to 90-minute attention control education groups twice weekly for 8 weeks. Certified yoga instructors delivered both interventions at a university clinic. Primary outcome was depression severity, measured by BDI scores every 2 weeks from intervention start at 0 weeks until finish at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy and self-esteem, measured by scores on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) at 0 weeks and 8 weeks. Blinded assessors analyzed whether change in outcome measures would be statistically comparable between the two intervention groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Major Depression With Yoga: A Prospective, Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group, pilot trial of an 8-week hatha yoga program as mono-therapy in major depression. Recruitment occurred from May to October 2010, and the trial was concluded in January 2011. We recruited 38 adults from the San Francisco community who met criteria for major depression of mild-to-moderate severity, as per screening diagnostic evaluation with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and scores of 14 through 28 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At screening, individuals engaged in psychotherapy, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, herbal/nutraceutical mood remedies, or any mind-body practices were excluded. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two instructor-led intervention groups: a hatha yoga practice group assigned to 90-minute hatha yoga practice sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks, versus an attention control education group assigned to 90-minute yoga history seminars twice weekly for 8 weeks. Participants in the hatha yoga group learned and practiced a specific sequence of classical yoga breathing techniques, mindful body postures, and a final deep relaxation pose. The attention control education group explored the history and philosophy of the main branches of yoga through seminars featuring lectures, documentary films, and interactive dialogue between instructor and participants; the seminars were designed to control for non-specific mood benefits of the hatha yoga intervention, such as attention from study personnel, peer interaction, time spent away from routine activities, and anticipation/interest related to mastering novel yoga-related information. Stratified block randomization was undertaken to ensure that each intervention group had equal numbers of participants with mild depression (per screening BDI scores of 14 to 19) versus moderate depression (per screening BDI scores of 20 to 28). Participants were informed at screening that anyone randomized to the education group would be offered 16 free hatha yoga classes, upon completion of the study, to learn and practice the same exercises taught to the hatha yoga practice group. The primary outcome was depression severity, measured by BDI scores at 2-week intervals from intervention start at 0 weeks until intervention end at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy and self-esteem, measured respectively by scores on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) at 0 weeks and at 8 weeks. Blinded assessors analyzed outcome data from both intervention groups, testing whether change in outcome measures would be statistically comparable between the two groups.</detailed_description>
