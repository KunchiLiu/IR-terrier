	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the effect of SYN115 compared to placebo (a "sugar pill" that looks like SYN115 but does not include active drug) on movement during the "on" and "off" states as well as other symptoms that some patients with Parkinson's disease experience. This study will also look at whether or not patients with Parkinson's disease experience "side-effects" with SYN115.</brief_summary>
