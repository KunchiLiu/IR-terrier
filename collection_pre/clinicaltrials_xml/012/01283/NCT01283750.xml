	<brief_summary>Funded by a unique private philanthropy and public coalition through THE ASSOCIATED: Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore, this project seeks to develop effective ways to deliver dementia care to older adults with memory disorders who live in the community. MIND at Home is an 18 month intervention research study whose goals are two-fold: To partner with community organizations to help proactively identify older adults in the Baltimore community who may need help related to memory disorders; To find out if providing person-centered, coordinated care will help older adults with memory disorders remain at home longer, as well other possible benefits. The investigators hypothesize that individuals with memory disorders that receive person-centered, coordinated care will have fewer unmet dementia-related needs, improved quality of life and function, fewer behavioral and depressive symptoms, and will be able to remain in their homes longer compared to individuals who receive augmented usual care.</brief_summary>
