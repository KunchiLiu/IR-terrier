	<brief_summary>This randomized, parallel-group study will assess the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) versus adalimumab, both in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients, already treated with MTX at stable doses, will be randomized to receive either RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 2 weeks. All patients will receive methotrexate (10-25 mg weekly) and folate (at least 5 mg weekly). The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
