	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the antitumor activity (i.e. progression free survival, overall survival, response rate, etc), safety and quality of life in patient with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer during 4-regimen (i.e. SP, FL/Tax, FL/Doc, FOLFOX) based chemotherapy. In addition, it is to evaluate efficacy and adverse events of anticancer agents according to the results of pharmacogenetic study.</brief_summary>
