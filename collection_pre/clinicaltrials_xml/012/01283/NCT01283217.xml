	<brief_summary>Docetaxel was the first drug that showed survival benefits when added to the CF regimen, but it was very toxic. Docetaxel is also has a synergistic anti-cancer effect with S-1, in phase I/II studies. The use of a docetaxel plus S-1 combination as first-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer achieved response rates of 46~56% and a median survival time of 14.0~14.3 months. Based upon this background, the aim of this study is to detect a significant increase in 3 year DFS of disease for the test group (DS) relative to the Control group (SP).</brief_summary>
