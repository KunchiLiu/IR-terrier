	<brief_summary>Pulse induced continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) is an established technology for measurement of advanced hemodynamic variables in critically ill patients. PiCCO is approved and designed also for use in children, but there is a lack of documentation of reference values in children not suffering from a critical illness. The goal of this study is to establish such values.</brief_summary>
