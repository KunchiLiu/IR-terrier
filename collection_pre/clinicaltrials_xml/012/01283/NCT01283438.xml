	<brief_summary>A randomized study to demonstrate the superiority of the BarricaidÂ® when used in conjunction with limited discectomy, compared to limited discectomy alone, with regard to preventing reherniation and the recurrence of pain or dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Demonstrate the Superiority of the Barricaid to Discectomy for Primary Lumbar Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Barricaid is indicated for patients with radiculopathy (with or without back pain), a positive Straight Leg Raise (L45, L5S1) or femoral stretch test (L12, L23, L34), and a posterior or posterolateral herniation at one level between L1 and S1 with radiographic confirmation of neural compression using MRI who are found to have an annular defect (post discectomy) which measures between 4mm and 6mm tall and between 6mm and 10mm wide, have a minimum posterior disc height of 5mm, and have failed at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment.</detailed_description>
