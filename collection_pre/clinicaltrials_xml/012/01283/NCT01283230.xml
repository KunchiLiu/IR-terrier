	<brief_title>Evaluation of Liver Fibrosis Staging With Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Elastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent new method for liver fibrosis assessment based on similar technology to transient elastography is acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. ARFI has the advantages which can be conducted in parallel ways of measuring points in the patients with chronic liver disease when they underwent routine ultrasound examination. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the normal range of ARFI velocity and assess the best cut-off value by recruiting healthy living liver and kidney donors.</detailed_description>
