	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-arm study conducted in subjects receiving chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer to assess the efficacy of MuGard. The study will evaluate the ability of MuGard to reduce the symptoms of oral mucositis. The study includes a treatment period of approximately 7 weeks depending on the subject's prescribed radiation plan. MuGard is a liquid that is classified as a medical device. It is a hydrated polymer system (oral hydrogel) and is intended for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis. When gently distributed within the mouth, the mucoadhesive formulation results in the formation of a protective coating over the oral mucosa. Subjects undergoing chemotherapy with radiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer are at high risk of developing oral mucositis as an adverse side-effect of cancer treatment. MuGard was previously shown to reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy when compared with data from historical control groups. The purpose of this study is to perform a direct comparison of the effectiveness of MuGard with a control group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will be included in the study if they: 1. Are willing and able to understand and sign an informed consent form (ICF) for the study approved by the Investigator's local or a central Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 2. Are males or females aged 18 years or older 3. Have recentlydiagnosed, pathologicallyconfirmed cancer of the head and neck (e.g., oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx; nasopharynx, lips, sinuses, salivary glands, or unknown primary)that will be treated with CRT (with or without induction therapy prior to CRT) 4. Have a plan to receive a continuous course of conventional external beam irradiation delivered as single daily fractions of 2.0 Gy to 2.2 Gy with a cumulative radiation dose between 50 Gy and 72 Gy with concomitant chemotherapy. Planned radiation treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, tongue, soft palate) with each site receiving at least 50 Gy 5. Have Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &gt;= 80% or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of &lt;= 1 (See Appendix B and C for KPS and ECOG scores respectively) 6. Have the ability to comply with the MuGard product insert Subjects will be excluded from participation in the study if they: 1. Have major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of RT or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study 2. Have active infectious disease excluding oral candidiasis 3. Have presence of oral mucositis 4. Have chronic immunosuppression 5. Have use of any investigational agent within 30 days of randomization 6. Are female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding 7. Have known allergies or intolerance to MuGard Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse, its ingredients, or the ingredients used in the sham control. The ingredients which appear in either formulation are as follows: benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, carbopol 971P, citric acid, glycerin, polysorbate 60, phosphoric acid, purified Water, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, sodium saccharin 8. Have inability to give informed consent or comply with study requirements 9. Are unwilling to or unable to complete the subject diary 10. Have any other condition or prior therapy that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with followup visits</criteria>
