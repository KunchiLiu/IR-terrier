	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of a modified constraint induced movement therapy (mCIMT) intervention on upper limb function in two groups of patients acutely post-stroke; 1) an experimental group that will participate in a 10 week mCIMT intervention designed to improve upper limb function, in addition to usual care, and 2) a control group that will participate in a program of usual care consisting of a rehabilitation intervention for the affected upper limb that is dose-matched to the experimental group.</brief_summary>
