	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if the laxative polyethylene glycol (also known as GoLYTELY速 or Miralax速) can treat your hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to your liver disease and/or cirrhosis) better and/or more safely than lactulose (another laxative). In this study, the investigators will evaluate if polyethylene glycol (GoLYTELY速) is more effective than lactulose on neurocognition (memory and thinking skills) and determine if it decreases the hospital stay.</brief_summary>
