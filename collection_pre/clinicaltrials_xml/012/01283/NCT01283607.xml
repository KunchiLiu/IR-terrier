	<brief_summary>Yearly, 15,000 Dutch in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles are performed for subfertility with a pregnancy rate of 26%. A failed cycle has great emotional impact; 20-25% of the women has relevant forms of depression/anxiety even after 6 months. For such maladjustment a risk profile has been identified and translated into a screening tool. Identification of women at risk enables a timely and tailored (individual's needs) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which reduces more serious maladjustment and corresponding costs. Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of an e-health CBT (digital coaching, Digicoach) in women ongoing IVF and having been screened at risk. Design: A single-centered randomised controlled trial comparing Digicoach (intervention) with standard care (control). Digicoach: an e-health CBT with 4-12 weekly sessions starting before an IVF cycle, following a woman's IVF course and covering in modules the main problems: depressed mood, anxiety, strong focus on child wish and acceptance. Main outcome measures: anxiety and depression occurrence rate 3 weeks after an unsuccessful IVF cycle. Secondary outcome measures: 1. (para)medical consumption, 2. quality of life, 3. productivity loss and 4. IVF outcome. Data are collected by questionnaires, diaries, medical record audit and page view registrations. Process evaluation: Individual's use (e.g. module progress, completion rate), experiences, (e.g. satisfaction and usability) and potential barriers for implementation are evaluated. Economic evaluation: studied during the Digicoach exposures from a societal perspective. Incremental costs (costs/%avoidance of depression/anxiety) are determined by comparing both study groups. Power/data analysis: To detect a 29% difference in the depression/anxiety occurrence rates (alfa=0.05 and beta=0.80) 58 unpregnant IVF women are evaluated.</brief_summary>
