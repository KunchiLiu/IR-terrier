	<brief_summary>People from the Indian subcontinent are more likely to get diabetes, even at younger ages. The Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program (D-CLIP) will test in a randomized trial if a culturally specific, community-based lifestyle and metformin (for individuals who do not respond to lifestyle change alone) intervention for men and women living in Chennai, India can effectively prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. Lifestyle interventions are programs that seek to prevent disease by promoting changes in health behaviors, improved diet, increased physical activity, and weight loss. The results of this program will be used to make policy and public health recommendations, which will result in broader diabetes prevention efforts. The research team hypothesizes that this program will result in improvements in health (diabetes prevention, weight loss, and improvements in other markers of chronic disease) for intervention participants compared to participants in the control arm of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Diabetes Prevention Through Lifestyle Change in India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: The Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program (D-CLIP) aims to implement and evaluate in a controlled, randomized trial the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of a culturally appropriate, low-cost, and sustainable lifestyle intervention for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in India. Methods: D-CLIP, a translational research project adapted from the methods and curriculum developed and tested for efficacy in the Diabetes Prevention Program, utilizes innovated methods (a step-wise model of diabetes prevention with lifestyle and metformin added when needed; inclusion of individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance, isolated impaired fasting glucose, and both; classes team-taught by professionals and trained community educators) with the goals of increasing diabetes prevention, community acceptability, and long-term dissemination and sustainability of the program. The primary outcome is, diabetes incidence, and secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness, changes in anthropometric measures, plasma lipids, blood pressure, blood glucose, and HbA1c, and program acceptability and sustainability assessed using a mixed methods approach. Conclusion: D-CLIP, a low-cost, community-based, research program, addresses the key components of translational research and can be used as a model for prevention of chronic diseases in other low- and middle-income country settings.</detailed_description>
