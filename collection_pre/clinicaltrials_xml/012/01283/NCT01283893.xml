	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in Korea. Having achieved excellent long-term survival for early gastric cancer patients, there is a growing interest in improving the quality of life of these patients without compromising their prognosis. Laparoscopic surgery for early gastric cancer have been found to be safe and feasible with superior short-term outcomes. Although laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is being performed for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer; the completeness of the D2 lymphadenectomy during laparoscopic surgery has not been evaluate and no standardized procedure exists. To conduct a clinical trial comparing laparoscopic D2 lymphadenectomy to the open approach, quality control of D2 lymphadenectomy procedure is necessary.</brief_summary>
