	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Histologic documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate Surgical castration or ongoing use of gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists with confirmed castrate levels of testosterone Metastatic progressive CRPC defined as progressive disease despite surgical castration or ongoing use of gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists with confirmed castrate levels of testosterone For patients in the doseexpansion cohort of the study, not more than two prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting Evaluable or measurable disease Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception Antitumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic, experimental, or hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, with the following exceptions: maintenance hormonal therapy for metastatic prostate cancer and palliative radiation to bone metastases within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including HIV and atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of the nail beds) Ongoing corticosteroid use with &gt; 10 mg of daily prednisone or equivalent Symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients who are receiving bisphosphonate therapy specifically to prevent skeletal events and who do not have a history of clinically significant hypercalcemia are eligible. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy (or recombinant antibodyrelated fusion proteins) Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that they meet all of the following criteria: evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS, radiographic demonstration of improvement upon the completion of CNSdirected therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNSdirected therapy and the screening radiographic study, and screening CNS radiographic study is &gt;/= 8 weeks since completion of radiotherapy and &gt;/= 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids and anticonvulsants Dose expansion cohort (B): no prior chemotherapy is allowed</criteria>
