	<brief_summary>In recent years, robotic devices are becoming more and more common in medical practice. Such devices provide an effective way to communicate within a clinical setting, but recent studies have shown far more diverse uses for these robots, ranging from training future surgeons to diagnoses of patients. In the investigators study, the investigators would like to investigate whether it is effective to employ robotic devices in the administration of neurostimulation treatment. It is the investigators hypothesis that the introduction of robotic devices will only yield minimal if any inaccuracies in a standard neuromodulation treatment protocol. In addition, the investigators also predict a high satisfaction rating from all participants involved in conditions involving the robot.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of the Use of Remote Presence Robots in Delivery of Neuromodulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with neuromodulation systems implanted for either movement disorders or chronic pain and who require programming of their systems will be approached to enter the study. Those who consent will be consecutively assigned to either the normal standard of care (i.e. programming of their systems with an experienced clinician) or programming of their systems with an inexperienced programmer (nurse) who will be directed by the experienced programmer via the remote presence robot. Both the nurses and the patients will complete questionnaires rating their satisfaction of the programming experience. They will each only receive one questionnaire at the end of the programming session. There is no other test point.</detailed_description>
