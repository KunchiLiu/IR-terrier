	<brief_summary>This is an investigator-blinded, bilateral comparison study in 30 subjects with atopic dermatitis. It is designed to assess and compare the efficacy of Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% and Hylatopic™ Plus Emollient Foam™ in subjects with atopic dermatitis. Subjects will apply Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% twice daily for four weeks on a chosen target eczematous area located on one side of the body and then apply Hylatopic™ Plus Emollient Foam™ three times daily on a symmetrical target eczematous area on the opposite side of the body. A randomized list will be created to determine which side the subject applies each medication. Subjects will be consented prior to any study evaluations or procedures. After signing the consent and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, qualified and enrolled subjects will apply study medication (Elidel® and Hylatopic™ Plus Emollient Foam™) to chosen affected areas for four weeks. Photography will be used to record the location of target lesions at the baseline, week two and week four/final visits. Subject's disease status will be assessed by two methods: 1) Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and 2) Target Lesion Symptom Score (TLSS) (see sections V.B.2 and V.B.3). PGA as well as TLSS will be made at baseline (Day 0), week two (Day 14 +/- 2 days) and week 4/final visit (Day 28 +/- 2days) visits for each of the target lesions. Half scales (i.e. 0.5, 1.5) will not be used. The presence or absence of skin atrophy and telangiectasias will be noted at each study visit as well. Additionally, subjects' self-assessments of their perception of degree of disease and itching severity control will be collected at each visit for each target lesion. This assessment will be made using a four point scale and Itch Severity Scale (visual analogue score) respectively (see section V.B.4). Lastly, subjects will take a Product Preference Survey at week 4/final visit (Day 28 +/- 2days). Parents (or guardians) will moderate Product Preference Surveys for subjects that are younger than 12 years of age.</brief_summary>

Subjects or their guardians must be able to read, sign, and date the informed consent, and abide by study restrictions for its duration. Females who are pregnant, attempting to conceive, or breastfeeding. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to either study drug. Subjects with AD on &gt;30% body surface area Subjects with overt signs of skin atrophy, telangiectasias and/or striae in the target area. Subjects with a current active skin malignancy or infection. Subjects requiring the use of medications known to alter the course of atopic dermatitis during the study treatment. Subjects who have received systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks. Subjects using systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants within 28 days of the Screening Visit. Subjects who have received topical corticosteroids or other topical therapies (tar, calcineurin inhibitors) for atopic dermatitis within 7 days of the Screening Visit.
