	<brief_title>Bioactive Glass Composite Implants in Cranial Bone Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional skull and facial bone reconstructions with hard tissues have a long history with good clinical outcomes. However, they have certain disadvantages. The benefits of synthetic materials are the avoidance of donor-site morbidity and scars, but also shorter hospitalization time, lower expenses and known composition. Custom-made skull bone implant can produced based on patients clinical need utilizing rapid prototyping technologies. This will result in very high accuracy of the form of the skull defect. Polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is one of the most widely used alloplastic material in surgery. Bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) particles have been used in various clinical indications. BAG was added to composite implant of PMMA with glass fibre reinforcement to enhance bone ingrowth to implant, and to utilize BAG`s antimicrobial effects. Ten patients cranial defects are treated with composite implants.</detailed_description>
