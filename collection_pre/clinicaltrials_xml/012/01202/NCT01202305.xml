	<brief_summary>HIV medicines have led to dramatic improvements in health. However, there remains a concern for potential drug toxicities, cost of drugs, and need for life-long treatment. In addition, research has found that health is not completely restored in HIV-infected patients, even if they have been taking effective HIV medicines for a long time. This may be due to direct drug-toxicity, continued replication of the virus, and/or inflammation of the body in response to the virus. Therefore, a more complete understanding of how HIV stays in the body is necessary. Recent research has shown that one of the places that HIV can stay in the body is in lymphatic tissues such as lymph nodes (even in patients who have been taking HIV medicines for a long time). In addition, the amount of damage to the lymphatic tissues can predict how the immune system (CD4+ T cell count) will respond to therapy. The investigators therefore propose a study in which lymph nodes from the groin area will be removed, with the goals of: 1) seeing how much HIV is in lymph nodes and 2) seeing how much damage has happened to the lymph node architecture.</brief_summary>
