	<brief_summary>Minor lacerations are a commonly treated injury in the paediatric emergency department . Over the past decade, standard closure of these lacerations has evolved from suture repair to closure with tissue adhesive (also referred to as "skin glue"). Local anaesthetic is not routinely used during application of skin glue as it was with sutures. There are, however, several potential advantages to pre-treating wounds with topical LET (Lidocaine-Epinephrine-Tetracaine), a liquid gel with anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive properties. Some believe LET can improve patient comfort, increase the ease of glue application, and lead to better healing when used on lacerations being repaired with tissue adhesive. This study aims to address the question of whether or not pre-treatment with LET improves outcomes in minor lacerations repaired with skin glue. The primary hypothesis is that pre-treatment of minor lacerations with LET will decrease pain (as measured on a Visual Analog Scale) during repair with tissue adhesive.</brief_summary>
