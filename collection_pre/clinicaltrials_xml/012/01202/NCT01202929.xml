	<brief_summary>High Resolution Manometry is a new technology that utilizes 36 solid state sensors on a thin catheter spaced at 1-cm intervals. One can more effectively measure the pressure of the esophagus. It includes a sophisticated software to display the pressures data as color topography plot using time, length of the esophagus and pressure within the entire esophagus. It is unclear if this technology improvement actually correlates with patient's symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation of High Resolution Esophageal Manometry With Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a 2007 retrospective study performed using this technology, 400 subjects referred to the motility lab underwent high resolution manometry (HRM) for complaints of dysphasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chest pain and miscellaneous complaints. HRM offered greater detail of individual contracting segments of the esophagus, including the duration of contraction and propagation of individual contractions. For example, a new subclass of achalasia was defined by HRM. In this classification, achalasia is divided into types 1, 2 and 3. Type 1 corresponds to classic achalasia (complete esophageal motor failure), type 2 is a compression achalasia (simultaneous panesophageal pressurization with aperistalsis), and type 3 is spastic achalasia with aperistalsis (100% spasm). However, it is unclear if this categorization represents a spectrum of disease among patients with achalasia, or it represents distinct subgroups of patients with different symptom presentation and etiology. This study will attempt to correlate the data from HRM to patient's chief compliants, symptom severity, and clinical presentation.</detailed_description>
