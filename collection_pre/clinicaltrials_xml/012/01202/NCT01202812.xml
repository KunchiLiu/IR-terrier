	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of LOVAZA (fish oil capsules) to decrease inflammation in children and adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). It has been found that besides the damage caused by sickle red blood cells themselves, the inflammatory response that occurs in SCD patients could potentially play a significant role in the occurrence of painful episodes or pain crises. The investigators will also study whether the subject/caregiver feels that there is an improvement in the child's quality of life by taking the medication. Besides the effect of LOVAZA on inflammation,the investigators are also testing whether the drug will have a beneficial effect on blood clotting ability (which is known to be increased in SCD) and on the anemia (low red blood cells) that is part of the disease entity.</brief_summary>
