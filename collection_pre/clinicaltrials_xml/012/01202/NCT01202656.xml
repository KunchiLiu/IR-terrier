	<brief_summary>This a trial designed to test whether granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, Neupogen) can increase the rate of embryo implantation following IVF and embryo transfer. Preliminary data at the Center for Human Reproduction(CHR) and elsewhere suggest that intrauterine infusion of G-CSF can improve endometrial development and can increase implantation rates of embryos.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To investigate the effect of treatment with CSF on pregnancy rates in routine in vitro fertilization (IVF). Design: Double blinded crossover randomized controlled clinical trial Setting: Academically affiliated private infertility centers Subjects: Normal female IVF patients 18-38 years old, and above age 38 years, who are willing to be randomized to treatment. Interventions: Subjects receive transvaginally, utilizing an insemination catheter, a slow uterine lavage with G-CSF (Neupogen), 300ug (in 1 ml); controls receive saline. Patients who do not conceive will, after one month washout time, continue treatment in the opposite study arm. Main Outcome Measures: Implantation rate(IR) and pregnancy rates. Second Outcome Measures: Live birth rates and miscarriage rates. Statistical and Power considerations: Analysis will be by regression with IR as dependent and treatment as independent. Results will be adjusted by age and indices of ovarian reserve, such as antiMulerian Hormone (AMH). Presuming an implantation rate of 10% and anticipating a 10% increase to 20% with treatment, 120 women, producing about 200 embryos in each study arm, will have to be recruited for 80% power and alpha of 0.05.</detailed_description>
