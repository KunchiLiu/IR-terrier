	<brief_summary>The proposed research extends previous research on Quest® cigarette smoking behavior by testing whether compensatory smoking occurs as cigarette nicotine level decreases, and whether, as a result, biomarkers of harm exposure increase. This hypothesis will be tested in 210 smokers who report smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day and have been smoking for at least five years and are not currently interested in quitting, but interested in trying a new cigarette product. Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) smoke their own preferred brand (control group); 2) smoke Quest® cigarettes in progressively decreasing cigarette nicotine level (step-down); or 3) Quest® cigarette non-step-down condition, where they will smoke Quest® cigarettes in a random order. The study will consist of 4 stages beginning with a 5-day preferred own brand cigarette smoking phase for all participants, followed by one of the three cigarette conditions. For those smoking Quest® cigarettes, cigarette nicotine level will change every 10 days, either in a step-down or random fashion. The primary behavioral outcome is smoking topography, a quantitative measurement of smoke exposure. Alveolar carbon monoxide (CO), a validated assessment of smoke exposure, and urine samples to assess carcinogen exposure, specifically NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) and 1-HOP (1-hydroxypyrere), and exhaled breath condensate will also be collected at the laboratory visits. At the initiation of the study, participants will view the Quest® print advertisement and complete a survey related to product expectations in order to determine the impact marketing and advertisement has on beliefs, attitudes and behaviors related to Quest® cigarettes.</brief_summary>
