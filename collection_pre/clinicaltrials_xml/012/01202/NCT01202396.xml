	<brief_summary>Pouchitis is a common complication following proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). It affects the quality of life and can become a chronic problem. The aetiology of pouchitis is not completely understood. A crucial role of the intestinal microbiota has been suggested, but no causative agent has been identified so far. Furthermore, the defensin expression and the epithelial integrity are altered in inflammatory bowel diseases and may play an important role in the development of intestinal inflammation. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the interaction between an altered microbiota composition, a defective epithelial integrity and changes in innate defense parameters such as defensins has a pivotal role in the development of pouchitis in UC patients.</brief_summary>
