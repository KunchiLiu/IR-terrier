	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the impact of exercise and supplementation on measures of fitness, function, and cardiovascular disease risk factors/modifiers in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The primary purpose of this study is to improve fitness and function, reduce cardiovascular disease risks, and enhance oxidation of dietary and body fats in persons with chronic tetraplegia through acute exercise, exercise conditioning, and dietary supplementation. This study will test the hypothesis that timing of supplementation with regards to exercise bout ('intervention/placebo') affects fitness, function, lipid profiles, lipid oxidation, and inflammatory markers after acute exercise and chronic conditioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Exercise in People With Tetraplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Much as in the general population, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in persons with spinal cord injury. However, CVD occurs earlier in life for those with SCI, progresses silently, and manifests atypical symptoms which fail to warn of impending ischemic damage. This accelerated development of CVD is multimodal in cause, including, but not limited to: a sedentary lifestyle, decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, and physiologic alterations in lipid metabolism, all attributable in part to SCI. Traditional methods of dietary modification and exercise intervention are likely insufficient to elicit adequate modification of post-SCI physiology to prevent CVD. Secondary to our purposes, but of immediate importance to an individual with SCI is the impact of a sedentary lifestyle and increased obesity on their ability to remain independent. A quarter of young persons with SCI possess levels of fitness which are inadequate to complete essential activities of daily living. Thus, a sedentary lifestyle, as measured by fitness, is a correlate if not perceptive of morbidity and mortality in persons with SCI. Atherosclerosis has recently been defined as an inflammatory disease. C-reactive protein has emerged as a general marker of inflammation and is elevated in persons with SCI. We have demonstrated persons with SCI have a pathophysiologic lipid uptake response to a high fat meal, the endpoint of which is increased vascular oxidative stress, a precursor to CVD, indexed by endothelial microparticles. We have also demonstrated circuit resistance training favorably alters lipid profiles of persons with paraplegia. Research in able-bodied individuals suggests acute bouts of exercise accelerate postprandial lipid metabolism (PPL). Post-exercise supplementation has been demonstrated to improve gains in both lean muscle mass and performance over exercise alone in both the able-bodied and individuals with spinal cord injury. Targeting inflammation, post-prandial lipidemia, and altering lipid profiles through dietary and exercise interventions may be a method to reverse or pre-empt the development of CVD in persons with SCI. Increasing muscle mass and physical performance through the same interventions may improve physical performance and thus independence in activities of daily living in persons with SCI. In addition, exercise may serve to decrease depression and anxiety in persons with SCI, much as in non-disabled persons. Targeted exercise plus timed supplementation may decrease the accelerated morbidity and mortality of persons with SCI.</detailed_description>
