	<brief_summary>One-site dose sparing intradermal influenza vaccination in elderly had been studied but resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes. The investigators evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the two-site intradermal injection of influenza vaccine containing all 6 and 12 micrograms of hemagglutinin antigen per strain (with 4/10th and 8/10th of a regular 15 microgram HA/strain intramuscular vaccine respectively) in elderly over 60 years of age. An influenza vaccine administered intramuscularly at the standard dose is used as the reference vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subjects would be randomly divided into three groups of 60 subjects each. Group1 receives a single intramuscular dose of 0.5 ml of trivalent influenza vaccine, containing at least 15 microgram of hemagglutinin antigen per strain, Group II receives two-site intradermal dose of 0.1 ml each, containing at least 3 microgram of hemagglutinin antigen per strain per site and group III receives two-site intradermal dose of 0.2 ml each, containing at least 6 microgram of hemagglutinin antigen per strain per site.
