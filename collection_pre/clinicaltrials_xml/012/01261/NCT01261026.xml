	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in women with ectopic pregnancy (EP), abnormal intrauterine pregnancy (aIUP) and normal intrauterine pregnancy (nIUP). METHODS: This was a prospective, case-control study comparing serum VEGF concentrations among 72 women with ectopic pregnancy (n=35), abnormal IUP (n=15) and normal IUP (n=22) matched for gestational age. For the determination of serum VEGF concentration a solid phase sandwich ELISA was used. Patients were stratified according to serum VEGF above or below 200pg/mL. RESULTS: The serum level of VEGF was significantly higher in women with ectopic pregnancy (median 211.1 pg/mL; range 5 - 1017.0 pg/mL) than in women with normal IUP (median 5 pg/mL; range 5- 310.6 pg/mL) P &lt; 0.0001. Serum VEGF concentrations did not show any statistically significant difference between women with aIUP (median 231.9 pg/mL range 5 - 813.7 pg /mL ) and EP (median 211.1 pg/mL range 5 - 1017.0 pg/mL). When cut-off concentrations of 200 pg/mL for VEGF were used, a nIUP could be distinguished from an unviable (EP and aIUP) with a sensitive of 53%, specificity of 90.9%, a positive predictive value of 92.9% and a negative predictive value of 46.5%.. CONCLUSIONS: Serum VEGF could not distinguish between an EP and an aIUP. However, serum VEGF concentrations above 200 pg/mL could discriminate a nIUP from an unviable pregnancy (EP or aIUP) with a PPV of 92.9%.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The inclusion criterion was the presence at transvaginal ultrasound of an extraovarian adnexal mass in women with a suspected ectopic pregnancy (amenorrhea, bleeding and pain) with positive test for betahCG. The exclusion criterion was nontubal ectopic pregnancy (cervical, cesarean scar, ovarian, and abdominal).</criteria>
