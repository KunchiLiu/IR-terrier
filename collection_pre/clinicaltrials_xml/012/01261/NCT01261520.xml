	<brief_title>Chinese Women and Mammography Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examined the efficacy of a culturally-tailored video in increasing mammography use among non-adherent Chinese women (vs. a generic video and control fact sheet). A total of 671 Chinese American women from metropolitan Washington, DC and New York city were enrolled to participate in this study. The majority of participants were recruited from on-site community events and some were recruited through public advertisement and referrals. Participants who completed baseline assessment were randomized to one of the three groups: 1) viewing an 18-minute cultural video, 2) viewing an 18-minute generic video, and 3) reading a fact sheet (control group). Participants were interviewed twice after intervention:1) process evaluation 2-4 weeks post intervention regarding participants' feedback on the materials and repeated key measures of knowledge, cultural views, and health beliefs and 2) outcome evaluation six-months post intervention that assesses actual receipt of mammography use.</detailed_description>
