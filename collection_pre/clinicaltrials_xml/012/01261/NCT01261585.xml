	<brief_summary>Study of the modification of the fixation(binding) of Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), fluoro-misonidazole (FMISO) and 3'deoxy-3-fluoro-thymidine deoxy-3-fluoro-thymidine (FLT) measured in tomography by broadcast(emission,issue) of positrons (PET) at patients before and in the course of exclusive radiotherapy or concomitant radiochemotherapy for primitive bronchial cancer. This protocle allows to study the simultaneous variations of the metabolism, the hypoxie and the cellular proliferation by PET SCAN at 5 patients reached(affected) by a primitive bronchial cancer in the course of exclusive radiotherapy for primitive bronchial cancer not small cell lung. The investigators are also going to study several scenarii of optimization of the radiotherapy according to the variations of the tumoral metabolism, the hypoxie and the cellular proliferation measured in the course of radiotherapy (theoretical study on console using the scanner and the various examinations).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patients with nonsmallcell lung carcinoma hitologicaly proved Candidate patients in a treatment with aim guardian by exclusive thoracic radiotherapy or of concomitant radiochemotherapy (tumoral dose superior to 60 Gy) ( n=5 ). Measurable tumor according to the criteria of evaluation RECIST Histology other one than primitive bronchial cancer not in small cells lung The patients for whom no tumoral target is assessable (forgiveness completes after first chemotherapy, operated patients). Patients for whom a radiotherapy with curative aim is not indicated (tumoral extension, metastases, general state, comorbidity). Patient having benefited from an examination PET in the FDG with in more than 4 weeks and for which a new PET in the FDG is not necessary with in the framework of its disease</criteria>
