	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Diltiazem, a Moderate CYP3A4/A5 Inhibitor, on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of E5555 and Its Metabolites in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, 2-arm study to evaluate the effects of diltiazem given in conjunction with E5555 on the PK of diltiazem and its metabolites. This is a Phase 1 study of 24 healthy male and female subjects that will be conducted at a single site. The planned duration of treatment for each subject is approximately 15 days including 1 day in Treatment Period 1 and 14 days in Treatment Period 2.</detailed_description>
