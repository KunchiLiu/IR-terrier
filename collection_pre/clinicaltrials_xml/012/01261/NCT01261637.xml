	<brief_summary>This study has been designed to determine if women undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia and routine pain management who also have an additional ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP)block using ropivacaine have better pain relief and a better quality of recovery than women who don't have the additional TAP block. Maximizing pain relief using ultrasound guided TAP blocks in addition to neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen may improve acute pain outcomes, reduce adverse side effects, and potentially reduce chronic pain.</brief_summary>
