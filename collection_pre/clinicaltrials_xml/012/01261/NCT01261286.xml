	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine the effect of C-reactive protein (CRP) status, and infliximab treatment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of verapamil, a model drug for L-type calcium channel blocking, in Crohn's disease (CD) patients compared to healthy patients. Hypotheses:CD patients will have elevated plasma verapamil concentrations, but diminished dromotropic response to verapamil; the concentration of circulating norepinephrine, used as a surrogate marker of sympathetic nervous activity, will be similar between the healthy patients and the CD patients; the sympathetic nervous system of the heart will be similar to healthy patients; Crohn's disease patients with normal CRP will have higher drug response compared to high CRP (&gt;3 mg/l) patients; and that infliximab-treated patients will have higher verapamil response than those with similar symptom profiles who are not infliximab treated.</brief_summary>
