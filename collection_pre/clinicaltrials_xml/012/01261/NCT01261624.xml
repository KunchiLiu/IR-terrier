	<brief_summary>The present study has been designed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of Givinostat in subjects with polyarticular course JIA Givinostat ready-to-use suspension especially intended for paediatric administration, will be administered orally at different daily doses. Patients with an established diagnosis of one of the following JIA forms (Polyarticular JIA rheumatoid factor positive or negative, Oligoarticular extended JIA, Systemic JIA without active systemic features) will be enrolled. The treatment regimen will remain unchanged for 12 weeks and the clinical response will by assessed by applying the ACR Pediatric response criteria. Patients achieving at least an ACR Pediatric 30 response will continue receiving the assigned dose for 12 further weeks. After the end of study (week 24) responder patients will be allowed to extend the treatment until they maintain a clinical benefit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Dose Finding Study of Givinostat to Treat Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-clinical data on Givinostat, support a potent anti-inflammatory mechanism of action which can potentially slow the arthritic destructive process. This rationale seems to be confirmed by the preliminary evidences collected in a previous Phase II clinical trial conducted in children and young adults with systemic JIA. The present protocol is aimed at collecting new information on safety and efficacy of two doses of Givinostat for the treatment of JIA.</detailed_description>
