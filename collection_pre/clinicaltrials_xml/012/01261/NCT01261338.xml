	<brief_summary>Because of industrial pollution, a large number of people in Annison, Alabama, have elevated body burdens of the class of compounds known as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). There is evidence that these compounds are associated with risks to health including diabetes. There is also evidence that the consumption of a non-absorbable dietary fat can reduce the level of compounds like PCBs. This clinical trial will test the hypothesis that a non-absorbable dietary fat can reduce the levels of PCBs in subjects in Anniston.</brief_summary>
