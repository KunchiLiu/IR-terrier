	<brief_summary>The study aimed to compare the use of a transurethral laparoscope to the use of a traditional cystoscope for evaluation of the bladder and ureters at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy. The hypothesis was that visual inspection of the bladder and ureters can be done safely using a transurethral laparoscope, takes less time than traditional cystoscopy, and is more cost effective than traditional cystoscopy.</brief_summary>
