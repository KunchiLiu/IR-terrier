	<brief_summary>Acromegaly is a disease of the pituitary gland that involves the overproduction of growth hormone. The drug works by blocking the binding of growth hormone to growth hormone receptors found in tissues throughout the body. Human studies have evaluated the reduction of IGF-I levels in the blood following pegvisomant treatment, however, no studies have evaluated IGF-I levels in tissues following pegvisomant administration. In this study, we will test a novel tissue biomarker for pegvisomant action, distinct from measuring IGF-I levels in the blood. To this end, we will determine if administration of pegvisomant modifies the expression of IGF-I, IGF-I receptor, growth hormone receptor and GH- and IGF-i-dependent signaling molecules in the colon tissue of patients with acromegaly.</brief_summary>
