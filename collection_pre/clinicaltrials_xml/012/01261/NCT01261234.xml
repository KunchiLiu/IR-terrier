	<brief_summary>CAS-CARE study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of cilostazol, compared to that of other antiplatelet drugs, on in-stent restenosis following carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients scheduled to undergo CAS. Study design is Multicenter Prospective Ranodomized Controlled Study, rondomized by cilostazol/non-cilostazol group prior to CAS. 900 patients will be enrolled for 2 years and followed 2 years with in-stent restenosis after CAS, evaluated by carotid ultrasound and angiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Artery Stenting With Cilostazol Addition for Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restenosis after carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a critical issue. Cilostazol can reduce restenosis after interventions in coronary or femoropopliteal arteries. The investigators confirmed and published periprocedural cilostazol administration reduced incidences of in-stent restenosis (ISR) or target vessel revascularization (TVR) after CAS, retrospectively. CAS-CARE study is Multicenter Prospective Ranodomized Controlled Study. Patients, scheduled for CAS within 30 days, 50% or more symptomatic carotid stenosis or 80% or more asymptomatic carotid stenosis, will enroll and randomize by cilostazol/non-cilostazol group. 900 patients will be enrolled for 2 years and followed 2 years with in-stent restenosis after CAS, evaluated by carotid ultrasound and angiography. And, evaluate cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and hemorrhagic events in periprocedural period and followed period. In this study, ISR is diagnosed by ultrasound and DSA/CTA. Equivalence of CTA to ultrasound will be studied.</detailed_description>
