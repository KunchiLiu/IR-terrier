	<detailed_description>Prospective study subjects will undergo screening procedures. Approximately 214 eligible patients will enter the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms (Ozarelix or Goserelin). Eligible patients randomized to the ozarelix group will receive two SC injections of ozarelix 65 mg in the abdomen on Day 1 (left lower quadrant, LLQ and right lower quadrant, RLQ), followed by a SC injection of 65 mg of Ozarelix (abdomen LLQ) on day 8 and will receive 2 additional SC injections of Ozarelix on days 28 and 56 (alternating injection sites). Eligible patients randomized to Goserelin will receive one 3.6 mg SC injection in the abdomen (LLQ or RLQ), followed by a 3.6 mg SC injection on Days 28 and 56 (alternating injection sites). Ozarelix will be reconstituted and administered as a 65 mg injection. Patients will receive two Ozarelix 65 mg subcutaneous injections (SC) on Day 1, and one 65 mg SC injection on day 8, followed by one 65 mg injection on days 28 and 56. The patients will receive one Goserelin 3.6 mg SC injection at baseline, Day 28 and Day 56.</detailed_description>
