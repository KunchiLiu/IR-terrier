	<brief_summary>This is a registry study in adult patients with newly diagnosed or refractory/relapsed myeloid neoplasms Investigator's sites: 60-70 sites in Germany and Austria Estimated duration of observation of an individual patient: 10 years maximum Objectives - To register all patients with acute myeloid leukemia and related precursor neoplasms, acute leukemia of unambiguous lineage, with higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS with excess blasts 2), and with myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition, newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory in all participating centers (completeness) - To perform timely analyses of disease-related genetic markers (incidences, treatment recommendations) - To assess patient and family history, clinical characteristics and outcome data (event-free survival [EFS], cumulative incidence of relapse [CIR], cumulative incidence of death [CID], overall survival [OS]) - To assess biological disease features and correlate with clinical outcome data (prognostic and predictive markers) - To store biosamples from all patients (e.g., bone marrow, blood, plasma, normal tissue, e.g., skin biopsy, buccal swap, finger nails, hairs, or sputum) - To assess quality of life</brief_summary>
