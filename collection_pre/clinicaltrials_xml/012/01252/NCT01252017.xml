	<brief_title>Nilotinib for Cytomegalovirus Prophylaxis and Treatment After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether nilotinib is effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of CMV reactivation in allo-HSCT patients. Prophylaxis Part: patients will be treated with nilotinib after their hemogram engraftment to prevent CMV reactivation Salvage Part: patients who have had intractable CMV reactivation after gancyclovir therapy will be treated with nilotinib</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Part A: Adult patients who have received alloHSCT Performance status ECOG 02 Patients with CMV reactivation (defined as plasma CMV DNA copy numbers of more than 1000 copy numbers/ml by QuantitativePCR) after alloHSCT. Patients with CMV reactivation that is uncontrollable by conventional first line agent (ganciclovir) for 2 or more weeks, or patients who are intolerable to ganciclovir treatment. Part B Adult patients who have received alloHSCT Performance status ECOG 02 Either the patient or his/her donor are CMVIgG test positive Patients with posttransplantation engraftment: stable myeloid engraftment (absolute neutrophil count 500/mm3) for at least 3 consecutive days, and stable megakaryocyte engraftment (platelet count 20k/uL) for at least 3 consecutive days. Patient with no CMV reactivation before enrollment: a negative (undetectable) plasma CMV DNA QuantitativePCR assay on blood collected within 7 days Patients without previous or current exposure to any prophylactic or therapeutic drugs for CMV reactivation Patients with renal insufficiency: serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL, Patients with significant electrolyte deficiency after suitable supplement: [K] &lt;3.0mmol/L, [Ca]&lt; 2.0 mmol/L(corrected), or [Mg] &lt; 0.6 mmol/L. Patients with hepatic dysfunction: alkaline phosphatase â‰¥2.5 times of the upper normal limit of the normal range (ULN); serum alanine or aspartate aminotransferase levels of &gt; 5 times ULN; a serum total bilirubin of &gt; 3 mg/dL Patients with serum amylase and lipase &gt; 1.5 x ULN Patients with history of HIV infection Patients with unstable medical condition or any other history of serious/significant medical diseases deemed not appropriate to be included to this study as judged by investigators Females patient who are pregnant or breastfeeding Female patients of childbearing potential not using any reliable and appropriate contraception method(s) Patients with life expectancy, as judged by the investigators, is less than 3 months Patients with, as judged by the investigators, other contraindications of nilotinib administration, such as prolonged QTc, concurrent usage of drugs that possess possible severe drugdrug interactions with nilotinib, or had severe adverse effects in the previous exposure to nilotinib Patients who cannot swallow capsules. Patients who are unwilling or unable to give consent</criteria>
