	<brief_summary>The study aims to investigate the correspondence between changes in central venous oxygen saturation (ScO2) and in cardiac output during hemodialysis. In 12 hemodialysis patients with an A-V fistula, a thoracic bioimpedance cardiograph will be validated for cardiac output measurements during ongoing hemodialysis. Provided this validation is satisfactory, impedance cardiography cardiac output and ScO2 will be measured at intervals during hemodialysis in 25 hemodialysis patients with a central vascular access. Absolute values and trends will be compared.</brief_summary>
