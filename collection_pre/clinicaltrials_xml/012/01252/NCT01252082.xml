	<brief_title>Non-surgical Periodontal Therapy Effects Metabolic Control in Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), the most common type of diabetes, is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and associated complications. The classic major complications of diabetes are microangiopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, delayed wound healing, and periodontitis. There is an interacting, complex relationship between diabetes and periodontitis.Many studies have shown a greater incidence and a greater severity of periodontitis in diabetic patients.Meanwhile, a number of studies have suggested that periodontitis may actually be a risk factor for diabetic complications as well. This study is performed to investigate the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy on metabolic control in DM2 patients.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>(1) mild to moderate periodontitis according to the criteria of the American Academy of Periodontology (32); (2) diagnosis of DM2 with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values over 7%; (3) no major diabetic complications; (4) blood sugar controlled with glybenclamide and metformin, without insulin administration; and (5) no systemic antibiotic administration or periodontal treatment within the last 6 months. (1) presence of systemic diseases other than DM2 that may influence the course of periodontal disease; (2) intake of immunosuppressive drugs, steroids, hydantoin, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; (3) tobacco use; (4) pregnancy or intention to become pregnant during the study period; (5) fixed orthodontic appliances; and (5) refusal or inability to give informed consent</criteria>
