	<brief_summary>The investigators will try to predict the risk of esophageal varices (EVs) in long-term BA survivors using noninvasive computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) indices and the measurement of transverse diameters of paraesophageal and gastroesophageal veins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Review of CT and MR in Pediatric Patients With Cholestasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We intend to review retrospectively 80 pediatric patients on an average of 2 years, who underwent 64-slice CT or MR examinations between January 2005 and Oct 2010 and had EVs on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Splenic diameters (mm) and hepatic diameters of all patients were measured. Splenic and hepatic volume indices also calculated. The transverse diameters of paraesophageal varices (PVs) and perigastric varices (PGVs) were measured adjacent to the lower thoracic esophagus and within the lesser sac, respectively. We will try to find out the possible splenic, hepatic or vascular predicting factors useful to evaluate the risk of clinically evident esophageal varices.</detailed_description>
