	<criteria>All subjects must have history of histologically confirmed malignancy. Brain biopsy is not required unless diagnosis is judged to be in doubt by the treating physician. Newly diagnosed brain metastases (four or fewer by postcontrast MRI obtained within six weeks of study entry) At least one brain metastasis (index tumor) must be within 26 cm in maximum diameter and deemed appropriate for surgical resection by the treating neurosurgeon. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of greater than or equal to 60 (Appendix B) Age greater than 19 Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks Subjects given written informed consent Patients with small cell lung cancer and lymphoma are ineligible. More than four metastases by baseline postcontrast MRI Prior whole brain radiation therapy Insufficient recovery from all active toxicities of prior therapies Subjects who are deemed to be poor surgical risks by the treating neurosurgeon because of medical comorbidities Pregnant or nursing women Women of childbearing potential who are not using an effective method of contraception are excluded. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to administration of SRS.</criteria>
