	<brief_summary>The aim is to investigate the importance of vitamin D levels to achieve the effect of strength training. If we can show that vitamin D has an effect of training, the ultimate goal is to find out why and how vitamin D affects muscle. This would potentially have important implications for public health. Since a large number of populations, including elderly, are shown to have too little vitamin D and also has low muscle strength, it will be essential that these people added vitamin D in relation to training and rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
