	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oritavancin in ABSSSIs, including those caused by MRSA and to evaluate the potential economic benefit of oritavancin administered as a single 1200 mg IV dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oritavancin Versus IV Vancomycin for the Treatment of Patients With Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative efficacy and safety study of single-dose IV oritavancin/IV placebo versus IV vancomycin for 7 to 10 days in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) suspected or proven to be caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Approximately 960 patients will be randomized at 100 centers globally. In addition, this study will characterize the PK and PK/PD properties of a single 1200 mg IV dose of oritavancin and evaluate the potential health economic benefits offered by this dosing strategy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Males or females ≥18 years old 2. Diagnosis of ABSSSI suspected or confirmed to be caused by a Grampositive pathogen requiring at least 5 days of IV therapy 3. An ABSSSI includes one of the following infections Wound infections, Cellulitis/erysipelas, Major cutaneous abscess 4. ABSSSI must present with at least 2 signs and symptoms 5. Able to give informed consent and willing to comply with all required study procedures Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria apply prior to randomization: 1. Prior systemic or topical antibacterial therapy with activity against suspected or proven Grampositive pathogens within the preceding 14 days The causative Grampositive pathogen(s) isolated from the ABSSSI site is resistant in vitro to the antibacterial(s) that was administered with documented clinical progression, or Documented failure to previous ABSSSI antibiotic therapy is available.
