	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Role of Prostaglandins in Radiation-induced Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis is a significant toxicity of radiation therapy and chemoradiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients. However the mechanisms that induce such mucositis are not completely understood. Previous work evaluating mucositis in bone marrow transplant patients has suggested that prostaglandin levels may be associated with the appearance of mucositis. The present study will measure the levels in saliva of the prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2 before, during, immediately after, and several weeks after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. These salivary levels will be correlated with clinical observation of mucositis and patient reporting of pain levels. Improved understanding of the mechanism of mucositis may lead to the development of more effective targeted agents to prevent this problem.</detailed_description>
