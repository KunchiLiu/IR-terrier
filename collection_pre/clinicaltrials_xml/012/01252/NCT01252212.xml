	<brief_summary>In this project, we will work directly with underserved patients in a safety-net setting to conduct a randomized clinical trial of standard-of-care adherence counseling versus a novel adherence intervention embedded in an existing PHR that uses cellular phone short message service (SMS) reminders and patient responses to the reminders. We will compare adherence rates in both arms as assessed by antiretroviral medication concentrations in hair samples and self-report; clinical outcomes will also be compared in the two arms. The project will examine medication adherence for antiretroviral medications and treatments of common conditions such as depression, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.</brief_summary>
