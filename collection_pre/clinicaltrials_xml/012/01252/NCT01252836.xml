	<brief_title>Study Evaluating AWBAT-D Versus the Standard of Care of Split-thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a randomized-controlled trial to examine split thickness skin graft donor wound site healing using AWBAT-D compared to current standard of care: Tegaderm. This will involve randomizing subjects to treatment with the AWBAT-D dressing or Tegaderm and monitoring outcomes. The AWBAT-D device has collagen and we hypothesize that the wounds treated with it will heal faster and with a decreased pain level. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there are differences in outcomes between AWBAT-D and Tegaderm in healing split thickness skin graft donor sites.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Subject is 18 years of age or older 2. Subjects requiring a splitthickness skin graft with a wound size between 5 and 50cm2 and a depth between 1218um. 3. Ability and willingness to understand and comply with study procedures and to give written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. 1. Subjects &lt; 18 years of age 2. Subjects with an allergy to porcine products. 3. Subjects undergoing STSG with a wound size less than 5 cm2 or greater than 50cm2. 4. Subjects undergoing STSG with a wound depth of less than 12um or greater than 18um. 5. Subjects undergoing repeat skin graft harvesting at the same donor site. 6. Has active malignant disease of any kind. A subject, who has had a malignant disease in the past, was treated and is currently diseasefree, may be considered for study entry. 7.
