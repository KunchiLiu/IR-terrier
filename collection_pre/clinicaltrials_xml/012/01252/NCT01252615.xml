	<brief_title>Patient and Partner Intervention After an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this randomized trial is to test a patient+partner intervention against the patient only intervention on recovery outcomes of patients and partners after ICD implantation. By interventing with both ICD patients and their partners, we expect to further improve outcomes of patients and aid in recovery of partners. Over a five year period we will test the effects of a 12 week patient+partner intervention against a patient only intervention in the first year subsequent to ICD implantation, using a 2 group (N=150/group) randomized clinical trial design. Relevant data will be collected on ICD patients and intimate partners at hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, 12 months post-ICD implantation. The four major outcomes are: physical functioning, psychological adjustment, health care utilization, and relationship impact. The primary analysis of treatment effect is the change in outcome variables from baseline to 3 months for the patient and partner. Secondarily, exploring long term effects of the intervention, theoretical elements, and the intervention effects by ICD implant reason will be determined.</detailed_description>
