	<detailed_description>Conditioning therapy - Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/d on d-7 to -6 - Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on d-7 to -2 - ATG 1.5-3.0 mg/kg/d on d-3 to -1 - Methylpred 2 mg/kg/d on d-4 to -1 Mobilization and harvest - Donor - G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/d s.c. on d-3 to 0 - Harvest of PBMCs on d 0 to +1 Infuse G-PBMCs on d 0 to d+1. - Donor G-PBMC infusion GVHD prophylaxis - Cyclosporine 1.5 mg/kg i.v. q 12 hrs beginning on d-1 and changed to oral dosing (with twice the i.v. dose) when oral intake is possible. Tapered beginning between d+30 and d+60. - Methotrexate 15 mg/m2 i.v. on d+2, and 10 mg/m2 i.v. on d+4 and d+7 Prophylactic dose-escalating DLIs - Begin at d+120 or at least 2 wks after IST discontinuation. - No evidence of recurrence or GVHD CD3+ cell dose increment q 4 wks 4Three dose levels</detailed_description>
