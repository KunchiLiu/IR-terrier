	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is the evaluation of two usual care strategies after stroke or TIA : achieved target LDL-C of 100 mg/dL (+/-10 mg/dL) or less than 70 mg/dL. Investigators will use the statin and titrate the dosage to achieve the target assigned by randomization in monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe or other drugs. The primary end-point is the occurrence of recurrent non fatal stroke, non fatal MI, and vascular death in each group. 3760 patients will be recruited and followed for eight and a half years maximum.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is the evaluation of two usual care strategies after stroke or TIA : achieved target LDL-C of 100 mg/dL (+/-10 mg/dL) or less than 70 mg/dL. Investigators will use the statin and titrate the dosage to achieve the target assigned by randomization in monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe or other drugs. Inclusion criteria: - Recent (less than 3 months) ischemic stroke As soon as possible after the event, once the neurologic deficit is stabilized (investigator judgment). These ischemic strokes include TIA with ischemic lesion documented by CT or MRI. - Or recent TIA (less than 15 days) without documentation of ischemic lesion on CT/MR imaging. Must be limb weakness or aphasia lasting more than 10 min. - And documented atherosclerotic stenosis in carotid artery (investigator judgment) (based on the results of Duplex echography, CTA, MRA or X ray- angiography), Or in the aortic arch (investigator judgment) (based on TEE or CTA), Or in other brain artery: vertebral, basilar or other intracranial artery (based on CTA, MRA, XRA), Or in coronary arteries (past history of acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization or positive coronary angiography) - And statin treatment is indicated, following ANSM guidelines (French drug agency), age &gt;18 years, rankin score ≤ 4, patient or a legal representative signs consent, patient is affiliated to social security system Exclusion criteria : - Ischemic stroke/TIA du to arterial dissection (investigator judgment) - Cardiac source of embolism (e.g., mitral stenosis, endomyocardial fibrosis) without documented atherosclerotic stenosis : a patient with atrial fibrillation or a past history of recent myocardial infarction or calcified aortic stenosis can be randomized if he otherwise fulfils inclusion criteria - Symptomatic hemorrhagic stroke : Presence of microbleeds on gradient echo imaging (T2*) is not an exclusion criteria. Hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke is not an exclusion criteria - Uncontrolled hypertension (investigator judgment) - LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL or patients for whom treatment intensification is impossible - F/U impossible or bad observance anticipated. - Co-morbid condition that may interfere with the F/U or with the evaluation of primary endpoint - Participation to another clinical trial The primary end-point is: occurrence of recurrent non fatal stroke, non fatal MI, and vascular death in each group. Secondary endpoints: - Fatal and non fatal stroke - Stroke and TIA - Major coronary event (MI, sudden death, coronary revascularization for an ACS) - Any coronary endpoints (MI, hospitalization for ACS, coronary revascularization) - Any revascularization procedures (coronary, carotid, peripheral) - Carotid revascularization (either surgical or endovascular) - Vascular death - Total death Hypothesis : - Follow-up of three years - Risk of primary end-point in the control group (Target LDL &lt;100 mg/dL) : 4% per year (12 % at 36 months) - 5% Alpha, 80% power, total number of subject is : - 3068 patients with a RRR 25% - 20% drop-out: 3760 patients (385 primary EP) Study specifications Follow-up : eight and a half years Follow-up visit : every 6 months Number of centers (French Stroke Units, under the auspice of the French Neurovascular Society) : 60-100 Ancillary study As an ancillary study, 800 patients (400 in each arm in 4 centers) will participate in the TST-PLUS (Plaque Ultrasound Study), in which they will have three ultrasound examination (baseline, 1 year and 3 years) and baseline blood sampling. The primary endpoint of this substudy will be the rate of occurrence of new carotid plaque, with the hypothesis that Rate of plaque occurrence in the &lt;100 mg/dL group will be 25% after 3 years (45% in EVA when atherosclerosis was present at baseline) RRR of plaque of 25% in the &lt;70 mg/dL group Alpha 5%, power 80% As an ancillary study, 1000 patients will participate in the TST-PGS (Pharmacogenetics) Study, in which they will have 1 blood sampling either at baseline or during one of the follow-up visits of TST. The aim of this study is to show that the benefit (risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death) observed with a strategy of LDL-C &lt;0.7 g / l compared to a strategy of LDL-C to 1 ± 0.1 g / l is higher in carriers of polymorphism 719Arg of the gene KIF-6 than non-carriers of this polymorphism.</detailed_description>
