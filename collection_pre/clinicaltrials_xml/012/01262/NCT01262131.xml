	<criteria>Current diagnosis of fibromyalgia made by the study Principal Investigator (PI) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia. Rating of current Degree of Pain on the 010 Numeric Pain Intensity Scale of 4 or greater. Subject's use of pain relief medication(s) has been stable over the past 30 days, and subject is willing and able to maintain preexisting use of pain relief medication(s) as his or her sole pain relief medication use, as needed, throughout study participation. Subject's use of insomnia medication(s) has been stable over the past 30 days, and subject is willing and able to maintain this existing use of insomnia medication(s) as his or her sole insomnia relief medication(s), as needed, throughout study participation. Subject has been on current (or no) medication regimen, unchanged for at least 30 days prior to study enrollment, and is willing and able to maintain that regular medication regimen, unchanged, throughout study participation. Willing and able to refrain from use of tender point injections throughout study participation. Willing and able to abstain from partaking in other/new treatments to improve fibromyalgia symptoms during study participation. Adequate contraceptive measures for female subjects. 18 years of age or older. Male or female. Any factors that might prevent the subject from completing a full course of therapy with the Resonatorâ„¢ device, or from attending any of the scheduled study visits, or from completing any of the study measures. Subject suffers from coexistent chronic pain condition(s) of nonfibromyalgia origin, such as osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain, painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuropathic pain, that cannot be distinguished in severity and/or in type/sensation of pain from the pain originating from the subject's condition of fibromyalgia. Any other significant comorbidities that might impact the ability to evaluate the subject's satisfaction of the ACR 1990 Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia, or for the subject to complete any of the study assessment tools. Tender point injections received within the prior one month. Current or past history of major psychiatric disturbance (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance abuse). Known inflammatory rheumatic disease. Epilepsy/history of seizures/taking medication for epilepsy. HIV and other autoimmune disorders. Active cancer or treatment for cancer within last 6 months. Active infection(s). History of ECT Uncontrolled Hypertension. Advanced Pulmonary Disease. Unstable cardiac disease. Prosthetics or implants comprised of ferrous metals. Pacemakers, vagus nerve stimulators, or other functional electrical stimulators such as those commonly used for pain. Consumption of more than 21 alcoholic drinks per week. Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning pregnancy prior to end of study participation. Developmental disability or other cognitive impairment that would in the judgment of the PI impair adequate comprehension of the informed consent form or complete any of the studyrelated activities. Worker's compensation, receipt of disability or present/past litigation for monetary compensation pertaining to subject's fibromyalgia condition. Participation in other research within 30 days of study enrollment.</criteria>
