	<brief_summary>Primary focal hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) is a debilitating condition affecting approximately 3% of the population in the United States. Not only that it is a major social embarrassment to affected individuals, it also has significant negative impacts on career, school, and relationship. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A), a sterile neurotoxin purified from Clostridium bacteria, was approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration in 2004 for the treatment of severe focal axillary hyperhidrosis that does not respond to topical antiperspirants. It is becoming a promising treatment for many patients suffering this condition. Over the past decade, the medication has also been used effectively for many other forms of focal hyperhidrosis such as the hands, feet, forehead, scalp and groin. Unfortunately, BTX-A injection for primary focal hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles are often limited by pain and post treatment muscle weakness associated with the procedure. Recent studies have demonstrated that BTX-A can be delivered across the skin via electric current using a medical device, called iontophoresis (FDA 510(k) clearance # K042590 or Phoresor IIPM700). Studies with limited number of patients have demonstrated promising results with this new treatment.</brief_summary>
