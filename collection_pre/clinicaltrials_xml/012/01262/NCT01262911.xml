	<brief_summary>SRT2379 is a potent small molecule activator of SIRT1 that has been found to inhibit systemic inflammation induced by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. The objective of this study is to test if SRT2379 may be a novel compound for the treatment of inflammatory disorders in man.</brief_summary>
