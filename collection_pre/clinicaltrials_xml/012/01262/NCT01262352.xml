	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor (VX-770) on lung clearance index (LCI) in subjects aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have the G551D-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Ivacaftor on Lung Clearance Index in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis and the G551D Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, limited objective measures are available to quantify lung function in CF patients with mild lung disease. Lung clearance index (LCI) derived from inert gas multiple-breath washout (MBW) testing hold considerable promise to evaluate early lung disease as studies have detected abnormalities in a high percentage of CF patients with normal spirometry in both infants and children. This study explored the effect of ivacaftor on LCI and the efficacy of ivacaftor on other clinical and biomarker endpoints of CF lung disease in subjects aged 6 years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele.</detailed_description>
