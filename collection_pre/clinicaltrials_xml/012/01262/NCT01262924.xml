	<criteria>A male or female aged ≥18 years at the time of vaccination Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study Written informed consent obtained from the subject If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential , i.e., either surgically sterilised or one year postmenopausal; or, if of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. For the annex phase of this study, subjects must meet the inclusion criteria mentioned above. In addition, subjects must have received either reducedantigencontent diphtheriatetanus or diphtheriatetanusacellular pertussis vaccine in the initial phase of the study and not responded to either the diphtheria or tetanus toxoid.. Vaccination against diphtheria and/or tetanus within the previous five years Vaccination against pertussis since childhood History of diphtheria and/or tetanus Known history of pertussis within the previous five years Known exposure to diphtheria or pertussis within the previous five years Known history of nonresponse to diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis vaccine Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine(s) during the study period or within 30 days/ 5 halflives preceding the dose of study vaccine Administration of chronic immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months/ 5 halflives of vaccination. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before vaccination and ending 30 days after Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding vaccination or planned administration/ administration during the study period Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition Pregnant or lactating female History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccines Acute disease at the time of enrolment Oral temperature of ≥37.5°C (99.5°F) Any of the following having occurred after previous administration of diphtheriatetanuspertussis vaccine or diptheria and tetanus vaccines An immediate anaphylactic reaction Signs of encephalopathy Any of the following having occurred after previous administration of diphtheriatetanuspertussis vaccine alone or in combination with other antigens: Rectal temperature ≥40.5°C within 48 hours of vaccination and not due to another identifiable cause Collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination Persistent, inconsolable screaming or crying lasting ≥3 hours within 48 hours of vaccination Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination</criteria>
