	<brief_title>SECOTEX® (Tamsulosin Hydrochloride) Bioequivalence Study Brazil - Fast Admin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TITLE: Randomized, two-period, cross-over, bioequivalence study on tamsulosin hydrochloride 0,4 mg prolonged release hard gelatin capsule (Synthon BV, The Netherlands) versus SECOTEX® (tamsulosin hydrochloride) 0,4 mg prolonged release hard gelatin capsule (Boehringer Ingelheim do Brasil Química e Farmacêutica Ltda) in healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions. It will be an open-label, randomized, laboratory-blind, crossover study with 02 treatments, 02 sequences, and 02 periods, in which the healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions receive, in each period, the test formulation or the reference formulation. The treatment's sequence attributed to each volunteer on the study period is determined by a randomization list, which is generated by PROC PLAN from SAS version 9.1.3 system. The formulations will be administered as a single oral dose followed by blood collections between, at least, 3 to 5 half-lives. The treatment's periods may obey a minimum interval of 7 half lives between them (period for drug's whole elimination by the organism).</detailed_description>
