	<brief_summary>This study involves inducting treatment seeking opioid dependent participants onto buprenorphine. Once the participant reaches a stable dose they will receive either placebo or gabapentin to determine if gabapentin helps ease withdrawal symptoms while the participant undergoes a 10-day buprenorphine detoxification.</brief_summary>

If any individual's degree of opioid dependence is questionable, that person will be excluded from further consideration as a participant. Participants must submit a urine negative for drugs of abuse other than opioids prior to starting the study. Unstable medical condition or stable medical condition that would interact with study medications or participation. History of major psychiatric disorder (psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar, depression) Pregnancy or plans to become pregnant or inadequate birth control (adequate birth control includes abstinence, condoms, birth control pills, etc). Present or recent use of overthecounter psychoactive drug, prescription psychoactive drug or drug (including Maalox) that would have major interaction with drugs to be tested. Liver function tests greater than 3 times normal, BUN and Creatinine outside normal range, or thyroid function tests outside normal range. EKG abnormalities including but not limited to: bradycardia (&lt;60 bpm); prolonged QTc interval (&gt;450 msec); WolffParkinson White syndrome; wide complex tachycardia; 2nd degree, Mobitz type II heart block; 3rd degree heart block; left or right bundle branch block.
