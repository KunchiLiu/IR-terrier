	<brief_summary>There remain important barriers to the translation of the programs like the Diabetes Prevention Program to public health. There is a lack of established lifestyle intervention programs as they are resource and time intensive, exceeding both the resources and the training of most primary care providers. A solution may be the implementation of lifestyle intervention programs in the community setting that are unrelated to primary medical care. A community based program at a public facility may extend the reach of lifestyle intervention to those unable to obtain these services from an established medical facility. Community lifestyle intervention to modify dietary, physical activity, and behavioral factors may be a promising strategy for weight management and the reduction of risk for metabolic disease. In this validation study we will assess pre and post intervention to identify whether measurable changes can be detected in body weight, body composition, markers of metabolic disease and quality of life after participation in the "Healthy Creations", a community based lifestyle intervention program presented by Center Court Fitness Center of the Grand Forks Park District and Altru Health System.</brief_summary>
