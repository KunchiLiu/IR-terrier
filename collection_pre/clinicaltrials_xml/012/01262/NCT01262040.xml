	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether narrowband imaging (NBI) makes it easier for a surgeon to see cancer. NBI is a kind of light. Normally, white light is used during surgery. White light uses many wavelengths of light. NBI only uses two wavelengths which highlight the blood vessels. This makes it easier for the surgeon to see blood vessels. Tumors often have more blood vessels than normal tissue. As a result, NBI may make it easier for the surgeon to see small tumors. In this study the surgeon will look with both normal white light and NBI. This way a comparison can be made to determine which is superior. Improved identification of tumors allows doctors and patients to make informed decisions about whether treatment is needed after surgery. It also provides additional information to determine which treatments may be best.</brief_summary>
