	<brief_summary>This a randomized controlled study to test the hypothesis that patients who perform in-cast exercises will have superior range of motion immediately post-cast removal, without a concomitant increase in complication rate when compared with a control group who receives standard post cast care which does not include the intervention exercises.</brief_summary>
