	<brief_summary>This study evaluates micrografting using a harvesting and grafting process that has been designed by Momelan Technologies. The overall concept is to harvest several small pieces of skin, each measuring about 1.75 mm in diameter from a normal pigmented area using a commercially available suction blister device, adhere them to a sterile elastomeric substrate and is then place it on a recipient area prepared by epidermal dermabrasion (removal of the epidermis).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Micrografting Technique for Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with vitiligo patches undergo removal of the epidermis of the affected vitiligo skin with dermabrasion. Several small pieces of pigmented skin (1.75mm) from the patient are taken from another area with the use of a suction blister device. The harvested pigmented skin is adhered to a sterile elastomeric substrate and placed on the previously dermabraded affected area. Originally the primary outcome was percentage of change in pigmentation with UV photos at 10 weeks in sites undergoing grafts compared to control sites. However, because we were unable to take UV photos, we had to revise our primary outcome.</detailed_description>
