	<brief_summary>Cervical Cancer is staged clinically, not surgically. Patients in whom an extensive disease is identified are not usually eligible for surgery. PET-CT is used to support staging. However, some patients received surgery after staging and subsequently require radio/chemotherapy due to findings on operation. This study will attempt to find a correlation between SUV-Max on PET-CT and subsequent outcomes i.e. need for adjuvant therapy.</brief_summary>
