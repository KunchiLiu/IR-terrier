	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Manuka honey may prevent or reduce esophagitis-related pain caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether Manuka honey is more effective than standard care in preventing pain. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II clinical trial is studying Manuka honey to see how well it works in preventing esophagitis-related pain in patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manuka Honey in Preventing Esophagitis-Related Pain in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy For Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the relative efficacy of 4 times a day consumption of liquid or lozenge Manuka honey to delay or prevent radiation esophagitis-related pain (during combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer) as compared to standard supportive treatment, as measured at week 4 by Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) for pain upon swallowing. Secondary - Evaluate the trend of severity of radiation esophagitis-related pain during combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer using weekly measurements of the NRPS. - Evaluate the adverse events associated with Manuka honey, as measured by CTCAE, v. 4. - Evaluate the severity of radiation esophagitis (grade 3-4, CTCAE, v. 4). - Assess weight loss (percent weight change from baseline to 4 weeks). - Assess quality of life (QOL) and pain, as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-30) global QOL score and pain symptom subscale. - Assess patient-reported dysphagia via a daily patient log. - Assess nutritional status, as measured by the mean change in serum prealbumin levels from baseline to 4 weeks. - Assess opioid use by collecting the patient's narcotic use in the previous 24-hour period at each weekly evaluation. - Evaluate patient-reported adverse events associated with Manuka honey using the PRO-CTCAE. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the percentage of esophagus in the radiation field (V60 &lt; 30% vs V60 â‰¥ 30%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive standard supportive care for esophagitis-related pain as needed during chemoradiotherapy. - Arm II: Patients swallow liquid Manuka honey slowly over 3-5 minutes. Patients must refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour after administration. Treatment continues 4 times per day during chemoradiotherapy. - Arm III: Patients place Manuka honey lozenges in their mouth one at a time and swallow the honey as it dissolves (no chewing or swallowing it whole). Patients must refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour after administration. Treatment continues 4 times per day during chemoradiotherapy. Patients complete quality of life, pain swallowing diary, and pain assessments (Numerical Rating Pain Scale, EORTC ALA-30 and Pain Subscale, and PRO-CTCAE) periodically during study treatment. Patients are followed up at 12 weeks from the start of study treatment.</detailed_description>
