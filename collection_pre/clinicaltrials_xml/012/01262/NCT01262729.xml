	<brief_title>Xenon and Therapeutical Hypothermia After Successful Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest and successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation will be randomized in two groups. First group (Treatment group) will be inhalated with xenon within 2 hours in addition to therapeutical hypothermia.
