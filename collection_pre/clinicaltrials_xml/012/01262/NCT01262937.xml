	<brief_summary>The goal of the project is to determine whether confocal endomicroscopy can be used to identify and discriminate among dysplastic, neoplastic, and nonneoplastic tissue, as compared with histologic specimens as a reference. The project will evaluate those at risk for or with known Barrett's esophagus, and those with known or suspected biliary strictures. It is our hypothesis that we will be able to identify between neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue.</brief_summary>
