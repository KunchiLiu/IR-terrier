	<brief_title>Device to Reduce Surgery Site Contamination - Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Air Barrier System is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a surgery site from ambient airborne contamination. This study examines the hypothesis that the Air Barrier System can reduce the presence of airborne colony-forming units at the surgery site during spinal procedures.</detailed_description>
