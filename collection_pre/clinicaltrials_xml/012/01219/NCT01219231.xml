	<brief_title>Effects of Physical Activity on the Brain in Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The age-related degradation of cognitive functions even to the point of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer`s disease are a growing public-health concern with devastating effects. Referring to animal data, empirical studies, and pilot human trials, exercise should improve cognitive functions such as learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general brain functions in elderly subjects (50-80 years old) with impaired glucose tolerance during a short term exercise program.</detailed_description>
