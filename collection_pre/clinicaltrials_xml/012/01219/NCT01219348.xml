	<brief_summary>Title: IDO peptid vaccination in combination with immune stimulating agent Aldara and the adjuvant Montanide, for treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small-cell lung cancer. A first-in-man phase I trial. Hypothesis: In this trial the investigators assess a new immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the immune inhibiting enzyme, IDO to investigate the potential of vaccination against IDO as a possible anticancer target.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IDO Peptid Vaccination for Stage III-IV Non Small-cell Lung Cancer Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common disease with a poor prognosis when locally advanced or metastasized, despite advances in surgery, chemo- and radiation therapy. In this trial the investigators assess a new immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the immune inhibiting enzyme, IDO to investigate the potential of vaccination against IDO as a possible anticancer target. IDO has recently been recognized as an important factor in immune regulation and development of immune tolerance in the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cells that represent IDO at their surface are known to inhibit the immune system. IDO expression is seen both in cancer cells and antigen presenting cells. The vaccination against IDO expressing cells is therefore two-sided. The vaccination therapy is thought to block the development of immune tolerance induced by IDO expressing cells. At the same time the investigators aim to stimulate the production of IDO specific T-cells, hence facilitating the elimination of IDO positive tumour cells. The primary end points are safety and toxicity evaluation. Secondary end points are immunological and clinical response.</detailed_description>
