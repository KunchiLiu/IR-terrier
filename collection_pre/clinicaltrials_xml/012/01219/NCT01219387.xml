	<brief_summary>The present study is designed to evaluate the basal serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B as early predictors of ovarian response, implantation rate, and pregnancy rate in women 38 years old or older that are undergoing an IVF cycle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Anti-mullerian Hormone Levels as Predictive of IVF Outcomes in Women Over 38 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifics aims are: a) to describe AMH and inhibin levels on day 3 previous to ART cycle; b) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the retrieved metaphase II oocytes quantity; c) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and quality embryo score d) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the number of gestational sacs per transferred-embryo (implantation rate); e) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the pregnancy rate; f) to make a prediction model for pregnancy rate by using a multivariable regression analysis. Patient participation includes signing the consent and having additional tubes of blood drawn at a regularly scheduled blood draw. This blood is used to run the study tests (AMH and inhibin levels).</detailed_description>
