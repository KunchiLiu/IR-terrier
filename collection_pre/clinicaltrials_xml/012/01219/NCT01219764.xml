	<brief_summary>The proposed study will test the hypothesis that H. pylori can be eradicated successfully (&gt;85%) using half-or full-dose "concomitant" non-bismuth quadruple therapy regimen: rabeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole twice daily for 7 days in patients with peptic ulcers and H. pylori related gastritis. Two hundred patients from the outpatient department and the endoscopy unit at AUBMC will be enrolled in this open-label trial. Patients with positive CLO tests or urea breath tests, documenting H.pylori infection, will be randomized into one of two groups: Full dose or half dose the concomitant regimen, with 100 patients in each group. Compliance and side effects will be assessed, and a urea breath test will be done for all patients after 4 weeks of therapy completion to evaluate eradication rates. Success of therapy will be evaluated according to intent-to treat and per-protocol analyses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Standard vs Half Dose Rabeprazole, Clarithromycin, Metronidazole and Amoxicillin in the Treatment of Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection with H. pylori has been linked with chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, adenocarcinoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach. Eradication of this organism has been recommended for patients with peptic ulcer disease, low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, as well as first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Guidelines still recommend using triple therapy regimen of PPI, clarithromycin and amoxicillin/metronidazole twice daily for 7 to 14 days. Over the years, it has become clear that the first-line triple therapy is loosing efficacy worldwide with PP and ITT eradication rates inferior to 80%. Antimicrobial resistance plays an important role in some of these failures. Major H. pylori study groups in the world have agreed that alternative treatment regimens are urgently needed. So far, 2 alternative treatment regimens have shown superiority over the first-line treatment protocols: the sequential therapy consisting of a combination of amoxicillin and a PPI twice a day for 5 days followed by another 5 days of the PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole/metronidazole, and the concomitant non-bismuth quadruple regimen consisting of PPI, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and amoxicillin twice daily. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that H. pylori can be eradicated successfully (&gt;85%) using half-or full-dose "concomitant" non-bismuth quadruple therapy regimen: rabeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole twice daily for 7 days in patients with peptic ulcers and H. pylori related gastritis. Two hundred patients from the outpatient department and the endoscopy unit at AUBMC will be enrolled in this open-label trial. Patients with positive CLO tests or urea breath tests, documenting H.pylori infection, will be randomized into one of two groups: Full dose or half dose the concomitant regimen, with 100 patients in each group. Compliance and side effects will be assessed, and a urea breath test will be done for all patients after 4 weeks of therapy completion to evaluate eradication rates. Success of therapy will be evaluated according to intent-to treat and per-protocol analyses.</detailed_description>
