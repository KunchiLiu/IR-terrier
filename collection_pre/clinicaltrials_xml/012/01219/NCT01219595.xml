	<detailed_description>This is a research study about the number and types of bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (E. coli strains) that are present in the intestine. The bacteria will be collected and analyzed before and after eating either sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces. This study will help us learn more about whether or not the components of consumed sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces reduce the numbers of harmful E. coli bacteria in the vaginal and intestinal tracts, thereby reducing the number of urinary tract infections among women.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women, ages 1865 History of recurrent urinary tract infections defined as three in the past year, or two in the last six months Subjects must be willing to follow the study protocol that includes consuming the mandatory daily dose of cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces and traveling to the UWHC Urology clinic for scheduled rectal and vaginal swab procedures.
