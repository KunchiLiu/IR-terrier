	<brief_summary>Falls are a common problem in elderly people which they have to receive the operation. Hemiarthroplasty is one of the common orthopedics operations. The prompt operation and good pain control will provide the good recovery and outcome. The investigators compare the efficacy of postoperative pain control between Intrathecal morphine 0.1 milligrams (mg.) with the local infiltration of 0.25% Bupivacaine for 20 milliliters (ml.) in patients received hip hemiarthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain Control After Hip Hemiarthroplasty: Intrathecal Morphine vs Periarticular Infiltration of Bupivacaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study process All the patients who assigned the hip hemiarthroplasty without any exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and be divided into 3 groups randomly 1. control group : the patients will be received spinal anesthesia with 0.5% Isobaric Bupivacaine and postoperative pain control by intravenous (IV) Patient - control Analgesia (PCA) 2. Morphine group : the patients will be received 0.1 mg. of Morphine added in Isobaric Bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia and postoperative pain control by IV PCA 3. Local group : the patients will be received spinal anesthesia and periarticular tissue infiltration with 0.25% Bupivacaine and postoperative pain control by IV PCA Data collection 1. Demographic data : age, sex, Body Weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), ... 2. Pain score every 3 hours postoperatively in the first 6 hours and at the 12th hours by visual analogue scoring system 3. Patient global assessment and patient satisfactory visual analogue scoring system at 24th and 48th hour 4. the amount of morphine during 24 and 48 hours postoperative and the time of first dose they received</detailed_description>
