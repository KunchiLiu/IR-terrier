	<brief_summary>The research purpose of this project is to create a registry, and blood and tissue bank for individuals at high-risk for pancreatic cancer. We plan to conduct histopathological and molecular analysis of resected pancreatic tissue prospectively collected from a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN) and the Association With Recurrence of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. In order to improve outcomes of this disease, significant research efforts have focused on understanding the changes that occur in the pancreas prior to tumor occurrence. The types of changes most often associated with tumor have been named pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). It is not yet clear how to identify the PanIN lesions most likely to develop into cancer and the length of time required for this progression. In order to evaluate these questions, we are interested in examining the microscopic and genetic characteristics of PanIN lesions in two "high-risk" patients: 1) patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer and developed tumor recurrence after surgery and 2) patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or with a genetic syndrome that puts them at risk for pancreas cancer. The surgical specimens from these patients will be evaluated by a pathologist for evidence of widespread PanIN lesions. In addition, PanIN lesions will be tested for abnormalities in several major genes that are known to be important in pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Tissueconfirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Underwent surgical resection for adenocarcinoma at ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center with pathologically negative surgical margins. Enrolled in our Pancreatic Cancer Registry and Tissue Bank protocol (AAAA6154). Have at least 2 relatives (of whom one must be firstdegree relative) with pancreatic cancer, or have been diagnosed with a a genetic syndrome which is associated with pancreatic cancer (among the included syndromes include BRCA1/2, FAMMM, PeutzJeghers, HNPCC, Hereditary Pancreatitis) —OR— Have radiological or pathological (fine needle aspirate or surgical biopsy) evidence of local tumor recurrence following surgery. Metastatic disease discovered at presentation or on recurrence (exception is the familial PDC patients) Positive surgical margins. Lack of clinical followup at one year following surgery</criteria>
