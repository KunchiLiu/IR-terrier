	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy of 24 Chromosome Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FISH based PGD techniques have provided little improvement in implantation and delivery rates. We believe that the use of 24 chromosome PGD, as compared to control (no PGD) will show a benefit to patients. This study is a randomized clinical trial that seeks to validate 24 chromosome PGD. Patients that meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized prior to embryo transfer. In order to be randomized, the patient must have blastulated embryos suitable for biopsy on day 5. Half of the patients will received 24 chromosome PGD and will have 2 PGD normal embryos transferred. Half the the patients will receive no PGD and the 2 morphologically best embryos will be transferred. Follow up on pregnant patients will be a blood draw at approximately 9 weeks gestation and buccal swabs collected from the infant(s).</detailed_description>
