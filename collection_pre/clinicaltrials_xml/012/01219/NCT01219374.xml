	<brief_title>Study of Ovum Donors After Donation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although several studies have explored donor's reactions and experiences up to a year post donation, no study has explored how donor attitudes and reactions change over time. Currently, there is no long-term data available to describe donor's feelings and reactions to their donation. Consequently, programs have no guidance to counsel prospective donors about whether donors' attitudes change towards their own participation, contact with any offspring, or concerns about the donation. In addition, just as ovum donors' initial health histories were shared anonymously with the recipient(s), any updated information gathered in this study would be shared anonymously with the recipient(s) or offspring should they request those updates.</detailed_description>
