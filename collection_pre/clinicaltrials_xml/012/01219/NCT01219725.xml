	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 6 months moderate intensity exercise training completed three times per week upon traditional and emerging cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women both with and without type 2 diabetes. These risk factors include blood markers associated with increased risk such as cholesterol, insulin, glucose and markers of inflammation plus measures of body fat, heart and lung fitness, vascular stiffness and vascular function. The study hypothesised that moderate intensity exercise training would intervene in the exaggerated risk seen in women following the menopause, especially in those with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
