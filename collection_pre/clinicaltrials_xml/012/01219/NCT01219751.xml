	<brief_title>Trial Of Sunitinib In Advanced Non-Clear Cell Type Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There have been no standard treatment in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Retrospective studies showed sunitinib or sorafenib might be active in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, especially papillary type and chromophobe type. This study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of sunitinib in this group of patients.</detailed_description>
