	<brief_title>Effects of Dietary Interventions on the Brain in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The age-related degradation of cognitive functions even to the point of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer`s disease are a growing public-health concern with devastating effects. Referring to animal data, empirical studies, and pilot human trials, dietary modification (caloric restriction, omega-3 fatty acids and resveratrol) should improve cognitive functions such as learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general brain functions in elderly subjects (50-80 years old) with mild cognitive impairment.</detailed_description>
