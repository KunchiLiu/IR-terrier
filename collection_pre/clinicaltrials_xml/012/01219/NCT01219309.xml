	<detailed_description>The study design is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a total duration of 6 months. 50-100 children and adolescents, aged 8-18 years, who meet the DSM-IVÔ criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) of any subtype will be given the opportunity to participate. The study comprises 2 study periods. Study Period I This is an assessment/evaluation and drug washout phase of up to 1-3 months for those patients taking any medication excluded by the protocol. Study Period II Participants will be randomised to 3 months of treatment with a fixed dose of 6 capsules per day of EyeQ, divided in two daily doses, to supply 558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA and 60 mg GLA daily, or to placebo. Identical capsules containing olive oil will be used as placebo. Randomisation will be organized by Equazen UK Ltd, who will prepare randomisation numbers to be sent out to the investigation centre. At 3 months a one-way treatment crossover of the placebo-group to active treatment will be made so that both patient groups will receive EyeQ for the remaining 3-month period. Compliance will be ascertained through bi-weekly telephone contacts and at each visit. Compliance is defined as taking the prescribed dosage &gt;70% of the days in a visit interval.
