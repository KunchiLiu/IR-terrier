	<brief_summary>The main aim of the study is to determine whether intramuscular injection of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells can improve the ventricular function of children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy(IDCM); Secondary end-points will be: 1)To explore the possible mechanism of the improvement of ventricular function in children with IDCM and 2) to evaluate the safety of intramuscular injection of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intramuscular Injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cell for Treatment of Children With Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy class II to III NYHA with ejection fraction over 20% were selected for phase II clinical trial, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were injected into limb muscle and followed for 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children of both genders with established clinical and echocardiographic diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy whose parents accept to participate in the trail. They should have symptoms and /or signs of heart failure, despite optimized medical treatment. Ejection fraction of left ventricular should be less than 50%, but more than 20%. associate coronary artery disease. any history or suspicion of a toxic , pharmacologic or deposit etiology. associated malignant or pre malignant systemic disease. associated hematologic disorder. a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. a history of syncope during the previous year, or with an active infectious disease or positive tests to viral disease.</criteria>
