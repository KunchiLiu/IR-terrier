	<brief_summary>Purpose: To investigate the relationship between retinal thickness (RT) and metabolic risks (MRs) in patients without retinal lesion. Methods: Fifty-two patients over 60 y/o were divided into four groups according to their MRs of hypertension, hyperlipidemia or hyperglyceremia. After complete ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography was performed to measure RT.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>We enrolled the patients included age more than 60 years old, no positive finding during dilated fundus examination. The exclusion criteria were as followed: systemic disease that will affect visual acuity evaluation (for example: CVA), *opaque cornea and vitreous glaucoma uvietis and other clinically established ocular disease. According to the LOCS III11, those who had nuclear opalescence, nuclear color more than grade 3 or any grade of cortical cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract were also eliminated.</criteria>
