	<brief_summary>Although it is important in the clinical management to classify BRVO into subtypes based on the location of the occlusion (major or macular), few studies have provided such information[8,9]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with macular edema due to Branch retinal vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injection and to determine the concentrations of cytokines in the aqueous humor according to the site of the occlusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Major and Macular Branched Retinal Venous Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Branch retinal vein occlusion is the second most frequent major retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy. One of the main reasons for visual loss in BRVO is the development of macular edema. Treatment options for BRVO include grid laser treatment, intravitreal injection of steroids, surgical procedures, and off-label treatment with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. During recent years, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab has been shown to efficiently reduce macular edema and improve visual acuity in numerous case series and prospective or retrospective studies.</detailed_description>
