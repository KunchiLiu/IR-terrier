	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function and increased symptoms such as breathlessness/dyspnoea, cough and expectoration. Even though subjective in nature, the symptomatology of COPD and mainly that of breathlessness/dyspnoea has been studied with the use of objective measurement tools. Taking into consideration that the symptoms experienced by the patient who suffers from a progressive disease such as COPD can only be perceived and interpreted by the patient him- or herself, and thus difficult to be quantified, COPD remains a challenge in clinical research. Therefore, there is a need to carry out qualitative studies that will provide insight into the wide spectrum of COPD symptomatology from the patient's perspective. In addition, a further mapping of the impact that COPD symptoms' perception has on a patient's life is required, as well as of the different pathways through which symptoms' perception is interpreted regarding the limitations of daily living activities, and the subsequent impact on disease management. The more the physician learns on the embodied experience of COPD, the better he/she may assist the patient in achieving optimal COPD management. Thus this cross-sectional observational study was designed aiming to obtain these data. Specifically, the study aims to evaluate the most frequently used words by the patients and the physicians to express the symptoms of COPD as well as the limitation of activities that it causes.</brief_summary>
