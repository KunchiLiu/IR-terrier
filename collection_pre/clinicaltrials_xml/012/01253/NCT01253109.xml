	<brief_summary>This study monitors the intraocular pressure (IOP) over 4 to 6 hours using the SENSIMED Triggerfish® device and Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT) in pigment dispersion syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma patients. The aim of the study is to detect SENSIMED Triggerfish® output signal peak after induced fluctuation by physical exercise or pupil dilation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of pigmentary dispersion syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma on both eyes IOP of ≥ 15 mmHg 1860 years. Patients able to jog continuously for at least 25 minutes Phakic eyes Patients who accept signing an informed consent approved by the Ethics Committee. Pigmentary glaucoma already treated with peripheral laser iridotomy (PLI), argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI), argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in any eye Patients treated with pilocarpine or other mydriatic agent within the last 4 weeks in any eye Antihypertensive treatment in the 4 weeks preceding the study and throughout the study. Following signature of informed consent, antihypertensive treatment will be washed out for 4 weeks prior to study procedures in enrolled patients Patients with pseudoexfoliative (PEX) syndrome or PEX glaucoma in any eye Patients not able to understand the nature of the research Patients under tutorship Corneal abnormality Subjects with contraindications for wearing contact lenses Full frame metal glasses during SENSIMED Triggerfish® monitoring History of other ocular surgery except uncomplicated strabismus surgery no later than 3 months prior to study procedures Ocular inflammation or infection History of cardiac or pulmonary disorder Pregnancy and lactation Simultaneous participation in other clinical research</criteria>
