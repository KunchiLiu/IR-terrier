	<brief_summary>The Genetics of Neural Tube Defects Study at the University of Miami: The University of Miami John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics is looking for families to participate in research to identify the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to Neural Tube Defects (NTD). Our research goal is to better understand the genetic and environmental causes of both open NTD, like spina bifida and anencephaly, and closed NTD, like lipomeningocele and tethered cord. This will eventually lead to more accurate genetic counseling and risk assessment, improved treatments, and better prevention methods. Any individual with a diagnosis of NTD and his/her selected family members can participate, if willing. Participation is free. Travel is not required. Participation involves reading and signing a consent form, providing a blood sample, a family and medical history interview, and granting the research staff permission to review the medical records of the individual(s) with NTD. We maintain the highest standards of confidentiality for all families. If interested, please contact Maria Ciliberti, the study coordinator, at 1-877-686-6444 (toll free) or directly at 305-243-4360, or by email Mciliberti@med.miami.edu .
