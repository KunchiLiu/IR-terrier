	<brief_summary>The investigators are recruiting children for a research study using a medication known as IGF-1 (mecasermin or INCRELEX) to see if it improves the health of children with Rett syndrome (RTT). To participate in the study your child must be female, between the ages of 2 to 12 and have a genetic diagnosis (MECP2 deletion or mutation) of Rett Syndrome. As you may know, there is no treatment for this illness. Currently, the standard management of Rett syndrome is supportive, which means attempting to prevent complications and treatment of symptoms. This study involves testing an investigational drug, which means that even though IGF-1 is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children, it has not been used before to treat Rett syndrome specifically. Information from this research will help determine whether the drug should be approved by the FDA in the future for the treatment of Rett Syndrome. There are five major goals to this study: 1. As one of the features of Rett Syndrome is unstable vital signs, the investigators are trying to determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing your child's pulse, blood pressure and breathing pattern. During PHASE 2, a device called BioRadio® will be used to monitor vital signs in a non-invasive way. This information will be recorded and stored on the accompanying laptop. Before starting PHASE 2, the investigators would like to "beta-test" the BioRadio® in PHASE 1. As such, the investigators may ask you to try using the BioRadio® with your child to test the fit and the performance of the equipment. Should you choose to enroll your child in PHASE 2, the investigators will then ask that your child wear the BioRadio® for two hours, on two consecutive days every four weeks. 2. The safety of IGF-1 in children with Rett syndrome. The study personnel will ask you to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. They will assist you in completing this by telephone interviews. Your child will undergo 2 lumbar punctures performed at the bedside in the clinical research facility. In addition, laboratory tests will be performed throughout the study to evaluate the safety of IGF-1. These will be blood tests similar to those provided in routine clinical care. Your child will undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical examinations including neurological and eye examination, tonsil evaluation, electrocardiograms (ECG), measurement of height, weight and head circumference. 3. IGF-1 may improve your child's behavior, communication and speech. In order to measure this, the investigators will evaluate your child once during each month of treatment with neurodevelopmental assessments and a neurological exam. All of the tests used during these evaluations are non-invasive. the investigators will also ask you what your impressions are about her behavior and day-to-day activities through a structured parental interview and various questionnaires. 4. We will examine your child's cortical function through use of electroencephalography (EEG) in conjunction with presentation of visual and auditory stimuli. EEG is a non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of your child's brain by applying a net of electrodes to her scalp. Through this we gain insight into how neural function correlates to the progression of behavioral abnormalities seen in individuals with RTT. By understanding how this electrical brain activity produces the abnormal behaviors seen in RTT, we will be better able to identify whether or not treatment with IGF-1 affects the way the brain communicates with the body. 5. Children with Rett Syndrome are often unable to regulate their body temperature and will sometimes experience "flushing" in their cheeks or have exceptionally cold hands or feet. The Qsensor® is a non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures your child's perspiration level and body temperature. We would like to use the Qsensor® to determine whether or not IGF-1 improves your child's ability to regulate her body temperature. As such, we ask that your child wear the Qsensor® during each study visit. This wrist-worn sensor has been demonstrated to be safe and comfortable but may cause a slight gray discoloration where the sensor contacts your child's skin. This discoloration will go away in less than a day. The Qsensor® is not waterproof, therefore may not be worn in the shower or while your child is washing her hands. If you believe the device is broken, please contact the study team immediately.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are two phases to the trial. Phase 1 is an intensive 6-week pharmacokinetic study which will require 3 inpatient stays and 4 half-day outpatient visits. During in-patient sessions, an IV line will be placed for frequent blood samples. A lumbar puncture will be performed by a physician at the beginning and again at the end of Phase 1. The primary goal of Phase 1 is to determine the safety of IGF-1 therapy for girls with RS. As such, the investigators will ask that you monitor your child's blood sugar levels using a glucometer. Your child's health is our utmost concern and she will be monitored continuously to ensure her safety. At the end of Phase 1, you will have the option of enrolling your daughter in an additional 20 weeks of treatment with IGF-1 during Phase 2 of the trial. The investigators must successfully complete Phase 1 before the investigators can move to the second phase of the trial with a larger number of patients. The second phase will be double-blinded; meaning neither the families nor the researchers will know which participants are receiving IGF-1. The cross-over design of the trial means each subject will receive 20 weeks of either placebo or IGF-1 and then, after the 6-week washout period, participants will receive another 20 weeks of the alternate treatment. All girls enrolled in Phase 2 will receive 20 weeks of treatment with IGF-1. Girls enrolled in Phase 2 will be seen monthly for safety monitoring, developmental evaluations and lab work. The investigators will ask caregivers to fill out a number of questionnaires and answer questions regarding their daughter's health, behavior and quality of life. The investigators will also monitor your daughter's heart function (ECG) and the electrical activity in her brain (EEG) four times throughout Phase 2. The BioRadio® is a child-friendly measurement device, capable of recording heart and breathing patterns. The investigators ask that your child wear the BioRadio® and Qsensor® for 2 hours of quiet activity during each study visit, every 5 weeks. Data from the BioRadio® will demonstrate if treatment with IGF-1 improves the heart rhythm and respiratory symptoms of girls with RS. Data from the Qsensor® may indicate if your child's perspiration level and body temperature show signs of normalizing.</detailed_description>
