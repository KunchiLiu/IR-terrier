	<brief_summary>UCSD researchers are conducting a study aimed to develop and evaluate a chronic disease self management web and text message based program on health-related self-efficacy and frequency of adolescent-conducted healthcare interactions. We hypothesize that users of the program will demonstrate greater gains between baseline and 8 month measures of health related self-efficacy and adolescent-conducted healthcare interactions as compared to the usual care comparison group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MD2Me - Texting to Promote Chronic Disease Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MD2Me study (or also known as TAHLC), sponsored by the National Institutes of Health is a 2-year randomized controlled trial to develop and test a text message and Internet based intervention among adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, or inflammatory bowel disease. Adolescents and young adults have been a difficult population to engage in healthcare. It is estimated that 1 in 5 adolescents do not get the healthcare they need. Interventions must address how the healthcare system can engage adolescents with chronic disease and provide opportunities to discuss health-related matters and improve disease outcomes. This study will help fill multiple gaps in the literature by exploring the utility of a push AND pull SMS texting-based application for chronic disease management among youth. Based on social cognitive theory, the intervention will use accessible technology to promote disease management among adolescents with chronic disease as they transition to adult care. The popularity and usage of SMS already demonstrated by adolescents suggests notable promise for the SMS-based TAHLC program to promote chronic disease self-management and healthcare engagement with substantial positive impacts on health among youth with chronic disease.</detailed_description>
