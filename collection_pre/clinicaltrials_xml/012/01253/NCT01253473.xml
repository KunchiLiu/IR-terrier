	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to see if using anti-inflammatory to patients with airway disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotype will be more effective than using these treatments in patients with loss of lung tissue. Symbicort plus ipratropium/albuterol will be used for 12 weeks in an open-label study in subjects with airway predominant COPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Symbicort in Airway Predominant Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects from the COPDGene study who have airway-predominant COPD on chest CT scan will be enrolled; a total of 40 subjects is planned. Subjects will all have background ipratropium-albuterol administered four times daily. Subjects will be randomized to receive budesonide (180 ug twice daily) or formoterol-budesonide (160/4.5 ug twice daily) for 12 weeks. The main objective is to explore novel outcomes: blood biomarkers and chest CT scan. Outcomes include lung function, walk distance, respiratory disease-specific health status, and expiratory chest CT scan gas trapping as an exploratory outcome. The primary outcome measure will be FEV1 pre-bronchodilator 12 hours after the last dose of study medication at the end of 12 weeks of treatment. FEV1 will be measured in the morning 6 hours after the last dose of ipratropium/albuterol and 12 hours after the last dose of budesonide and budesonide/formoterol</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. COPD GOLD Stage 2 and 3 (postbronchodilator FEV1 3580% predicted and FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 at the time of enrollment in COPDGene) by spirometry. 2. Less than 15% of the lung &lt;950 Hounsfield Units on COPDGene highresolution inspiratoryChest CT scan (i.e. no evidence of significant emphysema) 3. Greater than 10% gas trapping on COPDGene expiratory CT scan (i.e. evidence of small airway disease). 4. No history of recent use (within the pat 8 weeks) of an inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. 5. Body weight &lt;100 kg (low dose CT scans in subject with increased boyd weight can not be reliably analyzed). 1. Exacerbation of COPD or other respiratory illness requiring antibiotics within the past 8 weeks. 2. Previous adverse reaction to inhaled steroids, longacting beta agonists, or longacting anticholinergic medications. 3. Symptomatic, untreated benign prostate hypertrophy. 4. Allergy to peanuts. 5.
