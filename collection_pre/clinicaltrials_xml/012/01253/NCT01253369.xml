	<brief_summary>Pazopanib is a drug that inhibits proteins thought to be important for new blood vessel formation. This drug has been used in other cancer research studies and information from those studies suggests that pazopanib may help block proteins that are important for the growth, invasion, and spread of cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the progression-free survival rate in participants with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer who have received one prior regimen of systemic chemotherapy at 8 weeks Secondary - To determine the response rate (as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria and changes in blood flow/perfusion as measured by perfusion CT) - To determine median and overall survival - To characterize the toxicity profile of pazopanib in this patient population. Exploratory - To analyze levels of circulating biomarkers from blood and urine samples obtained serially throughout the study and assess the utility of individual or subsets of these proteins to serve as a surrogate marker for treatment effect, treatment efficacy, and for tumor progression - To measure and investigate the use of monocytes as surrogate markers of angiogenesis inhibition - To analyze the subject population by identification of intra-tumoral biomarkers (such as c-kit, VEGF receptors, and microvessel density measured in available tumor biopsies) associated with the efficacy, safety and resistance to pazopanib - To assess the utility of perfusion CT scan in evaluating changes in anti-angiogenic activity as a measure of treatment efficacy STATISTICAL DESIGN: This study uses a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of cetuximab based on progression-free rate (PFR) at week 8 defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. The null and alternative PFR are 30% and 50%. If fewer than 4 patients enrolled in the stage one cohort (n=15 patients) achieve SD or better than accrual would not proceed to stage two (n=15 patients). If 13 or more patients are progression-free of the 30 patients then the null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that the treatment will be considered promising if the true PFR rate was 30% is 8.4% and 82% if the true PFR rate was 50%.</detailed_description>
