	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a 25% glucose solution given via a soother with or without facilitated tucking with a similarly administered water placebo (control condition) on infant stress responses during and immediately after a neonatologist performed ECHO (np-ECHO).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sweetheart Study: Oral Glucose for Reducing Stress During Echocardiographic Assessment in Infants in the NICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and four infants were randomized to one of four groups during a single np-ECHO examination, at the discretion of the medical team. Randomization to soother and water (Control) with and without facilitated tucking or to soother and 25% glucose (Intervention) with or without facilitated tucking will be determined by generating randomly permuted sequential blocks of four and six allocation numbers.</detailed_description>
