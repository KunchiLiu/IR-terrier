	<brief_summary>UC San Diego researchers conducted a study to develop and evaluate an internet and text message based weight loss study for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. We hypothesized that those study participants randomized to the intervention will demonstrate greater reduction in BMI-z score as compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PACE CALL: Weight Loss Study for Childhood Leukemia Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PACE CALL or Fit4Life study, sponsored by the American Cancer Society , was a 4-year research project aimed at developing and testing the efficacy of a web &amp; cell phone based weight loss program. The purpose of the intervention was to promote weight loss and management and improve physical activity, diet and sedentary behaviors among preadolescent and adolescent youth (7-18) who are survivors of childhood ALL (defined as being off therapy for at least 2 years without disease relapse). Fit4Life was based on and adapted from notable prior successful adolescent weight control interventions, and physical activity and diet behavioral promotion interventions in the preadolescent and adolescent age group. Particular sensitivity to issues experienced by cancer survivors and their families were incorporated into this newly developed intervention based on systematic cancer survivor input and feedback as well as mentor/collaborator input regarding cancer survivor research.</detailed_description>
