	<criteria>Provide written informed consent, which will consist of reading, signing, and dating the informed consent document after the Investigator, subInvestigator or other designated study staff member has explained the study procedures, risks, and contact information. Are male or female, ≥ 18 years of age, of any race. Are willing to attend all required study visits, and to comply with study procedures. Meet none of the exclusion criteria (any single exclusion criterion which is met by a potential subject will disqualify that subject from participation in this study. Have a history of dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus, Ehler Danlos disease, icthyosis vulgaris, vasculitis, or bleeding disorders (coagulopathies). Have any dermatologic disease which may be aggravated or provoked by the wounding procedure, such as Lichen Planus, Psoriasis, or Vitiligo. Have Fitzpatrick scale skin type 6 (never sunburns, deeply pigmented). Are at risk of keloid or hypertrophic scar formation, based on personal history, family history, or brief skin exam (conducted at the screening visit to look for keloids or hypertrophic scars). Have been treated within the last three months for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin C deficiency, connective tissue disorders, or any other disease process that impedes wound healing. Are taking concomitant medications at doses which are known to interfere with healing, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antineoplastic drugs, or immunosuppressive drugs. Are using topical glycolic acid products, alphahydroxy acid products, retinoids, or chemical peel agents in the treatment areas. Are using systemic steroids or immunosuppressant agents, or have used these drugs within the past three months. The Principal Investigator may declare any subject ineligible for a valid medical reason.</criteria>
