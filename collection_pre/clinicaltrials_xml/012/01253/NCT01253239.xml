	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual performance of two cohorts of patients who received multifocal intraocular lenses following cataract and clear lens extraction surgeries. Comparing visual outcomes of patients who were implanted with TECNIS Multifocal IOLs in both eyes versus patients implanted with TECNIS Multifocal in one eye and ReZoom Multifocal IOL in the opposite eye.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation the TECNIS IOL in Both Eyes VS the ReZoom IOL in One and TECNIS IOL in the Opposite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stable post operative cataract and clear lens extraction patients who have been implanted with either the TECNIS Multifocal IOL in both eyes or TECNIS Multifocal IOL in one eye and theReZoom Multifocal IOL in the opposite eye. Study Design-A retrospective chart review to collect visual outcomes to determine lens performance. Patient satisfaction questionnaire will be administered to determine spectacle independence.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who have undergone surgery and received either the TECNIS Multifocal Intraocular lens in one eye and the ReZoom Multifocal Intraocular lens in the other will be evaluated. Males and Females with ages ranging from 42 years to 86 years old. Patients who have subsequently developed any visual limiting problems (e.g. corneal, retinal, infection) which could potentially limit their post operative visual potential.</criteria>
