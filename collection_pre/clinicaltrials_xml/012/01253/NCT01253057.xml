	<brief_summary>Several epidemiological studies found that exposure to antineoplastic agents were associated with some reproductive, carcinogenic effects, higher rates of advance micronuclei (MN), sister-chromatic-exchange (SCE) and spontaneous abortion. Cleaning staff were potentially exposed to these agents while cleaning ward, ward toilet or other area. One medical center and one area hospitals in Taipei.Surface wipe samples were collected in the cleaning staff work area, such as ward environment and ward toilet. Urine and blood samples of subjects were collected for exposure examinations. Platinum-containing drugs (Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Oxaliplatin) were used as indicator drugs in environmental (surface wipe samples) and biological (urine and blood samples) samples. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, working practices, medical and contact history, and perceived work-related symptoms of cleaning staff. The results of this study will be to reduce exposure to cleaning staff.</brief_summary>
