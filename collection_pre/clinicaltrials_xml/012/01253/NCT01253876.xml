	<brief_summary>Soymilk components such as isoflavones, essential fatty acids, phytoesterols, good fats, inositols might have beneficial effects on weight control and blood pressure management. Most studies in this regard have been conducted on postmenopausal or premenopausal women and there are few studies on female youths. Therefore, we are going to determine the effects of soy consumption on the weight, waist circumference and blood pressure in overweight and obese female youths. This was a cross-over randomized clinical trial which was conducted in 2010 in Isfahan on overweight or obese young female youths. After three weeks run-in, females were randomly assigned to consume a diet containing caw's milk or a diet in which only one glass of soy milk was substituted; each one for six weeks. Random sequencing generated in SPSS was used for allocating females in different group randomly. Patients were not blinded because they had to use soy milk in one period of trial and use caw's milk in another period.</brief_summary>
