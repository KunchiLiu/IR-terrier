	<brief_title>Expressive Writing for Heart Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Expressive writing, for as little as 3-5 sessions of 20 minutes, has been found to improve both physical and psychological health based on health outcome measures such as number of doctor's visits and hospital days, blood pressure control, lung and immune function, pain, anxiety and depression. Given its simplicity and obvious advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, expressive writing has great potential as a therapeutic tool or as a means of self-help, either alone or as an adjunct to traditional therapies. This modality has not been studied in obese patients with Ischemic Heart Disease.</detailed_description>
