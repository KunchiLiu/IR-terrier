	<brief_title>Pulse Oximeter Responses to Multiple Levels of Stable Hypoxia in Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have developed methods that permit them to test multiple pulse oximeter sensors on neonates simultaneously during cardiac surgery. During this type of surgery, the arterial oxygen saturation changes over a wide range, providing an ideal arena for the assessment of neonatal pulse oximeter sensors at many levels of oxygen saturation. Several arterial blood gas samples are typically obtained during these procedures. Saturation of each arterial blood sample is determined by direct oximetry in a hemoximeter and this measurement is compared to the reading displayed on the pulse oximeter.</detailed_description>
