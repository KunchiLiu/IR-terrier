	<brief_summary>The incidence of invasive candida infection (ICI) in critically ill patients is increasing day by day. The crude mortality of IFI in ICU could be as high as 25%-75% depending on their age, underlying conditions, and so on. Candida albicans was by far the predominant species in most countries, causing up to two thirds of all cases of invasive candidiasis. However, a shift toward non-albicans Candida species has been observed. Although the studies of ICI cause universal attention recently, there is still no large-scale, multi-center epidemiological research in China focusing on ICI in critically ill patients, therefore we conducted a large-scale multi-center observational study of IFI in critically ill patients named "China Scan" (CHINA Survey of Candidiasis in ICU) to assess the current incidence, mortality, pathogen spectrum, management, and risk factors for ICI in China ICUs.</brief_summary>

Candida albicans was by far the predominant species in most countries, causing up to two thirds of all cases of invasive candidiasis.

Objective of the study: Determine the current incidence of IFI in ICUs in China. Describe the risk factors for IFI in China ICUs. Explore the pathogen spectrum of IFI in ICUs in China. Describe the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of Candida isolates. Describe the antifungal treatment for ICU patients with IFI. Evaluate in-hospital mortality among patients with IFI in ICUs.</detailed_description>
