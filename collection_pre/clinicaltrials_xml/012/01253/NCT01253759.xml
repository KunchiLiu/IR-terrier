	<brief_title>Long Term Results of Combined Transpupillary Thermotherapy (TTT) Indocyanine Green (ICG) Based Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) in Choroidal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was done in a Clinical practice setting. Forty six eyes of 46 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas were treated with i-TTT using infrared light delivered from a diode laser. All patients were evaluated to rule out systemic metastasis and underwent a complete ophthalmological evaluation including: Slit lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examination, Fluorescein angiography, Optical coherence tomography and A/B ultrasonography. Main outcome measures were: Changes in visual acuity, complications associated with the treatment and local control of the tumor.</detailed_description>
