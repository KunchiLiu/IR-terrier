For immunocompromised subjects with suspected West Nile virus infection: Receiving immunosuppressive treatment for any disease, such as autoimmune diseases, or transplant recipients; or Have received organs or tissues or cells from donors likely infected with West Nile virus (as shown by serology or PCR/NAT from the donor, organs, or tissues) or Have acquired immunodeficiency (other than from immunosuppressive treatment or from receiving infected transplants) or congenital immunodeficiency 3. For subjects with substantial exposure to West Nile virus: Exposure by any route, including percutaneous, inhalation, or mucosal exposure (such as might occur in a laboratory accident) 4. Develop signs and/or symptoms within 14 days before study enrollment</criteria>
