	<brief_summary>Elevated blood pressure (BP) is an important public health concern. It is highly prevalent, the prevalence may be increasing, and it is a risk factor for several adverse health outcomes, especially coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and decline in cognitive function. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) is a 2-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a treatment program aimed at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a lower goal than currently recommended will reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPRINT will randomize about 9250 participants aged ≥ 50 years with SBP ≥130 mm Hg and at least one additional CVD risk factor. The trial will compare the effects of randomization to a treatment program of an intensive SBP goal with randomization to a treatment program of a standard goal. Target SBP goals are &lt;120 vs &lt;140 mm Hg, respectively, to create a minimum mean difference of 10 mm Hg between the two randomized groups. The primary hypothesis is that CVD event rates will be lower in the intensive arm. Participants will be recruited at approximately 90 clinics within 5 clinical center networks (CCNs) over approximately a 2-year period, and will be followed for 4-6 years.</detailed_description>
