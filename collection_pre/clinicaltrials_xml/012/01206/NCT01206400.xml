	<brief_title>Effect of Pioglitazone on Testosterone in Eugonadal Men With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several clinical studies demonstrated that pioglitazone not only improves insulin sensitivity but also decreases plasma androgen concentrations (DHEAS and androstenedione) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) . However the reduction in the androgen levels in PCOS is whether secondary to increase in the insulin sensitivity or due to direct effect of thiazolidinediones on steroidogenesis is not known.So far, two human studies have been conducted regarding the effects of rosiglitazone (a thiazolidinedione group of drug) on testosterone level, one in healthy individuals and another was in patients of type 2 diabetes with hypogonadism . But these studies gave equivocal results as the study population were different. Hence we plan to study the effects of pioglitazone on the steroidogenic enzyme axis in eugonadal men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</detailed_description>
