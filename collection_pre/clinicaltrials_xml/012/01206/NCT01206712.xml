	<brief_title>Beta Cell Relieving and Cardiovascular Protective Effects of LANTUS Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease characterised by a steady loss of beta cell function and an increase in the proinsulin/insulin ratio. During the recent years intact proinsulin has been the topic of interest in numerous preclinical and clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Intact proinsulin was confirmed as a marker of functional beta cell failure and as a predictor of increased beta cell loss due to apoptosis and/or diminished neogenesis. A number of population based studies showed that intact proinsulin is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease in diabetic, and in non-diabetic patients. In a clinical trial investigating human proinsulin as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of diabetes mellitus an eight fold increase in CVD was found during treatment with human proinsulin compared to human regular insulin, indicating a thrombo-embolic potential of intact proinsulin. In a recent investigation an association could be confirmed between increased proinsulin plasma concentrations and the severity of angiographical characterised CHD. Even the exact mechanism how proinsulin is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is not completely recognized, it was already shown that PAI-1 activity increases after proinsulin administration in vitro, and there is increasing evidence that the atherogenic effects of proinsulin might be linked to increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels with subsequent inhibition of fibrinolysis and an augmented thrombogenic potency. Treatment with sulfonylurea increases intact proinsulin secretion, and in a couple of studies, sulfonylurea treatment was found to be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. In contrast, several studies have shown that after the introduction of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients intact proinsulin levels and plasma PAI 1 levels decline, indicating not only beta cell protection, but also antiatherogenic properties of insulin. In a recent study, we have shown that treatment with basal insulin in combination with metformin effectively reduces intact proinsulin levels, and that insulin glargine is superior to NPH insulin in controlling postprandial release of intact proinsulin over an entire day. Recently a new therapeutic concept using DPP IV inhibitors in combination with metformin has been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. There is some evidence that, in the beta cell, DPP IV Inhibitors might improve the conversion of intact Proinsulin into Insulin and C-peptide and thereby reduce circulating intact proinsulin levels. Since the number of type 2 diabetic patients treated with DPP-IV inhibitors is steadily increasing, there is a need to generate more data on the postprandial release of intact proinsulin in patients treated with DPP-IV inhibitors compared to Insulin or sulfonylurea treatment. The rationale of the study is to investigate the effect of glargine and metformin treatment compared to sulfonylurea and metformin treatment and compared to DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin treatment on postprandial intact proinsulin release and postprandial PAI-1 levels. Accompanying a comparison of postprandial intact proinsulin release and the time course of postprandial PAI-levels in between all three antidiabetic treatment groups and a non-diabetic control group will be performed as well.</detailed_description>
