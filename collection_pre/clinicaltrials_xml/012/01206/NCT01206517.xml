	<brief_summary>This study is an open label, sequential-group, two site, multiple dose escalating study of sublingual administered asenapine in a pediatric population with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder; in one study cohort (3a) participants with other conditions treatable with chronic antipsychotic medication can also be enrolled. Participants will receive a single sublingual placebo dose on Day -1, followed by multiple sublingual doses of asenapine twice daily (b.i.d.) for 6 days (Cohorts 1 and 2), 7 days (Cohort 3b-d), or 11 days (Cohort 3a), and a final once daily administration on Day 7 (Cohorts 1 and 2), Day 8 (Cohort 3b-d) or Day 12 (Cohort 3a).</brief_summary>

An acceptable method of contraception includes one of the following: stable oral, transdermal, injectable, or sustainedrelease vaginal hormonal contraceptive regimen without breakthrough uterine bleeding for 3 months prior to Screening; in addition, during study use of condom and/or spermicide (when marketed in the country) intrauterine device (inserted at least 2 months prior to Screening visit); in addition, during study use of condom and/or spermicide (when marketed in the country) Note: Vasectomy of the partner is not considered sufficient contraception and one of the 2 methods listed above must be used Females who are not currently sexually active must also consent to use one of these accepted methods of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the study condom (male or female) with spermicide (when marketed within the country), diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide (when marketed within the country) and condom (male), Exclusion Criteria The participant will be excluded from entry if ANY of the criteria listed below are met at baseline The participant: Is pregnant, intends to become pregnant (within 3 months of ending the study), or is breastfeeding In the opinion of the investigator, will not be able to participate optimally in the study Has an uncontrolled, unstable clinically significant medical condition (e.g., renal, endocrine, hepatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, hematologic, immunologic, gastrointestinal or cerebrovascular disease, or malignancy) that may interfere with the interpretation of pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability evaluations in the opinion of the investigator Has a history of any infectious disease within 4 weeks prior to drug administration that in the opinion of the investigator, affects the subject's ability to participate in the trial Is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Has a positive screen for drugs with a high potential for abuse (during the Screening period or clinical conduct of the trial) Has a history of psychiatric or personality disorders that in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, affects the subject's ability to participate in the trial Has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome Has a diagnosis of mental retardation or organic brain disorder Has a primary diagnosis other than schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, current episode manic or mixed, that is primarily responsible for current symptoms and functional impairment; this exclusion is not applicable to participants in Cohort 3a Has a diagnosis of psychotic disorder or a behavioral disturbance thought to be substance induced or due to substance abuse Has a current (past 6 months) substance and alcohol abuse or dependence (excluding nicotine and caffeine) Has a history of tardive dyskinesia or tardive dystonia If has attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has not been on a stable dose of stimulants (e.g. amphetamines, methylphenidate) for the last 3 months (participants who have not taken any stimulants in the last month will not be excluded) Has a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the past 2 years Has donated blood in the past 60 days Has previously received asenapine Is at imminent risk of selfharm or harm to others, in the investigator's opinion based on clinical judgment Report at Screening, suicidal ideation, or suicidal behavior in the past 6 months Is currently participating in another clinical study or have participated in a clinical study (e.g., laboratory or clinical evaluation) within 30 days of baseline Is part of the study staff personnel or family members of the study staff personnel Has demonstrated allergic reactions (eg, food, drug, atopic reactions or asthmatic episodes) which, in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, interfere with their ability to participate in the trial Smokes more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent tobacco use per day Has a history of malignancy</criteria>
