	<brief_title>Oral Steroids Before Pulmonary Vein Isolation to Improve Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is: 1. To assess the efficacy of oral prednisone in improving the outcomes of pulmonary vein isolation with radiofrequency ablation. 2. To measure the inflammatory cytokine (TNF-Î±, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) response to radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation with or without prior prednisone treatment.</detailed_description>
