The Target Lesion must have an area of at least 5 cm². Have a Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) at baseline for the overall disease severity. Patient has current diagnosis of other types of psoriasis other than stable plaque psoriasis (i.e. acute, guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis) or has psoriasis of any kind of the face or scalp that will require active treatment during the study.

Patient has a history of allergy or sensitivity to corticosteroids or history of any drug hypersensitivity or intolerance which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or the results of the study. Patient has been treated within 12 weeks (or five half lives, whichever is less) prior to the first dose of study drug with any biological therapies for psoriasis. Patient has received any systemic steroids within 4 weeks of the first dose of the study drug. The use of inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids is acceptable as long as usage has been stable for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and will be continued during the study. Patients who have used any topical antipsoriatic agents of any kind or any topical corticosteroids for any reason within 2 weeks prior to first use of study drug.
