	<brief_summary>1. Do paper-based and web-based intervention modelling experiments (the methodology we are developing) identify the same predictors of GP behaviour regarding prescribing of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections? 2. Can a web-based IME system provide trialists with richer and more predictive information upon which to base the development of behavioural change interventions than paper-based IME systems?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing and Evaluating Interventions to Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing of Antibiotics in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NHS needs effective quality improvement interventions to be put into clinical practice, which requires effective behaviour change interventions. Intervention modelling experiments (IMEs) are a way of exploring and refining an intervention before moving to a full-scale trial. They do this by delivering key elements of the intervention in a simulation that approximates clinical practice by, for example, presenting GPs with a clinical scenario about making a treatment decision. Earlier IMEs have been paper-based, which limits what can be done in the simulation. Web-based IMEs provide the potential for better clinical simulations, which have the potential to lead to better interventions. The current proposal will run a full, web-based IME involving 250 GPs that will advance the methodology of IMEs by directly comparing results with an earlier paper-based IME. Moreover, the web-based IME will evaluate an intervention that can be put into a full-scale trial that aims to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Reducing inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics in general practice is a national priority; indeed, antibiotic use is increasing in the UK and Scotland's prescribing is second highest amongst UK administrations. More effective behaviour change interventions are needed and this proposal will develop one such intervention and a system to model and test future interventions. This system will be applicable to any situation in the NHS where behaviour needs to be modified, including interventions aimed directly at the public.</detailed_description>
