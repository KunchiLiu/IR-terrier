	<detailed_description>In the beginning of the study, changes in the background information collected in the original study (conducted 2009-2010) are asked with a questionnaire. Information on influenza vaccinations is collected with vaccination cards and monthly short message service (SMS), and verified in registers, if needed. If an epidemic caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus starts in Finland, the participants are asked to actively report symptoms of influenza like illnesses (ILI). The symptoms are also monitored by weekly SMS. In case of ILI, nasal and oral swabs are collected to verify the 2009 H1N1 influenza cases. Paired serum samples are collected at the acute on convalescence phase of the disease. The occurrence of laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza cases is compared between vaccinated and not (yet) vaccinated persons.</detailed_description>
