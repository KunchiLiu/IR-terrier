	<brief_summary>A single centre open randomised parallel-group study to evaluate whether prophylactic fenestration of the peritoneum at the time of renal transplantation prevents lymphocele formation. Adult (&gt;18 years old) recipients of renal transplants from deceased donors were eligible for inclusion. From March 2007 to May 2009 130 patients were included. The patients were randomized either to peroperative peritoneal fenestration, or to serve as controls. Block-randomization was conducted in groups of 10, drawn from envelopes containing five notes from each group. Patients who previously had undergone extensive abdominal surgery, or were included in other studies were excluded.</brief_summary>
