	<brief_summary>Secondary brain ischaemia (SBI) usually develops after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The current management strategies are based on intracranial pressure-targeted therapy (ICP-targeted) with cerebral microdialysis monitoring (modified Lund concept) or cerebral perfusion pressure-targeted therapy (CPP-targeted). We present a randomised controlled study to compare the two management strategies. The hypotheses of the study were: - SBI developed after aneurysmal SAH and severe TBI share the same crucial characteristics and any treatment applied will essentially treat the same underlying pathophysiology. - ICP-targeted therapy with cerebral microdialysis monitoring according to the modified Lund concept is superior to CPP-targeted therapy in managing comatose patients with SBI after aneurysmal SAH and severe TBI. Sixty comatose operated patients with SBI following aneurysmal SAH and severe TBI were randomized into ICP-targeted therapy with cerebral microdialysis monitoring and CPP-targeted therapy groups. Mortality rates in both groups were calculated and biochemical signs of cerebral ischaemia were analysed using cerebral microdialysis. Outcome for cerebral microdialysis was measured as poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1, 2 and 3) or good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 and 5).</brief_summary>
