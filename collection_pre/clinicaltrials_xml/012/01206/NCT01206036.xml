	<brief_summary>In this Phase I study safety of the combination of Docetaxel and Temsirolimus needs to be shown before the study can be expanded into a Phase II study to examine the activity of a safe combination of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel in a comparison with Docetaxel alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CESAR Study in Prostate Cancer With Temsirolimus Added to Standard Docetaxel Therapy (CEPTAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate feasibility of dose levels DL1, DL2 and DL3 (which are combinations of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel) and defining a recommended dose (RD) for the Phase II part using these dose levels in a dose escalating scheme. Secondary objectives are the collection of safety data on the dose levels used in this part.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Phase I Part: Adult males ≥18 years of age. Patients with CRPC defined as confirmed rise of PSA levels after orchiectomy or LHRH agonist based therapy. Progressive disease, defined as PSA progression by confirmed rising PSA levels. PSA at time of study entry ≥2ng/ml within 1 week prior to treatment (according to Scher 2008). Bone metastasis and/or lymph node and/or visceral organ metastases allowed. Measurable and non measurable disease allowed. Performance status (PS) 01 ECOG. Signed written informed consent.

AST and ALT &lt;=2.5 x upper limit of normal, or &lt;=5 x upper limit of normal in case of liver metastases. Serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 x upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min. Androgen ablation will have to be continued. Antiandrogens such as bicalutamide will have to be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment. Exclusion Criteria Phase I Part: Clinically symptomatic brain or meningeal metastasis. Receiving known strong CYP3A4 isoenzyme inhibitors and/or inducers.

Nonhealing wound or ulcer. Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage within the past month. Any condition / concomitant disease not allowing chemotherapy with docetaxel, prednisone and temsirolimus in the discretion of the treating physician, like: Renal insufficiency requiring dialyses; congestive heart failure or uncontrolled angina pectoris; prior myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of chemotherapy; uncontrolled severe hypertension (failure of diastolic blood pressure to fall below 90 mm Hg despite the use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive drugs) or arrhythmias; instable diabetes mellitus, ulceration from diabetes mellitus or other conditions not allowing high dose corticosteroids; effusions in pericardium, pleura or abdomen symptomatic and in need of being punctured. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components in the temsirolimus infusion or other medical reasons for not being able to receive adequate premedication (antihistamine agents). Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity Medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the patient to complete the study or sign informed consent.
