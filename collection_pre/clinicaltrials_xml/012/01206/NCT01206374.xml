	<brief_summary>Vitiligo vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that causes loss of pigmentation over the skin, hair and mucous membranes (e.g. lips, nose, genitals). While genes have been identified that are thought to be required for development of vitiligo, only 5-10% of relatives develop disease. The triggers for disease onset have not yet been identified. The intent of this study is to research trends in laboratory data, social and medical history that may be contributory to vitiligo onset, location of disease, course of illness and response to therapy.</brief_summary>
