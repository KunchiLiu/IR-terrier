	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effects of aerobic interval training and the IDF recommendations on physical activity on cardiac function and CV risk factors in patients with diabetes. The hypothesis is that AIT more than MCT, will improve myocardial dysfunction in patients with subclinical LV disease, improve both endothelial function and VO2max and thus reducing CV risk factors and CV disease. HbA1c will be more stable. The aims of this study are to address the exercise prescription recommendations for patients with (T2DM) who have subclinical heart disease. The prescription recommendations will be assessed by randomising T2DM patients with subclinical heart disease to one of the following 2 groups for 3 months followed by a 9 month home-based program: Moderate Intensity Exercise Group (ME). Home exercise equivalent to the present exercise recommendations of the International Diabetes Federation. Aerobic interval training (AIT). Exercise equivalent to the current guidelines achieved through high-intensity interval training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators primary hypotheses are that in patients with type 2 diabetes and subclinical heart disease: Moderate Intensity Exercise will: Not significantly improve myocardial function compared to controls, Despite significant improvement (compared to controls) in: Glycaemic control (HbA1c) Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) Body composition (DXA) Aerobic Interval Training Group will: Significantly improve myocardial function compared to controls, Significantly improve (compared to moderate intensity exercise group): Glycaemic control (HbA1c) Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) Body composition (DXA)</detailed_description>
