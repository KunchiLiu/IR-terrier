	<brief_summary>For the patient with acute dyspnea in the ED, early differentiation between CHF and non-CHF causes is essential for proper management. The capacity to triage patients quickly and accurately has a beneficial impact upon outcome, disposition, stratification and length of stay in the ED and required length of hospital admission. The ability to assess pulmonary status rapidly by quantitative regional vibration technology offers significant potential advantage for earlier diagnosis. The VRI technique may provide a quick and accurate method of differentiating between dyspnea due to HF and dyspnea due to pulmonary causes; thereby improving management and outcomes.</brief_summary>
