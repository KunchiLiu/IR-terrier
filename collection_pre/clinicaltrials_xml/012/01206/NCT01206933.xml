	<brief_summary>Investigators in the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of The George Washington University Medical Center are carrying out a research study to determine why patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection (HIV/HCV) have a more rapid and progressive course of HCV infection, leading to fatty infiltration of the liver and cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of HIV Tat Protein on HCV Replication in an In-vitro Model System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Samples will be collected from 4 groups of patients with HIV/HCV infection, identified by the virologic control of either HIV, HCV, or both. Sera will be used in an in-vitro hepatocyte model of hepatitis C infection to better understand the pathogenesis of HIV/HCV co-infection, and to gain insight into intracellular mechanisms.</detailed_description>
