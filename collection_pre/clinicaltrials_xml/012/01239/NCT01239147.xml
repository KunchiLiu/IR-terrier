	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies suggest that whole grain consumption affects measures of obesity including BMI, body fat tissue, and body weight. Most cross-sectional studies demonstrate rather consistently an inverse association between BMI and whole grain consumption. Furthermore, prospective cohort studies suggest that people with high whole grain consumption have less risk for body weight gain compared with low whole grain consumption. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of inclusion of whole grain in the diet on anthropometric measures, particularly abdominal fat regain after a weight loss diet. It is anticipated that the short-term regain of abdominal fat after a weight loss diet is lower in volunteers consuming whole grain than in volunteers consuming refined grain.</brief_summary>
