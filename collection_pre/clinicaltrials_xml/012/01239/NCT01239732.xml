	<brief_summary>This open-label, non-comparative, multi-center study will assess the safety profile and efficacy of Avastin (bevacizumab) when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy in participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Participants will receive 15 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) Avastin intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of every cycle for up to 36 cycles of 3 weeks each, carboplatin (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] 5-6 mg/ml/min) on Day 1 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 cycles and paclitaxel 175 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) on Day 1 every 3 weeks or 80 mg/m^2 every week for a maximum of 8 cycles. The anticipated time on study drug will be 108 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
