	<brief_summary>Breast reconstruction with a pedicled myocutaneous latissimus dorsi (LD) flap is a widely used reconstruction method. It is controversial if surgical denervation by transecting the thoracodorsal nerve should be performed or not. It is assumed that after denervation the latissimus dorsi muscle will significantly atrophy and lose volume. On the other hand discomforting signs and symptoms from muscle contraction are believed to be prevented if flap is denervated. The aim of the study was prospectively evaluate the influence of LD-flap innervation on the functional and aesthetic outcome of delayed breast reconstruction, and to compare the change in muscle structure in breast MRI and histopathology.</brief_summary>
