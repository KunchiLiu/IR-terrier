	<brief_summary>Mediastinal irradiation for treatment of malignancy increases the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), while diabetes mellitus or other known risk factors can be absent at the time of the first coronary event. Radiation-induced atherosclerosis affects the coronary ostia and proximal coronary segments, or causes diffuse microvascular damage. Younger patients and those exposed to high radiation doses (&gt; 35 Gy) have a higher risk for developing premature CAD and likely may benefit from coronary assessment. A novel hybrid imaging technique that combines SPECT and CTCA has been shown to overcome the individual pitfalls and the diagnostic challenges of stand-alone SPECT and CCTA, improve the lesion detectability and sensitivity in patients with balanced diffuse lesions as well as the specificity and mainly PPV of CTCA. The aim of the study is to perform hybrid SPECT/CTCA in asymptomatic patients with HL who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum in order to allow an early diagnosis of hemodynamically significant CAD that will need further therapeutic interventions.</brief_summary>
