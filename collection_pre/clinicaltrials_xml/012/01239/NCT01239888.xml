	<brief_title>Oxytocin and Tibolone Adjuncts in Treatment Resistant Depression - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are examining the efficacy and safety of oxytocin or oxytocin and tibolone with an antidepressant (SSRIs) in treatment resistant depression in a double-blind randomized clinical trial. A secondary objective is the evaluation of neurobiological factors contributing to drug efficacy in treatment resistant depression.</detailed_description>
