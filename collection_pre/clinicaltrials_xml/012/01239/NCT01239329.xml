	<brief_summary>Underweight is more prevalent in people with a mental handicap than in people without a mental handicap, especially in people with a severe mental handicap. It is unknown if these people are malnourished. There is no validated screening instrument available to determine the nutrition status in people with complex multiple disabilities. Research regarding malnutrition based on body composition and nutrients in stead of anthropometric data is important. The aim of the study is to understand the nutritional status of people with complex multiple disabilitiest through measurement of body composition and nutritients. The primary objective of the study is: What percentage of people with complex multiple disabilities are malnourished, based on altered body composition and nutritients? Understanding the nutritional status of these patients is important in order for them to receive appropriate and effective treatment. This treatment is of interest for general health and the quality of daily life.</brief_summary>
