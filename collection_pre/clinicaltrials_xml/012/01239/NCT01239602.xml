	<brief_summary>Stem cell theray in old stroke patients is a study to treat stroke patients approved before in our hospital. We recruit these patients who received stem cell therapy and completed the study. We adopted movement-related cortical potential,and cortico-cortical inhibition to assess the stroke patients with or without stem cell therapy. Further analyzing the correlation of the motor related cortical potential and cortico-cortical inhibition among them. We wanted to find out if there are changes in cortical excitability in subjects with chronic stroke after stem cell therapy.</brief_summary>
