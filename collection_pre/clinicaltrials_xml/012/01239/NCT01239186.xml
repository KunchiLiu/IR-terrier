	<brief_summary>This study will analyse the sperm global methylation status of 62 infertile men before assisted reproductive techniques. Some of these patients (20%) present hypomethylation of H19 locus. A global methylation analysis may reveal others imprinting defects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification and Characterization of the Methylation Abnormalities on Whole Genome Among Infertile Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase of the abnormalities of the imprint was brought back at the child's stemming from assisted reproductive techniques. Now abnormalities of methylation could be implied in defects of spermatogenesis and certain abnormalities of development of the male germ cells could be due to modifications abnormal epigenetics. The objective of this research is to determine the frequency of arisen the abnormalities of methylation at the level of the locus H19 in the sperm cells of barren men presenting an unexplained oligozoospermia and to determine if these changes are a reflection of abnormalities of the profiles of methylation of the whole genome. The patients will realize a taking of sperm having signed the consent.</detailed_description>
