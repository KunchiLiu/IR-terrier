	<brief_title>High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation Virus Myomectomy to Treat Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are common in reproductive aged women. Patients are seeking new ways to treat symptomatic uterine fibroids that allow them to avoid surgery. High intensity focused ultrasound therapy (HIFU) is a novel non-invasive method for uterine fibroid. Preliminary clinical studies proved HIFU ablation is a safe and effective technology. However, it is not clear whether HIFU has superiority over traditional surgery on satisfaction and adverse impact.The study is to confirm these questions.</detailed_description>
