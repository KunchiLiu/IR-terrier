	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Methylphenidate HCl ER Capsules in Children and Adolescents With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a parallel, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, forced dose, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Biphentin methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release capsules in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in pediatric and adolescent patients aged 6 up to 18 years. The study will have four phases: (1) Screening and washout; (2) Double-blind fixed dose study involving test drug at 10, 15, 20 or 40 mg/day or placebo for 1 week; (3) Open-label phase that includes dose optimization with doses starting at 10 mg, and allowed up to 60 mg; and (4) 30-day safety follow-up. Eight (8) visits may be required. The open-label period following the one double-blind fixed dose week provides additional opportunity for subjects to receive treatment with Biphentin. Extra unscheduled dose optimization visits are allowed as needed for additional dose titration visits during the open-label period. Various safety and tolerability, and quality of life assessments will be conducted. Biphentin is designed to be a single daily dose alternative to separate doses of immediate release methylphenidate by providing a biphasic plasma profile. It achieves a first Cmax more similar to immediate release methylphenidate. It also comes in eight (8), that allow better individualized dosing.</detailed_description>
