	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to describe antibody persistence and response to re-vaccination with either Menactra® or Menomune® vaccine approximately three years following initial vaccination in adults who participated in trial MTA29 (NCT00874549). Objectives: - To describe the rates of immediate reactions, solicited injection-site and systemic reactions, all unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events following vaccination. - To evaluate persistence of serum bactericidal antibodies in subjects who received Menactra® or Menomune® vaccine approximately three years ago. - To evaluate the immune response to serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in subjects re-vaccinated with either Menactra® or Menomune® vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants who were randomized and received either Menactra® or Menomune® vaccine in trial MTA29 will receive 1 dose of either Menactra® or Menomune®, respectively on Day 0 and will be followed-up for 28 days post-vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 56 years or older on the day of inclusion. Received the appropriate Menactra or Menomune vaccine as assigned by randomization in Trial MTA29. Ambulatory and healthy, as determined by medical history. Informed consent form has been signed and dated. Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. For a woman of childbearing potential, use of an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to vaccination until at least 4 weeks after vaccination. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would pose a health risk to the participant or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine. Known pregnancy, or a positive pregnancy test. Currently breastfeeding a child. History of documented invasive meningococcal disease. Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination. Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period. Receipt of any meningococcal vaccine since participation in trial MTA29. Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination, except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least two weeks before trial vaccination. Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following the trial vaccination. Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months, which might interfere with assessment of the immune response. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months). Laboratoryconfirmed seropositivity for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. Previous personal history of GuillainBarré Syndrome (GBS). Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, latex, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances. Laboratoryconfirmed thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination. Bleeding disorder or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating IM vaccination. Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily. Current alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the ability to comply with trial procedures. Not available for the entire study period or unable to attend the scheduled visits or to comply with the study procedures. Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion. Identified as employees of the Investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study center, as well as family members (i.e., immediate, husband, wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the employees or the Investigator.</criteria>
