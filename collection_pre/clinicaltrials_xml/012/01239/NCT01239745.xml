	<brief_summary>This non-interventional study will be conducted in several Eastern European countries to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Aromasin® when it is administered in real-word setting in postmenopausal women with invasive estrogen receptor positive early breast cancer , who are disease-free after completion of 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen and continue the treatment with Aromasin® until completion of 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy, to understand how Aromasin® is used in routine clinical practice, to assess adherence to prescribed Aromasin® treatment and to understand reasons for its early discontinuation.</brief_summary>
