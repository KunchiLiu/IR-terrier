	<criteria>1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age. 2. NonHDLC ≥100 mg/dL and ≤220 mg/dL at Visits 1 and 2. 3. FPG ≥90 mg/dL and ≤145 mg/dL, at Visits 1 and 2. 4. HDLC &lt;60 mg/dL at Visits 1 and 2, regardless of gender. 5. Untreated dyslipidemia, or statin treatment only with equipotency to atorvastatin ≤40 mg daily for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening Visit 1 and without change or initiation prior to randomization 1. Known intolerance to niacin or bile acidsequestering drugs or aspirin. 2. Any contraindication to a study medication (niacin, aspirin or colesevelam). 3. History of dysphagia, swallowing disorders or intestinal motility disorders. 4. History of pancreatitis. 5. Fasting TG &gt;500 mg/dL at Visits 1 and 2 6. Currently taking medication for diabetes mellitus, Type 1 or 2,or currently taking glucoselowering drugs (e.g. metformin) for any other indication. 7. Currently taking drugs that may affect glycemic and/or lipid control (e.g., betablockers, etc.) if started within the 12 weeks prior to Visit 1, or prior to randomization. This does not apply to dietary supplements.). 8. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2. 9. History of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attacks, stroke or revascularization procedure within the 3 months prior to Visit 1 or prior to randomization. 10. Use of prescription strength niacin, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates or omega3 fatty acids within 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 or prior to randomization. This does not apply to dietary supplements. 11. Unwilling to abstain, during the study, from weightloss drugs (including overthecounter) or weightloss programs during the study. 12. Current use, or intended use during the study, of cyclic hormones (e.g., oral or vaginal contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy). 13. Females who are pregnant, planning to be pregnant during the study period, lactating, or women of childbearing potential not using an acceptable method of contraception. Acceptable methods include intrauterine device, cervical diaphragm plus spermicide, female condom plus spermicide, or partner's use of condoms plus spermicide. Partner's vasectomy only or use of condoms or spermicide only are not considered acceptable forms of birth control. 14. Current use, or intended use during the study of cyclosporine. 15. Recent history (past 12 months) of illicit drug use or excessive ethanol use. Excessive ethanol use will be defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz hard liquor). 16. Exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to Visit 1, and prior to randomization. 17. Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, or which might confound the interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk.</criteria>
