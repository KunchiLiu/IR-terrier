	<brief_summary>A higher degree of platelet inhibition remains the goal of peri-interventional and long-term anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. In clinical practice, patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation who are already on clopidogrel therapy get re-loaded with clopidogrel. This is based on prior observations showing that higher inhibition of platelet aggregation may be achieved by giving a loading dose of clopidogrel in patients with coronary artery disease while on chronic clopidogrel therapy. However, to date it is unknown if greater inhibition of platelet aggregation can be achieved by adding a prasugrel loading dose in patients on chronic prasugrel therapy. Therefore, understanding the pharmacodynamic implications of a prasugrel re-load strategy in patients on already on chronic prasugrel therapy will be useful.</brief_summary>
