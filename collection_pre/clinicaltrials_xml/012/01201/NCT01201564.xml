	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare two techniques for operative care of umbilical hernia in adults regarding wound complications, wound side fluid collections, recurrence rate, postoperative pain, duration of hospitalization and quality of life. The IPOM technique provides mesh positioning directly into the abdominal cavity onto the defect under laparoscopic control while in sublay position the mesh is placed directly behind the rectus muscle after small incision close to the belly button.</brief_summary>
