	<brief_title>Right Ventricular Function in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have reported the association between sleep disorders to an increased risk to the development of cardiac disease. However, there is no substantial that about the influence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on the right ventricular function. Objective: to analyse the right ventricular function in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea by means of Real-Time Three dimensional Echocardiography.</detailed_description>
