	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: Address 3 short term objectives; (1) Determine the effects of physiologic testosterone (T) therapy on neurological function and functional independence following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in hypogonadal men during inpatient rehabilitation; (2) Document the natural history of neuroendocrine dysfunction and recovery in men during inpatient rehabilitation after TBI; (3) Obtain data to validate the NIH toolbox, a novel assessment of neurological function for use in the TBI population; and two long-term objectives: (1) Utilize study findings to design a multicenter trial to further assess the impact of T therapy in hypogonadal men following TBI and (2) Impact TBI practice management with new information about neuroendocrine dysfunction after TBI and hormone treatments to improve outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will assess the hormonal status of men on admission to an inpatient TBI rehabilitation program. Eighty-eight Individuals with low Testosterone (T) levels will be randomized to receive either physiologic T therapy or placebo. Fifty-six Individuals with sufficient levels of T will be followed as a second control group. All three groups will undergo serial assessment of neurological function (as measured by the NIH Toolbox) and functional independence (FIM) to correlate with hormone levels. Hormone levels will be assessed through analysis of blood samples drawn from all participants at the time of study screening and at two week intervals for a total of 7 blood draws during the 12 week study period. Demographics, injury characteristics, concomitant medication usage and adverse events will be documented by medical record review. Statistical analysis will be performed to test study hypotheses. Findings will be disseminated at professional and consumer conferences and in peer-reviewed journals and consumer-based publications. Results will also be made available through the Craig Hospital website and via summary report to the Colorado TBI Trust Fund Research Program. If T therapy is found to be effective, findings will be used as preliminary data for a grant proposal for a multi-center trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. History of TBI as defined as "damage to brain tissue caused by an external mechanical force as evidenced by loss of consciousness or post traumatic amnesia (PTA) due to brain trauma or by objective neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical examination or mental status examination;"82 2. Moderate to severe TBI as indicated by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than or equal to 12 at emergency department admission, or post traumatic amnesia (PTA) of greater than or equal to seven days postinjury, or radiographic evidence of intracranial injury; 3. Continuously hospitalized from time of injury until admission for rehabilitation; 4. Enrolled in study within 6 months of TBI; 5. Receiving inpatient rehabilitation for TBI at Craig Hospital; 6. Males between the ages of 16 to 65 (inclusive); 7. Approval by attending physician; 8. Testosterone level below the assay normal range; 9. Consent to study participation 10. History of any conditions that would prohibit testing contained in the NIH toolbox; 11. NonEnglish or nonSpanish speaking (to the extent that would limit the ability to complete study measures); 12. History of prior psychiatric illness requiring hospitalization; 13. Prior testosterone therapy; 14. History of or current or suspected hormonally dependent cancer , including carcinoma of the breast or prostate cancer; 15. Known hypersensitivity to any T gel ingredients including alcohol and soy products; 16. Hematocrit (HCT) greater than 55% (normal range in Colorado is up to 52) or transaminase elevation &gt;4x upper limit of the normal range. 17.

History of untreated prolactinoma 21. History of severe heart failure or uncontrolled medical problem that would interfere with the participant's safety in the study as determined by the investigator.</criteria>
