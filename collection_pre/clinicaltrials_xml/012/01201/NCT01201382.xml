	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) to group counseling (GC) for the prevention of depression in adolescents. The project will: (1) identify adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms but who do not meet criteria for a current mood disorder diagnosis; (2) randomize eligible adolescents to either IPT-AST (N = 100) or GC (N = 100); (3) assess depressive symptoms, depressive disorders, global functioning, interpersonal functioning, comorbid conditions and school related indices at baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up; (4) examine the effects of IPT-AST on depression and various domains of functioning at each time point; and (5) conduct analyses to examine potential mediators and moderators of the association between IPT-AST and depression outcomes. This study will yield data on the efficacy of IPT-AST relative to GC for the prevention of depressive symptoms and depressive disorders. It will also provide information about the mechanisms of action of IPT-AST and determine for whom IPT-AST is most effective.</brief_summary>
