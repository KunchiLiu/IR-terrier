This protocol was the first administration of this core questionnaire with the purpose of assessing dental practice changes that may have occured since the earlier administration of the individual questions with the separate networks.It also collected baseline data for others.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CONDOR Impact of Dental Practice-Based Research Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three dental PBRNs had a unique opportunity to measure the impact of research participation on potential changes in practice base of the research protocol. We were able to examine the effect of participation in research in general to the acceptance of research findings from other studies and the effect of association with but not participation in a research network.</detailed_description>
