	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety and tolerability, long-term efficacy, and health outcome data in all patients currently ongoing in the fingolimod multiple sclerosis clinical development program. This study will combine all currently ongoing Phase II and III fingolimod extension studies as well as ongoing and newly planned studies into one single long-term extension protocol that will provide patients with continuous treatment and will continue until fingolimod is registered, commercially available, and reimbursed in the respective countries.</brief_summary>
