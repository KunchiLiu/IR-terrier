	<brief_summary>This multicenter study will assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first line treatment in participants with triple negative metastatic breast cancer. Participants will receive bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously (iv) every 3 weeks, plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 iv) and carboplatin (iv to an area under curve [AUC]=2) on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle.
