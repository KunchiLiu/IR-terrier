	<detailed_description>Patients will be recruited between Sep, 2010, and Dec, 2014. Baseline assessments before the start of treatment include neurological examination, grading of facial function, measurement of ipsilateral pain, documentation of concurrent medication. These patients are assigned to receive one of the following treatment groups, i.e. 1)the hormone group: oral hormone drugs, do not accept acupuncture treatment; 2)acupuncture group: using acupuncture therapy, do not accept oral hormone therapy; 3)hormone-acupuncture combined treatment group: receive oral hormone and acupuncture therapy at the same time; 4)other treatment group: other treatment in addition to the above 3 groups of treatment abroad. The secondary factor grouping (subgroup): According to the different time of treatment after the onset of disease, the acupuncture group and the hormone- acupuncture combined treatment group can be divided into Type Ⅰ subgroup (patients receive acupuncture within 10 days of the onset of disease) and Type II subgroups (patients receive acupuncture after 10 days of the onset of disease). The primary outcome is the time to complete recovery of facial function, assessed by Sunnybrook system and House-Brackmann scale. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of ipsilateral pain in the early stage of palsy (and the duration of this pain), the proportion of patients with severe pain, the occurrence of synkinesis, facial spasm or contracture, and the severity of residual facial symptoms during the study period.</detailed_description>
