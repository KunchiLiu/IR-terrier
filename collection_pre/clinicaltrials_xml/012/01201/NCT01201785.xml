	<brief_summary>Since diabetic platelets are characterized by an enhanced turnover rate, it may be hypothesized that an increase in the frequency, rather than the dose, of drug administration may be a more effective strategy to inhibit platelet reactivity in diabetic patients as this may enable COX-1 blockade of newly generated platelets. However, how different dosing regimens impact the pharmacodynamic effects of aspirin selectively in diabetes mellitus has been poorly explored. Therefore, the aim of the present pilot investigation was to evaluate how increasing the frequency of aspirin administration, remaining within the daily recommended therapeutic doses, affects antiplatelet responsiveness in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
