	<brief_summary>Development of stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) has a detrimental effect on stroke outcome. Biomarker-guided antibiotic treatment of patients at high risk for pneumonia may help to improve stroke outcome. Therefore, the investigators will evaluate whether intensified infection monitoring via Procalcitonin guiding an early standardized antibiotic treatment improves functional outcome after stroke compared with standard therapy based on current guidelines.</brief_summary>
