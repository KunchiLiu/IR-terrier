	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effects of low-intensity strengthening exercise on the brain (thinking and processing speed) for patients with early dementia, compared with normative older adults. Participants will engage in 3 months of exercise 3-5 times per week using a chair and small weights. It is hypothesized that there will be a significant improvement in brain function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Strengthening Exercise on the Brain for Early Dementia and Normative Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Objective(s): This study will evaluate the neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects of low-intensity strengthening exercise for patients with early dementia, compared with normative older adults. 2. Research Design: This is a quasi-experimental design in which change over time as a result of the exercise intervention will be compared with change over time seen in a normative sample. 3. Methodology: The aim is to enroll 12 participants with early dementia and 12 normative controls, all who are interested in starting a strengthening exercise program. Neuropsychological evaluation, resting electroencephalography (EEG), and event-related potentials (ERP) data collection will commence prior to the start of exercise. Participants will participate in an exercise class 2-3x/wk for three months. Repeat neuropsychological, EEG, and ERP evaluations will occur at the conclusion of three months of exercise. The exercises consist of low-intensity exercises, using a chair and small weights. A leader trained in the Tufts University exercise model will conduct the classes. 4. Findings: The investigators hypothesize a positive impact of exercise on neuropsychological function, especially performance on tasks requiring executive functions. This change will be compared with performance of normative controls who also exercise. Changes in brain function will be explored using EEG and ERP, and results are expected to be similar to prior research examining older adult exercisers which shows improvement in function.</detailed_description>
