	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the improvements in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for fostamatinib compared to placebo or adalimumab in patients who are Disease-Modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) na√Øve, DMARD intolerant or have had an inadequate response to DMARDs. The study will last for approximately six months</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sub-study: Full title: Optional Genetic Research Date: 10 September 2010 Version: 1 Objectives: To collect and store, with appropriate consent , DNA samples for future exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to fostamatinib disodium and/or adalimumab; and/or susceptibility to, progression of and prognosis of RA The main study recruitment is complete, and sub study recruitment will continue until the target is reached, estimated to be June 2013 Sub-study: Full title: (Sub-study to OSKIRA-4): A Phase IIB, Multi-Centre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Fostamatinib Disodium Monotherapy Compared with Placebo or Adalimumab Monotherapy in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sub-Study Date: 21 March 2011 Version: 1 Primary objective: Assess the efficacy of fostamatinib in reducing joint synovial disease activity as measured by: - Change from baseline to Week 6 (versus placebo) in OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis score.</detailed_description>
