	<criteria>Male or postmenopausal or surgically sterilized female subjects, 50 years of age or older; Documented diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association; Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months before screening; Subjects on stable diabetes treatment regimens (receiving oral hypoglycemics with or without insulin) for at least 2 months before screening; Screening and prerandomization glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;10.0%, according to central laboratory; Body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 38 kg/m2 Subjects willing to perform specified home blood glucose monitoring and comply with all study protocol requirements; Signed informed consent. Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL; Fasting triglycerides &gt;1000 mg/dL; Albuminuria &gt;200 mg/24 hours; Positive mammography (if female) or prostatespecific antigen (PSA) or prostate examination for cancer (if male); Use of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids in the 30 days before screening; Use of any experimental or marketed growth hormone, growth hormone secretagogues, insulinlike growth factor1 (IGF1), or insulinlike growth factor binding protein3 (IGFBP3) during the previous 6 months; Subjects with two or more severe hypoglycemia episodes within the past 6 months, or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor glycemic control within the past 6 months. Similarly, during the leadin period, any subject with more than one severe hypoglycemic episode or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor glycemic control will be excluded from randomization; History of or presence of active concomitant conditions or diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction, poorly controlled hypertension, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, seizure disorder, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy [except subjects with only microaneurysms on fundus examination]) that would interfere with the protocol conduct and endpoint measurements; Subjects with a major surgical operation during the 30 days before screening; Subjects with known hypopituitarism, history of pituitary tumor/surgery, head irradiation, or severe head trauma; Current cancer or history of cancer, except nonmelanomatous skin cancer; Subjects with active infection at any body site or a history of severe infection (requiring oral or parenteral treatment) during the 30 days before screening; Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory evaluation (unless discussed with and approved by the medical monitor); Subjects with allergy to synthetic growth hormone products or their excipients; Subjects who had previously received growth hormones in any clinical trial; Participation in a trial of an experimental drug or device within 90 days before screening.</criteria>
