	<brief_summary>This feasibility study specifically addresses the issue of adapting US dietary guidelines physical activity recommendations to the population of the Lower Mississippi Delta. The hypothesis is that including a pedometer as a self-monitoring tool as part of adapted physical activity guidelines will result in greater immediate increases in physical activity (as monitored by an accelerometer) than an education program alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steps Toward Adapting Physical Activity Guidelines for the Lower Mississippi Delta Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to determine if a short-term pedometer-based intervention results in immediate increases in time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) compared to a minimal educational intervention.A sample of 43 overweight adults 35 to 64 years of age participated in a one week pedometer-based feasibility trial monitored by accelerometry. Participants were randomized into a one-week education-only group or a group that also wore a pedometer. Accelerometer-measured MVPA was measured over 7 days at baseline and post-intervention.</detailed_description>
