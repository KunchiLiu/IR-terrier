Patient has ALT levels ≥ 1×ULN Patient who is able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to comply with the study requirements. Patient is currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic or corticosteroid therapy. Patients previously treated with interferon, peginterferon or other immunomodulatory within the previous 6 months. Patients previously treated with clevudine, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, Tenofovir or any other investigational nucleoside for HBV infection. Patient with clinical evidence of decompensated liver disease (Total bilirubin ＜ 2.0mg/dL, Prothrombin time ＜ 1.7(INR), Serum albumin≥3.5g/dL) Patient is coinfected with HCV, HDV or HIV. Patient has a history of ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy. Patient with clinical evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma Patient with previous liver transplantation Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Patient has a clinically relevant history of abuse of alcohol or drugs.

Patient has creatinine clearance less than 60mL/min as estimated by the following formula: (140age in years) (body weight [kg])/(72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) [Note: multiply estimates by 0.85 for women]</criteria>
