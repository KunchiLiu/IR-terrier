	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects on anthropometric, glucose metabolism and lipid profile biomarkers of exchanging with high-protein, low-glycemic index products (40-30-30) the habitual breakfast, mid-morning and afternoon snacks on type-2 diabetes patients following a chronologically scheduled pattern.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutritional Intervention With Moderately High-protein, Low-glycemic Load Products in Type-2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes prevalence in adults has grown in the last years in many societies, accompanying the high incidence of obesity-related and other cardiovascular risk factors. Indeed, obesity is the most relevant overnutrition disease worldwide, being more dramatic than a self-esteem problem or an aesthetic issue, since it is associated to different metabolic disorders such as coronary diseases, hypertension, certain tumors, dislipidemia, biliary disorders, immunodeficiencies and insulin resistance. Different studies have shown the efficacy of low-fat diets on weight reduction, which has been associated to an improvement in overweight-related chronic pathological conditions. Additionally, a moderate increase of protein content (up to 30% of total caloric intake) in the diet and the inclusion of low-glycemic index products have been shown as a good tool for weight loss and maintenance. Recent studies have also shown the benefits of partial nutritional interventions, mainly on modifying breakfast intake, on anthropometrical and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight patients. The study has been designed as a longitudinal nutritional intervention with two consecutive 4-week periods: from week 0 to 4, volunteers will follow their habitual diet. The second period (week 4 to 8), the volunteers' habitual breakfast, mid-morning and afternoon snacks will be substituted by 40-30-30 products, without changing any other parameter of their habitual diet or lifestyle.</detailed_description>
