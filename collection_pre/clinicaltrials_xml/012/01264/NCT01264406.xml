	<brief_summary>This study will compare the effect of two doses of exercise on energy intake and body weight. The comparison will be between three groups; two exercise groups and a control group. The exercise groups will not be provided with a dietary intervention and the study design also includes a non-exercise control group. E-Mechanic trial can make important contributions to understanding of the role of exercise dose in weight management. While it is accepted that regular exercise plays an important role in general health, the exact role of exercise in prevention of weight gain, weight loss and prevention of weight regain remains poorly understood despite exercise being widely prescribed for these purposes. The idea that current weight management exercise recommendations may produce increased energy intake (or other forms on compensation) resulting in disappointing weight loss is an important public health issue. The finding of this study could help shape future exercise and weight loss recommendations and treatment plans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparison of Energy in Take and Body Weight EXERCISE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the E-MECHANIC Trial is to test the effect of two doses of exercise on energy intake, body weight, body composition, activity levels, and metabolic rate. The exercise doses will reflect current recommendations for: 1) general health (8 KKW), and 2) weight loss (20 KKW). A non-exercise control group will also be recruited. The primary outcome variables are: 1) energy intake, and 2) the discrepancy between expected weight loss and observed weight loss. Energy intake will be measured using doubly labeled water and laboratory-based food intake tests. Secondary outcome variables include resting metabolic rate, activity levels (excluding structured exercise), and body composition. Following a comprehensive baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to the 8 KKW, 20 KKW, or control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Additional assessments will be conducted at week 4, with another comprehensive assessment at week 24. The week 4 assessment is important to determine if endpoints change in the short-term, but not long-term.</detailed_description>
