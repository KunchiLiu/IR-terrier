	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of Diacerein 100 mg daily versus placebo in reducing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, when added to stable oral MTX therapy in patients with active early RA. To evaluate the safety of Diacerein 100 mg daily when administrated in combination with oral MTX therapy in those patients for up to 24 weeks To investigate a potential persistent effect, 4 weeks after Diacerein treatment is stopped (carry-over effect)</brief_summary>

Treatment with intraarticular injection of a depocorticosteroid within 8 weeks prior to randomisation; 12. Treatment with NSAID or oral corticosteroids, unless the patient has been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before randomisation (maximal allowed daily dose of oral corticosteroid equivalent to prednisone 10 mg); 13. Physical therapy and alternative therapies, unless the patient has received them regularly for at least 4 weeks before randomisation; 14.
