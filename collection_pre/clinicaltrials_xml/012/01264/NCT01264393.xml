	<brief_summary>Behavioral weight loss programs can successfully reduce body weight, but these programs are available to limited numbers of overweight and obese individuals. This project evaluates a unique weight loss approach that combines a self-sustaining weight loss campaign (for outreach) with training in behavioral weight loss strategies and strategies to increase accountability (to improve weight loss success). This innovative combination has the potential to be a cost-effective model for disseminating weight control interventions.</brief_summary>
