	<brief_summary>The primary aims are to test the effectiveness of the self-help DM intervention (SHIP-DM), a comprehensive, culturally tailored DM management intervention, in improving glucose outcomes; To determine the effectiveness of the SHIP-DM in KAI with type 2 DM in improving self-care skills and psycho-behavioral outcomes related to DM control, to develop tangible infrastructures for the dissemination of valid and effective education materials to a wider population of KAI with type 2 DM in the US (e.g., audio-visual education materials, web-based intervention materials, mobile telephone-based intervention materials) and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of each dissemination module, utilizing the delayed intervention group participants. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary cost-effectiveness data related to the proposed intervention, including cost estimates for this type of DM intervention, and to establish a systematic, long-term dissemination plan, including documenting effective methodologies, to facilitate faster translation of research findings and products to direct consumers in non-research settings.</brief_summary>
