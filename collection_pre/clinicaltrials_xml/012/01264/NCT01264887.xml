	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is the characterization of the long term safety profile and long-term dose requirements of tapentadol PR (prolonged release) in patients with malignant tumor-related pain. In the United States the prolonged-release formulation is also referred to as the extended-release formulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tapentadol in Chronic Malignant Tumour Related Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of tumor-related pain is high and the treatment of chronic tumor-related pain remains a challenging therapeutic problem. Participants directly entering the KF5503/52 trial from the KF5503/15 trial (i.e., within 7 days of Visit 8 of the KF5503/15 trial) is scheduled: a Transfer Visit, an Open-label Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. For participants with a gap of more than 7 days and less than 24 weeks, between their full completion of the KF5503/15 trial and entry into the KF5503/52 trial the following is scheduled: an Enrollment Visit, an Entry Visit for assessment of eligibility, an Open-label Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. This trial was designed to offer patients with chronic malignant tumor-related pain the option of continuing treatment by receiving tapentadol prolonged release (PR). The protocol scheduled visits every 28 days during the open-label treatment period. Unscheduled visits (or at least unscheduled telephone calls) were planned when dose adjustment is required. If a visit is not possible at the time of dose change, it could be done up to 7 days later. Unscheduled visits could also be performed whenever considered necessary (i.e., for evaluation of adverse events).</detailed_description>
