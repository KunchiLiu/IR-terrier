	<brief_summary>The study is a global Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omalizumab administered subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult patients aged 12-75 who have been diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) who remain symptomatic despite standard-dosed H1 antihistamine treatment (including doses up to 4 times above the approved dose level), H2 blockers, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) refractory to H1 antihistamines, H2 blockers, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) at the time of randomization. The presence of itch and hives for &gt; 6 consecutive weeks at any time prior to enrollment despite current use of H1 antihistamine (up to 4 times the approved dosage), H2 blocker, and/or LTRA treatment during this time. Urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7) score (range 0−42) ≥ 16 and itch component of UAS7 (range 0−21) ≥ 8 during 7 days prior to randomization (Week 0). Inclinic UAS ≥ 4 on at least one of the screening visit days (Day −14, Day −7, or Day 1). For women of childbearing potential, agreement to use an acceptable form of contraception and to continue its use for the duration of the study. Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days prior to screening. Weight less than 20 kg (44 lbs). Clearly defined underlying etiology for chronic urticarias other than CIU. Evidence of parasitic infection. Atopic dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, senile pruritus, or other skin disease associated with itch. Previous treatment with omalizumab within a year prior to screening. Routine doses of the following medications within 30 days prior to screening: Systemic or cutaneous (topical) corticosteroids (prescription or over the counter), hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide. Intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (IVIG), or plasmapheresis within 30 days prior to screening. Regular (daily/every other day) doxepin (oral) use within 6 weeks prior to screening. Patients with current malignancy, history of malignancy, or currently under workup for suspected malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer that has been treated or excised and is considered resolved. Hypersensitivity to omalizumab or any component of the formulation. History of anaphylactic shock. Presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, metabolic, or other pathological conditions that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results and or compromise the safety of the patients. Evidence of current drug or alcohol abuse.</criteria>
