	<brief_summary>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is high and expected to increase dramatically in worldwide, in France and especially in the French West Indies.This chronic disease is associated with premature mortality and various debilitating complications which can be prevented by optimal control of glycaemia, blood pressure and lipids. Diabetes management includes lifestyle modification and medication. Despite numerous studies supporting the benefits of frequent physical activity for people with Type 2 diabetes, an estimated 60Â±80% of this population remain sedentary. Promotion of physical activity in current diabetes care seems to be inadequate. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the medium-term effectiveness (after 3 and 6months) of exercise consultation in promoting physical activity in outpatients with Type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
