	<brief_summary>Traditional Chinese herbal medicine, no matter mono-therapy or poly-pharmacy, is composed of complicated chemical constituents. Many confounding factors influence activity of Chinese herbs, including the origin of the herbs, safety of the products and consistency between batches. Study of the effectiveness and mechanism of Chinese herbs in vivo is much more challengeable due to unresolved problems of product quality control, screen of effective principles, monitor of the marker constituents and the targets for site of action. In this project, we will introduce the concept of metabolomics to detect total metabolites spectra as the biomarkers of Chinese herbs intervention. Correlation will be analyzed between changes in total metabolites and clinical improvements when menopausal women receive Suan Tsao Jen Tang or Jia Wey Shiau Yau San, and postpartum women receive生化湯.</brief_summary>
