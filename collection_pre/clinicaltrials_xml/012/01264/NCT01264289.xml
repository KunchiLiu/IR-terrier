	<detailed_description>This randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of two formulations of 5 mg finasteride tablets under fasted conditions. The study was conducted with 26 (25 completed) healthy adults. The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There was a 7-day interval between treatments.</detailed_description>
