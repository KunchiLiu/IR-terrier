	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label, two period crossover study will evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of RO5185426 and the efficacy and safety of continuous administration in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. Patients will be randomized to receive in a crossover design single oral doses of RO5185426 with or without food, with a 10-day washout period between doses. Following the crossover periods, patients will receive RO5185426 orally twice daily on a continuous basis until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
