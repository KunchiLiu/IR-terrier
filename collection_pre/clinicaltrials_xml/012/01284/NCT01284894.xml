	<brief_summary>Two to 15% of subjects present dysphagia. In case of normal eso-gastro-duodenal endoscopy, patients with dysphagia are referred for esophageal motility testing. Esophageal manometry is the gold standard to evaluate esophageal motility in absence of esophageal obstruction. Two different techniques are available: the conventional manometry and the high resolution manometry. The second one may improve the diagnostic yield and the tolerance of examination in patients with dysphagia.</brief_summary>
