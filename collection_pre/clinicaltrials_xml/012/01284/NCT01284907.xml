	<criteria>Physician diagnosed asthmatics and they should fulfill at least two of the following three criteria: A minimum of three clinic visits for acute asthma within 1 year Two or more asthmarelated hospital admissions within 1 year, or Steroid dependency, as defined by either 6 months of oral or 1 year of inhaled corticosteroid use Age: 614 years old. The age group of 6 to 14 years old was chosen for two reasons: 1. Diagnostic accuracy of asthma is better in this age group as nonspecific wheezers less than 6 years of age could be excluded. 2. Child should be able to use a peak flow meter and perform spirometry tests. A positive specific IgE or a positive skin prick test for at least one airborne allergen. Children with mild intermittent and mild persistent asthma. Asthmatic children who are currently on immunotherapy or anti IgE. Asthmatic children with concomitant other medical problems. Children who are younger than 6 yrs or older than 14 yrs. Children with history of early life injury to airways like premature birth (&lt; 36 weeks) or home use of oxygen. Children with vitamin D deficiency. Since these children may be randomized to the control group, they will be excluded for ethical reasons.</criteria>
