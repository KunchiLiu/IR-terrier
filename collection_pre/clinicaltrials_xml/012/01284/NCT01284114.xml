	<brief_title>Effects of Aliskiren in Elderly Hypertensive Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was reported to be affecting 11% of the all population. This number is much higher in the elderly population and may be as high as 30%. CKD is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is called "Cardio-renal Continuum". The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays pivotal roles in both cardiovascular and renal functions. The increased oxidative stress by activated RAS on vascular endothelium is one of important factor to development of Cardio-renal Continuum. The blockade of RAS by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been reported to ameliorate the renal disease and CVD; however,they do not completely suppress RAS, leading to a reactive rise in plasma renin activity (PRA). Aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor, is effective against essential hypertension by reducing PRA, resulting in more complete suppression of RAS; however, little is known about the effects of aliskiren on heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive CKD patients. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of aliskiren on heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive CKD patients.</detailed_description>
