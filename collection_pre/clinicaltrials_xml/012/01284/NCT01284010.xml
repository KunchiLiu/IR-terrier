	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood and bone marrow samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Blood and Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To perform high-resolution, genome-wide profiling of DNA copy number alterations and loss-of-heterozygosity in samples from adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) obtained at diagnosis. - To perform candidate gene resequencing of diagnostic ALL samples. - To examine correlation of genetic alterations with outcome. - To examine the correlation between microarray multi-gene and multi-exon expression signatures with specific alterations and outcome. - To understand genetic events that contribute to the formation, development, and relapse of adult ALL by integrating the copy number and sequence alterations with the multi-gene signatures, and by comparing these data with data already generated in pediatric ALL. OUTLINE: Diagnostic, complete remission, and germ-line specimens are analyzed for DNA profiling and gene resequencing by the Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray platform, PCR, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Frequency of genetic alterations are performed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Results are then compared with the data already generated from pediatric patients.</detailed_description>
