	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Effect of Cannabidiol on Liver Fat Levels in Subjects With Fatty Liver Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 10 week (2-10 day screening, eight week treatment period and one week follow-up), randomized, partially-blind study will assess the effect of CBD in subjects with raised liver triglycerides (liver fat â‰¥ 5%). Eligible subjects will enter the study at a Screening Visit (Visit 1, Day -10 to -2) and commence a two to ten day screening period, before returning for a baseline visit (Visit 2, Day 1). During the fasted Screening Visit, study-related observations will include: informed consent, demographics, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, weight, height and concomitant medications. Subjects will have the following assessments performed: 1. Fasting lipid profile blood sample 2. Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c &amp; fasting serum insulin 3. Safety blood tests (haematology and biochemistry) 4. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen) 5. CAGE Questionnaire to assess alcohol dependency 6. Body weight will be measured and BMI calculated 7. Pregnancy test (if appropriate) 8. Liver triglyceride content (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)) scan unless there is documented history of a liver fat content equal to or above 5% as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/MRS or a biopsy within the last two months prior to this screening visit. Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan poses a significant burden (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may be undertaken separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the visit. Suitable subjects will be invited to return fasted for a Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Day 1). The following measurements will be made at Visit 2, prior to study medication being dispensed: 1) Safety assessments (Adverse Event(s) (AE)) and vital signs and a review of concomitant medications) 2) Body weight measurements / adipose tissue distribution. Body fat content and visceral adiposity will be assessed by MRI/MRS. Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan poses a significant burden (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may be undertaken separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the visit. 3) Fasting lipid blood sample 4) Fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin 5) Safety blood sample (haematology and biochemistry) 6) Urinalysis 7) Liver triglyceride content (MRI/MRS scan). Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan poses a significant burden (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may be undertaken separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the visit. 8) Other assessments (blood sample for plasma CBD levels; Physical Activity Questionnaire; Food Frequency Questionnaire) Subjects will be issued study medication and advised to take it twice daily as instructed. There will be a safety follow-up telephone call at Week 1, Day 8 (Visit 3) which will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications. Compliance with IMP administration will also be discussed. There will be a second safety follow-up telephone call at Week 2, Day 15 (Visit 4), which will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications. Compliance with IMP administration will also be discussed. A further visit will take place mid-treatment (Visit 5, Week 4, Day 29) where the following assessments will be performed: 1. Safety assessments (AEs, vital signs, review of concomitant medications and physical exam) 2. Safety blood sample (haematology, biochemistry and non-fasting glucose) 3. Urinalysis 4. IMP compliance review There will be a safety follow-up telephone call at Week 6, Day 43 (Visit 6) which will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications. Compliance with IMP administration will also be discussed. A further fasted visit will take place at the end of treatment (Visit 7, Day 57) where the following assessments will be performed: 1. Safety assessments (AEs, vital signs, review of concomitant medications, physical exam (including body weight measurements and BMI calculation), ECG and pregnancy test as appropriate) 2. Body weight measurements / adipose tissue distribution 3. Fasting lipid blood sample 4. Fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin 5. Safety blood sample (haematology and biochemistry) 6. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen) 7. Liver triglyceride content (MRI/MRS scan). Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan poses a significant burden (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may be undertaken separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the visit. 8. Other assessments (blood sample for plasma CBD levels; Physical Activity Questionnaire; Food Frequency Questionnaire) 9. IMP compliance review There will be a final safety follow-up telephone call at Visit 8 (seven days after completion or withdrawal), involving a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications.</detailed_description>
