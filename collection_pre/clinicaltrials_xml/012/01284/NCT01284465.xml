	<brief_title>Type 2 Diabetes Self-management Intervention for Low-income Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, the prevalence of diabetes has significantly increased among women and because of the expected fast growth rate of minority populations, the number of women in these groups who will be diagnosed with diabetes is also expected to increase significantly over the coming years. Among women from minority groups diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death while it is the seventh among non-Hispanic White females. Non-compliance to diabetes self-care is a major concern for type 2 diabetic women of racial/ethnic groups because of the existing socio-economic and environmental barriers. Often, these women live in poverty; have less than a high school education as well as language barriers and inadequate health literacy, which further place them at risk for complications, and the daily activities of diabetes self-care are implemented within the context of family responsibilities and patient's priorities. This study is a 12-month randomized controlled trial designed to compare a lifestyle intervention group (combination group) and a control group (education only group). Participants assigned to either group will receive three group education sessions (baseline, 3 and 6 months) with an emphasis on self-management.</detailed_description>
