	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether some features of plaques in coronary arteries predispose the heart muscle to injuries during angioplasty in patients with a narrowing in at least one of the arteries that may need a stent placed during a heart catheterization. Participants undergo a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study before the heart catheterization to look for scarring in the heart muscle. During the heart catheterization, participants undergo an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) exam to look at the make-up of the plaques before the stent placement and the investigators will measure the pressures in the arteries to look at how severe the blockage is. Within 30 days after the heart catheterization, participants will have a second MRI done to look for any new scar in the heart muscle.</brief_summary>
