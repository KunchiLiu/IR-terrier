	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of MEDI-565 in Adults With Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a FTIH, dose-escalation and expansion Phase 1 study. The first part is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of MEDI-565 to determine the MTD or OBD and evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM, and antitumor activity of MEDI 565 in adult subjects who have GI adenocarcinomas for which no standard or curative treatments are available. The second part is a dose-expansion study at the MTD or OBD in subjects with selected tumor types.</detailed_description>
