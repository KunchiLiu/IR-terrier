	<brief_summary>The Tan EndoGlide device results in less endothelial cell trauma during insertion of the donor corneal graft indicated by reduced endothelial cell loss at 1 year follow-up compared to the Forceps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Study Comparing Endothelial Cell Loss Using the Tan EndoGlide With Forceps for Insertion of the Donor Graft in DSAEK</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients presenting with corneal decompensation requiring DSAEK with or without cataract surgery for visual rehabilitation. Clinical diagnosis include endothelial cell dysfunction secondary to Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, pseudophakic or aphakic bullous keratopathy, failed penetrating keratoplasty or DSAEK, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome or trauma. Ability to understand the nature of the procedure and give full informed consent. Patients who are able to comply with the standard DSAEK followup protocol at the Toronto Western Hospital. Patients with late stage corneal decompensation with stromal scarring unsuitable for DSAEK and therefore requiring penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with complex anterior segment pathology precluding successful DSAEK procedure. Patients not giving full informed consent to participate in the trial</criteria>
