	<brief_summary>A Phase II clinical research study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dose levels of an injectable investigational treatment (ACC-001) in subjects with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's disease. ACC-001 (vanutide cridificar) is a beta amyloid fragment attached to a carrier protein. It is intended to help induce an antibody response against beta amyloid and is administered as an intramuscular injection.</brief_summary>
