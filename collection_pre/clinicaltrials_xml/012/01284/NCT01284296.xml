	<brief_summary>This study will further investigate the Masimo SpHb [FDA Approved] continuous non-invasive hemoglobin monitor in spine surgery patients. (See NCT00792597) We will investigate the effect of enhanced circulation to the finger (which will be attached to the sensor) following a local injection (digital block) of lidocaine (an FDA approved local anesthetic), and assess the accuracy of the SpHb reading as it relates to a standard laboratory hemoglobin value (tHb).</brief_summary>
