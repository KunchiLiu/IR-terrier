	<brief_title>Study of ACE-011 to Determine Safe and Effective Dose of ACE-011 for the Treatment of Chemotherapy Induced Anemia in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: Metastatic non-small and small cell lung cancer, metastatic bladder, head and neck, and cervical cancer: Modified to expand eligible tumor types to include advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, excluding those solid tumors treated with curative intent, in Part 1 of the study. Part 2 metastatic non small cell lung cancer; Modified to confirm only metastatic NSCLC subjects are eligible for Part 2 of the study</detailed_description>
