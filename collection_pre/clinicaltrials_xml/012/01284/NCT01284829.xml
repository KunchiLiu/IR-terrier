	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study which aims to validate a new diagnostic approach in the tissue characterization of adrenal tumors indeterminate on conventional imaging. For this purpose, it is not necessary to have a control group since the diagnostic accuracy in a well defined subset of patients. Visit 0 : Enrollment, eligibility. Visit 1 : FDG-PET. Visit 2 : Postoperative visit. Visit 3 : 6 months post-PET. Visit 4 : 12 months post-PET.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) in the Diagnosis of Indeterminate Adrenal Tumors on Conventional Imaging: A French Prospective Multicentric Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective The primary objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET, particularly the SUVmax tumor/liver ratio, in the diagnosis of indeterminate adrenal tumors on conventional imaging. Secondary objectives - To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the tumor SUVmax, and SUVmax of the tumor/mean SUV of the liver. - To evaluate the relationship between SUVmax tumor/liver ratio and Weiss score. - To evaluate the impact of the use of FDG-PET on the treatment options. - To evaluate the economic impact of FDG-PET in the management of indeterminate adrenal tumors (ancillary study).</detailed_description>
