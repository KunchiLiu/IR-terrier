	<detailed_description>Even with extensive diagnostic workup the underlying etiology remains unidentified in about 25% of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Non-invasive high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) of the carotid artery allows detecting vulnerable plaques (VP) and quantifying single plaque components. The hypotheses behind this study are that i) a substantial proportion of cases of AIS and TIA within the anterior circulation and no identified cause (cryptogenic AIS or TIA) are caused by VP in the carotid artery; ii) that these patients are at a high risk of developing a recurrent stroke, TIA, or clinically silent lesions detectable by brain MRI; and iii) that VP in the carotid artery are associated with specific infarct patterns as detected by diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Finally, the investigators will search for biomarkers associated with vulnerable carotid artery plaques. Motivating this study are the following considerations: i) data on the frequency and characteristics of VP in patients with cryptogenic AIS or TIA will provide valuable insights into stroke mechanisms; ii) depending on the results this study may have implications for diagnostic decision making and provide the basis for the planning of targeted interventional studies.</detailed_description>
