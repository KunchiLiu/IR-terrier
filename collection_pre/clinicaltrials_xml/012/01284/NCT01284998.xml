	<brief_summary>In case of deformities of the forefoot (Hallux-valgus, Hallux-varus), the basal osteotomy may be more indicated than the distal osteotomy as it allows to achieve a greater degree of correction. However, weight bearing forces on the head of the first metatarsal acting at a distance from the osteotomy site subject the construct to an important dorsiflexion stress. Fixation strength being the important consideration led to design the B-BOP® Lock plate, specifically dedicated to basal osteotomy of the first metatarsal, with the following characteristics: - plantar positioning to obtain the best stability and resistance while reducing the implant bulkiness; - anatomical shape adapted to the plantar curve of the first metatarsal. Taking advantages of the most appropriated anatomical site to implant the B-BOP® Lock plate directly on tension, it offers an innovative and unique basal osteotomy fixation solution. The B-BOP® Lock osteosynthesis plate benefits now of the Surfix locking screws technology. The purpose of this study is to collect and publish data from several centers, several users.</brief_summary>
