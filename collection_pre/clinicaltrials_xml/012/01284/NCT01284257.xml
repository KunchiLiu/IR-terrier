	<brief_summary>The MORE Observational Study follows real-world renal transplant patients with the data resolution of a monitored, prospective clinical trial for 5 years. In addition to capturing detailed clinical data, the study describes recent important changes in surveillance testing and drug therapy and relates these changes to short and long-term outcomes. Also, the study measures patient compliance over time and details the rationale for modifications of MPA dosing in maintenance and regimen changes after episodes of AR. The MORE study will provide information on era changes in transplant practices and their impact on clinical outcome, new insights on optimizing regimens for discrete patient subsets and new perspectives on the optimal use of MPA therapy.</brief_summary>
