	<brief_summary>Growing evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is a relevant treatment for severely obese patients, especially those with metabolic complications, as it significantly reduces weight, hypertension and ameliorates glycemic control. Its action on adipose tissue distribution and in particular on epicardial adipose tissue EAT remains unknown. Whether metabolic improvement is associated with EAT reduction is also unknown. The researchers thus investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on EAT in severely obese patients. The primary endpoint of this study was the change in EAT amount 6 months after bariatric surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The best of our knowledge, no study has really addressed whether this EAT was modulated by diet or therapeutics like bariatric surgery. The researchers were particularly interested in studying the impact of bariatric surgery and of weight loss on the amount of EAT and whether reduction in EAT could have a positive impact on myocardial function.</detailed_description>
