	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients before surgery with Major Depression Inventory (MDI). The investigators hypothesize that this patient group will not produce scores correlating to having a mild, moderate or severe depression even though they have just recently experienced a major life crisis by receiving a malignant diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Major Depression Inventory (MDI) in Measuring Preoperative Depressive Symptoms in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Major Depression Inventory is a self-rating depression scale with 12 questions. The questionnaire has previously been investigated in a Danish population. The scale contains the 10 ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases)symptoms of depression and these symptoms are identical with the DSM-IV major depression symptoms with the exception of one symptom, low self-esteem, which in DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is incorporated in the symptom of guilt. On a six-point Likert scale, the individual items measure how much of the time the symptoms have been present during the last 14 days. The MDI is then scored according to specific guidelines and can be used as both a rating scale and a diagnostic instrument. Patients will approximately one week after the diagnosis of breast cancer has been made, corresponding to approximately one week before surgery, be asked to complete the MDI. Patients therefore only complete the MDI once in the whole study. At the same time a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and questions regarding previous illnesses and medication will be asked. Patients will not be followed up in any way.</detailed_description>
