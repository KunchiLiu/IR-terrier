	<brief_summary>This study represents the first investigation of anrukinzumab in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and will evaluate proof of mechanism by changes in the mechanism based biomarker (YKL 40) and pharmacodynamic biomarkers (fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin and hs-CRP). It will provide further assessment of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) by administration of multiple intravenous (IV) doses of anrukinzumab.</brief_summary>
