	<brief_title>Study of an Investigational Drug, ASP3026, in Patients With Advanced Malignancies (Solid Tumors and B-Cell Lymphoma)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted using a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. Enrollment of at least 3 subjects is planned for each dosing cohort until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined. Up to three additional subjects per cohort may be enrolled if each additional subject is known to be positive for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) or Proto-Oncogene Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ROS (ROS) abnormalities. The decision to expand a cohort or dose escalate will be based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Cycle 1 that are considered by the Investigator to be related (possibly or probably) to ASP3026. Intra-subject dose escalation will be allowed at the discretion of the investigators. The Safety Data Review Committee may elect to enroll additional subjects in a cohort to further evaluate the dose level. Once the MTD is determined, approximately 20 additional subjects with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) abnormalities will be enrolled at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose. Each cycle will include 28 days of continuous dosing with ASP3026. Treatment with ASP3026 may continue until one of the discontinuation criteria is met.</detailed_description>
