	<brief_title>A Study In Healthy Volunteers To Assess The Safety, Tolerability, And Relative Oral Bioavailability Of Three Formulations Of PH-797804</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male and female subjects of nonchildbearing potential between the ages of 21 and 55. No evidence of active or latent TB. An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject. Evidence, including abnormal clinical laboratory parameters, eg, liver enzyme elevations, or a history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy) or any active GI disease (including any relevant surgery). Any current and clinically significant skin lesions as described in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events for Dermatology (CTCAE) Version 3. A clinically significant skin lesion is defined as Grade 1 (mild) for rash and pruritus, and Grade 2 (moderate) or above for all other lesions (see Short Name description in CTCAE for specific description of lesion). Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
