	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to detect changes in the brain that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Results will be compared to age matched controls. Investigators will assess lesions by measuring T2 and T1 enhanced lesion volumes and magnetization transfer ratio histogram parameters (MTRHP) in patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive disease. This data will be correlated to total brain parenchymal volume as well as identifying the effect of MS lesions on the gray and white matter, volumetric disability, including Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and a specific battery of neuropsychological tests. Quantitative analysis of whole brain N-acetylaspartate (WBNAA), a reproducible measure of viable neuron number, using 1H MRS and compare the results to age-matched controls over duration of 5 years.</brief_summary>
