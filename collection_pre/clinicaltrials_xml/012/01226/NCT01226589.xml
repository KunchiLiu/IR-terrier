	<brief_summary>Adverse drug events can occur commonly due to medication errors during the transition of care in a health care facility. Medication reconciliation is the process of comparing medications and providing an accurate medication list as a resource for prescribers, which is currently only being done upon inpatient admission at the CCI. The purpose of this study is to see if pharmacist medication reconciliation at discharge reduces unintentional medication discrepancies for inpatient discharges.</brief_summary>
