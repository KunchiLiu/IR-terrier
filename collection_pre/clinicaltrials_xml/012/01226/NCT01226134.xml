	<brief_summary>Pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia is poorly understood. Gastrointestinal motor abnormalities, Helicobacter pylori infection, impaired gastric accommodation to a meal, hypersensitivity of the afferent nerves of the gut, psychological disturbances and central nervous system dysfunction have been proposed. Pharmacological treatments for patients with functional dyspepsia remain unsatisfactory. Only small benefits relative to placebo have been found with histamine H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitor and Helicobacter pylori eradication. Itopride is a dopamine antagonist with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory actions. This agent is currently indicated for patients with various upper GI symptoms. This study is aimed to evaluate the effect of Itopride on gastric emptying(by 13-C Octanoic acid breath Test), accommodation (by Gastric Scintigraphy SPECT and slow nutrient drinking test)and symptoms in FD patients</brief_summary>
