	<brief_summary>Patients with major depression who are on a waiting list for psychotherapy usually suffer from considerable symptoms. Online self-help is one potential way to alleviate this suffering. The investigators want to study if patients awaiting psychotherapy benefit from online-self help. The investigators therefore randomly assign patients to either online self-help or no intervention and assess their depressive symptoms on a regular basis. The investigators hypothesize that online self-help will be superior to no intervention in alleviating depressive symptoms in depressed patients awaiting psychotherapy.</brief_summary>
