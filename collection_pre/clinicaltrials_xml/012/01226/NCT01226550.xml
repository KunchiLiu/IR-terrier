	<brief_summary>This is an open, non-randomized, phase I-II, pilot study, which evaluates the combination of optimum cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with mitomycin C (MMC) and irinotecan. The latter drug will be administered in escalating doses to patients with gastric, colorectal, appendicular, or primary peritoneal carcinosis (PC).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with a peritoneal carcinosis (PC) either of digestive origin or primary: a colorectal or gastric carcinosis, a peritoneal pseudomyxoma or mesothelioma, or a primary carcinosis of the peritoneum regardless the number of prior treatment lines. A PC and primary tumor considered to be resectable according to preoperative clinical and paraclinical data: absence of mesenteric retraction and absence of bladder invasion. Patients in good general health (ASA ≤ 2). Absence of cardiorespiratory failure (PaO2 &gt; 60 mmHg in a stable condition, dyspnea ≤ NYHA stage 1, left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 60%.). Prothrombin level &gt;70 %, total bilirubin &lt; 2 x the normal level, ASAT and ALAT &lt; 2.5 x normal levels, and alkaline phosphatases &lt; 5 x normal levels. Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min, polynuclear neutrophils &gt; 1500/mm3, and a white blood cell count &gt; 4000 /mm3. Patients who give written, informed consent. Patients affiliated with the French universal healthcare system. Patients with a PC with ovarian, mammary, biliary, pancreatic, or bronchial origin. Evolutive patients after systemic chemotherapy. Patients with a PC considered to be irresectable according to preoperative clinical and paraclinical data: mesenteric retraction or bladder invasion. Patients in poor general health (ASA &gt; 2). Cardiorespiratory failure (dyspnea &gt; NYHA stage 1, PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg in a stable condition) Prothrombin level &lt; 70 %. Any brain abnormality showing on the head scan. Signs of heart failure and especially left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 60% on the cardiac ultrasound. Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 000 / mm3 Visceral metastases other than a single resectable liver metastasis. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Chronic inflammatory intestinal disease and/or an intestinal obstruction. History of severe hypersensitivity to irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate or one of the excipients of Campto. Bilirubinemia &gt; 3 times the normal upper limit Yellow fever vaccine. Prophylactic treatment with phenytoin. Severe medullary insufficiency.</criteria>
