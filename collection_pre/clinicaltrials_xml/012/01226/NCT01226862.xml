	<brief_title>Advancing Telestroke Care: A Prospective Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to promote the development and economic sustainability of telemedicine for acute stroke treatment. The study's objectives are 1) to determine if the use of telemedicine consultations for stroke patients will improve their care per guidelines compared to stroke patients treated by control hospitals; and 2) to determine if the care per guidelines provided via telemedicine consultations for stroke patients will be similar or equivalent to care per guidelines provided to stroke patients treated at hub hospitals. The Advancing Telestroke Care study will establish treatment and outcomes in three distinct study cohorts: hub telemedicine hospital, spoke telemedicine hospital and non-telemedicine control hospital.</detailed_description>
