	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives - To compare the amount of post-operative wound drainage between the group of patients in which EVICEL™ spray is utilized (Arm A), and the group of patients in which an EVICEL™ placebo is utilized (Arm B). - To compare the length of time to drain removal between Arm A and Arm B. Secondary objectives - To compare the incident or rates of seroma, hematoma, and post-operative edema between the two groups. - To compare the reported pain experienced in each group at selected time points using a standard numerical rating scale (NRS). - To compare the length of hospital stay between the two groups of patients.</brief_summary>
