	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess patient preference for Lantus SoloSTAR pen versus Lantus vial and syringe at the end of Crossover Phase (Week 4) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Secondary Objectives: To compare Lantus SoloSTAR pen versus Lantus vial and syringe with regard to the following parameters: Randomization/Crossover phase: - Healthcare professional's (HCP) recommendation for Lantus SoloSTAR pen versus Lantus vial and syringe Re-randomization phase: - Change in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) from week 4 to week 10 - Percentage of patients achieving FPG&lt;110 mg/dL at week 10 - Change in Lantus dose injected per day (U) from week 4 to week 10 Observational phase: - Percentage of patients achieving glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) goal (&lt;7%) at week 40 - Time to first observation of HbA1c&lt;7% during the observational phase - Percentage of patients who discontinue Investigational Product (IP) during the observational phase due to dissatisfaction with their current device All phases: - Percentage of patients who discontinue IP during each phase of the study - Safety assessment such as occurrence of hypoglycemic events (HE) and adverse events (AE)</brief_summary>
