	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency is commonly found in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The investigators hypothesize that the correction of hypovitaminosis D before the initiation of anti-HCV combination therapy and the maintenance of an optimal vitamin D status during antiviral therapy could improve the antiviral efficacy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Vitamin D on Top of Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin in Patients With Chronic Viral Hepatitis C Null-Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label, prospective evaluation of the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation starting 1 month before and continuing for the duration of combination therapy with pegylated interferon alpha (2a or 2b) plus ribavirin in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C genotype 1 or 4, nonresponders to a first antiviral therapy.Vitamin D supplementation is started one month before antiviral therapy in order to introduce pegylated interferon plus ribavirin in patients with optimal vitamin D status</detailed_description>
