Participants entering Part B of the study must also have a tumor that is safely amenable to serial biopsies Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Therasse et al. 2000) or Revised International Working Group Lymphoma Response Criteria (Cheson et al. 2007) Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancerrelated hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy for at least 28 days (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug Females with child bearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks Have symptomatic, untreated or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Participants with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable, asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic participants without history of CNS metastases is not required Have current acute or chronic leukemia Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant Females who are pregnant or lactating Known hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim</criteria>
