	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the preliminary efficacy of treatment by the VascuActive device on peripheral diabetic neuropathy, and to correlate this effect with physiologic changes. Patients will undergo a 4-week period of home treatment by the VascuActive device, and will be monitored during this period and during a two-month follow-up period for the efficacy of the device in reducing neuropathic pain, sensation impairment and other signs and symptoms.</brief_summary>
