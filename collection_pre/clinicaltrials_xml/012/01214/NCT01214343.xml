	<brief_title>Comparing Efficacy of Sorafenib Versus Sorafenib in Combination With Low-dose FP in Patients With Advanced HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib with Low-dose FP Group Sorafenib will be administered orally at a dose of 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) twice daily (bid) for 28 days. Cisplatin at the dose of 20mg/m2 will be administered at day 1 and day8, and fluorouracil at the dose of 330mg/m2 will be administered continuously at day1-day5, and day8-day12 via the implanted catheter system. Sorafenib Group Sorafenib will be administered orally at a dose of 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) twice daily (bid) for 28 days. The treatment regimen will be continued until radiographic or symptomatic progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
