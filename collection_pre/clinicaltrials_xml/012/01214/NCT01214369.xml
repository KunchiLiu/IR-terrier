	<brief_summary>- Hypothesis: - X-tip intraosseous is an effective supplementary injection in mandibular hot teeth as well as Periodontal Ligament (PDL) injection - Purposes: - Comparing the anesthetic efficacy of X-tip intraosseous and PDL injection in mandibular hot teeth which had not been anesthetized after 3.6 ml Infra Alveolar Nerve Block - Methods and Materials: - forty patients with mandibular hot molar or second premolar which had not been anesthetized after 3.6 ml inferior alveolar nerve block injection will be selected for this study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthetic Efficacy of X-tip Intraosseous Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Randomization: - All patients will be randomly divided into two groups as follows: 1. X-tip intraosseous injection will be used as supplementary 2. PDL injection will be used as supplementary - Anesthetic evaluation: - For anesthetic evaluation we will use Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</detailed_description>
