	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Healthy males according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate), 12lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests 2.

Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation. Exclusion criteria: 1. Any finding of the medical examination (including Pulse Rate and electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance 2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease 3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 4. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) 5. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders 6. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts. 7. Chronic or relevant acute infections 8. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) 9. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (longer than 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial 10. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial up to 7 days before the start of drug administration in the study or during the study period 11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within one months prior to administration or during the trial 12. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or more than 3 cigars or more than 3 pipes/day) 13. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days 14. Alcohol abuse (more than 40 g/day) 15. Drug abuse 16. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) 17. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the trial) 18. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 19. Any positive results in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies, anti hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test Exclusion criteria specific for this study: 20. Hypersensitivity to pramipexole or other dopamine agonists 21. Supine blood pressure at screening of systolic&lt;100 mmHg and diastolic &lt; 60 mmHg, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (i. .e. clinical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension associated with a decline &gt;=20 mmHg in systolic BP and a decline &gt;=10 mmHg in diastolic BP, at one minute after standing compared to the previous supine systolic and diastolic BP obtained after 5 minutes of quiet rest)</criteria>
