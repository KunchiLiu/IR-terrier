	<brief_title>The Improvement in Uroflow and Postvoid Residual Urine After Urethral Meatotomy in Children With Meatal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urethral meatal stenosis is a known complication of circumcision occuring in up to 3% of newborns undergoing circumcision. It is customary to perform a meatotomy in order to prevent bladder outlet obstruction, although bladder outlet obstruction has never been proven and improvement has only been proved in a single, small, retrospective study. Our intention is to evaluate the improvement in objective parameters (uroflow and postvoid residual urine) after urethral meatotomy by measuring these parameter before the procedure, one month after the procedure and one year after the procedure. Symptoms assessment will also be performed.</detailed_description>
