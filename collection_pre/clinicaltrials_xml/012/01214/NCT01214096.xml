Severe hepatic and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine&gt;2.0 mg /dl, AST or ALT is five times higher than the upper limit of normal range); 10. Subject needs mechanical ventilation; 11. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90mmHg, or &gt; 160mmHg; 12. Chronic heart failure complicated with acute hemodynamic disturbance or acute decompensation within last 1 month; 13. Mobitz Type II or III° atrial ventricular block，severe ventricular arrhythmia (polymorphic and frequent premature ventricular beats, frequent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia); 14. Serum potassium&lt;3.2mmol/L, or&gt;5.5mmol/L; 15. Female subject is pregnant or plan to become pregnant 16. Childbearingaged female subject who is unmarried or dose not bear child; 17.
