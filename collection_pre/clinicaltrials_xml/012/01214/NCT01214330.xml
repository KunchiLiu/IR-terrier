	<detailed_description>The SoloPap "kit" provides to subjects who would not otherwise have a Pap smear done a convenient and private way to collect samples and ship them to a laboratory for processing. The current study is pilot/pre-cursor study for a larger subsequent study that aims to determine whether SoloPap is truly noninferior to clinician-collected Pap smears in detecting cervical pathology. It will also determine user preference and willingness to perform a self- test.</detailed_description>
