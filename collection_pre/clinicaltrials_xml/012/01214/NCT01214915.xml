	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how effective and safe SPD422 (Anagrelide Hydrochloride) is in Japanese subjects, diagnosed with Essential Thrombocythemia, who's previously treatment has either not been effective or has caused unacceptable adverse reactions. The study will aim to show that platelet counts can be safely reduced in treated patients to below 600 x 10^9/L after a minimum of three months treatment. To demonstrate an positive effect platelet levels will need to remain below 600 x 10^9/L for at least 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
