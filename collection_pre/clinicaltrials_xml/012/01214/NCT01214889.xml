	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of PENTAXIM™ combined vaccine versus TETRAXIM™ vaccine to support registration of PENTAXIM™ in South Korea. Primary Objective: To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3, Polyribosyl Ribitol Phosphate [PRP]) and vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis antigens of sanofi pasteur's PENTAXIM™ vaccine versus sanofi pasteur's TETRAXIM™ and Act (Haemophilus influenzae type b) HIB™ vaccines, one month after the three-dose primary vaccination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of PENTAXIM™ Vaccine Versus TETRAXIM™ Vaccine Given With ACTHIB™ Vaccine in South Korean Infants.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive three primary doses of their assigned study the vaccine, on Days 0, 60, and 120. They will be assessed for immunogenicity on Day 0 before vaccination and Day 150 post-vaccination. Safety will be assessed for all participants throughout the study, up to Day 157.</detailed_description>
