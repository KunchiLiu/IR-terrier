	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the dose of LY573636 that can be administered safely in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced cancer who have failed a prior treatment. The study consists of a dose escalation phase to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)and a dose confirmation phase in patients with platinum resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have never been treated with doxorubicin.</brief_summary>
