	<brief_title>Truvada Plus Raltegravir for Nonoccupational Post-exposure Prophylaxis (nPEP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-Occupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (nPEP) after sexual exposure to HIV is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Although no efficacy data exist for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) after sexual exposure, PEP has been shown to reduce HIV transmission in other exposure situations such as occupational exposures and mother-to-child transmission. The role in nPEP of the newer agents approved for the treatment of HIV infection remains unknown. The anti-HIV drug raltegravir works early in the life cycle of the virus, before it integrates with human DNA. It has few side effects and drug interactions what makes it an ideal drug for an nPEP regimen. We aim to asses the safety and tolerability of the combination of truvada and raltegravir for nPEP.</detailed_description>
