	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in signs of inflammation/local infection when Mepilex Border Ag is used in normal clinical practice when used on chronic ulcers (venous leg, diabetic foot and pressure ulcers) and partial thickness burns in need* of topical antimicrobial treatment according to the physician.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Multi-centre Investigation to Evaluate Signs and Symptoms of Local Inflammation/Infection on Chronic Ulcers and Partial Thickness Burns When Using Mepilex Border Ag as an Anti-microbial Wound Dressing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation is designed as an open, non-controlled, post-marketing clinical follow-up. Subjects with chronic ulcers or partial thickness burns (including donor sites) at 2 sites will be included. Each subject with a chronic ulcer will be seen once a week for a maximum of 4 weeks or until desired treatment effect is obtained, whichever occurs earlier. Each subject with a partial thickness burn/donor site will be followed once a week for a maximum of 3 weeks or until desired treatment effect is obtained, whichever occurs earlier. All dressing changes will be done according to clinical routine practices and will follow IFU (instruction for use)</detailed_description>
