	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study is planned to validate OSND against the prospective morbidity and mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients and to examine the hypothesis that OSND risk stratification of chronic HD patients is useful in predicting outcomes and better than its component alone or in diverse combinations. The investigators specific aim is to validate OSND in chronic HD patients by comparing it with conventional measures of nutritional state, including blood tests, anthropometry, MIS, GNRI, bioelectric impedance analysis and several measures of clinical outcome including prospective mortality and hospitalization.</brief_summary>
