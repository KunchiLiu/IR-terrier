	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation with intra-patient dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of intravenous LY2523355 to determine the dose of LY2523355 that can be safely administered to patients with acute leukemia. Part A and Part B are dose escalation of two schedules in patients with acute leukemia. Parts A and B will enroll concurrently. Part C is a dose expansion for each schedule in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Dose escalation period for both schedules: Patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia regardless of subtype for whom experimental phase 1 therapy is appropriate Are greater than or equal to 18 years of age Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug Dose confirmation period for both schedules: Participant must have a confirmed diagnosis of untreated AML, should not be a candidate for standard therapy, and a clinical trial is a preferred treatment option or acute AML that is relapsed or refractory to no more than 2 prior induction regimens. Hydroxyurea to control prior blast counts is not considered a prior regimen. Are greater than or equal to 60 years of age Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication. Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia by spinal fluid cytology or imaging. A lumbar puncture is not required unless CNS involvement is clinically suspected. Participants with signs or symptoms of leukemic meningitis or a history of leukemic meningitis must have a negative lumbar puncture within 2 weeks of study enrollment. Have other active malignancy (with the exception of basal and squamous cell skin cancer) at time of study entry Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant within 3 months. All organ toxicity must be resolved. Have evidence of graftversushost disease due to an allogenic bone marrow transplant Have uncontrolled systemic infection Females who are pregnant or lactating Have known positive test results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb) (screening not required)</criteria>
