	<brief_summary>Despite improving in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), this affection keep an elevate rate of death. The strategy of mechanical ventilation is more and more under definite protocol, following large strength randomized studies. Although, it doesn't exist today element allowing to adjust the level of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) with improvement in patient's survival. The investigators proposed in this study to determinate the level of PEEP adjust to obtain the better arterial oxygen transport (TaO2). The investigators going to conduct a physiologic, observational, none controlled study. All patients hospitalized in intensive care unit of Pontchaillou hospital with ARDS criteria and without specific exclusion criteria will be included. Primary objective is to looking for the optimum level of PEEP for TaO2.</brief_summary>
