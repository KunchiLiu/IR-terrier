	<criteria>1. Male or female patients aged from 18 to 60 years (inclusive). 2. Patients with asthma indicated by history of asthma symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine with a provocation concentration of methacholine that cause a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) ≤8 mg/ml at Visit 1. 3. Patients with stable asthma condition with baseline forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) ≥70% predicted at first visit. 4. The PC20 methacholine should increase at least 4fold after inhaling 24 μg of formoterol Aerolizer (2 applications of 12 μg) at Visit 2. 5. Able to be taught correct inhalation technique for both devices at screening. 1. Known hypersensitivity to formoterol, lactose, or methacholine. 2. History of lifethreatening asthma in the last three years. 3. Major malignancies including pheochromocytoma within the last 5 years. Exception will be considered where malignancies have been resolved as judged by investigator. 4. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, planned pregnancy during the study, or women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception. These methods include total abstinence (no sexual intercourse), oral contraceptives, an intrauterine device (IUD), an etonogestrel implant (Implanon), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (DepoProvera shots). If one of these cannot be used, using contraceptive foam and a condom are recommended. Lack of suitability for the study: 5. Screening visit 2 has to be postponed repeatedly. 6. Evidence of respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks before the study (screening visit 1). 7. Seasonal or episodic exposure to an allergen or occupational chemical sensitizer which are likely to vary in symptom presentation and severity during the course of the study (e.g. ragweed sensitive patients in Iowa during AugOct). This does not apply to patients who can be well controlled on therapy. 8. History of nonreversible pulmonary disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or pulmonary fibrosis. 9. History of severe cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, liver or endocrine dysfunction (patients with wellcontrolled hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, thyroid disease or diabetes may be included if medication for these diseases does not affect methacholine challenge or formoterol metabolism). 10. History of hemophilia or coagulation disease. 11. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities of clinical relevance, in particular abnormal prolongation of QTinterval (QTc according to Bazett in women ≥450 msec, in men ≥430 msec). 12. Potassium level below lower limit of laboratory normal range plus 0.3 mmol/l as safety margin. 13. Exacerbation of bronchial asthma requiring emergency department visit or hospitalization during the last 3 months prior to this study. 14. Prior or concomitant treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids during the last 3 months (a short course of oral corticosteroids for asthma is permissible if for &lt;10 days and at least 30 days have passed). 15. Use of longacting ß2agonists in last 3 weeks before the first methacholine challenge or during the study 16. Change in dosage of other controller therapy (inhaled glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene modifier, slowrelease theophylline) during the last 3 weeks before the first methacholine challenge or during the study. 17. Use of shortacting ß2agonists more than thrice a week in the previous month. 18. Inability to temporary withhold the following medications/substances before lung function test: shortacting ß2agonists and shortacting anticholinergics at least 6 hours, regular longacting ß2agonists at least 3 weeks, longacting anticholinergics at least 36 hours, inhaled glucocorticosteroids at least 2 hours Disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) at least 24 hours, slow release theophylline at least 48 hours, rapid release theophylline at least 24 hours, caffeine at least 4 hours 19. Patients with aspirin induced bronchospasm. 20. Any treatment with ß2antagonists (including eye drops). 21. Noncooperative patients, inability to perform outcome measurement correctly. 22. Inability to measure PC20 methacholine after 24 μg of formoterol Aerolizer (PC20 &gt;128 mg/ml). 23. Current smokers or regular smokers during last 12 months or more than 10 packyear history. 24. Drug or alcohol abuse which would interfere with the patient's proper completion of the protocol assignment. Administrative reasons: 25. Participation in another clinical study within 1 month prior to or during this study 26. Lack of ability or willingness to give informed consent. 27. Lack of willingness to have personal study related data collected, archived or transmitted according to protocol. 28. Personnel involved in the planning or conduct of the study. 29. Anticipated nonavailability for study visits/procedures.</criteria>
