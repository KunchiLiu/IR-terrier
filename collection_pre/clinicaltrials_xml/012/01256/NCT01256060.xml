	<brief_summary>Extensive data has been accumulated to suggest that central release of oxytocin is important for social cognition and function, as well as likely involved in anxiety modulation and repetitive behaviors. The principal investigators of this study have previously documented: 1) an association between Autism Spectrum Disorder and a single nuclear polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the blood by enzyme immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults with autism. A medication treatment targeting the core deficits of Autism Spectrum Disorder in childhood is highly valuable because it could influence the developmental trajectory and make further psychosocial interventions possible. In this context, we propose a small dose finding study to confirm that the dose used in the adult study is not more than the maximum tolerated dose in youth. `</brief_summary>
