	<brief_summary>There are two types of treatments depending on the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAS): - for the treatment of severe (AHI&gt; 30/h), the standard treatment is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). If it proved effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness and associated cardiovascular risk, compliance of patients 4 years of treatment falls below 70%. - Treatment of moderate (AHI between 15 and 30/h), lifestyle measures, the bracing of mandibular advancement and / or possibly the head and neck surgery can be proposed. These treatments include side effects and their effectiveness is very controversial.Il therefore seemed interesting to test the impact of physical activity through a standardized training program to re personal effort on the development and improvement of OSAS patients with a sedentary moderate to severe OSAS (AHI between 15 and 40 / h) The main assumption is that the ESR could eventually delay the initiation of treatment with CPAP in severe OSAS or an alternative therapeutic relevance in the moderate OSAS and severe in patients who can not tolerate conventional treatment(CSF). The main objective of this biomedical research is to evaluate the effects of a program of REE in ambulatory index of hourly apneas / hypopneas (AHI = marker of severity of OSAS) .- objectives specify 2AIR effects of REE on the quality of sleep (TxSLP) and daytime symptoms (EDS objective fatigue) on the one hand and the other on the metabolism (OV, SM, IR) and markers of LCR (inflammation, oxidative stress , endothelial function).</brief_summary>
