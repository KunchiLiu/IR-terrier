	<brief_summary>The fundamental reason for comparing the ability of the Frontal Sedline TM Electroencephalogram (PSA EEG) to standard Global 12 Lead Electroencephalogram (EEG) for burst suppression detection is to determine if a less expensive, less invasive and possibly more convenient bifrontal EEG monitor can be effective for evaluation of anesthesia-induced intraoperative burst suppression therapy (IBST) for cerebral protection.</brief_summary>
