	<brief_summary>This study will look at patients with post-operative treatment of a meniscal tear or degenerative joint disease (degenerative arthritis). They will be randomized into one of three groups: Euflexxa injection, saline (placebo) injection, or no injection. Those who are randomized into the injection group will receive a series of three injections (one a week for 3 weeks), then a "booster" injection at 6 months post-op. Several questionnaires will be given after the first set of injections, then again at a one year follow-up. The hypothesis is that patients receiving hyaluronic acid injections will have better pain and function scores as compared with placebo and no further treatment at all time points.</brief_summary>
