	<brief_summary>This study includes two sub-trials. In trial 1 patients suffering from insomnia but not meeting the criteria for depression are randomised to either therapist guided Internet-based CBT for insomnia or to a control group with a non-guided, brief self-help program that acts as a placebo control. The primary purpose is to evaluate reduction in Insomnia severity (compared to placebo) after treatment and at follow-ups at 6-month, 1 year and 3 years. Secondary purpose is to evaluate the costeffectiveness of the treatment and to evaluate if the insomnia treatment has a preventive effect on future depressive episodes. Recruitment is done through mass media and includes all regions of Sweden. Initial assessment based on questionnaires and telephone interviews. Trial 2 includes patients suffering from both Insomnia and depression. Randomization is done between either CBT for insomnia or CBT for depression (both Internet-based) to evaluate each respective treatment's effect on both insomnia and depression. The patients need for further treatment after the initial one will be measured and used as a secondary outcome. Recruitment is done through mass media but only citizens in the Stockholm area are included since the initial assessment are based on both questionnaires and telephone interviews as well as a visit at a psychiatrist located at the Internet psychiatry clinic in Stockholm. Both trials will include health economic data and analysis. For the longer follow-up periods (1 and 3 years), registers will be used to analyse consumption of sleep medication and antidepressants as well as general health care utilization.</brief_summary>
