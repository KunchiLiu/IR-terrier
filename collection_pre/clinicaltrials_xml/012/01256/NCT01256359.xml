	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled phase 2 trial. Patient will be randomly assigned 1:1 between 2 treatment arms. They will receive either docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV and placebo given bd, or AZD6244 75mg bd daily with docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV. Docetaxel will be administered every 3 weeks for a maximum 6 cycles, but AZD6244/placebo may be continued beyond this, until disease progression. The objective is to assess whether the combination of AZD6244 with docetaxel is worthy of evaluation in a definitive randomised study, with the null hypothesis being that the combination has activity similar to that of docetaxel alone in this population. After consent has been obtained mutational analysis of tumour BRAF will be performed on archival tumour tissue, where this information is not already known, to assess eligibility for the study. If there is no archival tissue a fresh biopsy will be requested from the patient. A blood sample will also be taken for future genetic analysis. Once taking part in the trial patients will need to attend their oncology unit regularly for monitoring and the delivery of treatment. Patients will undergo complete physical examination at screening, on C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C2D8 and day 1 of every subsequent cycle. Blood for haematology, biochemistry and clotting will be taken at each of these visits. A 12 lead ECG will be performed at screening . Disease assessment will be by CT scanning using modified RECIST criteria after 9 and 18 weeks, then every 3 months until disease progression.</brief_summary>
