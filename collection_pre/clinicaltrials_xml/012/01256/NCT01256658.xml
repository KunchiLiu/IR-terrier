Family history of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval or sudden death or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval such as history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, with clinically relevant bradycardia or with severe cardiac disease. Taking drugs that are known to influence cardiac function and to prolong QTc interval, such as class IA and III: neuroleptics, antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antifungal agents, certain nonsedating antihistamines. Known disturbances of electrolyte balance, e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Taking drugs which may be metabolized by cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6</criteria>
