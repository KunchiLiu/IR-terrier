	<brief_summary>The primary objective: *To measure the difference in the number of Ranibizumab therapies needed in 12 months in the Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) positive and Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) negative group. Secondary Objective: - To measure the mean change in visual acuity from Baseline to Month 12. - To measure the mean change in central retinal thickness per OCT from Baseline to Month 12</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study, of intravitreally administered Ranibizumab in eyes with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), specifically looking at the correlation between the presence of Posterior Vitreous Detachment(PVD) and the number of intravitreal injections of Ranibizumab required. 40 subjects from the offices of Vision Research Foundation will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be assigned to either a Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) positive group or a Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) negative group based on a pre-treatment ultrasound. A maximum of 20 subjects in each group will be enrolled. Subject accrual into the trial is expected to be completed within 6 months. All study eyes will receive 0.5mg, of intravitreous monthly injections of Ranibizumab, for four initial doses,(Day 0, Month 1, Month 2, and Month 3),with scheduled follow-up visits monthly for 12 months. Re-treatment after the first 4 injections, will be on an as needed basis, based on predefined criteria. Eyes will be evaluated with a full ocular examination, visual acuity measurement (ETDRS chart at a distance of 4 meters),OCT,FA,Fundus Photos, B-scan Ultrasound and subject adverse event monitoring.</detailed_description>

The following are considered effective means of contraception: surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel,an IUD,or contraceptive hormone implant or patch. Patients with any form of prior eye treatment for AMD including: Photodynamic Therapy, antiVEGF Therapy, Laser, Vitreoretinal surgery Had ocular surgery within the past 60 days in study eye Concurrent use of more than two therapies for glaucoma Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye(defined as intraocular pressure&gt;30mm Hg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) Concurrent use of systemic antiVEGF agents Has active infection in the study eye(s) Inability to obtain photographs to document CNV Has received investigational therapy within 60 days prior to study entry Patients with significantly compromised visual acuity in the study eye due to concomitant ocular conditions. Has other conditions the investigator considers to be sound reasons for exclusion(e.g., lack of motivation, history of poor compliance, concomitant illnesses, personality disorder, mental condition, drug abuse, use of neuroleptics, physical or social condition predicting difficulty in longterm followup).
