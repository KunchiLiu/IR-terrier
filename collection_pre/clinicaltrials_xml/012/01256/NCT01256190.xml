	<brief_title>A Study of Fibrocaps in Liver Surgery in the Netherlands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, comparative efficacy and safety trial in 60 subjects undergoing hepatic resection. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Fibrocaps + Gelfoam or Gelfoam on the day of surgery. The Fibrospray device will be used to apply Fibrocaps to the Target Bleeding Site. All investigators using the Fibrospray device will be trained on the correct and safe set-up and use of Fibrocaps and the Fibrospray device prior to participating in this clinical trial.</detailed_description>
