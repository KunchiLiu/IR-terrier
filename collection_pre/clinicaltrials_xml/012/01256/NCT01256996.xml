	<brief_summary>In the last decade, the number of dental implantations continuously increases. However, at the same time, the prevalence of peri-implantitis increases, too. Although both surgical and non-surgical interventions are available for the therapy, there is no efficient and satisfying therapy option resulting in an adequate improvement of this disease. An innovative, low abrasive powder has been introduced for the therapy of periodontitis. However, the powder might be suitable for the peri-implantitis therapy, also, and could improve the effectiveness of the therapy. The usage of this powder in peri-implantitis patients has not been assessed in a clinical trial although the effectiveness in natural teeth has been demonstrated. The aim of this prospective, randomised, multi-centre trial is to assess the effectiveness of the aforementioned powder in peri-implantitis patients.</brief_summary>
