	<brief_title>Gene Expression Profiling of Breast Cancer Cells Predict the Response of Malignant Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The patiets with malignant pleural effusion are randomizned to be treated with cytokins(inteleukin 2) or dendritic cells(DC) plus cytokine induced killer cells(CIK) locally. 2. Malignant pleural effusion from metastatic breast cancer patient is obtained through thoracentesis and is centrifugalized to enrich cancer cells before the therapy. 3. The enriched cancer cells are flash frozen and stored at -80℃ until processing. 4. The gene expression in pleural effusion is detected by microarray to screen gene markers that are differently expressed between groups . 5. Statistical analysis is performed using unsupervised hierarchical cluster.</detailed_description>
