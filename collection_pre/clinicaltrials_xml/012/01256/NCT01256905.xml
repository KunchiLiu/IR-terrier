	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a drug commonly used to treat excessive day-time sleepiness, called armodafinil (Nuvigil), is also effective in improving the impairment in the attention commonly reported by patients with more advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body disease (LBD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Attention Modulation for Treatment of Parkinson's Disease and Dementia With Lewy Bodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aims of this study are: 1. To investigate whether in PDD and DLB th specific disturbances in the basal ganglia thalamocortical network, measured through the Electroencephalography (EEG) frequency analysis, are ameliorated by armodafinil. Our main hypothesis is that armodafinil can restore the attention and improve cognitive disturbances in PDD and DLB, through a specific effect on striatal-thalamo-cortical activity.</detailed_description>
