	<brief_title>Comparison of an Internet-based Guided Self-help and a Group Therapy for Chronic Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic tinnitus can result in significant psychological suffering and reduce quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in decreasing the impairment caused by tinnitus. One recent way delivering CBT is an internet-based self-help intervention. Internet interventions for patients with chronic tinnitus, developed by Swedish scientists, showed promising results (Andersson et al., 2002; Kaldo et al., 2007; Kaldo et al., 2008). The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of this internet-based self-help training for chronic tinnitus with a traditional well-established CBT group treatment and with a discussion forum group in a randomized controlled trial. Secondary goals are a process evaluation of both treatments, the identification of predictors of treatment success, an estimation of the cost-effectiveness of each treatment and the validation of the Tinnitus Cognitions Questionnaire (T-Cog; Hiller &amp; Haerk√∂tter, 2005).</detailed_description>
