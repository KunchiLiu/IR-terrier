	<brief_summary>This is an open label-study of Fluzone HD, a high-dose form of trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), vs. Fluzone, a standard-dose form of TIV. Subjects with cancer or HIV will be vaccinated twice with one of the two vaccines and evaluated for development of immune responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity of Fluzone HD,A High Dose Influenza Vaccine, In Children With Cancer or HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to compare the immune response of Fluzone HD, a high-dose, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), to Fluzone, a standard-dose TIV, in children with cancer and in children with HIV. The secondary objectives of this study are to: - Describe the safety and reactogenicity of high-dose and standard-dose TIV. - Compare the immunogenicity induced by 1 dose, compared to 2 doses, of high-dose and standard-dose TIV. - Describe the relationship between baseline lymphocyte numbers/function and robustness/durability of the immune response.</detailed_description>
