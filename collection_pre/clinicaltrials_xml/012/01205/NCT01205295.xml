	<brief_summary>Background: Previous studies have shown that anxiety and dissatisfaction with patient progress are predictors for increased postoperative pain and reduced impact and efficacy of pain treatment. However, it remains to be shown whether patient anxiety and concern are predictors for the perceived quality of patient progress and the perceived efficacy of treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between preoperative anxiety and concern, and the perceived quality and efficacy of postoperative treatment. The hypothesis is that anxious and concerned patients are less satisfied with treatment and have a poorer response of their treatment. Methods/design: This PhD-project consists of four coherent studies. 1) A methodological study evaluating the CMD-SQ (Common Mental Disorder - Screening Questionnaire) questionnaire by a test-retest study. 2) The main study, a prospective follow-up study, has the aim of investigating the correlation between patient anxiety and concern, their perceived quality of patient progress and the perceived efficacy of treatment. This correlation will be detected by means of five questionnaires: CMD-SQ, EQ-5D, SF-12, HVOK, OHS or OSS. 3) A study consisting of an explicit internal medical audit with the aim to investigate whether the medical assessment of patient efficacy of treatment is consistent with their own self-reported efficacy of treatment. 4) An intervention study designed as a randomized clinical trial. The aim is to investigate whether a targeted effort towards patients with a high score of CMD-SQ, i.e. patients with anxiety and concern, can increase their self-reported efficacies of treatment and their perceived quality of progress. A total of 800 hip- and shoulder-patients will be included. Discussion: If a correlation between patient anxiety and concern, their perceived quality of progress and the perceived efficacy of treatment is found, it will be relevant to screen all hip- and shoulder-patients for anxiety and concern preoperatively and deal with this before their operation. This study will provide a proposition of how these patients can be taken care of through cognitive behavioural therapy as a targeted effort towards their anxiety and concern. Aim and hypothesis: The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between patient anxiety and concern, and their perceived quality and efficacy of treatment. The overall hypothesis is that patients who are anxious and concerned are less satisfied with their treatment and have a poorer overall efficacy of their treatment.</brief_summary>
