	<criteria>Healthy volunteers: males, &gt;/=50 and &lt;/= 65 years of age Cancer patients: males &gt;/= 45 years of age Patients had an MRI of the prostate and/or a positive choline or acetate PET/CT for diagnosis (Note: MRI, choline and acetate PET/CT are optional for primary prostate cancer patients) of recurrence prostate cancer and the primary cancer disease is/ will be histologically confirmed. The prostate cancer is histologically confirmed and results of histology are available. Patients with primary prostate cancer: &gt;/= 20 percent of biopsy material should be affected by cancer in the histopathological evaluation. Patients with primary prostate cancer: Patient is scheduled to undergo prostatectomy. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY867548, unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease) which could compromise participation in the study Known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation.</criteria>
