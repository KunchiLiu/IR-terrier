	<brief_summary>The investigators are performing a study to determine whether changes in blood flow occur in the neck and back of the brain following a series of head positions and a manipulation of the upper neck. Each participant will be asked to undergo a series of MRI's to evaluate whether there are any changes in blood flow resulting from any of the head positions or manipulation. The study will be conducted over a period of 1 day and each participant can anticipate the testing to take approximately 120 minutes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Cerebral Blood Flow With Spinal Manipulative Therapy vs. Voluntary Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal is to further investigate the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine positions, including rotation and manipulation in-vivo under clinically relevant circumstances using two advanced forms of MRI technology on the VA and posterior cerebral vessels. According to the knowledge of the investigators, a study utilizing MRI and functional blood oxygen level dependent (fBOLD) imaging to examine blood flow and perfusion, turbulence and evidence of micro-trauma within these vessels has yet to be conducted.</detailed_description>
