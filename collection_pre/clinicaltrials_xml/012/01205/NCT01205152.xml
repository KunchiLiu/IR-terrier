	<brief_title>Extension Study of Protocol ENB-002-08 - Study of Asfotase Alfa in Infants and Young Children With Hypophosphatasia (HPP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asfotase Alfa was formerly referred to as ENB-0040 Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.</detailed_description>
