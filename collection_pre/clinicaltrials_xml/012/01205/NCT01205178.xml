	<brief_summary>SB-252263 (Tafenoquine, TQ) is an 8-aminoquinoline (8-AQ) antimalarial drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). TQ is currently being developed for the radical cure of acute P. vivax malaria in combination with standard doses of CQ, which is 1500 mg over 3 days. The current gold standard for radical cure of P. vivax malaria in many areas of the world is chloroquine (CQ) for clearance of the acute parasitemia immediately followed by primaquine (PQ) to clear the liver stages of the parasite and prevent disease relapse. The 8-AQ class of drugs, including PQ, is hemolytic in subjects with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The current study will identify a dose of TQ within the target efficacious dose range that has a hemolytic effect similar to or less than PQ 15 mg OD x 14 days (i.e. ≤ 25-30% hemoglobin decline in WHO class III G6PD-deficient subjects).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: The subject is between 18 and 45 years of age, inclusive A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is nonpregnant, nonlactating and if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential defined as: Is postmenopausal (12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH &gt;40mIU/mL) Is premenopausal and has had a hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or a bilateral tubal ligation with medical report verification. Childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to comply with one of the following during the treatment stage of the study and for a period of 90 days after stopping study drug: Use of oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone, in combination with a barrier method (e.g., condom or diaphragm) Use of an intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year Double barrier method consisting of spermicide with either condom or diaphragm. Male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual partner for that female Complete abstinence from intercourse for 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug, throughout the study and for a period of 90 days after stopping study drug. A signed and dated informed consent is obtained from the subject or the subject's legal representative prior to screening. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned. WHO class III G6PDdeficiency or G6PDnormal status must be documented by enzyme activity and cytochemical staining. G6PD genotype must confirm WHO class III G6PD deficiency or G6PDnormal status prior to TQ dosing in all parts of the study (i.e., P. vivax infected subjects may commence CQ therapy whilst the cytochemical staining, enzyme activity and G6PD genotype are being determined). Supplemental Inclusion Criteria for Part A: Healthy volunteers Inclusion criteria 17 above AND Subject is female For G6PDdeficient subjects (WHO class III variant), subject must be heterozygous with 4060% normal RBCs by cytochemical staining method. For G6PDnormal subjects, subject must have &gt;90% normal RBCs by cytochemical staining method. Supplemental Inclusion Criteria for Part B: P. vivax patients Inclusion criteria 17 above AND Subject is female Positive blood smear for P. vivax with parasite density &gt;500 and &lt;200,000/µl For G6PDdeficient subjects (WHO class III variant), subject must be heterozygous with 4060% normal RBC by cytochemical staining method. For G6PDnormal subjects, subject must have &gt;90% normal RBCs by cytochemical staining method. Supplemental Inclusion Criteria for Part C: P. vivax patients Inclusion criteria 17 above AND Positive blood smear for P. vivax with parasite density &gt;500 and &lt;200,000/µl For G6PDdeficient subjects (WHO class III variant), subject is a homozygous female or a hemizygous male. For G6PDnormal subjects, subject must have &gt;90% normal RBCs by cytochemical staining method A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: Clinically significant illness (intercurrent illness e.g. pneumonia, preexisting condition e.g. renal disease, malignancy or conditions that may affect absorption of study medication e.g. severe diarrhea or any signs of malnutrition as defined clinically, and clinical signs and symptoms of vascular disease (e.g. cardiac, CNS, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc.). Any clinically relevant biological or physical abnormality found or reported at screening which, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically significant and would preclude safe participation in this study. These abnormalities may be identified on the screening history and physical or laboratory examination, 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Mixed malaria infections by Giemsa smear. Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating or unwilling/unable to comply with recognized contraceptive methods during the treatment stage of the study and for a period of 90 days after stopping study drug. Symptoms of severe vomiting (no food or inability to take food during the previous 8 hours).

History of porphyria History of psoriasis History of allergy to tafenoquine, chloroquine, primaquine, mefloquine or any other 4 or 8aminoquinolines. Subject has taken other antimalarials (e.g., mefloquine, primaquine, chloroquine) within the past 60 days by history.
