	<criteria>BChE deficient subjects: The halflive of AZD8848 in plasma should be more than 20 minutes in an in vitro screening test Matched control subject: The halflive of AZD8848 in plasma should be less than 2 minutes in an in vitro screening test Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, laboratory assessments, vital signs or ECG Present or medical history of cardiovascular disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put subject at risk because of participation in the study or influence the result of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study Family history of autoimmune disease</criteria>
