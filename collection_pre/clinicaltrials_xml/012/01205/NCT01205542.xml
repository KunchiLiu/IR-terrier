	<brief_summary>Basic strength training for the neck/shoulder muscles can decrease intensity of neck/shoulder pain, but it is uncertain whether training should focus directly on the upper trapezius - which is most often tender - or on the lower compartments and serratus anterior. We hypothesize that strengthening exercise for the lower and middle trapezius as well as the serratus anterior will decrease intensity of neck/shoulder pain among office workers</brief_summary>
