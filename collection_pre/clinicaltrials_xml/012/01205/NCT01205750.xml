	<brief_summary>Obesity is associated with dyslipidemia, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol are transported in the system of lipoproteins, and the metabolism of these lipids in plasma is closely interrelated. Evidence suggests that increased concentration of very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) is a central pathophysiological feature of the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in dyslipidemia. The primary objective of this study is to investigate VLDL-TG kinetics and hepatic insulin sensitivity in age-matched obese and lean, healthy men in the postabsorptive state and during acute hyperinsulinemia using VLDL-TG and glucose tracers.</brief_summary>
