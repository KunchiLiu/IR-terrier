	<brief_summary>Intra-uterine insemination (IUI), generally in combination with ovarian stimulation, is one of the most commonly used treatments for infertility. Accurate timing of insemination, in order to coincide with ovulation, has an important impact on the success rate. Optimal timing of insemination is achieved either by monitoring follicular growth through serial ultrasound measurements followed by the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or by the detection of urinary luteinizing hormone (LH). However in cycles where follicular growth is monitored there is a possibility of premature LH rise before the administration of hCG, which may affect the outcome of the treatment. The goal of the study is to determine if adding the testing of urine LH in conjunction with ultrasound monitoring leads to an increase in pregnancy rates in IUI cycles when compared to ultrasound monitoring alone.</brief_summary>
