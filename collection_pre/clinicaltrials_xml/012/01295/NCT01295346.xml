	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if putative brain injury biomarkers have utility as blood-based traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnostic and monitoring tools. This will be accomplished by examining the relationships between potential serum-based TBI biomarkers and clinical measures of injury severity, occurrence of complications, and outcome, in subjects with mild or moderate TBI. The assay will be evaluated in a sample population of subjects over the age of 18 who have been referred to the health care provider for closed head injury evaluation.</brief_summary>
