	<brief_title>Probiotic Lactobacillus Reuteri to Prevent Antibiotic-associated Diarrhea and Clostridium Difficile-related Infections in Hospitalized Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) occurs in up to 25% of all individuals receiving antibiotics (Bartlett, 2002). In hospitalized patients, AAD is related to significant increases in mortality, length of stay, and cost of medical care (McFarland, 2006). Twenty-nine percent of hospitalized patients may develop diarrhoea after antibiotic use; therefore, identifying strategies to minimize antibiotic-associated diarrhoea could be of significant medical and economic advantage (McFarland, 1998). A promising tool in this area is the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri</detailed_description>
