	<detailed_description>In a website-based intervention study, the investigators wish to examine if it is possible to increase physical activity among inactive persons. Main objective is to determine if access to a website with personalized feedback on PA level and suggestions to increase PA results in improvements in self reported PA, anthropometrics and applied physiological measurements. Physical inactive adults (n=12,287) participating in a nationwide health survey and examination (DANHES) were asked to randomly assigned to either intervention (n=6,055) or control group (n=6,232). The intervention group had access to a PA website with personalized advice and suggestions to increase PA. After 3 and 6 months, a follow-up questionnaire was administered by e-mail. The 7-day International Physical Activity Questionnaire was included in the questionnaires to assess four domains of PA in daily-life (work, transportation, domestic, and leisure-time) and sedentary time. Furthermore, at the 3 month follow-up a subgroup of participants (n=1,190) were invited complete anthropometrics and physiological measurements.</detailed_description>
