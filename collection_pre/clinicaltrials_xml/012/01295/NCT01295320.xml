	<brief_summary>The subjects included in this study are subjects that participated in study NCT00434577. These subjects were vaccinated with the candidate Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccine at Month 0 and Month 2 and were then followed at Month 12, Month 24 and Month 36 (study NCT00434577) for safety and immunogenicity. This long term follow up study (ZOSTER-024 [114825]) will evaluate immune responses to and safety of the previously administered candidate HZ vaccine at Months 48, 60 and 72. The study visits will be scheduled at approximately one year intervals after the first visit in ZOSTER-024. Blood samples for the evaluation of cellular and humoral immunity will be taken from all subjects at each visit. Information on safety and the occurrence of HZ will also be collected during these visits.</brief_summary>
