	<brief_title>Natural History of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infections in Mid-Adult Women (WHIM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a longitudinal study of 500 women in order to determine rates and risk factors for HPV infections in 30-50 year old women. Participants will be followed for 6 months and will be asked to complete online questionnaires on their health, sexual behavior, HPV vaccinations, and cervical cancer screening. The investigators will ask participants to self-collect monthly vaginal swab samples and self-collect 2 oral swab samples. Women will also be asked to provide 2 blood samples. All swab samples will be tested for type-specific HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, blood samples will be tested for HPV antibodies.</detailed_description>
