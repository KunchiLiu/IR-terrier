	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine if vulvar (external female genitalia) pain is decreased with emu oil over a similar placebo oil (no active ingredient) by using measurement devices, examinations, and questionnaires. Topical emu oil has not been scientifically studied for this condition yet, but related reports show no significant side effects or potential benefits. A total of 30 women will participate in the study at William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak.</brief_summary>
