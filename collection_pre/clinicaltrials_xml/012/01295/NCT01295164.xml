	<brief_summary>The instrument that will be used in the study is the Murcia monocular Adaptive Optics Visual simulator (AOVIS-I). The system provides an objective characterization of the optical quality of the patient's eye by application of wave-front sensing technology. The optical condition of every eye is represented by its wave aberration. This characterization overcomes the current description based only in refractive errors. This provides an accurate description of the optics of the eye based on the assessment of the whole set of ocular aberrations. The particular wave-front sensor is of a Hartmann-Shack type. One characteristics of this wave-front sensor is its high dynamic range allowing measuring highly aberrated eyes, such as patients with keratoconus.</brief_summary>
