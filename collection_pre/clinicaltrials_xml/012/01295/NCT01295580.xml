	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Safety and Efficacy of Two Hyaluronic Acids for the Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial using a non-inferiority comparison to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intra-articular injection of Durolane® vs Artz® in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Durolane or Artz. All subjects will be followed up for 26 weeks from the initial treatment.The screening period is expected to be up to 2 weeks in duration before the baseline visit. Each subject will provide a written informed consent and undergo a qualifying screening. Assessment at screening will include postero-anterior view of standing weight-bearing semi-flexed radiographs of the study knee. The OA changes of the study knee will be graded 0,1,2,3 or 4 according to the Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic scoring criteria. Radiographic assessment will be made by an assigned and well trained investigator at each study center. The study knee and contralateral knee will use the Likert WOMAC 5-point scoring for pain assessment. Physical examination of the knees and vital signs will be performed (this examination will be repeated at end).</detailed_description>
