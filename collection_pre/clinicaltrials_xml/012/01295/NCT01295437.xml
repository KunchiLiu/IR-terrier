	<brief_summary>Chronic pain may be a long-term problem after inguinal Lichtenstein hernioplasty. The aim of this study was to compare long-term results of hernioplasty using three different meshes (partly absorbable, lightweight polypropylene and thick polypropylene mesh).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Meshes in Lichtenstein Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernioplasty was performed under local anesthesia in 300 patients in day-case surgery by the same surgeon and exactly by the same surgical technique. The patients were randomized to receive either a partly polypropylene-polyglactin mesh (Vypro II, 100 hernias), a lightweight polypropylene mesh (Premilene LP, 100 hernias) or a conventional densely woven polypropylene mesh (Premilene, 100 hernias). Pain, patients discomfort and recurrences of hernias were carefully followed 5 years after surgery.</detailed_description>
