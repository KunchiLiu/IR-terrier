	<brief_summary>Constipation following elective Caesarean sections (CS) is a common problem experienced by up to 50% of patients (1). The causes for this are multifactorial and include manipulation of the bowel during surgery, immobilisation and opiate based anaesthetic and analgesic techniques. To try to alleviate the problem of postoperative constipation, some anaesthetists prescribe postoperative lactulose in addition to postoperative analgesia, although no data exists that shows whether this has any beneficial effect on postoperative constipation. 1.
