	<brief_title>Androgenetic Alopecia in Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: To test the hypothesis that adult males with classic form of Fabry disease have a significantly lower incidence of androgenic alopecia than matched controls. Study Population: 120 patients aged 20-64 with Fabry disease that have GLA mutations or alpha-galactosidase A activity associated with no residual enzyme activity and non-Fabry male controls of the same age range and the same number of non-Fabry controls. Design: This is a cross-sectional study comparing the prevalence of androgenic alopecia in two groups of subjects. Outcome Measures: The levels of the outcome will be no androgenic alopecia and frontal only androgenetic alopecia opposed to vertex only and frontal and vertex androgenetic alopecia.</detailed_description>
