	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that consumption of a low calorie cranberry beverage imparts a favorable impact on HDL cholesterol, LDL oxidation, and cell adhesion molecules in men. However, these studies were not well controlled. Thus, it is important to confirm these effects in a blinded, placebo-controlled feeding study. The investigators goal is to verify the cardioprotective effects of cranberries by conducting a dietary intervention trial with healthy subjects in a controlled environment.</brief_summary>
