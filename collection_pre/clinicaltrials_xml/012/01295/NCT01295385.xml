	<brief_summary>Diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy is then retained, supposing a change in the coronary microcirculation linked to an endothelial dysfunction. Abnormalities of the myocardial metabolism is frequently associated. It is regrettably about a hypothesis difficult to verify with current medical techniques.This deficiency being not only harmful to the diagnosis, but also to the assessment of the efficiency of the medical treatment on the myocardial metabolism and the endothelial function. Techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance offer interesting perspectives.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>These techniques allow in this context: 1. to quantify the myocardial blood flow at rest and after "cold pressor test" in a population of healthy volunteers. The myocardial blood flow will be obtained by estimating myocardial blood flow at the venous coronary sinus site. This allows us to quantify a possible endothelial dysfunction in a reproducible way. No MRI study in diabetic patients has ever been led until now with this technique. 2. to estimate the metabolic and structural abnormalities in this population, with particularly: - Quantification of the myocardial metabolism in vivo by spectrometry of phosphorus 31. - Structural abnormalities: become integrated into the description of diabetic cardiomyopathy.</detailed_description>
