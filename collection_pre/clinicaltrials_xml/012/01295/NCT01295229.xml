	<brief_summary>The escalating pandemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the most significant contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery causes profound weight loss and dramatically ameliorates T2DM through mechanisms beyond just weight loss, but its role in diabetes management and the nature of its weight-independent anti-diabetes effects are not well established because of a paucity of appropriate randomized trials, the execution of which is hindered by numerous obstacles. The investigators therefore propose a feasibility study to demonstrate our capacity to identify, recruit, randomize, and track outcomes for 40 adult Group Health members identified as having T2DM and a BMI between 30-40 kg/m2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calorie Reduction Or Surgery: Seeking Remission for Obesity And Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of the research study is to demonstrate our capacity to identify, recruit, randomize, and track outcomes for 40 adult Group Health members identified as having T2DM and a BMI between 30-40 kg/m2. Our cohort recruitment strategy will utilize the GH administrative and clinical databases to identify patients with T2DM and a BMI of 30-40 kg/m2. Sufficient numbers (N=4,000) of these individuals will be mailed and surveyed to identify the small minority without strong preferences regarding medical vs. surgical diabetes/obesity treatment. This subset will be invited to become better informed about both strategies using a novel, standardized patient decision aid for shared decision making (SDM) related to bariatric surgery: a high-quality educational video that provides balanced and frequently updated information about the risks and benefits of surgical and non-surgical care. After viewing SDM tool, potential subjects' "willingness to randomize" will be assessed, and a subset of willing patients will actually undergo randomization to either RYGB or a state-of-the-art intensive but reproducible medical/lifestyle intervention. Forty patients will be randomized to either RYGB or an intensive medical/lifestyle intervention. Twenty members will be randomly assigned to intensive behavioral/medical treatment, and twenty will be randomly assigned to receive gastric bypass surgery. In the non-surgical group, the investigators will study the feasibility and resources needed to deploy a state-of-the-art intensive behavioral intervention to promote weight loss, which includes dietary and exercise components. It will be coupled with diabetes pharmacotherapy treatment consistent with Group Health Clinical Practice Guidelines (http://incontext.ghc.org/clinical/clin_topics/diabetes2/dm2_poc.html). Patients randomized to the surgical arm will undergo a standard laparoscopic proximal RYGB, as commonly practiced by GH surgeons. The operation and post-operative care will be performed at GH by Dr. Steven Bock, Dr. Jeffery Lander, and their clinical staff, including a team of nutritionists and a Registered Nurse Case Manager who coordinates the care of patients in the GH Bariatric Surgery Program. Surgical patients will also undergo a standardized 8-week pre-operative and 10-month post-operative behavioral treatment regimen with the GH Bariatric Surgery Program. Participants will have follow-up research visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization, where they will have the following measurements: standardized physically exam by Dr. Foster-Schubert; weight, waist and hip circumferences; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; resting 1-minute pulse; and fasting (12-hour) blood (50 ml) collection.</detailed_description>
