	<brief_summary>Linezolid is the first approved synthetic oxazolidinone that is active against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Because of its significant efficacy, linezolid is widely used in clinical treatment. However, the side effects of linezolid commonly lead to anemia and thrombocytopenia. This hematological toxic effects limit its prolonged used. The investigators have found that Vitamin B6 application, as a preventive, auxiliary therapy, can relieve anemia and thrombocytopenia. The present study was designed to verify the effects of Vitamin B6 in the prevention of linezolid-associated cytopenias and investigate its mechanism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin B6 on Relieving Linezolid-associated Cytopenias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infected patients receiving linezolid therapy are divided into two groups, i.e. the linezolid group and the linezolid + vitamin B6 group, the line of division being whether vitamin B6 is to be applied or not in the course of treatment. The purpose is to evaluate the role that vitamin B6 plays, during the process of linezolid therapy, in the relief of erythropenia and cytopenias.</detailed_description>
