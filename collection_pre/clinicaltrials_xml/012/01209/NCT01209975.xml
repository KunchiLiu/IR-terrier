	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess retinal blood flow and vascular reactivity in patients with newly diagnosed primary open angle glaucoma pre- and post-primary Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty(SLT). Canon Laser Blood Flowmeter will be used for the assessment of retinal blood flow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retinal Vascular Reactivity in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Glaucoma Before and After Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We previously found that vascular reactivity improved after short term treatment with dorzolamide drops. It is not clear whether this improvement was a direct effect of the medication or secondary effect of the decrease in IOP. We would like to see the change of vascular reactivity before and after SLT, which will decrease the intraocular pressure without pharmacologic effect.</detailed_description>
