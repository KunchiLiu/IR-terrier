	<brief_title>Study of the BiTE® Blinatumomab (MT103) in Adult Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL in adult patients is an aggressive malignant disease with dismal prognosis and unmet medical need. Additional therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Blinatumomab is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct designed to link B cells and T cells resulting in T cell activation and a cytotoxic T cell response against CD19 expressing cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of different doses of the bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab in adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. Patrticipants will receive up to five 4-week cycles of intravenous blinatumomab treatment.</detailed_description>
