	<brief_summary>Exercise training in patients with coronary artery disease is able to correct several risk factors. Furthermore endothelial function can be improved. There are some hinds for improved collateral circulation after exercise training, nevertheless there is no study showing significant improvement/ increase in coronary collaterals. This might be due to technique of collateral measurement. Therefore we conduct a study were coronary blod flow before and after 4 weeks of exercise training were measured.</brief_summary>
