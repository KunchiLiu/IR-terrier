	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, parallel design study in elderly primary insomnia patients and demographically matched controls. The objectives if this study are primarily: 1. To determine if functional deficits in simulated driving performance can be demonstrated in primary insomnia patients, and detected in healthy volunteers, impaired by alcohol; and secondarily: 2. To compare simulated driving performance deficits in elderly primary insomnia patients to those in healthy elderly volunteers impaired by alcohol, for at least one of the following driving endpoints: standard deviation of lane position (SDLP), standard deviation of speed (speed deviation), lane excursions, and a driving composite score.</brief_summary>
