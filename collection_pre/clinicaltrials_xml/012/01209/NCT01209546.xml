	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of FLUTTER® VRP1 (PEP and Oscillating High Frequency).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis is an airway disease with many etiologies characterized pathologically by the abnormal permanent dilatation of bronchi, caused mainly by the perpetuation of inflammatory processes induced by frequent episodes of bacterial infections, with consequent change in the ciliated epithelial lining and compromising the effectiveness of mucociliary clearance that can favor the hypersecretive state found in these patients. In addition to drug therapy or surgical treatment, patients with bronchiectasis also have physiotherapy, which is an important part in treatment. The patients present impaired mucus transport, and can enjoy the benefits provided by respiratory therapy, which features intended to increase the removal of airway secretions and thus reduce the obstruction to improve ventilation and oxygenation. One of the instruments commonly used in respiratory therapy is the Flutter ® VRP1 (VarioRaw SA, Switzerland), which is a simple equipment, small, similar to a pipe that combines two techniques: positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and high-frequency oscillations. Some previous studies have shown beneficial effects after use of this device in patients with bronchiectasis. However, it is unclear whether the mechanism of action is related to the combination of PEP and the techniques of high frequency oscillation, or just one of those components.</detailed_description>
