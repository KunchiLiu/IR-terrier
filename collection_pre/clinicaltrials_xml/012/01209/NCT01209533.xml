	<brief_title>Inhaled Iloprost in Mild Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal studies have suggested that prostacyclin may downregulate allergic inflammation, thus providing the scientific basis for trials of inhaled prostacyclin agonists such as iloprost for the treatment of asthma. This study will examine the tolerability of four times daily iloprost on asthma symptoms and pulmonary function over a two week treatment period.</detailed_description>
