	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of a cancer vaccine that can be given to patients with asymptomatic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). The safety of this vaccine is also being studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy for Asymptomatic Phase Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Vaccine: The cancer vaccine used in this study is made from DNA (the genetic material of cells). The vaccine is designed to increase your immune system's ability to react against lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Making the Vaccine: About 12 months are needed to make this vaccine from your tumor. Although a lot of effort will be used to try to make the vaccine for each participant, researchers are not always successful. Researchers cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive a vaccine. Baseline Procedures: The following tests and procedures will be performed within 4 weeks before starting the vaccine: - Your medical history will be recorded (+/- 2 days). - You will have a physical exam (+/- 2 days). - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant. To take part in this study, you must not be pregnant. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. This urine will be collected over a 24-hour period. You will be provided with a container for urine collection. Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level based on when you start the study. If you are one of the first 3 participants, you will receive a lower dose of the vaccine. If that dose level is found to be safe, all other participants will receive a higher dose of vaccine. Once the vaccine is ready (about 12 months), you may receive up to 3 vaccines, given one month apart. The vaccine will be given using a needle free injection device that works by delivering the vaccine through your skin. Each dose of vaccine will be split between 5 separate injections. You will no longer be able to take the vaccine if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. Your participation on this study will be complete 1 year after your last vaccination. Study Visits: During the study, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. These tests and procedures are part of regular cancer care; however, they will be done more often while you are in this study. In the 7 days before the first vaccine, if your doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. Within 2 days before each vaccine: - Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. This urine will be collected over a 24-hour period. You will be provided with a container for urine collection. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for immune system disorders. On the day you receive your vaccine: - You will have a physical exam. - You will be asked how you are feeling. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking. At 4 and 8 weeks, blood (2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check how your immune system responds to the vaccines. At 4 weeks after your last vaccination: - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check how your immune system responds to the vaccines. - You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. About 4 weeks after your last vaccination, and then every 2 month for 1 year: - Your medical history will be recorded. - You will have a physical exam. - You will be asked how you are feeling. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. This urine will be collected over a 24-hour period. You will be provided with a container for urine collection. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for immune system disorders. About 4 months after your last vaccination, and then every 4 months for 1 year, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check how your immune system responds to the vaccines. About 4 weeks after your last vaccination, and then every 6 months for 1 year, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. This is an investigational study. The vaccine is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Up to 12 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
