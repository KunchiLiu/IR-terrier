	<brief_title>GSK1322322 Versus Linezolid in the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, double dummy study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of GSK1322322 when given as 1500mg twice daily over a 10-day period versus linezolid (600mg twice daily for 10 days) in adults with suspected Gram positive Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection who are not currently receiving antibacterial therapy. Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to GSK1322322 or linezolid. This study consists of a screening visit, a 10-day treatment period, and follow-up evaluations 7 and 28 days following the last dose.</detailed_description>
