	<criteria>Histologic documentation of incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid malignancy that has failed to respond to at least one prior regimen or for which there is no standard therapy Documented negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and use of two forms of contraception. Contraception must be used while the patient is enrolled in the study and for 12 months after the patient discontinues from the study. For men with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a latex condom and to advise their female partner to use an additional method of contraception during the study and for 3 months after their last dose of GDC0449. Agreement not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 12 months after their last dose of GDC0449 For male patients, agreement not to donate sperm during the study and for at least 3 months after their last dose of GDC0449 Adequate hematopoietic capacity Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function At least 3 weeks since the patient's last chemotherapy, investigational agent, radiation therapy, or major surgical procedure and recovery to pretreatment baseline or stabilization of all treatmentrelated toxicities Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics Clinically important history of liver disease significantly impairing hepatic function, including active viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Any medical condition or diagnosis that would likely impair absorption of an orally administered drug Pregnant or lactating Treatment with excluded medications, including strong CYP450 inhibitors and inducers, within 2 weeks of study entry Male patients already receiving rosiglitazone Male patients with a known contraindication to rosiglitazone Female patients already receiving oral contraception &lt; 14 days prior to Day 1 Female patients with known contraindication to oral contraceptions</criteria>
