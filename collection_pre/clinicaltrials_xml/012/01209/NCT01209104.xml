	<brief_summary>GSK1325756 is a potent, competitive, selective and reversible CXCR2 receptor antagonist that is being developed as a once-daily oral anti-inflammatory medication for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Selective antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its various chemokine ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the underlying inflammation in COPD via the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and activation. The current study explores the effects of age, gender and food (high fat meal) on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1325756. Because a significant proportion of COPD subjects are prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPI's) such as omeprazole in order to alleviate symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), it is important to understand the absorption of the current formulation of GSK1325756 in an environment of raised intra-gastric pH as will be encountered in patients taking PPI's. Therefore, this study will also evaluate the impact of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1325756.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives. However, subjects taking a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 3 months prior to enrollment may be included if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives. In all cases, subjects should have a resting BP of 140/90 irrespective of antihypertensive medication status. Subjects taking a stable dose of lipid lowering medications (statins or fibrates) for at least 3 months prior to enrollment may be included if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives. 2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) more than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. 3. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until least 3months postlast dose of study drug. 4. Body weight more than or equal to 60 kg (110 lbs) for men and more than or equal to 45 kg (99lbs) for women and BMI within the range 1932 kg/m2 inclusive. 5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. 6. Willingness to complete all study procedures and complete all planned treatment periods and follow up assessments. 7.12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the Investigator, and average QTcB or QTcF less than 450 msec 8.AST and ALT less than 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin more than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%). 1. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening 2. A neutrophil count at screening of less than 2 x 109/L 3. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). 4. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. 5. A positive test for HIV antibody. 6. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of more than 14 drinks for males or more than 7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits. 7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). 8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. 9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures,s compromise subject safety, or interfere with the objectives of the study. All concomitant medications should be queried with the GSK Medical Monitor. 10. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. 11. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. 12. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or prior to dosing. 13. Lactating females. 14. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. 15. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. 16. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. 17. Urinary cotinine/ exhaled breath CO levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. 18. Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication.</criteria>
