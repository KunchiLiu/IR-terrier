	<brief_summary>This study intended to investigate and compare the changes that may occur in response to cryolipolysis (localized cool exposure) and subcision (surgical technique) on cellulite. The cryolipolysis cooling device used is FDA approved for skin cooling, but still investigational in the treatment of cellulite. It has previously been used for fat reduction on love handles or back fat. During cryolipolysis, the system drew fat tissue into an applicator then exposes the extracted fat tissue to cold temperatures. The cold exposure caused fat cells to die, with the goal to decrease the raised areas of cellulite. Subcision is a process used to treat scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases and has been noted to improve moderate to severe cellulite. Subcision is a simple surgical procedure that is performed by inserting a specially designed needle under the skin after local numbing medication is injected. The needle is moved in a repetitive motion parallel to the skin to separate the surface tissue from the deeper scar tissue with the goal to improve the dimpling caused by these tissues sticking together. This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.</brief_summary>
