	<brief_summary>The objective of this post-marketing study is to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety outcome of treatment with ChondroMimetic in a patient population within the proposed indication (osteochondral cartilage defects), over a 36 months post-implantation follow-up period. The primary objective is to collect post-marketing safety data in a real life setting by means of (S)ADR reporting. The secondary objectives are: - Clinical outcome as assessed by patient reported EuroQoL-5D - Structural repair as assessed by MRI - The number of treatment failures and the time to treatment failure - The ease of use of ChondroMimetic as reported by the surgeon</brief_summary>
