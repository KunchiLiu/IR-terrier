	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled trial will compare strategies to reduce the risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and re-hospitalization in MRSA carriers. This trial will provide critical answers about the role of decolonization versus standard-of-care education in preventing MRSA infections in the large group of high risk MRSA-positive patients being discharged from hospitals. Findings could potentially impact best practice for the 1.8 million MRSA carriers who are discharged from US hospitals each year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial will compare strategies to reduce the risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and re-hospitalization in MRSA carriers. This trial will provide critical answers about the role of decolonization versus standard-of-care education in preventing MRSA infections in the large group of high risk MRSA+ patients being discharged from hospitals. Findings could potentially impact best practice for the 1.8 million MRSA carriers who are discharged from US hospitals each year. Specific Aims: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is arguably the most important single pathogen in healthcare-associated infection when accounting for virulence, prevalence, diversity of disease spectrum, and propensity for widespread transmission. MRSA infection causes or complicates 300,000 hospitalizations each year [Klein, Smith, Laxminarayan], a number which has doubled in the past five years. An additional 1.5 million hospitalized patients either acquire or already harbor the pathogen without current infection. Altogether, these 1.8 million MRSA inpatient carriers experience a high amount of MRSA invasive disease in the year following discharge. Due to increased delivery of complex medical care at home or other post-hospital settings, more and more patients experience serious healthcare-associated morbidity after hospital discharge.[Huang, Platt; Huang, Hinrichsen, Stulgis et al.] In fact, over 80% of patients admitted for MRSA infection have had prior healthcare exposures and are at high risk for repeated MRSA infection.[Huang, Platt; Huang, Hinrichsen, Stulgis et al.; Klevens, Morrison, Nadle, et al.] Project CLEAR compares two strategies to reduce infection and re-hospitalization due to MRSA among patients being discharged from hospitals. Our trial will compare a long-term regimen aimed at eradicating MRSA body reservoirs with patient education on general hygiene and self care, which is the current standard of care. Our specific aims are: - To conduct a randomized controlled trial of serial decolonization versus standard-of-care patient education among MRSA carriers upon hospital discharge to reduce post-discharge MRSA infection and re-hospitalization for one year - To identify predictors of a) infection or re-hospitalization due to MRSA, and b) successful MRSA decolonization, including patient demographics, comorbidities, medical devices, risk behaviors, socioeconomic status, and colonizing MRSA genotype - To estimate medical and non-medical costs of MRSA infection among MRSA carriers and evaluate the potential for cost savings associated with decolonization</detailed_description>
