	<brief_summary>Currently, no clear consensus exists regarding the effect of epidural anesthesia upon breast-feeding. In theory, epidurals may increase breast-feeding failure via inadequate maternal milk production, deficiencies in neonatal neurobehavior, or both, but most studies have failed to separate these potential mechanisms. The present study examines whether epidural duration correlates with 1) likelihood of breast-feeding at hospital discharge and 2) neonatal neurobehavioral deficits in feeding, as measured by the L&amp;A components of the standardized, validated LATCH scoring system.</brief_summary>
