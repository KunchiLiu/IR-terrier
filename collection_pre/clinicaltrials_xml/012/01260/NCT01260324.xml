	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate the natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); (2) estimate the population incidence of NAION; and (3) identify potential risk factors for NAION.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology Study of Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population consisted of members of the Ingenix Normative Health Informatics (NHI) Database during 01/01/2003 through 12/31/2007, who were 18 years of age or older with at least 183 days of continuous enrollment in the database and without any doctor visits associated with a diagnosis of ischemic optic neuropathy during the 183 days prior to cohort entry. From the study population, patients with a claim associated with an ischemic optic neuropathy diagnosis code were identified as potential NAION cases (n = 3,732). From the potential NAION cases, definite and possible NAION cases were identified using medical record review and a claims algorithm (n=1,283). From the study population, patients without a claim associated with an ischemic optic neuropathy diagnosis code were randomly selected as controls (n = 20,000)</detailed_description>
