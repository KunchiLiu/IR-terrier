	<brief_summary>The present study "Continuum of care for frail elderly people" form part of the research programme "Support for frail elderly persons - from prevention to palliation" (www.vardalinstitutet.net) which comprises research into three interventions. The program comprises interventions addressing frail elderly people in different phases of the disablement process, from elderly people who are beginning to develop frailty to very frail elderly people receiving palliative care. The intervention "Continuum of care for frail elderly people" addresses elderly people who are frail and that have a great risk of high health care consumption. The hypothesis is that an intervention program for frail elderly people can reduce the number of visits to the emergency department, increase the life satisfaction and maintain the functional ability. The intervention, including an early geriatric assessment at the emergency department, early family support, a case manager in the community with a multi-professional team and active follow-up by the case manager, contributes to early recognition of the elderly people's need of information, care and rehabilitation and of informal caregivers' need of information. It enhances the transfer of information and integrates the care between different caregivers and different care levels, thereby better recognize frail elderly people's needs. Specifically, this study is expected to show that the intervention has a positive effect on the frail elderly person's functional ability, life satisfaction, satisfaction with health and social care, and health care consumption.</brief_summary>
