	<brief_summary>Altitude tolerance correlates with the level of oxygenation achieved. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether increased expiratory pressure within the thorax is able to improve oxygenation during hypoxic hypoxia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two types of procedures will be tested in a random order, interspaced by resting periods : threshold PEEP set at 5,10 and 15 cm of water and pursed leap breathing. Subjects will be tested at rest, and during light exercise (30% of sea level predicted VO2max). FiO2 will be set at 12.5% (4000 m). fc, VE, PETCO2, TA, ECG, cardiac output, and tissular oxygenation will be monitored.</detailed_description>
