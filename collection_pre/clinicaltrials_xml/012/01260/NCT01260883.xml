	<brief_summary>Infants handle ketorolac differently than adults. Study of handling of this pain medication given to infants following surgery. Detailed analysis of how the drug is eliminated from age 2 months to 18 months. Compared morphine use in infants who received the drug to the group getting placebo. Safety testing for kidney and liver function, breathing measured by continuous oximetry, and any bleeding issues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketorolac in Postoperative Infants: Pharmacokinetics and Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population kinetic analysis of ketorolac stereo-isomer concentrations after single dose given postoperatively in infants aged 2-18 months. Safety assessments of renal and hepatic function tests by blood tests before and after drug administration, urinalysis pre- and post-drug, continuous oximetry before and for 12 hours after drug. Morphine use between active drug groups and placebo group in the first 24 hours after surgery was assessed as a surrogate analgesic measure in these non-verbal infants. A modified infant pain scale was used to assure consistent pain management.</detailed_description>
