	<brief_summary>In current radiation therapy, imaging (typically, cone beam CT imaging or two orthogonal X-ray projection imaging) is done for patient setup before radiation dose delivery. Dose delivery typically takes 2 to 5 minutes depending on the delivery technique used for treatment. A tumor target may change its position during the dose delivery process. The goal of this project is develop a real-time imaging strategy to monitor the tumor position during dose delivery and evaluate its potential clinical impact.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The study population will be drawn from available patient population that will be treated using IMRT/VMAT. The Stanford population of IMRT/VMAT will be taken as roughly representative of prospective IMRT patients and will not be subdivided by any additional characteristics.
