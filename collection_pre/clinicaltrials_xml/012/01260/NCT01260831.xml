	<brief_title>Evaluating Processes of Care &amp; the Outcomes of Children in Hospital (EPOCH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Bedside Paediatric Early Warning System (Bedside PEWS) is a scientifically developed documentation-based system of care designed to identify children who are clinically deteriorating while admitted to hospital inpatient wards. It was developed and validated by the applicants. The investigators have preliminary data demonstrating that the Bedside PEWS addresses multiple factors (communication, hierarchy, secondary review) contributing to delayed treatment of children at risk. In our pilot study of implementation at a single site the investigators showed statistically significant reductions in late transfers, 'stat' calls, decreased apprehension when nurses called physicians to review patients, and improved communication. Our preliminary data show that the Bedside PEWS score is superior to other methods being used to identify children at risk for impending cardiopulmonary arrest. A 2-year cluster-randomized trial will evaluate the impact of Bedside PEWS on clinical outcomes, processes of care and resource utilization in 22 paediatric hospitals.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>For Hospitals: provide care for more than 200 inpatient admissions aged &lt;18 years and &gt;37 weeks gestational age in eligible inpatient wards each year have specialised paediatric physicians (including paediatricians, paediatric surgeons, other paediatric subspecialists) and, one or more intensive care unit (PICU) that provides care for children. A PICU is a designated, staffed area for prolonged mechanical ventilation, invasive monitoring and circulatory support for children including but not limited to neonates. Other areas designated for patients of increased acuity, such as 'constant observation' or 'high dependency' or 'stepdown' units will be regarded as part of the PICU where the PICU staff physicians are wholly or jointly responsible for the care of children in these areas (can write orders in the chart). may or may not have a METRRT for children. A METRRT is defined as an identified team of one or more trained healthcare professionals who report to an on service PICU physician, and perform urgent consultations on hospital inpatients. For inpatient wards: areas where care is provided to patients who are admitted to the hospital, other than PICU, operating rooms, and other designated areas where anaesthetistsupervised procedures are performed. All eligible inpatient wards will participate in the study. For patients: Within eligible hospitals we will study patients older than 37 weeks gestational age and less than 18 years who are admitted to eligible inpatient wards, who receive care in an eligible inpatient area during the study. For hospitals: have plans to introduce a new 'medical emergency team' during the study, and where a severity of illness score (Brighton, Cardiff, PEWS, Bedside PEWS or other unpublished score) is used in ward areas hospitals where randomization is not deemed acceptable. These exclusion criteria ensure that major system changes including introduction of METRRT, new documentation systems, physician staffing, and hospital capacity will not bias results. For patients: those who are less than 37 weeks gestational age throughout their hospitalization are cared for exclusively in an NICU children who are admitted directly to a PICU and die before PICU discharge and thus have not received care in an eligible inpatient ward</criteria>
