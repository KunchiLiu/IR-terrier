	<brief_summary>Objective: At present, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials are analyzed only in the time domain. A technique to evaluate this potential in the frequency domain could provide more information, but has only been applied within the last year. Design and Study Sample: In this study we recorded vestibular evoked myogenic potential in the time domain, in 156 ears of 78 normal-hearing young adults, at frequencies of 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz, with intensity of 90 dB nHL. Next, the steady state vestibular evoked myogenic potential was recorded at the same carrying frequencies, modulated at 20, 37, 40, 43, 70, 77 and 80 Hz. Results: The responses found by modulated frequency, regardless of carrier, recorded a higher presence of peaks and mean amplitudes between 20 and 70 Hz, especially at 40 Hz. Conclusions: The results show that the observation technique in the frequency domain is feasible and shows a strong association with the time domain for recording vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, at carrying frequencies of 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 Hz.</brief_summary>
