	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to determine if smoking will influence the platelet aggregation inhibition ability of clopidogrel and prasugrel. It will also determine if smoking has any effect on the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of prasugrel and the active and inactive metabolites of clopidogrel. The primary hypothesis is that smoking status will influence the antiplatelet effects and active metabolite concentrations of clopidogrel but will have no impact on prasugrel's antiplatelet effects or active metabolite concentrations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of Smoking Status on Prasugrel and Clopidogrel Treated Subjects Taking Aspirin and Having Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be stratified according to smoking status prior to being randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences: prasugrel 10 mg daily for 10 days followed by clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 10 days or clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 10 days followed by prasugrel 10 mg daily for 10 days. There will be a 14-day Washout Period between Active Treatment Period 1 (when subjects receive the first drug of the sequence) and the second Active Treatment Period 2 (Period 3) (when subjects receive the second drug of the sequence). All subjects will remain on the same dose of aspirin from baseline throughout the study.</detailed_description>
