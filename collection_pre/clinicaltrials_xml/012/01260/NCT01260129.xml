	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of QD Versus BID Silodosin With Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Suggestive of BPH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silodosin is a highly selective α1A-adrenoceptor antagonist for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH. 4mg Silodosin twice daily has been approved in Asia including Japan and Korea. In US, 8mg Silodosin once daily with the FDA approval is already available. Korea has newly adopted 8mg Silodosin once daily.
