	<brief_title>Open Label, Single Dose, Non-randomized Study to Assess the Drug to Drug Interaction of Briakinumab on CYP Substrates.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study does involve 3 days confinement at the beginning of the trial and 4 days at the end of the trial. The trial duration is 17 days with 6 visits not including the confinement periods. The trial is being conducted in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis subjects.
