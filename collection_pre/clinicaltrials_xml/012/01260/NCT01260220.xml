	<brief_summary>An isolation-limited segmental antral approach to pulmonary vein isolation is as effective in achieving long-term freedom from atrial fibrillation as the standard anatomic, circumferential antral ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Segmental Versus Circumferential Antral Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled non-inferiority designed trial. Follow up: Patients will stop their anti-arrhythmic drugs 2 months post procedure. Follow-ups will involve clinical assessment, holter and/or loop recorders at 3, 6, 9, and 12 month intervals.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) for at least 6 months with at least 1 symptomatic episode during the previous 6 moths Patient must be felt to be candidates for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) ablation based on AF that is symptomatic and refractory or intolerant to at least one class 1 or 3 antiarrhythmic agent Documentation of at least one episode of AF on 12 lead ECG, TTM or Holter monitor within 12 months of randomization in the trial Patient must be on continuous anticoagulation with warfarin (INR 23) or fractionated subcutaneous heparin for &gt;4 weeks prior to the ablation or they have undergone a recent (less than 48 hours before planned ablation) transoesphageal echocardiogram to exclude left atrial thrombus. Patient must provide written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial Contraindications to oral anticoagulants History of any previous ablation for AF Intracardiac thrombus AF due to reversible causes Pregnancy atriotomy scar (typically, MV or TV repair/replacement, ASD surgery, transplants)(CABG are okay)</criteria>
