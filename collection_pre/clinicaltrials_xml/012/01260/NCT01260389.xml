	<brief_title>Pharmaceutical Care for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective pharmacologic management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) not only involves prescription of recommended medicines by the physician, but also implies correct use of the prescribed medication by the patient (ie, good drug adherence and correct inhalation technique). Community pharmacists could help to improve the latter aspect, by delivering pharmaceutical care. The present randomised controlled trial will study the hypothesis that a pharmaceutical care intervention would result in an improved drug adherence and inhalation technique in COPD patients over a 3 month-period.</detailed_description>
