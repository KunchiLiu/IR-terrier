	<brief_summary>Dr. Sherie Novotny of the Department of Psychiatry at UMDNJ-RWJMS and collaborators are starting a treatment trial to determine whether Docosa Hexanoic Acid(DHA), the major omega-3 fatty acid found in the brain and a component of fish oil, has any effects on the symptoms of autism. We propose to carry out a trial to test the effect of DHA compared to a placebo (a pill with no drug in it) on several aspects of autism in children and adolescents, in a 12-week clinical study with children or adolescents in the age group of 5-17 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Additionally this trial will study genes related to the therapeutic agent, DHA, and biomarkers related to DHA in the urine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growing evidence supports oxidative stress may contribute to autism. Docosa Hexanoic Acid(DHA)is a normal substance that is present in large amounts in the brain and can be used by the body to produce natural antioxidants. Our hope is that supplementing DHA in individuals with autism may improve some aspects of their functioning. Specifically our aims are: Aim 1. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on the global severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder, via a 12-week double blind placebo-controlled parallel study. Global severity will be assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and additionally in younger children by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Aim 2. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on behavioral symptoms and functional ability in children with autism. Assessment will be by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Community Version11. Aim 3. To develop an improved protocol and study design based upon these studies for future large scale studies of DHA in the autistic population. Aim 4. Monitor the effects of therapy on the isoprostane biomarker. Aim 5: Develop additional biomarkers that correlate with autism and with therapy. We will extend the analyses to neuroprostanes and resolvins. We will measure: (i) Urinary excretion of the isoprostane metabolites, 2,3 Dinor-5,6 dihydro-PGF2t and iPF4Î±-VI. (ii) DHA derived resolvins D2, D4, D5 and D6 and neuroprotectin. Aim 6: Confirm our preliminary results by correlating increased isoprostane excretion with GSTM1*0 copy number in individuals with autism. Aim 7: In the same way, correlate GSTM1*0 copy number with response to therapy assessed by diminution of isoprostane excretion during therapy. Aim 8: Study additional biomarkers developed through Hypothesis #2 for correlation with GSTM1*0 copy number and response to therapy to identify additional gene-biomarker correlations. Aim 9: Study additional polymorphisms of genes related to DHA metabolism, for association with autism, gene-biomarker correlations, and correlation with response to therapy.</detailed_description>
