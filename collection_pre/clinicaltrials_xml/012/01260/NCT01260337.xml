	<brief_title>The Effects of a Pre-packaged, Portion Controlled Meal Plan on Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Control: A Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible volunteers are randomly assigned to a treatment group consisting of a pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan plus a group behavior modification program or to a control group that consists of a group diabetes support and education (DSE) program. Random assignment will be stratified by whether or not a subject is taking insulin at baseline, which will be included as a covariate in all subsequent analyses. Treatment assignments are unmasked. At the end of 24 weeks both groups will have completed 9 group sessions (weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24). At week 16, each participant will meet individually with the study physician to review their progress to date. These meetings will take place at the week 16 group visit. The PCD program is aimed at achieving and maintaining a decrease in weight and providing a group behavior modification program from 0-24 weeks. The DSE program is aimed at providing diabetes support and education from weeks 0-24. A Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) will review the effects of diet and weight loss, exercise, and medications on blood glucose levels among all participants at the individual session before any changes in dietary intake or exercise are prescribed. Participants will be counseled on strategies to prevent hypoglycemia and will be given a blood glucose meter and strips and instructed to measure their blood glucose at least two times per day while participating in the study. In addition, the causes, symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia will be reviewed including when to contact their health care provider.</detailed_description>

Participation in any weight loss study or investigational drug study within 6 weeks prior to the screening 15.

Participants on medication treating dyslipidemia for at least 3 months are allowable. 19. Any female who tests positive on a urine pregnancy test or who reports being pregnant at screening 20. Gastrointestinal Disorders (gallbladder disease, Crohn's disease, Irritable bowel syndrome, and any GI disease that affects malabsorption). 21.
