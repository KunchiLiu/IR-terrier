	<brief_summary>This study is to assess the safety and tolerability of sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg with and without ribavirin (RBV) and/or with and without pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG) in subjects with genotype 1, 2 or 3 hepatitis C (HCV) infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Labeled Study of PSI-7977 and RBV With and Without PEG-IFN in Treatment-Naïve Patients With HCV GT2 or GT3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: HCV genotype 2 or 3: participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks. Participants will be randomized in equal proportions to: no PEG (Arm 1), PEG for 4 weeks (Arm 2), PEG for 8 weeks (Arm 3), or PEG for 12 weeks (Arm 4). Part 2: HCV genotype 2 or 3: participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily (monotherapy) for 12 weeks (Arm 5), or SOF 400 mg once daily with PEG and weight-based RBV for 8 weeks (Arm 6); HCV genotype 1: null responders (did not respond to their prior treatment) will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 7). Part 3: HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive (Arm 8) or HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment-experienced participants (Arm 9) will receive SOF 400 mg once daily in combination with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks. Part 4: HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment naive participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with weight-based RBV for 8 weeks (Arm 10) or SOF 400 mg once daily and 800 mg RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 11). HCV genotype 1 null responders will receive SOF 400 mg once daily, ledipasvir (LDV), and weight based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 12). HCV genotype-1 treatment naive participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with weight-based RBV and LDV for 12 weeks (Arm 13). Part 5: HCV genotype 1 null responders will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with GS-9669 500 mg once daily and weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 14). HCV genotype-1 treatment naive participants receive SOF 400 mg once daily with GS-9669 500 mg once daily and weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 15). Part 6: HCV genotype 1 null responders with Stage F4 fibrosis will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks (Arm 16) or LDV/SOF FDC with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 17). HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment-naive participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks (Arm 18). HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment-experienced participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks (Arm 19). HCV genotype 1 hemophiliacs will receive LDV/SOF FDC with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 20). HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC with weight-based RBV for 6 weeks (Arm 21). HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 6 weeks (Arm 22).</detailed_description>
