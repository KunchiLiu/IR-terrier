	<brief_summary>Biventricular pacing is a validated treatment for patients suffering from heart failure resistant to medical treatment. However, up to 30% of the patients are non responsive to this strategy using the coronary sinus approach to pace the Left Ventricle (LV). It has been demonstrated that the magnitude of the improvement was highly dependant on the LV pacing site. The coronary sinus approach rarely offers more than 1 or 2 potential pacing sites. Resynchronisation using a transeptal approach to pace the left ventricle on the cardiology has been shown feasible on small series. We therefore would like to compare these two approached in a randomised prospective study to confirm the hypotheses that endocardial LV pacing by offering multiple choices for the pacing sites reduces the number of non responders and is associated with greater hemodynamic benefit when compared to the conventional coronary sinus approach.</brief_summary>
