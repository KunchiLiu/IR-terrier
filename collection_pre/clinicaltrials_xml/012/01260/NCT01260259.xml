	<brief_summary>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is a treatment that may be associated with improved outcomes after cardiac surgery. It can be elicited noninvasively by using a tourniquet to elicit transient ischemia over a lower extremity. It is thought to promote anti-inflammatory and cell survival pathways, and thus protect remote organs against future ischemic injury. We hypothesize that compared to sham treatment, RIPC will be associated with decreased post-operative acute kidney, myocardial, and lung injury.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In children undergoing cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), our primary aims are to determine whether RPC is associated with: 1) decreased AKI and 2) decreased acute myocardial injury. Secondary aims include investigating the effects of RPC on post-procedure: 1)acute lung injury and 2) morbidity/mortality.</detailed_description>
