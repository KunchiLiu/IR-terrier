	<brief_title>Comparison of Laparoscopic Hill and Laparoscopic Nissen Anti-Reflux Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design is a two-armed prospective single-blinded comparison between the two procedures, performed and randomized independently at the Swedish Medical Center Cancer Institute in Seattle, WA, and at Legacy Health Systems in Portland, OR, in adult patients with uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux failing medical management. A standardized operative technique for each procedures will be utilized at both institutions, and will include intraoperative manometrics and intraoperative photographic documentation of the gastroesophageal valve, as well as placement of clips at the GE junction to accurately identify its location post-operatively. To eliminate "expertise" bias, the investigator from each institution will participate in up to 50 of the first of each of the two procedures.</detailed_description>
