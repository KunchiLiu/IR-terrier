	<brief_summary>Almost all rating scales for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are not validated in France. This clearly hampers the development of the diagnosis and the monitoring of patients but also research in this domain. This study is conceived to collect data in the general population of children aged from 4 to 18 years in public schools in the city of Nice. Children are pseudo-randomly selected from classes of randomly selected schools in the city of Nice (France). Teachers fill out questionnaires using a dedicated secured website, and ask parents to fill out a similar set of questionnaires regarding their child's behaviour at home. Since ADHD has a strong genetic components, parents are also asked to fill out questionnaires regarding their own behaviour at adulthood and in childhood retrospectively. Additionally, known factors related to ADHD and other disorders as well as other putative factors are tested in the epidemiologic study.</brief_summary>
