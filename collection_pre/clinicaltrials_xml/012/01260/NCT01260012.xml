	<brief_summary>Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of schistosomiasis mansoni. However only limited proportion of subjects with infection develop this pathology and there is limited knowledge on risk factors for the differential morbidity patterns observed in endemic communities. Our preliminary cross-sectional study indicated that serum levels of antioxidants may be related with the development of fibrosis. The present project is a randomised double blinded placebo controlled prospective study investigating the role of food based antioxidant supplements on the outcome of anti-schistosomal chemotherapy with regards to the extent of fibrosis reversal.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schistosomiasis is the second leading parasitic disease worldwide, after malaria. Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of schistosomiasis mansoni which can lead to reduced work capacity and early death in endemic countries. There is, however, limited knowledge on the development of liver fibrosis and the differential patterns morbidity observed in endemic communities. Our preliminary cross-sectional study in Ethiopia seems to indicate that serum levels of antioxidants may influence the development of fibrosis. The present project is a translational study combining basic antioxidant laboratory work with is a randomised double blinded placebo controlled prospective study in endemic areas in Ethiopia, investigating the role of food based antioxidant supplements on the outcome of anti-schistosomal chemotherapy with regards to the extent of fibrosis reversal. In addition, analysis of dietary intakes of antioxidants among communities with comparable levels of S. mansoni infection but with differing levels of schistosomal periportal fibrosis will be undertaken to compare serum levels of antioxidants and prevalence of liver fibrosis. Furthermore we plan to assess development of schistosomal peri-portal fibrosis in a cohort of students established 9 years back who had comparable levels of community prevalence of schistosomiasis but with differing access to fruits and vegetables. Research on this topic has a high priority globally which is in line with the millennium development goals. Knowledge in this field will also add to our understanding of fibrosis development in general and to the efficacy of clinical treatment of schistosomiasis in particular.</detailed_description>
