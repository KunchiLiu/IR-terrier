	<brief_title>Yoga Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the participation rate, accrual, adherence, and retention to a yoga trial in patients with malignant brain tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain estimates of the variability of self-reported fatigue, distress (i.e., depression, anxiety), sleep disturbance, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life from baseline to the end of the intervention at 6 (post-onsite intervention) and 12 weeks (post-full intervention). II. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of a yoga intervention in patients with malignant brain tumors on the outcomes of fatigue, distress, and cognitive function. III. To standardize the cancer-specific yoga protocol for use with brain tumor patients. OUTLINE: Patients participate in yoga classes comprising postures, deep relaxation, breathing practices, and meditation twice weekly for 75 minutes during weeks 1-6. Patients then practice yoga at home twice weekly for 45 minutes during weeks 7-12. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 4-5 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed protocol specific informed consent Are diagnosed with a Malignant Brain Tumor (Grades IIIV) Able to start the onsite yoga intervention within 1 week of first radiation treatment Are physically able to attend the intervention classes (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status rating 02) Able to understand written and spoken English Have no medical contraindications reported by the attending physician Have practiced yoga on a regular basis (at least once a week) within the past 4 weeks to recruit participants who are not already regularly practicing yoga; given that the benefits of yoga are likely more immediate than longterm, however, we will enroll participants who have previously had a yoga practice</criteria>
