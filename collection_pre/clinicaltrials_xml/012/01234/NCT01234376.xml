	<brief_summary>Confocal laser endomicroscopy enables in vivo microscopic imaging within the mucosa layer of the gut at a subcellular resolution. Various studies have addressed the potential of endomicroscopy for the in vivo diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, BarrettÂ´s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Currently, there is only one case report from our group who noted the utility of endomicroscopy for the in vivo diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether endomicroscopy is effective for the in vivo diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis.</brief_summary>
