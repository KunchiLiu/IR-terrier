	<brief_summary>Remodulin (Treprostenil sodium) is synthetic prostacyclin analog available as a solution for administration in the intravenous route. It is approved for treatment of class I - pulmonary hypertension functional capacity stage III-IV. A key factor for the success of pulmonary hypertension therapy is maintaining near constant blood level of a given medications along the day. A sudden decrease in the blood levels might lead to rebound phenomenon; abrupt increase in the pulmonary artery pressure which might lead to acute right ventricular failure and even to sudden death. As some PHT patients suffer are on hemo-dialysis therapy due to end-stage renal disease there is a need to document the variation of the blood level along the dialysis cycle.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After giving informed consent 10 ml of blood will be drawn from the study population at the following occasions. - Baseline measurement immediately before starting HD therapy. - During the hemo-dialysis therapy - every one hour. - After the end of the hemo-dialysis therapy - every one hour (a total of four measurements) to record recovery of Treprostenil blood levels.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients with PAH who receive chronic (more than 3 months) Treprostenil treatment administered intravenously as a single agent therapy who maintain chronic hemodialysis therapy. Patients must be in stable condition for at least one month. Patients other than class I PAH will be not included in this study.</criteria>
