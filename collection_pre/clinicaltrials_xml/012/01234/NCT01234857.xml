	<brief_summary>This is a two-part study that will determine, if: 1) the combination of ridaforolimus and dalotuzumab will improve progression-free survival compared to exemestane; and 2) the combination of ridaforolimus and dalotuzumab will improve progression-free survival compared to both ridaforolimus and dalotuzumab as single agents, in participants with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
