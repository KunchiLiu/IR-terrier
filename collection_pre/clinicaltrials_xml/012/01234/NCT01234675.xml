	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia is a condition of chronic widespread pain, sleep disturbance and fatigue. Most of the patients with fibromyalgia complain of either non-restorative sleep or complaints of disturbed sleep due to pain. The proposed study is aimed at examining the effects of milnacipran on sleep disturbance in patients with fibromyalgia. The study is randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two way crossover PSG study to explore the effects of milnacipran on sleep disturbance. Patients will receive either milnacipran 50 mg BID or matching placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Milnacipran on Sleep Disturbance in Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia is characterized as non-restorative in nature, and is defined as a feeling of light sleep, independent of duration, and as non-refreshing. As such, these patients wake up in the morning and complain of stiffness and overall aching of the body. It is well known that reciprocal relationship exist between sleep and pain, with sleep disturbances being an important contributor to morbidity in fibromyalgia. Milnacipran, a selective serotonin norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRI)), was approved by the FDA for the management of fibromyalgia. Although milnacipran has extensively been studied in fibromyalgia patients, but there is no objective measure, i.e., the use of overnight polysomnography, to determine its effects on sleep. The study is meant to explore the effects of milnacipran, versus placebo, on sleep in patients with fibromyalgia as measured by overnight PSGs. The study will also involve important domains of fibromyalgia etiology: sleep disturbance, pain, fatigue and quality of life.</detailed_description>
