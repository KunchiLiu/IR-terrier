	<brief_summary>A major means whereby oxidative stress promotes aging-related disease is by activating inflammatory pathways. Decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation should ameliorate many of the problems associated with aging, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Animal and human studies have demonstrated that consumption of vitamin D and phase 2 protein inducers decrease oxidative stress and associated inflammation. The flax lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) is metabolized to enterolactone, a potent phase 2 protein inducer. Animal and human studies have shown that consumption of flax seed or its component SDG decreases hypertension, serum cholesterol, atherosclerosis, the growth of experimentally-induced cancers as well as metastases of human breast tumours implanted into nude mice, and delays the development of type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D plays a role in modulating inflammation, enhancing immunity (while suppressing autoimmune injury) and exerting control over cell differentiation. Adequate levels of vitamin D also appear to promote better glycemic control. The investigators predict that consumption of SDG in persons with adequate vitamin D status will decrease oxidative stress and associated inflammation. If this hypothesis is upheld, this research has the potential to greatly decrease healthcare costs while allowing healthier aging.</brief_summary>
