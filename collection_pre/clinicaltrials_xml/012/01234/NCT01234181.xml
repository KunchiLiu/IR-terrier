	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study, is to determine the differences of clinical outcomes between hypoxic pre-treatment group and control group in bone marrow stem cell transplantation (BM-SCT) to treat acute myocardial infarction (AMI); and to evaluate the safety of both treatments. Heart failure patients underwent PCI treatment after AMI and with informed consent, are randomized allocation into hypoxic pre-treated BM-SCT group, normoxic pre-treated BM-SCT group, and control group. Cell resuspension is intracoronary injected into patients receiving coronary angiography, IL-6, CRP, TNF and BNP are detected; echocardiography, cardiac MRI and ECT are analyzed to evaluate heart function and alive myocardial cells. Holter's ECG monitor is employed to observe arrhythmia and embolism. We hypothesize that, by receiving hypoxic pre-treated BM-SCT, impaired heart function will be reversed in heart failure patients.</brief_summary>
