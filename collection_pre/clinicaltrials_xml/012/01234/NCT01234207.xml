	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment of a Customized Free-form Progressive Addition Lens Spectacle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized, double-masked crossover trial, 95 experienced wearers wore customized free-form PAL spectacles (Test) and standard non-free-form PAL spectacles (Control) for one week each. At dispensing and after 1 week of wear, subjects were tested for distance and near visual acuity (VA) under both high and low contrast; in addition, 30 degree off-axis VA was measured using a novel apparatus, as was the horizontal extent of undistorted vision at reading distance. Subjects also completed a set of questionnaires detailing their satisfaction levels, adaptation times, and preferences for Test or Control spectacles for different visual tasks.</detailed_description>
