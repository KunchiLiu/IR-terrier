	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease with pruritus as one of its main features. Because of the symptomatic nature of their condition, pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis may preferentially seek care in the subspecialty dermatology clinic while falling behind in visits to their primary care provider. This cross-sectional study in patients attending the Dermatology Clinic at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin will screen for common conditions associated with atopic dermatitis and subsequently treat or refer patients for appropriate care. The investigators hypothesize that Milwaukee County pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis will have a high prevalence of asthma needing treatment, missed immunizations requiring catch-up, and vitamin D deficiency necessitating replacement therapy.</brief_summary>
