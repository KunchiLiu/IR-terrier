	<brief_title>Influence of Surgical Regional Anesthesia on Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regional analgesia is the most effective way of providing analgesia during labor and delivery. By using a combination of local anesthetics and opioids, it is often possible to avoid motor block. Spinal anesthesia is suitable for most elective cesarean sections. Epidural anesthesia and in particular catheter based epidural anesthesia allow a gradual extension of anesthesia and are suitable for prolonged treatment of postoperative pain. It is unclear which anesthetic technique provides better pain relief after cesarean section. This prospective, randomized study compares the effectiveness of three types of regional anesthetic techniques (Spinal anesthesia, Combined spinal epidural anesthesia, Combined spinal epidural anesthesia with indwelling catheter for 24 hrs) on pain after elective cesarean section.</detailed_description>
