	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine which drug has the greatest effect on Ang-(1-7) levels in cancer patients with hypertension. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of these drugs on levels of Ang II, VEGF, PlGF, and ACE in the same patients. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - ARM I: Patients receive oral benazepril hydrochloride once daily on days 1-7. - ARM II: Patients receive oral lisinopril once daily on days 1-7. - ARM III: Patients receive oral ramipril twice daily on days 1-7. - ARM IV: Patients receive oral losartan potassium once daily on days 1-7. In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
