	<brief_summary>The present study was designed to assess analgesic capacity of intrathecal administration of morphine combined with intravenous fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia (ITM-PCA) compared to patient controlled epidural analgesia using fentanyl and repivacaine (PCEA) in patients undergoing gastrectomy. The investigators hypothesized that ITM-PCA would show comparable analgesic effect to PCEA in gastrectomy.</brief_summary>
