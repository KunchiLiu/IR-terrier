	<brief_summary>1. Goals - The primary goal of this phase II trial is to: evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC as first-line therapy Secondary goals are to:evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination, investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this population 2. Design The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial according to the two stage testing design by Simon.22</brief_summary>
