	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety of the treatment with a combination of bendamustine and rituximab and to find out what effects, both good and bad this treatment has on DLBCL. In addition to learning about the combination of bendamustine and rituximab, the researchers are interested in learning about how this cancer treatment affects daily activities. Subjects will be asked to complete a Geriatric Assessment (GA). GAs are designed to gather information on memory, nutritional status, mental health, and level of social support. GAs are also designed to help the health care team understand how well subjects can carry out their day to day activities and to briefly describe what other medical conditions subjects may have. This assessment will help the health care team understand a subject's "functional age" (the age a subject functions at) as compared to a subject's actual age. The researchers also want to learn how chemotherapy affects the aging process in our bodies. This is done by measuring the amount of p16 in blood. Researchers want to understand if chemotherapy changes the levels of p16 in blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine + Rituximab in Older Patients With Previously Untreated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter Phase II clinical study will investigate the complete response (CR) rate after therapy with bendamustine combined with rituximab in older (≥65 years old) patients with previously untreated stage II-IV DLBCL deemed poor candidates for cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine (Oncovin®), prednisone, rituximab (CHOP-R); n=37. The hypothesis being tested is that this regimen will be safe and effective as frontline therapy in older DLBCL patients deemed poor candidates for CHOP-R. After 3 cycles of therapy, patients with less than a partial response (PR) will come off study, and be managed at the discretion of their treating physician. Patients who achieve a PR after 3 cycles will continue for a total of 8 cycles of therapy, while patients who achieve a CR will continue for a total of 6 cycles of therapy. Secondary objectives include overall response rates (ORR), disease-free, progression-free and overall survival, and an evaluation of the toxicity and tolerability of the regimen. This trial also includes an exploratory analysis designed to evaluate a potential correlation between expression of the senescence marker p16INK4a and the toxicity associated with this regimen. In addition, patients will be asked to participate in a Geriatric Assessment (GA) tool during the trial.</detailed_description>
