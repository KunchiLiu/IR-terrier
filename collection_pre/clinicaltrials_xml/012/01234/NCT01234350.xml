	<brief_summary>This study is a large observational study set-up to observe how the long-term treatment of Firmagon (hormone regulator) compared to another treatment will effect specific conditions such as cardiovascular events, changes in bone density, changes in blood sugar levels or liver enzyme levels in patients with prostate cancer. Patients will be treated according to their routine clinical care and this will not be dictated by the study. As the study is observational in nature, the study will collect specific data relating to the 3 specific events above. Patients that agree to this study will be followed-up for 5 years. Patient data will be collected every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months for the last 3 yrs.</brief_summary>
