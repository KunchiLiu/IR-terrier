	<brief_title>Agreement Among Expert Radiologists in Diagnosing Primary Liver Tumors by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is currently the method of choice for non-invasive diagnosis of primary liver tumors. However, differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) remains challenging, particularly in non-cirrhotic patients.</detailed_description>
