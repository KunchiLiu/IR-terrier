	<brief_summary>An open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase 2 trial in which patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with anthracycline and taxane therapy receive ramucirumab DP or IMC-18F1 administered on an every-21-day cycle (in combination with oral capecitabine therapy; capecitabine is administered twice a day on Days 1-14 of each cycle). Approximately 150 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either ramucirumab DP or IMC-18F1 in combination with capecitabine (Arm A and Arm B, respectively) or capecitabine monotherapy (Arm C). Randomization will be stratified by triple-negative receptor status (estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 [HER2/neu]-negative) (yes/no) and receipt of prior antiangiogenic therapy. Treatment with the study medication(s) will continue until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient, or investigator decision. Capecitabine dose reductions in the setting of significant myelosuppression, hand-and-foot syndrome, or diarrhea will be required.</brief_summary>
