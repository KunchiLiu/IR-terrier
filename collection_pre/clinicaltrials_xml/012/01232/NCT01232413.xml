	<brief_title>A Study of the Effect of ASP1941 on Cardiac Repolarization in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized in four treatment sequences of twenty subjects each. Subjects in each treatment sequence will participate in a total of four treatment periods (A, B, C, and D) separated by washout periods of at least 7 days from completion of the prior period (Day 8) through clinical check-in (Day -1) of the next study period. For Period 1, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit on Day -2. For each subsequent study period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit on Day -1. Subjects will be discharged from the unit after completing procedures on Day 8 of each period. Subjects will receive a follow-up telephone call 7-10 days after their last clinic day (Period 4\Early Discontinuation [ED]).</detailed_description>
