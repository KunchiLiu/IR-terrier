	<brief_summary>Tiny molecules (hormones) are released from the bowels and other organs to the bloodstream in response to meals in order to orchestrate the metabolism. Oxyntomodulin, GLP-1 and glucagon are all known to regulate parameters such as appetite, food intake and induce weight loss. Therefore we want to investigate mechanistic relations between the three hormones.</brief_summary>
