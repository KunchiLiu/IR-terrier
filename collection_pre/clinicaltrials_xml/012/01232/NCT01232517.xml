	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to gather information about the NeuroVision System (which is FDA cleared for this indication) during the placement of pedicle screws. NeuroVision is a machine that monitors nerve activity during surgery and will alert the surgeon if there are any nerve-related issues during screw placement. The use of nerve monitoring is standard of care at most centers during spine surgery. The standard monitoring for screws placed is performed after the screw is placed, to ensure it is well positioned in the bone (if it is not, the screw may be removed and/or repositioned). The NeuroVision System has a novel feature called "Dynamic Screw Test" that allows for that monitoring to be performed as the screw is placed, rather than after the fact. This study is being done to determine if this real-time monitoring of screw placement provides beneficial additional information to the operating surgeon to prevent misplacement of screws before it happens.</brief_summary>

Patients who understand the conditions of enrollment and are willing to sign an informed consent to participate in the study. 1. Patients with underlying neurological disease or neurological deficits that are not associated with the condition for which they are seeking surgical intervention. 2. Patients who have had previous instrumented surgery at the involved lumbar level. 3. Participants in any other clinical study involving an investigational device or drug within 30 days of enrollment into the current study.</criteria>
