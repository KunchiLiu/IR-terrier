	<brief_title>Validation of Ultrasound as a Diagnostic Tool for Assessment of Hemophilic Arthropathy of Knees and Ankles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound has advantages over MRI as it is less expensive, does not require sedation and is more readily available in centres around the world. Given these characteristics of ultrasound it is an ideal imaging tool for early assessment of hemophilic joints in countries whose access to MRI is limited. Early evaluation of soft tissue changes in young hemophilic patients may lead to earlier interventions and better mid-term and long-term clinical outcomes. By this way the joint function of hemophilic patients can be preserved, saving their joints from severe arthropathy and offering them the possibility of a normal professional life in the society.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency ≤1%) or B (factor IX deficiency ≤1.0%) Cooperative patients (age of 7 to 18 years old) Patients under 7 years old who have clinical evidence of arthropathy and imaging studies are required for clinical reasons. In these cases, the procedures may be done under sedation. Male sex (higher prevalence in males) History of previous ankle or knee bleed Comorbid illness such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, muscular dystrophy, neuropathic arthropathy that cause osteoarticular findings that may obscure or confound the hemophiliabased joint findings Noncooperative patients Active bleed (defined as evidence of a recent bleed with one week of the proposing imaging studies and/or musculoskeletal changes on physical examination suggestive of a bleed within one week of the proposed imaging studies).
