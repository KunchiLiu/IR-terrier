	<brief_summary>This randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate the reduction in disease activity and the safety of tocilizumab (RoActemra/Actemra) in combination with traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with active, moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In the double-blind part of the study, patients will be randomized to receive either 162 mg tocilizumab or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 24 weeks using a pre-filled syringe. In the open-label part of the study, patients will be randomized to receive 162 mg tocilizumab subcutaneously every 2 weeks from Week 24 to Week 96 using a pre-filled syringe or an auto-injector.</brief_summary>
