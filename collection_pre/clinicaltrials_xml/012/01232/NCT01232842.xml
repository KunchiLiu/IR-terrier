	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Study in Tissue Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that originates in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is restricted to CD33+ precursors. OUTLINE: Cryopreserved acute myeloid leukemia cell samples are separated from endothelial cell by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed for X-chromosome inactivation patterns by cytogenetic/molecular analysis and/or Humara assay.</detailed_description>
