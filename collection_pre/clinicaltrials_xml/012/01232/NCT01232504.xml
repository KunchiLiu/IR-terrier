	<brief_summary>We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label randomized trial to compare the antifungal effect of Recombinant Human Granulocyte-macrophage Stimulating Factor (rhGM-CSF), Recombinant Human Granulocyte Stimulating Factor (rhG-CSF) or a combination of rhGM-CSF and rhG-CSF for neutropenic patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From Sept 2009 to Dec 2012, we recruited consecutive patients with hematological diseases undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation at 5 institutions in China. Recipients between ages of 14 to 60 years old were eligible. Eligible patients were randomized to receive once daily subcutaneous 5-7μg/kg/d GM-CSF (Molgramostim, TOPLEUCON®; Xiamen Amoytop Biotech Co., Ltd., China) (GM-CSF group), 5-7μg/kg/d G-CSF (G-CSF group), or a combination of 2-3μg/kg/d GM-CSF and 2-3μg/kg/d G-CSF each (G-CSF+GM-CSF group). Administration of CSFs was started on day 5 post-transplant and continued until recovery from neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt; 1.5×10(9)/L for 2 consecutive days). If absolute neutrophil count (ANC) decreased to &lt; 1.5×10(9)/L within 5 days after withdrawal of CSFs, the same CSF would be resumed until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached 1.5×10(9)/L again. All patients received antimicrobial prophylaxis with oral levofloxacin 500 mg daily and antifungal prophylaxis with oral fluconazole 200 mg daily.</detailed_description>
