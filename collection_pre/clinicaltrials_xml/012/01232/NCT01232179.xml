	<brief_summary>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is treated with conventional pan retinal photocoagulation (PRP) which can improve the visual prognosis in this complication significantly. However , the treatment may also resulting adverse effects such as blurring of central vision, visual field constriction and disturbance in dark adaptation and contrast vision. Extended targeted retinal coagulation (TRP) to the ischemic areas may cause regression of the neovascularization while minimizing some of the risks and complication associated of treatment of PDR with these two methods.</brief_summary>
