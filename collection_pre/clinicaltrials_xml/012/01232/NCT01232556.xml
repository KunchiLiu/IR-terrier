	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab in relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who are not candidates for intensive high-dose chemotherapy. Specifically, the goal is to demonstrate the superiority of this combination compared with an active comparator arm (investigator's choice of rituximab+bendamustine or rituximab+gemcitabine) using the primary endpoint of overall survival.</brief_summary>
