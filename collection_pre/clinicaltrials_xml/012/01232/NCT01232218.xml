	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a specific stretching and strengthening protocol, in addition to current standard treatment, is more effective for treating post-stroke shoulder pain than current standard treatment alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Protocol for Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current standard treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain includes joint protection (i.e., slings and protective positioning) and stretching/strengthening exercises through a pain-free range. Although the added movement of the shoulder blade when moving the post-stroke arm has been recommended in the literature, no studies to date have been found which directly looks at the impact of providing synchronized three-dimensional scapular and humeral movement during therapy. Due to the integral relationship between the scapula and the humerus during movement, it is hypothesized that an increase in 3-dimensional shoulder blade mobility in the painful post-stroke shoulder will contribute to increased pain-free 3-dimensional arm movement. This double-blind randomized-controlled study aims to investigate the effectiveness of this 3-D approach at addressing post-stroke shoulder pain.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>diagnosis of shoulder pain secondary to altered alignment and/or neuromuscular movement patterns poststroke; medically stable and 224 months post onset of stroke; between stages of 25 of the ChedokeMcMaster stages of upper extremity motor recovery; not currently receiving any other active neurorehabilitation intervention to promote stroke recovery; cognitively able to provide informed consent, follow specific testing commands, and communicate their level of pain during assessment and treatment. a history of shoulder pain prior to the onset of the stroke; shoulder pain which is secondary to any history of trauma, fractures, arthritis or joint instability of the neck, spine, ribs, or shoulder girdle before or after the stroke; possible rotator cuff tears; shoulderhand syndrome; thalamic or central pain; spinal cord pathology; osteoporosis; any medical condition which may affect the ability to participate in an active rehabilitation exercise program (i.e., uncontrolled hypertension or angina).</criteria>
