	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples fo tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Demonstrate that S100A10 is expressed on APL cells and that levels of S100A10 correspond to the amount of fibrinolytic activity. - Evaluate the impact of ATRA on S100A10 level and fibrinolytic activity in vitro. - Evaluate the impact of S100A10 knockdown on fibrinolytic activity. - Correlate in vitro findings in cell culture to primary patient samples both pre- and post-ATRA therapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Previously collected samples are analyzed via flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Cell surface levels of S100A10 and annexin A2 are correlated to the promyelocyte population and total protein levels are examined to determine total annexin A2 and S100A10 in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.</detailed_description>
