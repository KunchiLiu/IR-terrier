	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the hypothesis that effects of liraglutide plus insulin detemir on myocardial fuel selection will be greater than the effects of either agent alone. 27 Type 2 diabetic subjects (HbA1c 7.5 - 9.5%) currently treated with diet and exercise alone or with oral antidiabetic agents will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: insulin detemir, liraglutide, or liraglutide plus detemir (9 subjects per group). All subjects will undergo an initial standardization of background treatment to metformin 2000 mg per day, followed by randomized assignment to 3 months' treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day (once daily each morning, tapering up according to label instructions) and/or detemir (administered twice daily, initially at 10 units per day then titrated to achieve fasting morning glucose readings below 130 mg/dL). PET measurements of myocardial fuel selection will take place at the end of this treatment period, under fasting conditions in the morning following that day's treatment injection(s).</brief_summary>
