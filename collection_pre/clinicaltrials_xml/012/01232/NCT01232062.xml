	<brief_title>Study of High-dose Chemotherapy (HDC) Combined With Adoptive Cellular Therapy With DC-CIK Cells in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Metastatic breast cancer patients should be definitively diagnosis based on histopathology, with ER-negative and PR-negative, FISH testing for her-2-negative 2. All the patients enrolled will be given standard HDC and cellular therapy.HDC and cellular therapy consisting of one cycle of HDC followed by an apheresis and ex vivo cultures to generate DC and CIK. DC-CIK infusions were given to each patient, followed by two cycles HDC, plus low-dose Oral Cyclophosphamide. 3. PET-CT scans were done on each patients at baseline and after chemotherapy. The response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines. 4. Estimate time to progression, survival rates and clinical benefit response on patients. 5. Find biomarkers associated with drug response.</detailed_description>
