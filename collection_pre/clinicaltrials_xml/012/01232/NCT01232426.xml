	<brief_summary>Intra-articular fractures at the dorsal base of the distal phalanx of the hand are usually referred to as Mallet fractures. Treatment of Mallet fractures remains controversial. Although no differences in clinical results are reported between conservative treatment and operative treatment, operative treatment is suggested for fractures involving more than 30% of articular surface. There are many different operative techniques, all with specific disadvantages. The investigators hypothesis is that operative treatment of Mallet fractures with one Meniscus ArrowÂ® has a better outcome than conservative treatment with a Mallet splint.</brief_summary>
