	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical trials are ongoing globally to evaluate Nimotuzumab in different indications. Nimotuzumab has been approved to treat squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in different countries. The clinical phase I study of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with chemo-irradiation in patients with local advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LAFSCC) has shown the safety and the potential efficacy of Nimotuzumab. The concurrent trial is a clinical phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with chemo-radiotherapy in patients with LAFSCC, and to further investigate its side-effect and toxicity.</brief_summary>
