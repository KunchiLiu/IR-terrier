	<brief_summary>The investigators want to know the role of Peripheral hematopoietic stem cell infusion in avoiding Drug Induced Liver Injury,and also try to research SNPs genotyping associated with Drug Induced Liver Injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study the Role of Stem Cell in Curing Drug Induced Liver Injury in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The researcher investigate the incidence and the cause of Drug Induced Liver Injury in MBC. 2. Patients having a complete clinical history and physical examination, receive routine chemotherapy. 3. Venous blood Sample(4 ml)is collected before and after each cycle according to the planning time. 4. Genomic DNA,RNA and upper serum is isolated. ELISA、rt-PCR or PCR-direct sequencing is used to detect the protein or gene expression associated with liver function.</detailed_description>
