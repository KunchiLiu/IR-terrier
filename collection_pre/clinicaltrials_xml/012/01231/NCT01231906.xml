	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy to see how well it works compared to combination chemotherapy with topotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with non-metastatic extracranial Ewing sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, and topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with topotecan hydrochloride in treating Ewing sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Non-Metastatic Extracranial Ewing Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: l. Test the effect of the combination of vincristine (vincristine sulfate), cyclophosphamide, and topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride) (VTC) added to the standard 5-drug chemotherapy interval-compressed backbone on event-free and overall survival of children and young adults with Ewing sarcoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate initial volumetric tumor size as a prognostic factor for event free survival (EFS) in patients with localized Ewing tumors. II. To evaluate histologic response as a prognostic factor for EFS in patients with localized Ewing tumors. III. To continue evaluation of biologic markers both as related to prognosis and as eventual therapeutic targets via encouraging concurrent enrollment on a Ewing sarcoma specimen-collection study. IV. To evaluate imaging response by fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) as a prognostic factor for EFS. V. To evaluate the effects of the type of local therapy on EFS and overall survival. VI. To evaluate the effect of local surgical margins in conjunction with histologic response on EFS in patients with localized Ewing tumors. VII. To evaluate the effect of local therapy modality (surgery, radiotherapy, or a combination) as well as the type of surgical reconstruction on musculoskeletal complications. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 5, and 9; and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 3, 7, and 11. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, and 22; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1 and 9; cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 7, 9, 13, 17, and 21; and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 3, 5, 11, 15, and 19. ARM II: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9; cyclophosphamide IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9, and on day 1 of weeks 5 and 11; ifosfamide and etoposide as in arm I; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 in weeks 5 and 11. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 7-10, 13-16, 19, and 20; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1, 7, and 15; cyclophosphamide IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1, 7, and 15, and on day 1 in weeks 9, 13, and 19; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1- 2 hours on days 1-5 in weeks 3, 5, 11, 17, and 21; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2 in weeks 9,13, and 19. Patients with responsive or stable disease undergo may undergo surgery alone in week 13 if lesion can be complete resected with negative margins and with reasonable functional result. Patients with unresectable lesions or inadequate margins after surgery receive radiotherapy during weeks 1-7. Patients with bulky lesions in surgically difficult sites such as the spine, skull, and periacetabular pelvis, patients with a poor response to induction chemotherapy, or those patients in whom surgery would result in unacceptable functional results may undergo radiotherapy alone in weeks 1-7 of consolidation therapy, and surgery should be performed after completion of consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with microscopic residual disease after planned pre-operative radiotherapy receive additional radiotherapy. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
