	<brief_summary>Anxiety about needles is a concern commonly expressed by diabetics when beginning insulin therapy. A shorter, thinner pen needle that delivers insulin with the safety and efficacy profile of longer pen needles may appeal to many diabetic patients as the shorter needle may be perceived as less intimidating and more comfortable. While pen needles of 4 to 8 mm in length are generally used for insulin injection in patients considered thin or normal weight, longer (12.7 mm) needles are still often prescribed for overweight or obese patients with diabetes. Since skin thickness is nearly constant across a range of body mass index (BMI), a clear rationale exists for the use of shorter needles in obese patients. (Gibney et al., CMRO 2010) The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the BD Ultra-Fine™ Nano 4mm x 32 Gauge(G) pen needle manufactured by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) provides equivalent glucose control (as measured by hemoglobin A1c levels) as the BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm x 31G and the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm x 29G pen needles in obese subjects with diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each subject's participation is expected to last a total of 7 months and includes a screening visit, a three-week wash-in period (one week with each of the three different size pen needles) followed by two consecutive 12 week study periods. The purpose of the three week wash-in period is to minimize the number of dropouts during the following study periods by ensuring that subjects have experience using each of the three study needles and find them generally acceptable for use during the study. Only subjects who complete the wash-in period and confirm their agreement to continue participating will be randomized into one of the two study arms. Subjects will be randomly assigned to use the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm pen needle and either the BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needle or the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needle. The randomization will also specify which of the two study pen needles to be used first. Half of the study subjects will use the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm and BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needles (4mm/8mm arm) and the other half will use the BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm and the BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needles (4mm/12.7mm arm). At the end of the first 12 week study period subjects will switch to the other assigned pen needle for the second and final study period. Glycemic control (based on HbA1c concentrations) will be assessed at baseline and at the end of each 12 week study period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Insulin requiring diabetics (type 1 or type 2) Using a pen device for selfinjection of all diabetesrelated medications for at least two months prior to screening. 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive. Body Mass Index of at least 30 kg/m². Hemoglobin A1c from 5.5 to 9.5 percent (%), inclusive. Selfmonitor blood glucose at least twice per day with a memory blood glucose meter, and willing to do so at least twice per day for the duration of the study On a stable diabetes treatment regimen (for example, no change to noninsulin therapies)for at least 2 months prior to screening Able to read, write and follow instructions in English or Spanish. Administer insulin with a pump. Currently use a syringe to inject insulin or any other diabetesrelated medication. Pregnancy. History of intravenous drug abuse. Current status or history of a medical condition that would contraindicate treatment with the study product or other conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at risk or have the potential to confound interpretation of the study results (i.e. recent history of ketoacidosis, hypoglycemic unawareness, etc.) Participated in any one of the following clinical studies: BDDC08011, 'Comparison of Glycemic Control among Diabetics using the 4mm x 32G BD Pen Needle versus the 8mm x 31G BD Pen Needle and the 5mm x 31G BD Pen Needle'.
