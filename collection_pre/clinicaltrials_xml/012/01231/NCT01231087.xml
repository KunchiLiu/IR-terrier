	<brief_summary>Obese patients are going to be submitted to indirect calorimetry pre-operatively and we are going to repeat the same exam 6 months after bariatric surgery (post Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass surgery). They are going to do also body composition analysis in both moments. The investigators are going to compare the results to see if the bariatric surgery increases their energy expenditure.</brief_summary>
