	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, Israeli phase II open label study evaluating treatment with RAD001 (10 mg daily) combined with letrozole (2.5 mg daily) in postmenopausal women after recurrence or progression on Tamoxifen, Anastrozole or Examestane. There are no treatments specifically approved after recurrence or progression on AIs. Available options, based on common clinical practice and several treatment guidelines (e.g. NCCN treatment guidelines 2008), include fulvestrant. Combining RAD001 with letrazole is a rational approach to the treatment of advanced Brest Cancer, offering the potential for inhibition of tumor cell growth\ proliferation and anti angiogenesis while at the same time potentially preventing the development of letrazole resistance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after documented recurrence or progression on Tamoxifen, Anastrozole or Examestane. Refractory disease to hormonal therapy is defined as: 1. Recurrence while on, or within 12 month of end of, adjuvant treatment with Tamoxifen , Anastrozole, or Exemestane. 2. Recurrence while on, or within 24 month of end of, adjuvant treatment with Letrozole. 3. Progression while on Tamoxifen, Anastrozole or Exemestane treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Prior use of chemotherapy and letrozole for Advanced Breast Cancer and mTOR inhibitors as the last anticancer treatment prior to study entry. Patients must have radiological evidence of recurrence or progression on last therapy prior to study entry. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
