	<brief_summary>This rollover study is designed to provide continued access to GSK2118436 for eligible subjects with BRAF mutation-positive tumors who have previously participated in a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)-sponsored GSK2118436 study (parent study), who have no evidence of progressive disease and who have tolerated GSK2118436 in the parent study without significant toxicities. Subjects will be enrolled into the appropriate cohort based upon the treatment received in their parent study. Safety assessments (physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, clinical laboratory assessments, and monitoring of adverse events) will be made throughout the study. Clinical activity will be assessed using local standard of care imaging practices and the appropriate response criteria as determined by the investigator.</brief_summary>
