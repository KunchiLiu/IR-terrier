	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies showed that 20-30% of patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections risked recurrent infection. Urinary tract infection causes marked discomfort for the patient, has a negative impact upon quality of life, and is associated with high social and health costs in terms of specialist appointments, laboratory and instrumental tests and prescriptions . Although diverse cycles of antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis have been proposed, doubts persist about the most efficacious pharmacological agents, duration of prophylaxis , the incidence of adverse effects and relapse when antibiotic therapy is suspended. Aims of the study: 1. To compare the efficacy of two prophylactic schedules (Prulifloxacin vs Phosphomycin): - in reducing the number of urinary tract infection episodes during prophylaxis - in reducing the number of urinary tract infection episodes after prophylaxis - in improving the patient's quality of life . 2. To assess : - Tolerability of antibiotic prophylaxis - The incidence of resistance to antibiotic therapy</brief_summary>
