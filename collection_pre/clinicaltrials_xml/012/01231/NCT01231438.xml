	<brief_summary>Patients with reduced renal function normally develop hyperparathyroidism, which in turn is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and de-calcification. Hyperparathyroidism may be enhanced by an increased level of FGF23 which is often seen in the early stage of renal failure. This pilot study will investigate the FGF23-lowering effect of early initiation of treatment with a phosphate binder versus active vitamin D in an open crossover design.</brief_summary>
