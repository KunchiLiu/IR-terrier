	<brief_summary>ING111762 is a 48 week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in at least 688 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral experienced, integrase-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, each added to an investigator selected background regimen consisting of at least one fully active agent plus no more than one second single agent which may or may not be active. Antiviral activity, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and development of viral resistance will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of GSK1349572 Versus Raltegravir (RAL) With Investigator Selected Background Regimen in Antiretroviral-Experienced, Integrase Inhibitor-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ING111762 is a 48 week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in at least 688 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral experienced, integrase-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, each added to an investigator selected background regimen consisting of at least one fully active agent plus no more than one second single agent which may or may not be active. Antiviral activity, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and development of viral resistance will be evaluated. Subjects must have documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one member of each of at least two antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug classes [nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (PI), fusion inhibitor (T20), or entry inhibitor (chemokine receptor 5 [CCR5] antagonist)]. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy. An additional data cut and analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes 24 weeks on therapy. Subjects randomized to GSK1349572 who successfully complete Week 48 will continue to received GSK1349572 until either it is locally available, until they no longer derive clinical benefit, until they meet a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, or until development of the compound is terminated. ViiV Healthcare is the sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Antiretroviral therapy (ART)experienced, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 1 infected adults at least 18 years of age. Women capable of becoming pregnant must use appropriate contraception during the study (as defined by the protocol). HIV1 infection as documented by HIV1 RNA &gt;400 copies/mL (c/mL) at Screening and with at least one consecutive HIV1 RNA &gt;400 c/mL within the four months prior to Screening (unless the Screening HIV1 RNA is &gt; 1000 c/mL where no additional plasma HIV1 RNA assessment is needed). Have documented resistance (via Screening resistance test) to two or more different classes of antiretroviral agents. For subjects off ART for at least one month, if Screening resistance results provide a fully active agent and do not show two class resistance then historical resistance results from the subject's most recent resistance testing may be used, following consultation with the study virologist and /or medical monitor. Integrase inhibitor (INI)naïve, defined as no prior exposure to any INI (e.g. RAL, elvitegravir, or GSK1349572). Able to provide written informed consent prior to Screening. French subjects: In France, subjects will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Screening resistance test result indicates no fully active antiviral agents are available for design of the background regimen. Subjectvirus does not yield results using genotype/phenotype/tropism at Screening (assay data is essential for eligibility determination). Women who are breastfeeding. Any evidence of an active AIDSdefining condition (except cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy or CD4+ &lt;200c/mm3). Subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment as defined by ChildPugh classification. Recent history (less than or equal to 3 months) of upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed, with the exception of anal or rectal bleeding. Anticipated need for hepatitis C therapy during the study. History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components or drugs of their class. History of malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; other localized malignancies require agreement between the investigator and study medical monitor for inclusion of the subject. Treatment with an HIV1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days prior to Screening. Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening: radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, any immunomodulator. Treatment with any agent, other than licensed ART, which has documented activity against HIV1 in vitro within 28 days of first dose of investigational product. Exposure to an experimental drug and/or experimental vaccine within either 28 days, 5 halflives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the experimental test agent whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of IP. French subjects recruited at sites in France will be excluded if the subject has participated in any study using an investigational drug and/or vaccine within 60 days or 5 halflives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the experimental drug or vaccine whichever is longer prior to screening for the study or the subject plans to participate simultaneously in another clinical study. Any acute or verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). ALT greater than or equal to 3xULN and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5xULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin).</criteria>
