	<brief_title>Prevention of Post-Mastectomy Breast Pain Using Ambulatory Continuous Paravertebral Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition of a multiple-day ambulatory continuous paravertebral block decreases the incidence and severity of post-mastectomy pain. Hypothesis 1: Following mastectomy, the incidence and severity of breast pain will be significantly decreased in the week following surgery with a multiple-day ambulatory continuous paravertebral block as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (as measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale). Hypothesis 2: Following mastectomy, the incidence and severity of chronic pain will be significantly decreased three months following multiple-day ambulatory continuous paravertebral blocks as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (as measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).</detailed_description>
