	<brief_title>Evaluation the Blood Loss in Pregnancies With Misoprostol-induced Labour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: it was a study achieved with 101 pregnant women with indication to induced delivery labor that were evaluated by the hemoglobin dosage pre and post delivery for estimate the blood loss at delivery. Patients were submitted to transabdominal obstetric ultrasound and basal cardiotocography. Procedures were taken for induced labor delivery with misoprostol 25mcg, by vaginal rout. The pills were administered each 6 hours in a maximum number of six. The control group was formed by 30 patients that began an spontaneously labor and 30 patients that achieved caesarians electively. The study of hemoglobin before and after delivery was evaluated through ANOVA to repeated measures, where it was verified the time effect (pre and post delivery) and the effect of the group (with and without use of misoprostol).</detailed_description>
