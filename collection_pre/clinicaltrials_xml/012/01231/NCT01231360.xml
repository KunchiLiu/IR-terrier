	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that subjects with PAD and intermittent claudication have altered expression of genes that regulate skeletal muscle metabolism. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that exercise training improves calf skeletal muscle insulin resistance and genes that regulate skeletal muscle metabolic function in PAD patients with intermittent claudication.</brief_summary>
