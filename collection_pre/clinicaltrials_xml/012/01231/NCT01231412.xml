	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body irradiation (TBI) together with fludarabine phosphate (FLU), cyclosporine (CSP), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or sirolimus before transplant may stop this from happening.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the effectiveness of 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens in preventing acute grades II-IV GVHD. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare non-relapse mortality in the 2 arms. II. Compare survival and progression-free survivals in the 2 arms. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. All patients receive FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 followed by 2-3 Gy TBI on day 0. ARM I: Patients receive CSP orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 with taper to day 150 and MMF PO three times daily (TID) on days 0-29 and then BID on days 30-150 with taper to day 180. ARM II: Patients receive CSP as in Arm I and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to 150 with taper to day 180. Patients also receive MMF PO TID on days 0-29 and then BID on days 30-40. MMF will then be discontinued without taper unless GVHD or disease relapse/progression occurs. TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0 following the TBI. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ages &gt; 50 years with hematologic malignancies treatable by unrelated hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) Ages =&lt; 50 years of age with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HCT who through preexisting medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high risk for regimen related toxicity associated with a high dose transplant (&gt; 40% risk of transplant related mortality [TRM]); this criterion can include patients with a HCTcomorbidity index (CI) score of &gt;= 1; transplants should be approved for these inclusion criteria by the principal investigators at the collaborating centers and at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC); all children &lt; 12 years must be discussed with the FHCRC principal investigator (PI) prior to registration Ages =&lt; 50 years of age with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Ages =&lt; 50 years of age with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HCT who refuse a highdose HCT; transplants must be approved for these inclusion criteria by the principal investigators at the collaborating centers and at FHCRC The following diseases will be permitted although other diagnoses can be considered if approved by Patient Care Conference (PCC) or the participating institutions' patient review committees and the principal investigators Aggressive nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and other histologies such as diffuse large B cell NHL: not eligible for autologous HCT, not eligible for highdose allogeneic HCT, or after failed autologous HCT Mantle cell NHL: may be treated in first complete remission (CR); (diagnostic lumbar puncture [LP] required pretransplant) Low grade NHL: with &lt; 6 month duration of CR between courses of conventional therapy CLL: must have either: Failed to meet National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group criteria for complete or partial response after therapy with a regimen containing FLU (or another nucleoside analog, e.g. 2Chlorodeoxyadenosine [2CDA], pentostatin) or experience disease relapse within 12 months after completing therapy with a regimen containing FLU (or another nucleoside analog); Failed FLUcyclophosphamide (CY)Rituximab (FCR) combination chemotherapy at any time point; or Have "17p deletion" cytogenetic abnormality; patients should have received induction chemotherapy but could be transplanted in 1st CR; or Patients with a diagnosis of CLL (or small lymphocytic lymphoma) or diagnosis of CLL that progresses to prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), or Tcell CLL or PLL Hodgkin lymphoma: must have received and failed frontline therapy Multiple myeloma: must have received prior chemotherapy; consolidation of chemotherapy by autografting prior to nonmyeloablative HCT is permitted Acute myeloid leukemia (AML): must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): patients in 1st chronic phase (CP1) must have failed or be intolerant of tyrosinekinase inhibitors (TKI); patients beyond CP1 will be accepted if they have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant Myelodysplasia (MDS)/myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS): patients must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia: must have failed 2 courses of therapy DONOR: FHCRC matching allowed will be grades 1.0 to 2.1: Unrelated donors who are prospectively: Matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLAA, B, or C as defined by high resolution typing DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive antidonor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft rejection vector are considered a twoallele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed DONOR: Only filgrastim (GCSF) mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol Patients with rapidly progressive intermediate or high grade NHL Patients with a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) Patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) who have not received myelosuppressive chemotherapy i.e. induction chemotherapy Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with disease refractory to intrathecal chemotherapy Presence of circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by standard pathology for patients with AML, ALL or CML Presence of &gt;= 5% circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by standard pathology for patients with MDS/MPS Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12 months following treatment Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding Patients with active nonhematological malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) or those with nonhematological malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) who have been rendered with no evidence of disease, but have a greater than 20% chance of having disease recurrence within 5 years; this exclusion does not apply to patients with nonhematologic malignancies that do not require therapy Fungal infections with radiological progression after receipt of amphotericin B or active triazole for greater than 1 month Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 35% (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction, shortening fraction of &lt; 26%); ejection fraction is required if age &gt; 50 years or there is a history of anthracycline exposure or history of cardiac disease;

40% and/or receiving supplementary continuous oxygen The FHCRC PI of the study must approve of enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, and the degree of portal hypertension; patients will be excluded if they are found to have fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evinced by prolongation of the prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bridging fibrosis, bacterial or fungal liver abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral hepatitis with total serum bilirubin &gt;
