	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of intradermal delivery of NP2 on pain scores and pain medication usage in subjects with intractable pain due to malignant disease. A second purpose is to confirm safety and secondary efficacy measurements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NP2 Enkephalin For Treatment of Intractable Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic severe pain remains a significant unmet medical need in patients that have progressive cancer. Existing treatments have limited efficacy and also suffer significant side effects. This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the impact of intradermal injection of NP2 in subjects who have intractable pain due to malignant disease. NP2 is a gene transfer vector engineered to express human preproenkephalin, a gene naturally involved in pain control. Delivery of NP2 directly to the site of pain caused by cancer is intended to provide increased Enkephalin peptides, which bind to opioid receptors, that may allow better pain control.</detailed_description>
