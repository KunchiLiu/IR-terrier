	<brief_summary>The present study is designed to determine the mutational status of markers (TET2 and PLCb2, cytogenetic aberrations) together with methylation status of the above genes using bone marrow and matched buccal cell samples from MDS patients who necessitate to start a treatment (i.e. EPO, Lenalidomide, Azacytidine). All patients included in the study will be followed for at least 2 years.</brief_summary>
