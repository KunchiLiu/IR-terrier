	<brief_summary>Patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at risk for secondary neurological deterioration. Their outcome within the first week after injury could be predicted by clinical signs, brain CT scan and transcranial doppler (TCD) on admission to the emergency room. The investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic performance of TCD to screen patients presented with mild to moderate TBI and mild lesions on CT scan, i.e., Trauma Coma Data Bank, TCDB classification II. The principal outcome measure is the negative predictive value of TCD.</brief_summary>
