	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the additional effect of probucol or concomitant administration of cilostazol and probucol on mean carotid artery intima-media thickness (mean IMT) at year 1, 2, and 3.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigate Effect on Mean IMT of Probucol And/or CilosTazol in Patients With Coronary Heart dIsease Taking HMGCoA Reductase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperlipidemic patients who are currently receiving HMGCoA reductase inhibitors(Statins) will be randomized Group A(Control), Group B(Probucol only added group) or Group C(Probucol and cilostazol added group) . Randomization will be done by the minimization method, controlling for the following factors: Country(Korea vs China) and max IMT (≥2.0mm vs.&lt;2.0mm). Group A : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor continued Group B : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor continued + Probucol 250 mg PO, BID Group C : HMGCoA reductase inhibitor continued + Probucol 250 mg PO, BID +Cilostazol 100 mg PO, BID</detailed_description>
