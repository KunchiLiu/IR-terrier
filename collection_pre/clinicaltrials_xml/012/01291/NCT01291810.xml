	<brief_summary>The safety and immunogenicity of the TNFα-Kinoid (TNF-K) have been evaluated in a phase I-II clinical study conducted in subjects with Crohn's Disease (CD). Preliminary results of clinical efficacy are promising. The principal aim of the present study is to confirm the clinical efficacy of the TNF-K in subjects with moderate to severe CD. Subjects with secondary resistance or intolerance to anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies will be enrolled in this trial. In addition, the immune responses and the safety elicited by TNF-K will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
