	<brief_summary>AKINESIS is a clinical study to assess the utility of blood and urine NGAL tests in predicting worsening kidney function in patients who present with acute heart failure (AHF) and who are treated with diuretics. It is believed that rising NGAL levels in the blood and/or urine can predict acute kidney injury. It is also believed that patients who are admitted to the hospital with high NGAL levels in the blood/urine will have poorer outcomes.</brief_summary>
