	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the use of a counterbalancing system of glucose and insulin infusion with frequent blood glucose monitoring and combined adaptive algorithm can produce tight glycemic control without hypoglycemia; study to develop a closed loop for use in intensive care units and surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Balanced Infusion System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is using an experimental design outpatient with individuals having treatment using an automated closed loop glucose control unit; glucoses are measured every 5 minutes using a intravenous glucose sensor and infusion of glucose and insulin are altered without manual intervention as directed by algorithm</detailed_description>
