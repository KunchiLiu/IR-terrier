	<brief_summary>Clomiphene citrate is commonly used for ovulation induction in women with anovulation, correction of luteal phase deficiency or for superovulation as empiric therapy for unexplained infertility. Superovulation using clomiphene, usually with intrauterine insemination, is usually regarded as first line therapy for unexplained infertility, infertility due to mild endometriosis, or infertility with mild or moderate compromise of the male factor. The side effect profile reported by some women using clomiphene citrate is similar to symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), including tension, irritability, depressed mood, affective lability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headache joint and muscle pain. Few studies have been performed to examine the relationship between clomiphene citrate and mood symptoms; however, these studies have been limited by their small sample size, potential for recall bias and lack of randomization. Moreover, the experience of infertility is dysphoric in and of itself. Therefore, a rigorous evaluation of whether, when in the cycle, and how often clomiphene is associated with mood changes is needed. Such a study would add to the body of literature on this topic in three important ways: 1) use of prospective data collection to more accurately identify commonly reported symptoms, 2) characterize the timing of symptom occurrence relative to treatment cycle, and 3) provide information relevant to planning of future studies involving targeted treatment of clomiphene citrate induced symptoms. If clomiphene use is shown to affect mood, the results would point to an important avenue for psychopharmacologic insight into relationships between mood and sex steroids. OBJECTIVES: Specific Aim #1: To identify psychological and physical symptoms experienced by women taking clomiphene citrate for superovulation in a prospective, placebo controlled trial setting. Specific Aim #2: To determine whether measures of the emotional and physical state prior to the administration of clomiphene, predict the occurrence of mood changes during the five days of clomiphene administration and in the late follicular and luteal phases of the cycle in which clomiphene was administered.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to identify psychological and physical symptoms experienced by women taking clomiphene citrate for superovulation in a prospective setting. Clomiphene citrate is commonly used for ovulation induction in women with anovulation, correction of luteal phase deficiency or for superovulation as empiric therapy for unexplained infertility1. While clomiphene citrate is generally well tolerated, common side effects have been reported including vasomotor flushes, breast tenderness, pelvic discomfort, and mood swings. Visual changes, such as palenopsia are rarely reported2. The side effect profile reported by some women using clomiphene citrate is similar to symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms of PMDD include tension, irritability, depressed mood, affective lability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headache joint and muscle pain. Several validated scales have been used to record symptom occurrences and to characterize the timing of symptom occurrence relative to the menstrual cycle3. The psychological and mood side effects of clomiphene citrate in women undergoing infertility treatment have been studied to a limited degree. One study reported mood swings in 9 out of 14 women surveyed4. Another small study found a higher frequency of irritability, mood swings, feeling down and bloating in women undergoing fertility treatment who were taking clomiphene citrate compared to no medication.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Menstruating women, ages 2540, with regular menstrual cycles 2335 days in length who elect to treat unexplained infertility using clomiphene citrate for superovulation combined with intrauterine insemination will be eligible for participation in this study. Eligible participants will be identified by physicians at the Utah Center for Reproductive Medicine at the University of Utah and will be provided written informed consent before being randomized to treatment groups. Male partner's semen analysis must show a sperm density of at least 10 million per ml, and motility of 20% or greater and normal morphology using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Women with a history of depression or anxiety disorder requiring hospitalization or treatment lasting more than six months and women who currently or have received treatment during the previous six months for anxiety, depression or other psychiatric disorders listed in the 4th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV) will be excluded. Women who have previously received treatment with clomiphene citrate will also be excluded from the study. Women using tobacco or illicit drugs will be excluded from study participation. Because the measurement tool used to measure symptoms has been validated only in women who can read and speak English, women who cannot speak and read English will not be eligible to participate in the study.</criteria>
