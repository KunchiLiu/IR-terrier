	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and recommend a proper dose for our phase II study of S-1 when combined with radiation therapy for locally advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of S-1 in Combination With Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced or Recurrent Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I trial of S-1 given in treatment days with an oral dose from 30mg/m2/d to 80mg/m2/d, concurrently with radiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer. Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a standard manner. S-1 will be administered for 6 dose levels,30/40/50/60/70/80mg/m2/d. Patients will be assessed for acute toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE)3.0.</detailed_description>
