	<brief_summary>Hypomagnesemia is common in renal transplant recipients and is mainly because of enhanced renal magnesium wasting, caused by immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitors). Glucose metabolism disorders, including insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion, are also prevalent post-transplantation and often precede the development of diabetes. As magnesium supplementation has been demonstrated to increase insulin sensitivity in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, its potential therapeutic supplementation (post-transplantation) deserves further examination. The hypothesis is that magnesium supplementation in renal transplant recipients exerts a beneficial effect on insulin resistance and/or secretion.</brief_summary>
