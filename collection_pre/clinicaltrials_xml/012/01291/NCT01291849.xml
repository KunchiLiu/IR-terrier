	<brief_summary>After nasal surgery, emergence cough or straining will produce venous engorgement and increase bleeding from the surgical site, so the necessity for smooth extubation without severe cough during emergence provides a challenge for the anesthetists. Recently, remifentanil is commonly used short-acting opioid, and several studies have demonstrated the antitussive effect of remifentanil via effect-site target-controlled infusion during emergence. However, there may be gender difference in response to opioid, and the previous studies about antitussive effect of remifentanil are targeted at female patients and there is no investigation of effect site concentration of remifentanil for male patients undergoing nasal surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect-site concentration of remifentanil via target-controlled infusion for preventing cough in man after sevofluorane balanced anesthesia.</brief_summary>
