	<brief_summary>More hysterectomies are performed laparoscopically either as a total laparoscopic hysterectomy or as a laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery include quicker hospital discharge, a shorter convalescence and cost effectiveness when compared to open procedures. Laparoscopic hysterectomies (both total and vaginally assisted) can lead to discomfort which may lead to a delay in discharge from hospital. Continuous infusions of local anaesthetic agents given post operatively to the site of operation have the been subject of trials for several operative procedures. To date however there have not been any properly controlled studies evaluating whether there are benefits of giving a local anaesthetic infusion for 48 hours into the pelvis following a total or vaginally assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy. The investigators therefore propose to investigate whether giving a local anaesthetic infusion in this fashion decreases the amount of rescue and patient controlled analgesia needed, and length of hospital stay. In order to do this the investigators wish to conduct a randomised placebo controlled double blind trial.</brief_summary>
