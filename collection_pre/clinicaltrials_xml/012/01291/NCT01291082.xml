	<brief_title>Whole-body MR in Staging Bone and Soft Tissue Metastases in Breast Cancer Patients(MetaMaRBo)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 50 patients with a proven breast cancer and bone metastases will be included. First step : staging - nuclear bone scan - Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) - MR (whole body short tau inversion recovery (STIR)-sequence and T1-sequence and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI),no contrast administration Aim : - Validation of whole body diffusion weighted imaging in detection of bone metastases and visceral metastases, comparing to Bone scan en PET/CT results. - To calculate cut-off values for DWI for bone and visceral metastases. Second step : therapy follow-up/therapy assessment. - Two groups of patients (oncologist takes the decision about therapy) 1. Patients treated by chemotherapy 2. Patients treated by hormonal therapy - on week 3, 12-16 and 52 in the chemotherapy or hormonal therapy-setting, a whole body MR (same protocol, no contrast) will be performed. End-point: Whole body MR with DWI is useful and reliable to assess the treatment response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with a proven breast cancer (by biopsy or imaging) 2. Bone metastases proven by MR, PETCT or Bone. Patients with visceral metastases can be included if bone metastases are also present. 3. Patient with an informed consent. 1. Patients with a single bone metastasis treated by Radiotherapy will be excluded. 2. Patients with contraindication for MRI: pacemaker, cochlear implant, non MR compatible devices (Baclofenpump). 3. Claustrophobia 4. Patient in a bad general condition.</criteria>
