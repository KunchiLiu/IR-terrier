	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Gemcitabine or S-1 Adjuvant Therapy After Hemihepatectomy for Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no standard adjuvant therapy after liver hemi-hepatectomy due to bile duct cancer, because of high surgical morbidity ratio and high adverse event ratio of adjuvant therapy. For example, our preliminary results showed that regular gemcitabine administration (1000mg/m2, day1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks) after hemihepatectomy was too toxic and induced severe leukocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Herein, we planned this study to decide more safety adjuvant protocol(recommend dose) for gemcitabine and S-1 after hemihepatectomy using continual reassessment method analysis. In this study, we decided that tolerable ratio of dose-limiting toxicity would be less than 10%.</detailed_description>
