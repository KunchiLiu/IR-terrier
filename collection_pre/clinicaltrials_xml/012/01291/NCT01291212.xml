	<brief_summary>The investigators have previously demonstrated the utility of transdermal testosterone in in vitro fertilization (IVF) low responder patients. Now, the investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of luteinizing hormone (LH) activity added to recombinant follicular stimulating hormone (FSHr) during ovarian stimulation in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Activity in Low Responder Patients With Transdermal Testosterone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies in macaques have indicated that androgens have some synergistic effects with follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) on folliculogenesis. Our previous clinical studies demonstrated the usefulness of pretreatment with transdermal testosterone in low-responder IVF patients. There is controversy on the usefulness of recombinant luteinizing hormone (LHr) added to FSHr in ovarian stimulation of low responder patients. Thus, our present study has been designed to compare ovarian stimulation with FSHr alone versus LHr added to FSHr when transdermal testosterone pretreatment is used.</detailed_description>
