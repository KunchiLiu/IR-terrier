	<brief_title>Intracoronary Human Wharton's Jelly- Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (WJ-MSCs) Transfer in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been demonstrated that MSCs have the potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease. WJ-MSCs from the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients at least 18 years of age； 2. Patients with 1st acute STelevation myocardial infarction (AMI) who undergo successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3, but have a substantial residual left ventricular regional wallmotion abnormality measured by 2D echocardiography. 3. No contraindications to undergoing celltherapy procedure within 1 weeks after AMI and PCI. 4. Hemodynamic stability—defined as no requirement for intraaortic balloon pump or for inotropic or bloodpressure supporting medications. 5. Consent to protocol and agree to comply with all followup visits and studies. 1. Presence of cardiogenic shock ( defined as systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg requiring intravenous pressors or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation); 2. Major bleeding requiring blood transfusion after acute reperfusion treatment; 3. A history of leucopenia; 4. Thrombocytopenia; 5. Hepatic or renal dysfunction; 6. Evidence for malignant diseases; 7. Unwillingness to participate;</criteria>
