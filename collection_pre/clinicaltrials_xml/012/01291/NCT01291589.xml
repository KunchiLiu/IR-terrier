	<brief_title>HIV Prevention in Very High Risk Men Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an innovative program development project that will, over the next year, pilot test, in an open trial format an 8-session, individual, cognitive-behavioral therapy based, intervention on ten (10) HIV-infected men who have sex with men who report very high levels (&gt;10 episodes) of sexual transmission risk behavior (unprotected anal intercourse with serodiscordant partners). That is, to pilot test a novel prevention intervention designed to effect reductions in sexual transmission risk behavior among the riskiest men in the largest HIV risk group in the US. Effecting even modest reductions in the mean number of risk acts in this group will likely have substantial public health significance through the number of averted new HIV infections. Traditional secondary HIV intervention strategies (e.g., Information, Motivation, Behavior change (IMB)) models only have modest effects for HIV-positive MSM and there is evidence to suggest that these effects tend to diminish over time.</detailed_description>
