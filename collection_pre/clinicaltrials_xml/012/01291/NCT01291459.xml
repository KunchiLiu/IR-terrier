	<brief_summary>Background and Rationale Raltegravir and Maraviroc, the first in class of 2 new families of antiretroviral drugs have demonstrated a high potency in treatment experienced and naive patients. Both drugs appeared well tolerated with low metabolic toxicity. No data are currently available concerning the combination of these 2 drugs. Hypothesis Maraviroc + Raltegravir should be potent enough to maintain virological efficacy in naive patients infected by CCR5 HIV-1 previously treated for 6 months with a Maraviroc-Raltegravir-Tenofovir-Emtricitabine combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Maraviroc/Raltegravir for Naive HIV-1 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: - To establish the ability of a Maraviroc-Raltegravir combination to maintain HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml at week 48 in naive patients infected by CCR5 HIV-1, following an initial 6 month phase of Maraviroc-Raltegravir-Tenofovir-Emtricitabine combination (Intent to treat and strategy analysis) - To study CD4 progression from baseline to week 48 - To study the time to virological failure during the simplification phase of the study (from week 24 to week 48) - To study the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml at each time point - To study the kinetics of viral load decrease from baseline to week 12 - To study the kinetics of proviral DNA decrease from baseline to week 12, 24, 36 and 48 - To study the clinical and biological tolerance of Maraviroc-Raltegravir combination through week 48 Study Design/ Clinical Plan Pilot, multicenter, national, uncontrolled study</detailed_description>
