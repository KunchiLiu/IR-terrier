	<brief_summary>Tracheal intubation with traditional Macintosh laryngoscope is associated with increase in intraocular pressure along with tachycardia and hypertension. These effects are not desirable in ophthalmic patients especially in patients with glaucoma. GlideScope video laryngoscope system is a new approach for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. It does not require a direct line of sight to the glottis when intubating with the Glidescope and as a result intubation is much less stimulating to the patient. Therefore GlideScope video laryngoscope assisted intubation could be a preferable technique for intraocular surgery offering advantages in terms of intraocular pressure and cardiovascular stability.</brief_summary>
