	<brief_summary>Bariatric operations such as the gastric bypass procedure provide a unique in vivo model of improvement of pathological beta cell function. The presented double-centre study aims to comprehensively investigate different aspects of beta cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with a wide range of disease duration after gastric bypass. In parallel, our project will address the aspects of changes in enteroinsular and adipoinsular axes as well as the early and late changes of other defined parameters after gastric bypass surgery.</brief_summary>
