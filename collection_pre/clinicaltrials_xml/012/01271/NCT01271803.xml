	<brief_summary>This open-label, dose-escalation study of vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in participants with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. Participants with previously untreated, BRAFV600E mutation-positive, locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic melanoma or those who have progressed on vemurafenib monotherapy immediately prior to enrolling in this trial are eligible. Participants will be assigned to different cohorts with escalating oral doses of vemurafenib and cobimetinib. This study consists of 2 stages, Stage 1 (Dose Escalation Stage [DES] and Cohort Expansion Stage [CES]) and the anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other discontinuation criterion is met.</brief_summary>
