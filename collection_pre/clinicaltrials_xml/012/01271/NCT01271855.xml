	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The routine use of belladonna/opium (B&amp;O) suppositories will improve patient's self-reported pain control in the first 24-hours after delivery. Commonly employed methods of controlling post-partum pain include opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, acetomenophen, and topical analgesics. Pain medication is generally administered via oral or IV route. Several studies have investigated suppositories as an alternative method of improving pain following delivery. Rectal analgesia provides a means of improving pain control through local effects on the perineum and uterus while possibly decreasing systemic absorption, which may in turn decrease systemic side effects and transmission to the newborn infant through breast milk. B&amp;O suppositories contain two medications that could potentially decrease post-partum pain. This quality may significantly improve pain from uterine contractions during the post-partum period.</brief_summary>
