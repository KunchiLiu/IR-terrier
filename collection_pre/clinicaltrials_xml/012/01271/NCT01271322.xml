	<brief_summary>Prospective, single-center, nonrandomized, explorative imaging study evaluating the value of PET as a predictor of histopathological response in metabolic non-responders Patients with resectable AEG (adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction) type I and II (cT3/4 and/or cN+ and cM0) Metabolic non-responders, showing a &lt;35% decrease of SUV (standardized uptake value) two weeks after the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible for the study and are taken to intensified taxane-based RCT (radiochemotherapy) before surgery. 18FDG-PET scans will be performed before (=Baseline) and after 14 days of standard neoadjuvant therapy as well after the first cycle of Taxotere/Cisplatin chemotherapy (=PET1) and at the end of intensified radiochemotherapy (PET2). Tracer uptake will be assessed semiquantitatively using standardized uptake values (SUV). The percentage difference Delta SUV=100(SUVBaseline-SUVPET1)/ SUVBaseline will be calculated and assessed as an early predictor of histopathological response. In a secondary analysis, the association between the difference SUVPET1 - SUVPET2 and histopathological response will be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HICON trial is a prospective, single-center, nonrandomized, explorative imaging study evaluating the value of PET (Positron emission tomography) as a predictor of histopathological response in metabolic non-responders Patients with resectable AEG (adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction) type I and II, staged cT3/4 and/or cN+ and cM0 by endoscopic ultrasound, spiral CT or MRI and FDG-PET are eligible. Tumors must be potentially R0 resectable and must have a sufficient FDG-baseline uptake. Only metabolic non-responders, showing a &lt;35% decrease of SUV (standardized uptake value) two weeks after the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible for the study and are taken to intensified taxane-based RCT (chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy) before surgery. 18FDG-PET scans will be performed before (=Baseline) and after 14 days of standard neoadjuvant therapy as well after the first cycle of Taxotere/Cisplatin chemotherapy (=PET1) and at the end of intensified radiochemotherapy (PET2). Tracer uptake will be assessed semiquantitatively using standardized uptake values (SUV). The percentage difference Delta SUV=100(SUVBaseline-SUVPET1)/ SUVBaseline will be calculated and assessed as an early predictor of histopathological response. In a secondary analysis, the association between the difference SUVPET1 - SUVPET2 and histopathological response will be evaluated..</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biopsyproven adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus (AEG type I) or cardia (AEG type II) with or without metastases in local lymph nodes (tumor stage cT3/T4, cNX, and cM0 in the tumornodemetastasis classification) Staging procedures include endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen. Eligible patients have to be fit for platincontaining chemotherapy Tumors must be potentially R0 resectable tumors during consecutive operation. Tumors must have demonstrated a minimal amount of FDGuptake in the baseline PETCT, defined as 18FDGuptake in tumor at first examination &gt; 1,35 x hepaticSUV + 2 x standarddeviation of hepaticSUV, and must be a metabolic nonresponder under EOX, defined as a decrease of the SUVmax of &lt;35% in a second PET on day 14 of chemotherapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score &gt;1 Previous or secondary malignancy Life expectancy of less than 3 months Uncontrolled bleeding from the tumor Tumor infiltration of the airways Pregnancy Uncontrolled diabetes Patients are also ineligible if they have undergone previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or endoscopic laser therapy.</criteria>
