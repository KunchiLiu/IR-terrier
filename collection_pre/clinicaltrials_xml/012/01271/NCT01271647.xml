	<brief_title>Classic Yin and Yang Tonic Formula for Osteopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis is a growing problem worldwide, with the greatest burden resulting from fractures. Nevertheless, the majority of fractures in adults occur in those with "osteopenia" (bone mineral density (BMD) only moderately lower than young normal individuals) Since life long drug therapy is an expensive option with uncertain consequences and side effect, natural herbal therapy offers an attractive alternative. The classic Yin and Yang Tonic Formula (eg.Zuogui Pill, Yougui Pill) have been used for osteoporosis or osteopenia in traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) for a long time. For this reason, Chinese guidelines for the treatment of osteopenia include natural herbal therapy, however, there is currently no randomize placebo controlled trial to verify the efficacy for treating low BMD. This trial is randomized, double blind, placebo controlled design. Results of this study will provide evidence regarding the value of the classic Yin and Yang tonic formula as an intervention for increase BMD and decreasing fracture risk in osteopenia. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action can be identified by this study.</detailed_description>
