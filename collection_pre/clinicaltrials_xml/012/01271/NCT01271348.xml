	<criteria>Signed and dated informed consent prior to participation Subjects in good health as determined by the Investigator Age 1840 or 5070 BMI &gt; 20 and &lt; 30 Pain in the target muscle (thigh) during muscle contraction of at least 5 on an 11 point categorical pain rating scale Willing to abstain from any physical therapy, hard physical work, exercise or sauna during the study treatment periods (Screening to Final Visit) For females, subjects of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who have had a menstrual period within 1 year) must be using appropriate birth control (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, some intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner). Oral contraceptive medications are not allowed in this study. Female subjects, who are surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) are allowed for participation Participation in another clinical study within the last 30 days and during the study Subjects who are inmates of psychiatric wards, prisons, or other state institutions Investigator or any other team member involved directly or indirectly in the conduct of the clinical study Pregnancy or lactation Alcohol or drug abuse Malignancy within the past 2 years with the exception of in situ removal of basal cell carcinoma Known hypersensitivity to etoricoxib or other NSAIDÂ´s including Cox2, or any of their excipients Bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal congestion, angioneurotic edema, urticaria or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs including Cox2 inhibitors Major traumatic lesions (e.g. fracture, tendon or muscle ruptures) of the musculosceletal system of the lower limbs Pain conditions which might interfere with pain rating during the study, e.g. neuropathic pain Significant neurological or psychiatric symptoms resulting in disorientation, memory impairment, or inability to report accurately (e.g. depressive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or other psychosis), that in the investigator's opinion may affect efficacy or safety assessments or may compromise subject safety during the study Heart failure (NYHA IIIV) Long term blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm Hg without adequate treatment Peripheral arterial disease, coronary heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease History of stroke or myocardial infarction Clinically relevant ECG changes Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min Liver dysfunction (e.g. defined by ALT and/or AST levels above upper limit of normal range) Coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis, or concomitant use of anticoagulants including low dose aspirin History of pancreatitis, peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleedings Inflammatory GI disease (e.g. M. Crohn, colitis ulcerosa) Any other analgesic therapy including cough and cold drugs containing analgesic properties as well as any other substance used for the treatment of pain during the study observation period (Screening to final Visit) Any other drug that might alter pain perception like CNS active drugs Statins within 3 months of screening and throughout the study Oral anticonceptives</criteria>
