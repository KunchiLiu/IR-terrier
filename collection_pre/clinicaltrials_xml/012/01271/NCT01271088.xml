	<brief_summary>Peritonitis is currently one of the leading complications of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Aminoglycosides and vancomycin are used in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis despite their potential risk for ototoxicity. NAC is a molecule used in the treatment and prophylaxis of many diseases related to oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to examine whether ototoxicity due to antibiotics used in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis can be prevented by N-acetylcysteine</brief_summary>
