	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of GFT505 80mg in reducing serum Triglycerides (TG) and increasing High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels compared with placebo in atherogenic dyslipidaemic patients with abdominal obesity, and to assess the tolerability and safety of once-a-day administrations of oral doses of GFT505 during 28 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study With GFT505 (80mg) in Atherogenic Dyslipidaemic Patients With Abdominal Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study period per patient is 7 to 14 weeks: a screening period (1 to 8 weeks) will precede a 4-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week follow-up period. During the screening period, patients will be asked to start or continue adequate diet and exercise and to stop their lipid-lowering medication (for not treatment-naïve patients). For patient taking any lipid-regulating medication, a minimum of 8-week wash-out from lipid-regulating therapies (fibrates, statins, …) is required.</detailed_description>
