	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that dobutamine is able to revert negative redistribution of flow by inducing a selective vasodilatory effect on hypoperfused territories, particularly at the sublingual and gastric mucosa, and at the peripheral tissues. The investigators designed a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study looking at the acute physiologic effects of 5 mcg/kg/min fixed-dose of dobutamine on cardiac function, microcirculation, gastric mucosal, hepatosplanchnic, and peripheral perfusion in septic shock patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that dobutamine is able to revert negative redistribution of flow by inducing a selective vasodilatory effect on hypoperfused territories, particularly at the sublingual and gastric mucosa, and at the peripheral tissues. Therefore, dobutamine improves microcirculatory alterations and regional perfusion in septic shock, independent of its effects on cardiac output. The relevance of this concept is that it would support a more rational use of dobutamine in septic shock patients, not only as an inotrope to increase cardiac output, but more important, as a selective vasodilator aimed at restoring perfusion. Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study looking at the acute physiologic effects of 5 mcg/kg/min fixed-dose of dobutamine on cardiac function, microcirculation, gastric mucosal, hepatosplanchnic, and peripheral perfusion in septic shock patients.</detailed_description>
