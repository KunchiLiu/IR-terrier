	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of incorporating avocados in meals on post-ingestion glycemic index, insulin response, sensations of satiety and on appetite-related gastrointestinal peptide and hormone release. Also the effect of consuming avocado containing meals on the caloric intake of participants in subsequent eating episodes will be explored. Each subject will participate in one intervention for one day, wait one or two weeks, come for another intervention, wait one or two weeks and come for a final intervention- three in total. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences. Postprandial response to the control and two avocado-containing test meals will be assessed and compared using a 3 x 3 single blind cross-over design. The Subjects will be between 25 and 60 years old, female or male, with a BMI of 23 to 32, stable weight, no sports involvement, non-smoking and not dependent on caffeine. Thirty subjects will be recruited.</brief_summary>
