	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Anticoagulation in Chinese Patients With Non-ST Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-ST-elevated acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS)are the leading cause of emergency medical care in the USA. In China, these syndromes have also become the major causes of morbidity and mortality and account for several thousands of death and hospitalizations annually. Anti-platelet drugs, anticoagulants and intervention therapy for high-risk NSTE-ACS patients may increase bleeding events while reducing ischemic coronary events. There are some evidences supporting the association between hemorrhagic complications and short- and long-term mortality. Therefore, future advances in antithrombotic therapy for NSTE-ACS need to focus on reducing ischemic event rates without increasing hemorrhagic complication rates. In this general framework, there is the need for an appropriate adoption of the available evidences concerning therapeutic strategies, specifically the use of the different antithrombotic strategies, in real world patients in order to further improve their outcomes.The primary objective of this study is to describe the clinical epidemiology of Chinese patients with NSTE-ACS, and to evaluate their current management in China. This study will be an observational survey, thus zero interference is emphasized throughout it. No randomization, blinding or special treatment will be assigned for the subjects. Issues concerning the care of subjects are completely left to the discretion of investigators in order to collect the real-world information about the pharmacological treatments for NSTE-ACS patients in china.</detailed_description>
