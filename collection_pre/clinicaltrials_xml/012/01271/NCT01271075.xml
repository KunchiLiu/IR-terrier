	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, triple cross-over, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, mechanisms, and safety of treatment with the antihistamine bilastine in patients with cold contact urticaria (CCU). Efficacy is primarily assessed by a change in critical stimulation time thresholds (CSTT) and critical temperature thresholds (CTT) after treatment with different dosages of bilastine (20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg). Following a baseline period of 2-4 weeks, patients are randomized to either group A or group B. In group A they are given bilastine 20 mg, 40 mg, placebo and bilastine 80 mg for 7 days each followed by a 14-day washout period at a time. In group B they are given bilastine 80 mg, placebo, 40 mg and 20 mg for 7 days each followed by a 14-day washout period at a time. CSTT and CTT testings are performed at each of 6 visits, skin microdialysis for the assessment of mast cell mediators is performed at V2, V3 and V6. Visits for investigator's assessments are scheduled at day -14 to -28, day 0, day 7, day 28, day 49, and day 70. Overall a max. of 20 subjects with cold contact urticaria will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
