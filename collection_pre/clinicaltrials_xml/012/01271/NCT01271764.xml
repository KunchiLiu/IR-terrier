	<brief_summary>Tumor invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death. Some studies have found that histone methyltransferases, such as EZH2, specifically affect metastasis in breast, gastric and prostate cancer. The functional roles of other members of the HMT family such as G9a in cancer remain obscure. Therefore, the investigators will investigate whether G9a have a role in recurrence/metastasis of endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
