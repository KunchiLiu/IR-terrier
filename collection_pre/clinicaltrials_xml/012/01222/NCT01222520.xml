	<brief_summary>If a patient cannot have his or her blood pressure controlled with telmisartan 80 mg, an antihypertensive drug from different class should be started concomitantly. In the Japanese 3x3 factorial trial of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in essential hypertension patients whose diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are equal or more than 95 mmHg, the DBP control rate (less than 90 mmHg) after 8 weeks treatment of the telmisartan 80 mg monotherapy group (66 patients) was 41.5%. There should be medical needs of the telmisartan 80 mg and amlodipine 5 mg fixed dose combination because some patients cannot have his or her blood pressure controlled with telmisartan 80 mg. Thus, this clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the antihypertensive effect and safety of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug of 2 antihypertensive agents with different pharmacological effects, telmisartan 80 mg and amlodipine 5 mg (T80/A5 mg), compared with telmisartan 80 mg (T80 mg) monotherapy in Japanese patients with essential hypertension who fail to respond adequately to treatment with the maximum dose of telmisartan 80 mg monotherapy. In this trial, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group comparison method is employed.</brief_summary>
