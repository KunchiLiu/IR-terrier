	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well vinorelbine tartrate and cyclophosphamide work in combination with bevacizumab or temsirolimus in treating patients with recurrent or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine tartrate and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of rhabdomyosarcoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective when given together with bevacizumab or temsirolimus in treating rhabdomyosarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine Tartrate and Cyclophosphamide in Combination With Bevacizumab or Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: l. To determine the feasibility of administering bevacizumab in combination with intravenous vinorelbine (vinorelbine tartrate) and cyclophosphamide (VC) in patients with recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). II. To determine the feasibility of administering temsirolimus in combination with VC in patients with recurrent RMS. III. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) of patients with recurrent/refractory RMS treated with bevacizumab and VC and compare with the EFS of those treated with temsirolimus and VC. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the initial (2 cycle) response rate of patients with recurrent/refractory RMS treated with bevacizumab and VC and compare with the response rate of those treated with temsirolimus and VC, and to also compare the best response rate on each regimen of protocol therapy. II. To evaluate surrogate biological markers in patients with recurrent RMS and to estimate differences in these markers following treatment with bevacizumab and temsirolimus. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate intravenously (IV) over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Patients also receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>
