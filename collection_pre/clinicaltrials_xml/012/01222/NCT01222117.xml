	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this Phase 2 study is to optimize Plasmin delivery by comparing different delivery regimens in patients with peripheral arterial occlusion. The study includes a blinded plasminogen activator treatment group and a blinded plasminogen activator placebo group. The study will also assess safety and tolerability of Plasmin at 150 and 250 mg doses.</brief_summary>
