	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this research is to assess whether both the "60 second Brain Game" and the "Brain Speed Test" computer-based programs can be used as assessment tools for objectively defining the severity of the functional impact of tinnitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Processing Speed as an Objective Measure of Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study aims to assess for deficits in brain processing speed and attention (two cognitive domains whose deficits have been implicated in tinnitus) with the use of the "Brain Speed Test".</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 80. Participants must have subjective, unilateral or bilateral, nonpulsatile tinnitus of 6months duration or longer. Participants must be able to read, write and speak using the English language. Participants must be able to provide informed consent. Participants with tinnitus related to Workman's Compensation Claim or other litigationrelated situations. Participants with active diagnoses of any acute or chronic brainrelated neurological conditions that alter normal brain anatomy or function including Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, cerebral infarcts, traumatic brain injury, history of brain tumor(s), epilepsy, or dementia. Participants with tinnitus related to retrocochlear lesions, cochlear implants, or other known anatomic/structural lesions of the brain, skullbase, temporal bone or ear. Participants unable to hear the highest volume of the computerbased objective assessments. Any medications that may affect or alter cognition including but not limited to sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or opiates. Any medical condition the PI determines would compromise the safety of the participant or complicate the interpretation of the study results.</criteria>
