	<brief_summary>This study aims to test a dietary intervention for diabetes in a medical practice setting, with the aim of developing a model for diabetes care that can be used widely. The investigators hypothesize that a low-fat vegan diet will be effective for management of diabetes and will be feasible in a practice-based setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Practice Based Nutrition Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the nutrition intervention (low fat, low-GI vegan diet) improves glycemic control, body weight, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and indices of renal function in a within-group analysis. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the nutrition intervention (low fat, low-GI vegan diet) is more effective than standard nutrition care for improving glycemic control, body weight, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and indices of renal function in individuals with type 2 diabetes Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that a low-fat vegan diet is sustainable among individuals with type 2 diabetes for a 20-week period, with weekly classes, and in a follow-up period of one year with limited professional support. Specific Aim 4 tests the hypothesis that a low-fat vegan diet has an acceptability that is comparable to that of standard nutrition care among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Specific Aim 5 tests the hypothesis that the effects of the dietary interventions on A1c and body weight are reduced in individuals with the A1 allele of the Taq1A and Taq1B polymorphism</detailed_description>
