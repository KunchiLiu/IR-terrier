	<brief_summary>This K23 award application is relevant to multiple topic areas in the recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) research priority list, as well as the recent IOM report brief and White House "Let's Move" Campaign focused on childhood obesity. The US prevalence of childhood-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes, both predictors of cardiovascular risk, have increased to epidemic proportions in recent decades. Children with mental illness, especially those treated with antipsychotic medications, are at additional risk for obesity and related risk conditions. Despite known increases in obesity-related outcomes, including premature mortality, associated with childhood-onset versus adult-onset obesity, there remains an under-appreciation of these risks in children. A variety of noninvasive techniques to assess cardiometabolic risk have begun to be applied in children, including carotid intima media thickness (IMT) measured by ultrasound, and hepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) measured by 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). These measures allow for the early, noninvasive study of metabolic risk. Unfortunately, none of these promising methods have been applied to the high-risk population of children with psychiatric disorders, and cardiac triglyceride content has not been evaluated in children at all, preventing accurate characterization of risk or the effectiveness of interventions the reduce risk in this vulnerable population. The overall aim of this two-study research plan is to characterize the level of measurable risk using these sensitive markers in treated and untreated children with mental health disorders, and to evaluate the magnitude of change in risk that can be observed using these biomarkers in children receiving a well established behavioral weight-loss intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed research seeks to increase knowledge regarding biomarkers of metabolic risk in children with mental health conditions, building on measures of body composition and insulin sensitivity used in MEAC. This project will utilize sensitive, early biomarkers of disease risk, including hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) and carotid IMT, directly relevant to diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, respectively. The overall aim is to characterize metabolic risk associated with weight using these sensitive biomarkers in children with mental health disorders, and to evaluate the magnitude of change observed in these biomarkers in children receiving an established behavioral weight-loss intervention. This will be accomplished in two phases. Study PHASE 1 will involve piloting testing a 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention, as well as feasibility of evaluating HTCG and IMT values in 3-5 overweight/obese psychiatrically ill youth ages 6-18 who are treated with antipsychotic medications. Aim 1: To test the feasibility of delivering an existing family-based behavioral weight loss program in families of psychiatrically ill youth who are overweight or obese. Primary Hypotheses: psychiatrically ill youth and their families can participate in an existing intensive behavioral weight loss intervention. Study PHASE 2 will involve a randomized controlled trial, testing the effects of a family based weight loss intervention on weight and metabolic biomarkers in overweight or obese mentally ill children (30) compared to age-, gender- and BMi%ile-matched healthy controls (30). Participants in the antipsychotic treated group will be randomized 2:1 to either weekly "study" group or a monthly "standard of care" group. A group of healthy controls will receive the weekly "study" treatment (20) and a reference group will receive the monthly standard of care condition (10). In addition, a pilot study will be performed to determine the feasibility and explore associations between obesity treatment response, measures of executive functioning and reward sensitivity, and rs-fcMRI of the default mode network (DMN) and reward networks in antipsychotic-treated and healthy control youth participating in the 17-week behavioral weight loss parent study as described above. Each participant in this pilot study will undergo baseline fMRI brain imaging and cognitive processing evaluation. Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of 17-weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on DEXA-measured whole body adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children compared with healthy controls. Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of 17-weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on hepatic tissue triglyceride concentration (HTGC) in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children compared with healthy controls. Aim 3: To evaluate the effect of 17-weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on carotid IMT in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children compared with healthy controls. Aim 4: To characterize baseline cognitive processing in 15-20 obese antipsychotic-treated and healthy control youth prior to participation in a 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention. Aim 5: Characterize baseline brain volumetric and resting state functional connectivity in 15-20 obese antipsychotic-treated and healthy control youth prior to engagement in a 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention. Primary Hypothesis: Change in DEXA-measured total fat and HGTC/IMT will be more pronounced in the weight loss intervention groups compared to diet and exercise education alone. Exploratory Aims: To evaluate changes in standard cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., fasting lipids, insulin, glucose, adiponectin, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and very low density lipoprotein particle size) and differences in adherence to an intervention between mentally ill and non-mentally ill youth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PHASES 1 and 2: i) 618 years old (at any point during study participation); ii) BMI percentile &gt; 85; iii) Meet DSMIV criteria for one or more childhood onset psychiatric disorders including disruptive behavior disorders (attention deficit disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified), affective disorders (bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder and mood disorder not otherwise specified), anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, social and other specific phobias) as well as other disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger's Syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), psychotic disorders (schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified) and movement disorders (tic disorder, Tourette's Syndrome) as determined by semistructured diagnostic interview and/or clinical evaluation, and/or psychiatric symptom assessments and/or ABC, described below in Sources and Materials, as deemed appropriate by the PI (EXCEPT for the Obese or Overweight Control Group in PHASE 2, none of whom can meet criteria for any DSMIV Axis I psychiatric illness); iv) Currently treated with an atypical antipsychotic medication (EXCEPT for the Obese or Overweight Healthy Control Group in PHASE 2, none of whom can be treated with any psychotropic medications; v) Participants treated with any psychotropic medication may not have any medication changes for 1 month prior to study enrollment at the discretion of the PI, and AntipsychoticTreated Participants must be treated with an antipsychotic &gt; approximately 12 weeks with no antipsychotic medication dose changes for 1 month; vi) The Healthy Overweight or Obese Control Group of PHASE 2 may not be currently taking any prescription medications (multivitamins, over the counter medications, glucocorticoid nasal spray and inhalers are permitted, as well as nonsedating antihistamines such as but not limited to Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine); and vii) Participants between 617 years old will be able to give assent and have a parent/guardian that can provide written informed consent, and 18 yearold participants will be able to provide written informed consent.
