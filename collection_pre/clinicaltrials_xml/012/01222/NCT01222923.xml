	<detailed_description>A single dose two way crossover bioequivalence study in 40 normal healthy males and females was utilized to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Risperidone ODT (orally dissolving tablet) formulations. The test product was a 1 mg ODT tablet formulation of Risperidone manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. The reference product was commercially available Risperidone 1 mg ODT tablets (Risperdal®), Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, LP. Each single oral dose (1 mg) will be administered orally as a 1 mg tablet. Blood samples were collected at intervals over a 72-hour period after medication administration.
