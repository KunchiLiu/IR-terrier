	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CetuGEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with EGFR positive, locally advanced and/or metastatic solid cancers. The effect of CetuGEX™ on the development of anti-drug antibodies and on tumour response will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

Written informed consent must be obtained prior to conducting any studyspecific procedures For Expansion Phase only: 10. No prior treatment with Cetuximab allowed 1. Chemotherapy, radiation, other anticancer therapies including any investigational agents at the study enrolment within 4 weeks prior to study enrolment 2.
