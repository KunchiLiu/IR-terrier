	<brief_summary>Obtain a preliminary assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the sustained lost weight (SLW) intervention in a real-world clinical setting for patients who have completed a 21-week very low calorie diet (VLCD). Hypothesis: Intervention will be feasible to implement as evidenced by the ability to recruit and retain participants and acceptable to participants as evidenced by self-report of satisfaction with the program and adoption of weight maintenance behaviors. Secondary Aim: Obtain a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the sustained lost weight (SLW) intervention for patients who have completed 21 weeks of a very low calorie diet (VLCD). Hypothesis: Greater than 75% of participants who receive this novel approach, where maintenance behaviors are individualized based on resting metabolic rate and a physical activity factor, will regain greater or equal to 10 kg. at week 52 follow-up.</brief_summary>
