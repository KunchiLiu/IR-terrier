	<brief_title>Bendamustine and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is a protein conformation disorder due to a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia. There are no established and approved second-line therapies for patients with systemic AL amyloidosis who fail initial melphalan-based treatment, be it high-dose melphalan with stem cell transplant or oral melphalan and dexamethasone (MDex). Therefore new treatments are needed for those who fail initial therapy and for those who initially respond but subsequently relapse. Therapy of AL is generally based on treatment regimens used in multiple myeloma (MM). Bendamustine achieves partial response with relapsed/refractory MM. Based on this high anti-MM activity, we anticipate that bendamustine will also be very active in clonal plasma cell disorder associated with AL.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years old Histopathology of amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease based on detection by polarizing microscopy of green birefringent material in Congo redstained tissue specimens or characteristic electron microscopy appearance or immunohistochemical stain with antilight chain antisera Demonstrate measurable disease as defined by one or more of the following: Serum monoclonal protein ≥ 0.5 g/dL by serum electrophoresis Urine monoclonal protein &gt; 200 mg/dL in a 24 hr urine electrophoresis Serum immunoglobulin free light chain ≥ 5 mg/dL AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda free light chain ratio. The difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains should be ≥ 5 mg/dL (dFLC) Demonstrate clonal population of plasma cells in the bone marrow or immunohistochemical stain with antilight chain antisera of amyloid fibrils ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Patients had at least one prior regimen consisting of at least 1 cycle If not previously transplanted, patient should be either ineligible for ASCT, or must have declined the option of ASCT. Patients who have previously had ASCT and have subsequently progressed are eligible, provided other entry criteria are met Ability to provide written informed consent obtained prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl (May transfuse PRBC to meet parameter) Platelets ≥ 100x 10^9/L (Must be independent of platelet transfusion) Calculated CrCl greater than or equal to 30 mL/min (CockcroftGault Formula ) AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN Serum potassium within normal limits Total serum calcium (corrected for serum albumin) or ionized calcium ≤ ULN Patients meeting the criteria for symptomatic MM: lytic lesions on skeletal survey or plasmacytoma Patients meeting International Myeloma Working Group definition of symptomatic myeloma with symptoms only related to associated amyloidosis who would otherwise only meet the criteria for smoldering MM are potentially eligible Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities (not including 1st degree AVblock, Wenckebach type 2nd degree heart block, or left bundle branch block. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator or an authorized physician subinvestigator as not medically relevant). Note: There is no lower limit of left ventricular ejection fraction below which patients are excluded from participation. Patients with NTproBNP ≥ 1800nb/L or BNP ≥ 400 ng/L, abnormal cTnT or cTnI Patient has received other investigational drugs within 14 days prior to enrollment Any form of secondary / familial amyloidosis Serious concurrent illness, which in the opinion of the investigator or an authorized physician subinvestigator would interfere with participation in this clinical study, Known HIV infection. Inability to provide informed consent or to comply with the schedule of office and treatment visits Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women(woman not of childbearing potential is defined as any woman whose menstrual periods have stopped in the past 12 consecutive months or have had a complete hysterectomy or both ovaries surgically removed). Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, lowrisk prostate cancer, or cancer after curative treatment.</criteria>
