	<brief_summary>This study examines the impact of fosamprenavir as part of an ART on virological, immunological and clinical parameters of genotype 1 HCV infection in HIV co-infected subjects. Fosamprenavir could have a direct or immune-mediated activity against HCV. If this is shown to be true, changes in HCV viral load or biological characteristics could be demonstrated.</brief_summary>
