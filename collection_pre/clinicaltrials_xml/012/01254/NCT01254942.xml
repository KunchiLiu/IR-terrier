	<brief_summary>This is a parallel Randomized Controlled Trial comparing two different delivery modes of post hip fracture managementâ€”a specialized Fracture Follow-up Clinic versus Usual Care alone. The Fracture Follow-up Clinic will focus on bone health and fall risk factors. The investigators will evaluate the effect of the clinic and exercise program on mobility and falls. The investigators primary hypothesis is that within the first year following a hip fracture, older adults who are assessed in the B4 Clinic and prescribed an exercise program will have significantly improved Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores compared with participants who receive usual care alone.</brief_summary>
