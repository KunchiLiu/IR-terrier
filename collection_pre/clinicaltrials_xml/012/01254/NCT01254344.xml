	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertapenem sodium compared with ceftriaxone sodium/metronidazole for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection following elective colorectal surgery in Chinese adults. This study is designed to demonstrate that ertapenem sodium is non-inferior to ceftriaxone sodium/metronidazole in this participant population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant is scheduled to undergo elective colon or colorectal surgery by laparotomy that is scheduled in advance with adequate time prior to surgery to complete preoperative bowel preparation. Participant is a Chinese adult between the ages of more than 18 years old and less than 81 years old. Participant is highly unlikely to conceive. Participant is undergoing emergency colon or colorectal surgery. Participant requires a second planned colorectal surgery or other surgery requiring antibiotic prophylaxis within the 4week followup period. Participant is undergoing laparoscopicassisted surgery. Participant is undergoing an isolated rectal procedure. Participant has a decompensated intestinal obstruction. Participant has active inflammatory bowel disease involving the colon (i.e., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). Participant is scheduled to undergo an elective colorectal procedure for revision of a previous operation involving a large bowel resection. Participant has a bacterial infection at the time of surgery. Participant requires or is anticipated to need the administration of other (nonstudy therapy) systemic antimicrobial therapy within 1 week prior to surgery or at any time during this study. Participant is anticipated to receive either antibiotic or antiseptic peritoneal lavage during the surgery. Participant has a history of serious allergy, hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis), or any serious reaction to ertapenem sodium, ceftriaxone sodium, metronidazole, penicillin, or any cephalosporin, beta(Î²)lactam, or nitroimidazole agents. Participant is breast feeding or plans to breast feed prior to the completion of the study period. Participant has neutropenia. Participant with immunosuppression due to an underlying disease, chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or use of highdose corticosteroids. Participant has a rapidly progressive or terminal illness. Participant is considered unlikely to survive through the expected 4week study period.</criteria>
