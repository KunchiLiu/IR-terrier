	<brief_summary>This study is aimed to answer the clinical question of the prevalence of myocardial scar in asymptomatic patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a special focus on the diagnostic efficacy of Xenetix® 350-enhanced 64-rows MDCT for the visualisation of the coronary arterial tree and secondarily for the assessment of myocardial viability when using Dotarem® enhanced-cardioMR as the gold standard examination.</brief_summary>
