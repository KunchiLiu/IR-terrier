	<brief_summary>Introduction: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a significant health problem increasing in both incidence and prevalence. It calls into attention consensus about diagnosing, assessing symptoms and treatment of patients with CRS. Therefore a validated Danish measure of health-related quality of life in sinonasal disease is needed. Method: The Sinonasal Outcome measure 22 (SNOT-22) was translated into Danish and reproducibility was evaluated by test-retesting 40 patients with CRS. The statistical analyses used, were Pearson´s correlation coefficient, Cronbach´s alfa, Kappa and Bland-Altman´s Plot. Reproducibility was also tested looking at subscales within the SNOT-22. Result: The results show good internal correlation with Cronbach´s alfa at 0.83 in the initial test and 0.92 in the retest. Pearson was 0.70 (p&lt;0.001) revealing good correlation between the initial scores and the retests scores. Kappa was calculated for each item with a mean value of 0.61 showing substantial agreement. Paired t-test revealed no significant difference in the subscales. Conclusion: The Danish version of SNOT-22 is recommended for Danish clinicians and researches as a patient-reported measure of outcome in sino-nasal disorders such as rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis.</brief_summary>
