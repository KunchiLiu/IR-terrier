	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that preservative-free tafluprost (MK-2452) is non-inferior to preservative-free timolol maleate with respect to the diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) change from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy in participants with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</brief_summary>
