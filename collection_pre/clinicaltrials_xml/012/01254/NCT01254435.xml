	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is the gold standard investigation in the screening of colorectal neoplasms. The investigators hypothesise that visualisation of the colonic mucosa on extubation may be improved by changing patient position as follows: left lateral position for the right colon, supine for the transverse colon and right lateral position for the left colon(fixed positioning). The investigators aim to validate our hypothesis by performing a randomised control study, comparing mucosal visualisation in patients placed in the 'routine' positions at the discretion of the endoscopist with visualisation in those placed in the above described positions. The hypothesis is that fixed positioning confers an advantage.</brief_summary>
