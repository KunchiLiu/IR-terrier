	<brief_summary>Event-related potentials (ERPsï¼‰has the advantage of excellent temporal resolution on measuring real-time neural activities that reflect to higher level cognitive processes. A research project related to lesion studies in which patients with cognitive function impairment and communication disorder will be recruited as participants to examine their impairment as well as residual abilities by using ERPs. Hopefully, expected findings will provide further analysis based on the patterns of neural activities revealed by both patients and normal controls should be able to provide important evidence toward building the cross-linguistic theory. The findings also have applications on diagnostic and evaluation for patients with brain lesions for clinical application with communication disorder.</brief_summary>
