	<brief_title>F-18 PET Bone Scans Versus Tc-99m Bone Scans for the Diagnosis of Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compare the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-Fluoride PET bone scans versus traditional 99mTc-MDP bone scans for detecting bone metastases. Determine if there is a significant change in clinical management between the two types of scans. Measure and compare the number of equivocal or uncertain findings that would have caused additional testing, particularly additional imaging studies, to be performed for confirmation when using 18F-Fluoride PET bone scans versus 99mTc-MDP bone scans. To quantify any adverse events resulting from either scan. To perform subgroup analyses according to cancer cell type.</detailed_description>
