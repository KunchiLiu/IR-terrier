	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to allow patients similar to that evaluated in the TROPIC trial (NCT00417079), and Investigators access to cabazitaxel for the management of metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (mHRPC) in those patients who have progressed during or after docetaxel and to document the overall safety of cabazitaxel in these patients. Please note that in each country, patient recruitment will end when cabazitaxel becomes commercially available.</brief_summary>
