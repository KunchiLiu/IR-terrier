	<brief_summary>The proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate a novel pharmacotherapy for hazardous drinking, HIV-infected men and women, using the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron. The investigators predict that participants who are treated with active doses of ondansetron will reduce their drinking more and show better HIV treatment participation and progress compared to participants who are treated with placebo. This study will provide important new safety and efficacy results on drinking and HIV outcomes following alcohol pharmacotherapy in HIV-infected persons.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ondansetron, Alcohol Use, and Alcohol-Related Symptoms In HIV+ Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hazardous drinking is particularly harmful in HIV-infected persons. It impairs the immune system, accelerates HIV disease progression, slows initiation of ART and decreases adherence. Thus, the development of effective alcohol treatments for this clinical population is particularly important. The investigators are proposing to investigate the effectiveness of ondansetron pharmacotherapy for the treatment of hazardous alcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence among HIV-infected patients. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, will be studied for several reasons: 1) evidence of effectiveness in persons who want to cut-down or reduce their drinking and who are not abstinent at medication initiation; 2) moderate-to-strong effects among early onset problem drinkers, a characteristic that is over represented in our clinic patients; 3) a very mild side-effect profile, making it an ideal pharmacotherapy candidate in patients who are often receiving multiple other medications with significant side-effects; and 4) its primary indication is for treatment of nausea, a common side-effect of antiretroviral (ARV) medications. The proposed study is a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of ondansetron for the treatment of hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorders among HIV-infected patients recruited from the Baltimore/Washington area. Participants will be genotyped for a functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene. They will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: placebo, low dose ondansetron (0.2 mg bid) and moderate dose ondansetron (0.8 mg bid). All subjects will undergo 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy in combination with medication management, and will be followed for 3 and 6 months after medication has ended.</detailed_description>
