	<brief_summary>Gut protein metabolism that could be influenced by protein supply is involved in the regulation of several physiological functions such as gut barrier function and represents a major contribution in the whole-body protein turnover. Intracellular pathways implicated in the transduction of amino acids effects remained unknown in the human gut. Thus, the aim of the present project is to evaluate and to understand the effects of amino acids (glutamine, leucine) on gut protein metabolism (synthesis and degradation) in young healthy humans.</brief_summary>
