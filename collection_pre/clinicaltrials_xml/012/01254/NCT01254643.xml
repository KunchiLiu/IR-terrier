	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V503 in Japanese girls between the ages of 9 and 15 and will determine whether V503 induces an acceptable immune response to all human papillomavirus (HPV) strains contained in the vaccine. The success criterion for the primary analysis requires that point estimates for seroconversion rate be greater than 90% for all 9 HPV types.</brief_summary>
