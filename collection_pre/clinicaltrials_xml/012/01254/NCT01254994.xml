	<brief_summary>To evaluate therapeutic efficacy and predicting factors of entecavir for treating patients with acute on chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF). A total of 108 patients with ACHBLF were allocated into either a treatment group (ETV group, n=53) or a control group (n=55). The HBV DNA level, liver function and survival condition of the patients were observed for 48 weeks after enrollment. The factors possibly related to entecavir treatment efficacy were also identified.</brief_summary>
