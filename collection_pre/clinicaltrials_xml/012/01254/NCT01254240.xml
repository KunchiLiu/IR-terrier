	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Two Choices of Phototherapy on Itching Skin Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with a skin disease and the given indication for a phototherapy with Ultraviolet B narrow-band (UVB narrowband, 311nm) with or without Ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm), the subjective pruritus levels and clinical severity will be measured before, during and after completion of the 16-week therapy (40 patients per group). Patients will be recruited in the department of dermatology of the University Hospital ZÃ¼rich in the outpatient clinic. Following oral and written consent, pruritus levels will be measured by a visual analogue scale and a new, detailed pruritus score 2 before start of therapy, every 4 weeks after start as well as after completion of the phototherapy. Phototherapy is to be administered 3 times per week. The study includes 5 study visits and up to 43 treatment visits that include administration of phototherapy only. A physical examination including clinical scores (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index PASI, Eczema Area and Severity Index EASI, Physician's static global assessment PSGA and Dermatology Dynamics Vector DDV) will be performed at every visit. During the first physical examination the Fitzpatrick-skin type of patient will be recorded, the demographics, the Body Mass Index (BMI), diagnosis, past medical history, co-morbidities, concomitant medication and the number of past UVA/B treatments.</detailed_description>
