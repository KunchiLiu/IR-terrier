	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study of IV PRM151 in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diffuse lung disease with a histological picture of usual interstitial pneumonia and a deteriorating clinical course. The prognosis is poor. Chronic alveolar inflammation with associated parenchymal remodeling is theorized to promote an ongoing abnormal fibrogenic repair response. Corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents have not been shown to benefit IPF patients. Recently several published clinical studies have indicated a strong correlation between IPF severity and/or disease progression and the levels of specific plasma biomarker proteins related to epithelial cell health and extracellular matrix turnover. PRM-151 is being developed for potential therapeutic uses to prevent, treat, and reduce fibrosis. This study is the first intravenous multiple-dose study in humans, and will be conducted in patients with IPF. Patients will be randomized to receive either PRM-151 or placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men or women of nonchildbearing potential aged 40 to 80 years at screening. Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as determined by high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests. History or presence of connective tissue disorder, tuberculosis (TB), cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis or other pulmonary disease except idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). History or presence of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, druginduced pulmonary toxicity, other forms of idiopathic pneumonia, or interstitial lung diseases associated with environmental exposure medication or systemic disease. High resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) findings inconsistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF).</criteria>
