	<brief_title>Burn Outcomes in Young Adult Burn Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study looks to understand previously collected outcomes scores. Identifying young adult burned patients at risk for poor outcomes remains an under-published field of study. We strive to identify problem areas for this population before they adversely effect their quality of life. How are these 19-30 year olds different from their non-burned counterparts and what interventions can we provide to equalize the balance?</detailed_description>
