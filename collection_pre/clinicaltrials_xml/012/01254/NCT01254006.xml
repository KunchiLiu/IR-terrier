	<criteria>Age (3080 years); Baseline Intraocular pressure (IOP) (2032 mmHg): average untreated Intra Ocular Pressure (IOP) for both eyes as determined from 2 to 4 visits within a 6months period; Central Corneal Thickness (CCT) (475650 Âµm): average of 3 different measurements from both eyes during the same visit; Pattern standard deviation (PSD) (0,503,00 dB) average of both eyes as stated on the most recent visual field index report Vertical Cup/Disk ratio (0,000,80): average of both eyes All these data were entered into a calculator specially designed for STAR (Scoring Tool for assessing risk) II parameter. The patients were divided into low, moderate and high risk groups according to the result given by the calculator. other ocular pathologies than glaucoma</criteria>
