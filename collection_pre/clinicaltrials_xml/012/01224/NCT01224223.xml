	<brief_summary>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been studied for their ability to suppress T cell responses in vivo and in vitro. As a result, MDSC can regulate cellular responses to chronic inflammatory conditions such as cancer, leading to the induction of tolerance and, ultimately, tumor escape from immune surveillance.</brief_summary>
