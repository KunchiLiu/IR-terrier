	<detailed_description>Tonsillitis and pharyngitis are the most common upper respiratory tract infections. The signs and symptoms are sore throat, difficulty with swallowing and/or inflamed tonsils and/or pharynx. In most cases these infections are viral in origin. Tinoridine is a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug with a different mechanism of action than common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and thereby inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of tinoridine in the treatment of pain and inflammation in patients with acute tonsillitis and/or acute pharyngitis of nonbacterial origin versus placebo.</detailed_description>
