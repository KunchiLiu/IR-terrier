	<brief_summary>The aim of the Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) therapy is to treat and prevent bleeding episodes due to abnormal platelet adhesion and abnormal blood coagulation as a result of low or abnormal Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and/or Factor VIII (FVIII) levels. The long-term efficacy and safety of a VWF/FVIII concentrate, Biostate, will be investigated in children, adolescents, and adults with VWD in whom treatment with a VWF product is required for prophylactic therapy, haemostatic control during surgery, or control of a non-surgical, spontaneous, or traumatic bleeding event.</brief_summary>
