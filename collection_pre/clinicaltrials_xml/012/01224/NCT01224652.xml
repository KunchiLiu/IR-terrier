	<criteria>Histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma in tissue/cell Recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer that has progressed following first line therapy Patients must be ≥18 years of age. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 At least one lesion (measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable) according to RECIST criteria Normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 2 weeks prior to administration of study treatment as defined below: Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL White blood cells (WBC) ≥ 3000/µL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/µL Platelet count ≥ 100 x 103/µL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit (UNL) Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min or Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x UNL unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be ≤ 5x UNL Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. Written informed consent Provision of informed consent for genetic research (In case of optional genetic research) More than one prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of gastric cancer in the metastatic or recurrent setting. Treatment with any investigational product during the last 14 days (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). Any previous treatment with a taxane, including paclitaxel and docetaxel or irinotecan, in the metastatic or recurrent setting. Patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated non melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥5 years. Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), within 2 weeks from the last dose prior to study treatment (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). Ongoing toxicities (&gt;CTCAE grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy. Clinically proven gastric outlet obstruction or CTCAE grade 3 or grade 4 upper GI bleeding Medically uncontrolled, clinically significant heart disease or infection Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery. Women who have pregnancy potential or willing to pregnant. Pregnant and breastfeeding women. Others Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection Any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent and regular followup.
