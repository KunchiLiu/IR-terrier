	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether MTA is more effective than a conventional calcium hydroxide liner (DycalÂ®) as a direct pulp capping material in mature molar teeth with a carious pulpal exposure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT of Pulp Capping Over Carious Exposures Comparing Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) With Dycal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcium hydroxide (CH) is considered the standard material for pulp capping with good results in cases with pulpal exposure as a result of dental trauma both in animal and clinical studies. However, in carious exposures, follow-up studies of direct pulp capping performed with CH based materials have shown increasing failure rates and the outcome has been considered uncertain. Direct capping of carious exposures still remains a controversial treatment for mature teeth. A new material, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was introduced for root end filling material almost two decades ago. It is also suggested for pulp capping. MTA cement has showed good sealing ability and bio-compatibility in animal studies. Results from studies in humans corroborate the results from animal studies. Although the overall results of pulp capping in human studies using MTA are very positive, well designed and controlled clinical studies, especially involving carious exposures are lacking.</detailed_description>
