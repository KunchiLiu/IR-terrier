	<brief_summary>- Title: PATIENT-MATCHED INSTRUMENTATION VS. STANDARD INSTRUMENTATION: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING POSTOPERATIVE AXIAL ALIGNMENT and COMPONENT POSITION - Short Title: Visionaire Alignment - Methodology: Monocentric, Single Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial - Study Duration: November 2010 to July 2014 - Study Centres: Leicester General Hospital, United Kingdom (UK)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axial Alignment in Patients Operated Using the Visionaire Patient Matched Cutting Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malalignment is one of the main reasons for knee arthroplasty revision. With the use of patient matched cutting block we expect better axial alignment of the components. Research Objectives: - The primary research objective is to evaluate the axial alignment and component position in TKA with use of Smith &amp; Nephew's VISIONAIRE Patient Matched Technology and to compare with the alignment when standard instrumentation. - Secondary research objectives include assessing the safety and effectiveness of the VISIONAIRE patient matched technology as compared to commonly accepted standard instrumentation in patients suffering from symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee joint. - Outcome Measures: - Implant alignment and Component position by means of CT-scans - Knee Society Score - EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) - Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) - Oxford Knee Score - Knee-related adverse events - Standard and full leg x-ray - Number of Subjects: 70 (2*35) - Enrollment time: 18 months - Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Patients with osteoarthritis of the knee requiring total knee arthroplasty - Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen: VISIONAIRE patient matched technology versus the commonly accepted standard instrumentation for the Genesis II total knee arthroplasty implant</detailed_description>
