	<brief_title>Active and Passive Distraction in Children Undergoing Wound Dressings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Children aged five to twelve were recruited from the pediatric day care unit at the Queen Silvia Children's hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Included children had wounds that differed in size and location but were too extensive to be handled in a primary care setting. The wound dressing procedures were standardized and the pain experiences were expected to be similar in all included children. Children with longstanding wounds, carerelated pressure wounds, and wounds in body areas with decreased sensitivity were excluded from this study.Children with cognitive impairments were excluded from the study, as were children or parents who did not have a good command of Swedish.</criteria>
