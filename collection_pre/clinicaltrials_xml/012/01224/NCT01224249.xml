	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate, whether higher intake of selenium rich food items such as fish and shellfish, is associated with higher selenium blood levels. The secondary aim is to investigate the uptake of selenium from fish and shellfish and the incorporation of selenium from those foods into proteins in the human body. Furthermore, the impact of the natural variation in the genes that are responsible for the accumulation of selenium in the proteins will be investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selenium Status Measured in Blood After a Higher Intake of Fish and Shellfish - a Randomized Dietary Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selenium is an essential trace element that is incorporated into proteins in the human body and it hereby plays a major role in several important cellular processes. Previous studies have indicated that the selenium status of the Danish population is below the levels required to optimize the suggested protective effects of selenium towards major diseases including cancer. In Denmark, important natural sources of selenium are fish and shellfish.</detailed_description>
