	<brief_summary>This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study will evaluate the effect of gantenerumab (RO4909832) on cognition and functioning and the safety and pharmacokinetics in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's Disease. Participants will be randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either gantenerumab or placebo. Participants who consent to be part of the sub study will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess brain amyloid. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks, with an option for an additional 2 years of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult participants, 5085 years of age Participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease who are not receiving memantine or cholinesterase inhibitors Has a study partner who in the investigator's judgement has frequent and sufficient contact with the participant as to be able to provide accurate information as to the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, who agrees to provide information at clinic visits which require partner input for scale completion Has had sufficient education or work experience to exclude mental retardation Study partner has noticed a recent gradual decrease in participant's memory (over the last 12 months), which the participant may or may not be aware of Screening Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score of 24 or above Additional inclusion criteria for sub study: Able and willing to travel to PET imaging center and complete the planned scanning sessions Past and planned exposure to ionizing radiation not exceeding safe and permissible levels Other prior or current neurologic or medical disorder which may currently or during the course of the study impair cognition or psychiatric functioning A history of stroke A documented history of transient ischemic attack within the last 12 months History of schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder Currently meets criteria for major depression Within the last 2 years, unstable or clinical significant cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris) Additional exclusion criteria for sub study: Inclusion in a research and/or medical protocol involving PET ligands or other radioactive agents within 12 months Present or planned participation in a research and/or medical protocol involving PET ligands or radioactive agents other than study WN25203 Have planned or are planning to have exposure to ionizing radiation that in combination with the planned administration with study amyloid PET ligand would result in a cumulative exposure that exceeds local recommended exposure limits</criteria>
