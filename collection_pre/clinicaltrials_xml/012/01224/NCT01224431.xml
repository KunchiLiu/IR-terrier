	<brief_summary>Background: The J-Tip Device allows an intradermal needle-free jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine. This study compares needle-free jet injection of lidocaine to saline in reducing pain prior to lumbar puncture in infants. Methods: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial involving infants, less than 3 months of age, presenting to the emergency department meeting clinical criteria for a lumbar puncture. All patients were administered the J-tip and randomized to either treatment with 1% lidocaine or an equivalent amount of sterile normal saline prior to lumbar puncture.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Lumbar puncture is an essential procedure in the emergency department for the evaluation of meningitis. Subcutaneous injection of lidocaine prior to lumbar puncture for local anesthesia is not a pain free procedure. The J-Tip Device allows an intradermal needle-free jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine. This study compares needle-free jet injection of lidocaine to saline in reducing pain prior to lumbar puncture in infants. Methods: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial involving infants, less than 3 months of age, presenting to the emergency department meeting clinical criteria for a lumbar puncture. All patients were administered the J-tip and randomized to either treatment with 1% lidocaine or an equivalent amount of sterile normal saline prior to lumbar puncture. Vital signs were recorded during the procedure. Facial expressions as well as crying times were video recorded from start to finish. Independent reviewers assigned pain scores based on the validated Neonatal Facial Coding System with possible scores ranging from 0-5.</detailed_description>
