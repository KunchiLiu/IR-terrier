	<detailed_description>The EVART study is a prospective epidemiological multicenter cohort study, including patients with newly diagnosed PAD (&lt; 1 year). Initial data on medical history, caracterisation of the PAD (risk factors, main sites and severity of the atherosclerotic lesions),clinical evaluation of undetected previous CV events, standardized US duplex examination of the abdominal aorta and carotid arteries and treatment (type and duration) are collected by the physician into an electronic medical record. A phone follow up at 3 months, 1, 2 and 3 years is realised by the Centre for Clinical Research of Grenoble. Data on mortality, revascularization, treatments prescribed (type and duration), cancer onset, cardiovascular events, carotid stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm are collected. All these serious adverse events are documented and reviewed by an independent critical events committee.</detailed_description>
