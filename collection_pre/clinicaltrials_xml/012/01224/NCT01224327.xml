	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Infusion Via Hepatic Artery in Cirrhosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infusion via hepatic artery in the treatment of liver cirrhosis. Patients with liver cirrhosis were randomly separated into two groups. Umbilical cord MSCs were infused to patients using interventional method via hepatic artery for One group. After the catheter placed at proper hepatic artery was confirmed by angiography, umbilical cord MSCs were infused slowly for 15-20minutes. The control group accepted conserved therapy.</detailed_description>
