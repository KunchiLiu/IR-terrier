	<brief_summary>This is a companion protocol to MD Anderson Cancer Center study 2010-0085 (Sequential Therapy in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Therapy: The "START" Trial). The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if dynamic contrast enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) scans can help researchers learn if the study drug received as part of study 2010-0085 (either everolimus, bevacizumab, or pazopanib) is working.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To perform a DCE-CT scan, a small amount of a special dye (called "CT contrast medium") is injected by vein into the body. Several CT images are then taken over a few minutes to learn how much dye spreads outside of the tumor. This can show how much blood flows to and from the tumor. By performing DCE-CT scans after several weeks on treatment, researchers may learn if changes in blood flow may be a sign that the treatment is working. Study Procedures: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a DCE-CT scan to check the status of the disease at the following times: - Within about 4 weeks before you begin treatment on study 2010-0085. - Eight (8) weeks after starting treatment on study 2010-0085. Before each of the DCE-CT scans are performed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your kidney function. If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have a standard-of-care CT scan at these timepoints to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: Your participation in this study will be over after the scan(s) 8 weeks after starting treatment on study 2010-0085. You will be taken off of this study if you leave the 2010-0085 study early. This is an investigational study. The DCE-CT scan is commercially available. Using DCE-CT scans to check the status of kidney cancer is investigational. Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
