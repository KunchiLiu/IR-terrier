	<brief_title>Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease Safety and Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a condition that can develop early in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), usually gets worse over time, and is known to cause problems for patients on dialysis. Children on dialysis can have a wide range of bone and growth issues, and common treatments have a chance of making these things worse by increasing serum calcium and serum phosphorus. Cinacalcet has been shown to be effective in controlling parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorus in adults. The purpose of this study is to show that including cinacalcet in the treatment of SHPT will lower the levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in a larger number of pediatric patients with CKD who are receiving dialysis, compared to a treatment regimen that does not include cinacalcet.</detailed_description>
