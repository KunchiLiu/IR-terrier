	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in adult female subjects aged 26-45 years. One group of subjects will receive the HPV vaccine and the other group will receive an active control (GSK Biologicals' hepatitis B vaccine). Immunogenicity data of the HPV group will be compared with those from the HPV group included in the NCT00779766 study (aged 18-25 years).</brief_summary>

Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before and 30 days after the first dose of vaccine. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).

Pregnant or breastfeeding subjects must be at least three months postpregnancy and not breastfeeding to enter the study. Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the protocol during the study period. Previous administration of 3Odesacyl4'monophosphoryl lipid A or AS04 adjuvant.
