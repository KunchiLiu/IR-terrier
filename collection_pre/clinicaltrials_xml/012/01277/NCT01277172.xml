	<brief_summary>This is a prospective international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind controlled study designed to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the safety of PBO-326 (Rituximab) and Mabthera (Rituximab) in combination with CHOP in previously untreated patients with diffuse B cells Non Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present R-CHOP (Rituximab plus Cyclofosfamide, Doxorrubicine, Vincristine and Prednisone) has became standard of care of patients with B cells Non Hodgkin Lymphoma CD20+. Study will perform pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) measurment of a novel Rituximab in comparison with Mabthera and evaluates safety both metabolic as well immunologic. Study protocolo is designed to provide data on impact of treatment interchange of both study drugs (PBO-326 and Mabthera).</detailed_description>
