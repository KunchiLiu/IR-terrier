	<brief_summary>There is no prospective study on the test intervals of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or on the role of prothrombin induced vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in surveillance program for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). The goal of this study is to compare if the testing of AFP + PIVKA-II in intervals of 3 months is more effective in diagnosing early stages of HCC than the 6 month interval of AFP that is commonly used</brief_summary>
