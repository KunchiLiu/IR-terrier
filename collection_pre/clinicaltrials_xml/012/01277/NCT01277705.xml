Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the administration of the study vaccine dose, or planned use during the study period. History of previous or intercurrent diphtheria or tetanus, pertussis or polio disease in the last 10 years. French subjects: history of diphtheria or tetanus, pertussis or polio vaccination in the last 10 years. German subjects: history of diphtheria or tetanus, pertussis or polio vaccination in the last 5 years, except those subjects participating in the tetanus antibody kinetic subgroup. German subjects participating in the tetanus antibody kinetic subgroup: history of diphtheria or tetanus, pertussis or polio vaccination in the last 10 years. Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting 30 days before the administration of the study vaccine dose and ending 30 days after study vaccination. Chronic administration or planned administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months or 5 halflives (whichever is the longer) of vaccination. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the study vaccination or planned administration during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, History of seizures or progressive neurological disease. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). The following adverse experiences associated with diphtheriatetanuspertussis vaccination constitute absolute contraindications to further administration of diphtheriatetanuspertussis vaccine; if any of these adverse experiences occurred following previous vaccinations, the subject should not be included: Absolute contraindications: Hypersensitivity reaction due to the vaccine. Encephalopathy Precautions: Fever &gt;= 40.0°C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting &gt;= 3 hours occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days of vaccination.</criteria>
