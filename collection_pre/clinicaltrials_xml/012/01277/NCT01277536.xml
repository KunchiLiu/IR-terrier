	<brief_summary>Until now, no risk assessment model informing about the need of thromboprophylaxis in patients admitted for an acute medical event has been validated. The goal of this project is to indirectly validate a model developed in Geneva by a non -interventional study involving the collection of patient characteristics during the hospitalization and a 3-month follow-up. These data will allow for the determination of the patient's risk, according to the Geneva model, and its validity, according the actual thrombo-embolic events, corrected for the thromboprophylaxis received. The project is multicentric in Switzerland (5-10 centers) and should involve about 1000 patients. First amendment (may 2011) : we have obtained the IRB approval for collecting data from patients who die during their hospital stay and for whom informed consent is not be possible to obtain.</brief_summary>
