	<brief_summary>Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic member of the corticosteroid. It is given to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy to counteract emetic side effect and essential drug for the chemotherapy-treated patients. Hiccup is common adverse effect of corticosteroid especially on dexamethasone varying from 3% to 60% of given patients. Discontinuance of dexamethasone relieves most hiccupping cases, but vomiting/nausea rates increase. It is not clear whether hiccup side effect is limited to the dexamethasone only or other corticosteroid group. Methylprednisolone, synthetic corticosteroid as similar as dexamethasone, could be considered as antiemetic agent for the patients with receiving chemotherapy. The investigators perform this pilot study under hypothesis that replacing dexamethasone with methylprednisolone could maintain antiemetic role and prevent hiccup.</brief_summary>
