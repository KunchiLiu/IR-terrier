	<brief_summary>The ALternate site cardiac reSYNChronization (ALSYNC) study, a non-comparative, prospective, non-randomized, multi-national clinical investigation. The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance of the investigational atrial transseptal endocardial LV lead delivery system and the implant procedure for delivering the SelectSecure® Model 3830 lead into the Left Ventricle via a superior approach, and to evaluate the performance of the SelectSecure® Model 3830 lead in the Left Ventricle.</brief_summary>
