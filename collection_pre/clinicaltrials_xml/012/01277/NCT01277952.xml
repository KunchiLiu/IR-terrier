	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the benefit of Deep Brain Stimulation for subjects with severe disability due to Traumatic Brain Injury. DBS has been proven safe and efficacious for remediation of multiple neurological conditions. It is the hope of the study team that the protocol will provide further insight into the potential of DBS to improve the quality of life and functioning of persons with severe disability due to TBI and at the same time can provide new clinical insights that will improve treatment for the entire spectrum of injury severity.</detailed_description>
