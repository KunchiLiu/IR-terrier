	<brief_summary>Morbidly obesity (body mass index 40 kg/mÂ²), the most serious, is more and more frequent. Cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of morbidity and mortality. An excess of TRL particles is one of the characteristics, represents a major cardiovascular risk factor. The overproduction of the intestinal TRL (which apoprotein B48 is the specific tracer) is recently recognized of insulin-resistance and the atherogenous role of these intestinal TRL has been shown. In front of this important overmortality, the bariatric surgery quickly developed. Three main procedures are performed: 2 based exclusively on the gastric restriction (the adjustable gastric banding and the sleeve gastrectomy) and one associating a malabsorption (the gastric bypass).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is a monocentric, prospective, comparative study. After identification of the eligible subjects, the kinetics (production and clearance rates) of the intestinal TRL will be performed in the hospital, using a stable isotope method (5,5,5-D3-L-Leucine), in 3 groups of obese patients (12 patients per surgery procedure), before and 6 months after the surgery</detailed_description>
