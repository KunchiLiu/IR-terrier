	<brief_title>Intra-erythrocyte Dexamethasone Versus Placebo in Patients With Steroid-dependent Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medical treatment of Crohn's disease is still unsatisfactory despite the use of large number of drugs as steroids which cause several side effects after a long-term treatment.Ery-Dex thanks its peculiar way of administration (intra-erythrocyte encapsulation and release at very low doses during 1 month)should dramatically reduce side effects due steroids, which are dose dependent, and provide an alternative for long-term glucocorticoid therapy.</detailed_description>
