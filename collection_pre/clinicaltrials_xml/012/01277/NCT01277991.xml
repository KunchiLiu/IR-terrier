	<brief_summary>In this study, a 5 mg dose of CP-690,550 will be given to study subjects on two separate occasions using one of two different strength tablets each time. The amount of CP-690,550 available in the blood following administration of each tablet will be measured and compared. The overall aim of the study is to establish that a similar amount of CP-690,550 is absorbed into the blood following administration of the same dose of each different strength tablet .</brief_summary>
