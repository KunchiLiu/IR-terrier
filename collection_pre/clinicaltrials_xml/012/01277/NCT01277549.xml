	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to characterize the performance of CaridianBCT's Spectra Optia Apheresis System, when used to collect mononuclear cells (MNCs) and cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) positive cells from healthy nonmobilized blood donors and healthy G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) mobilized blood donors, respectively.</brief_summary>
