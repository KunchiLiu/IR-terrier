	<brief_summary>The German Spondyloarthritis Inception cohort (GESPIC) was started as a prospective, longitudinal, multicentre, nationwide study in Germany on patients with early SpA including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. The objectives of GESPIC are to learn about the course of AS and other SpA during the very early stage of the disease, to appropriately assess the outcome including radiographic progression of patients after several years of follow-up, to identify outcome predictors, to assess quality of life, function, and costs (direct and indirect costs).</brief_summary>
