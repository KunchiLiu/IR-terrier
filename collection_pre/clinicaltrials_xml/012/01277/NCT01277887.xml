	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation for Smokers With Sleep Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a developmental study to: 1) create and test an integrated cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation and insomnia intervention with 30 smokers who report current insomnia. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 counseling conditions. The cognitive-behavioral intervention provides standard care smoking counseling along with counseling to address insomnia. The smoking counseling intervention provides standard care smoking counseling adapted from the American Lung Association Freedom from Smoking program. Efficacy data from this trial will be used to determine effect size estimates for biologically confirmed self-reported point prevalence smoking abstinence at the end of treatment and 1 month after completing treatment. Changes in sleep efficiency and self-control to resist smoking urges will also be examined. If the effect size estimates are sufficiently large and medically important to pursue a definitive trial, these data will be used to propose a full scale large study.</detailed_description>
