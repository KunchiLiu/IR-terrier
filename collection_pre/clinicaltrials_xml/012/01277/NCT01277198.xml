	<brief_title>Role of Flexible Cystoscopy in Laparoscopic Stone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous trials to increase stone clearance rates have been recently reached using flexible equipment in laparoscopic surgery, however, it is not clear whether using flexible equipment is really helpful in performing pyelolithotomies and the clearance rates using flexible equipment varies 71% to 100%. Therefore, authors plan to investigate the usefulness of flexible cystoscopy in performing laparoscopic pyelolithotomies and ureterolithotomies by comparing operative results of a single surgeon's experience.</detailed_description>
