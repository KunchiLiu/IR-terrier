	<brief_summary>The investigators assess if repetitive, transcranial alternating current stimulation (rtACS) can improve the speaking quality of the aphasic patient as well as other communication skills as naming, repeating and understanding spoken words, reading and writing. Further, it will be assessed if memory and attentiveness deficiencies after 10 days of therapy with brain stimulation are stabilized and remain stable after a training-free period of 60 days.</brief_summary>
