	<brief_summary>Auditory stimulation during pregnancy has been found to influence foetal behaviour with a potential of being carried forward to neonatal period. This study evaluated the effect of ante-natal music exposure to primigravida healthy mothers on the behaviour of their term appropriate-for-date newborns. This was a single centre, randomized, open-label controlled trial. Primigravida mothers aged 19-29 years, free of chronic medical diseases or significant deafness, with singleton pregnancy, with a gestation of 20 weeks or less were randomized to listen to a pre-recorded music cassette for approximately 1 hour/day in addition to standard ante-natal care (intervention arm) or standard care only (control arm). Peri-natal factors with adverse effect on neonatal behaviour were deemed as protocol violations. The infants born to mothers exposed to music during pregnancy performed significantly better on 5 of the 7 BNBAS clusters. The maximal beneficial effect was seen with respect to orientation and habituation. Conclusion: Music exposure to mother during pregnancy significantly influences neonatal behaviour.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: Auditory stimulation during pregnancy has been found to influence foetal behaviour with a potential of being carried forward to neonatal period. This study evaluated the effect of ante-natal music exposure to primigravida healthy mothers on the behaviour of their term appropriate-for-date newborns assessed using Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS). Methods: This was a single centre, randomized, open-label controlled trial. Primigravida mothers aged 19-29 years, free of chronic medical diseases or significant deafness, with singleton pregnancy, with a gestation of 20 weeks or less were randomized to listen to a pre-recorded music cassette for approximately 1 hour/day in addition to standard ante-natal care (intervention arm) or standard care only (control arm). Peri-natal factors with adverse effect on neonatal behaviour were deemed as protocol violations. Outcome measure included scores on 7 clusters of BNBAS. Primary analysis was per protocol. Results: One hundred and 26 newborns in the music group and 134 in the control group were subjected to BNBAS assessment. The infants born to mothers exposed to music during pregnancy performed significantly better on 5 of the 7 BNBAS clusters. The maximal beneficial effect was seen with respect to orientation (ES 1.13, 95% CI 0.82-1.44, p&lt;0.0001) and habituation (ES 1.05, 95% CI 0.53-1.57, p=0.0001). Conclusion: Music exposure to mother during pregnancy significantly influences neonatal behaviour.</detailed_description>
