	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine wether intravenous Phenylephrine, administered as start bolus and following continuous infusion (specific dosage per weight), or optimal lower limb bandaging is more effective in preventing hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia in healthy women. The hypothesis is that the Phenylephrine model is superior to lower limb compression in preventing hypotension.</brief_summary>
