	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to understand whether training in tasks that require perceiving and thinking about things, or cognition, can improve memory in veterans who have been exposed to a blast explosion and have TBI and PTSD. A primary goal of the study is to determine whether it is feasible for veterans who don't live close to a VA to perform this cognitive training at home.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rural Veterans With Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) And Comorbid Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many military personnel have experienced traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the current Afghanistan and Iraq wars. TBI occurs when a sudden force causes the brain to move, causing damage to brain cells. PTSD is an anxiety disorder associated with serious traumatic events. Blast explosions can lead to TBI. People who experience TBI as a result of a blast injury are more likely to experience PTSD than people who have TBI not due to blast. TBI and PTSD may be associated with memory problems in some patients. Because therapy for PTSD sometimes requires learning new ways to think about things and making new responses, being able to remember the new information being learned is important. It is possible that improving memory may also improve PTSD treatment. This is a prospective study of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (Afghanistan and Iraq wars; OEF/OIF) veterans who will undergo two neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments prior and subsequent to a cognitive training intervention. This is a feasibility study to ascertain whether OEF/OIF veterans diagnosed with mild TBI and comorbid PTSD and who live in rural locations will adhere to the schedule demands required of a computer-based cognitive training protocol.</detailed_description>
