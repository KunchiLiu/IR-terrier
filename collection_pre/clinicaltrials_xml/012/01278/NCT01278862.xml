	<brief_summary>Study aim is to compare Lava Computer Aided Design / Computer Aided Milling Computer Aided Machining (CAD/CAM)crowns that are veneered (covered) with porcelain that has been milled using CAD/CAM, with similar CAD/CAM Lava crowns that have been veneered with a hand fabricated porcelain covering.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Lava Digital Veneer System (DVS) Crowns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Veneers will be randomly allocated to study crowns. Study crowns will be evaluated over three years. The test porcelain veneer is CAD/CAM milled as a veneer shell that is then fused to the CAD/CAM milled Lava crown to make the final crown to be cemented in the patient's mouth. This may be a more predictable technique in the fabrication of Lava crowns than current conventional methods.</detailed_description>
