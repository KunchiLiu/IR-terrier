	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Subjects With Onychomycosis of the Great Toenail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this cohort, only the targeted great toenail identified at Baseline prior to the commencement of treatment from culture results collected at the Screening visit were evaluated for primary efficacy whereas all treated toenails were evaluated for safety. At each visit, the investigator was asked to make a clinical evaluation of the targeted great nail, marking whether or not they considered the nail to be clear of onychomycosis. This evaluation was the basis for determining whether or not study medication should be dispensed at the visit. This record includes information only for Cohort 3 (5% solution) of the study. Cohorts 1 and 2, are described in NCT00679523 (7.5% solution). No comparison was made between Cohorts 1&amp;2 and Cohort 3.</detailed_description>
