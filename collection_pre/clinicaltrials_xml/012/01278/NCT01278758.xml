	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of ASA404 in patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic cancer with impaired renal function and with normal renal function. It is very possible that patients with renal impairment will show differences in renal excretion of parent ASA404 and its metabolites, warranting a study that leads to a better pharmacokinetic assesssment in this population.</brief_summary>
