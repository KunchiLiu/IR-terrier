	<brief_title>International Multicenter Study One Day Prevalence Observational Study for Delirium on ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium is a serious complication in postoperative and critically ill patients and is independently associated with cognitive impairment at hospital discharge and with significantly higher 6-month mortality. Furthermore, ICU delirium is associated with more days requiring mechanically ventilation, longer ICU length of stay, and longer hospital length of stay. More recently a study by Pisani and co-workers' could show an association between days of delirium and mortality; - each additional day spent in delirium is associated with a 20% increased risk of prolonged hospitalization - translating to over 10 additional days - and a 10% increased risk of death.The reported prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients ranges widely from 11% to 87%. The aim of our study is to investigate the implementation rate of routine delirium assessment in European ICUs.</detailed_description>
