	<brief_summary>This study is designed to obtain pharmacokinetic data following a single-dose 20-minute i.v. administration of ASA404 (900, 1200, or 1800 mg/m2) in adult cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. The study will be carried out in cancer volunteer patients (utilizing controls with normal hepatic function) who will be assigned to four hepatic impairment groups according to their pre-dose (Day-1) and total bilirubin level. The study will consist of two phases, a (Core Phase) that will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single i.v. dose (900, 1200 and 1800 mg/m2) of ASA404 in adult cancer patients with impaired hepatic function, and compared to controls with normal hepatic function. The assessments will be done on the safety and tolerability of that single dose in adult cancer patients with impaired hepatic function and compared to controls with normal hepatic function. The Extension Phase will consist of assessing the safety and tolerability of ASA404 at the same three doses in combination with a sponsor-approved taxane-based regimen in adult cancer patients with impaired hepatic function and compared to controls with normal hepatic function.</brief_summary>
