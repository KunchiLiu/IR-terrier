	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease. Single-port access cholecystectomy (SL) has been recently introduced using only one, trans-umbilical placed port. The method has been denominated as ''scarless.'' However, it is unknown whether SL significantly improves body and cosmesis images as well as the quality of life (QoL), reported directly by the patients. Furthermore SL promises to reduce postoperative pain and to be cost-effective due a faster postoperative recovery. The aim of this Double Blind Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to demonstrate whether SL is superior to LC in improving patients', body and cosmesis images as well as QoL and to analyse cost-efficiency. Based on the sample size calculations, a total of 110 patients will be randomised to either LC or SL. The primary endpoint will be the cosmetic score. Costs, pain, time to convalescence, quality of life and complications and will also be compared as secondary endpoints. This study will provide evidence-based patient-oriented information regarding the SL procedure and its further use.</brief_summary>
