	<brief_summary>Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) still carries a high rate of severe postoperative complications. No score is currently available to help identify the patient's surgical risk. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic score to predict major postoperative complications after PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Score To Predict Major Complications After Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators prospectively collected in an electronic database preoperative, intraoperative and outcome data of 700 patients undergoing PD in our Institution from 2002 to 2010. The investigators used a multivariate logistic regression analysis to create a new score to predict severe complications defined as Clavien-Dindo classification III, IV and V. The score was developed using a random two-thirds of the population (469 patients), and was then validated and calibrated in the remaining third of the patients (231).</detailed_description>
