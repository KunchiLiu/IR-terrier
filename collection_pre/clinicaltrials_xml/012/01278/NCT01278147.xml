	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present project is to develop, implement and evaluate a pilot regional patient education program on the management of one of the main side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients, that is fatigue. A carer (doctor or nurse) trained in educational techniques will be responsible for the patient. The carer will first identify modes of behavior and competences that the patient must acquire in order to optimize his/her management of fatigue ("educational diagnosis"). An education program, based on a contract of goals will be proposed after this diagnosis phase. The expected results are, in the short-term, a significant reduction in the mean level of fatigue in patients receiving chemotherapy who benefited from individual educational management. In the longer term, the aim is to evaluate the impact of this program on patient quality of life and use of healthcare structures in comparison with conventional management.</brief_summary>
