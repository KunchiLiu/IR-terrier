	<brief_summary>Physical activity is considered important in prevention and treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Genotype of genes involved in metabolism is also known to be associated with the development of metabolic syndrome. However, scarce evidence exists regarding the influence of physical activity intensity and genotype on metabolic syndrome in people with obesity. The investigators examine physical activity using an uniaxial accelerometer, as well as aerobic fitness using an electric bicycle ergometer, several genotypes of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolisms in middle-aged men with obesity and/or abdominal obesity who were employees in silicon wafer manufacture and participated in a health checkup.</brief_summary>
