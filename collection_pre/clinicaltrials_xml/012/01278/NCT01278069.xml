	<brief_summary>Myeloid Sarcoma (or granulocytic Sarcoma or Chloroma) is well defined by the WHO. However, there are currently no data about the prevalence, sites of occurence and thr prognostic value for patients with AML with this finding. Information about this condition is based on retrospective analyses since there have been no studies trying to define the role of myeloid sarcoma in AML so far. This observational trial will include adult patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed AML in order to perform 18FDG-PET-CT imaging prior to induction chemotherapy. Furthermore, a second 18FDG-PET-CT will be performed after induction chemotherapy to define the responsiveness of these tumors to chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of this study is the prevalence of 18FDG-PET-CT positive extramedullary AML manifestations (myeloid sarcoma) in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AML.</brief_summary>
