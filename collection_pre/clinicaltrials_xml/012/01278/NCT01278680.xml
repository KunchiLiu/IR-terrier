	<brief_summary>Employees of Blue Shield of California (BSC) will be recruited to participate to regularly use Walkstations. Some participants will be randomly assigned to a "hold out" control condition and the remainder will be assigned to one of two experimental treatments: Personal Incentive vs. Charitable Incentive. In the Personal Incentive condition people will be paid $3 for every completed Walkstation session, whereas for participants in the Charitable Incentive condition $3 will be donated to a specific charity. The incentives will operate for approximately 45 days and then for an additional 45 days participants in the two experimental conditions will have access to the Walkstations. Participants in the hold out control condition will begin using the Walkstations after the initial 90 day period.</brief_summary>
