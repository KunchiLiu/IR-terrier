	<mesh_term>Cataract</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age 18 or greater Bilateral condition (cataracts or Presbyopia) for which phacoemulsification and posterior IOL implantation has been planned for both eyes Visual potential of 20/25 or better in each eye after cataract removal and IOL implantation Clear intraocular media other than cataract Normal OCT of the macula No evidence of Keratoconus or significant irregular astigmatism on Preoperative topography No evidence of Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy on Slit lamp Exam Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination procedures Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease History of ocular trauma History of intraocular, extraocular Muscle, or corneal surgery (including laser vision correction) Amblyopia or strabismus Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.) Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of 20/25 or worse Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention (i.e patients with diabetic retinopathy) Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) Contact lens usage within 2 months for PMMA contacts lenses, 2 weeks for gas permeable lenses or 3 days for extendedwear and dailywear soft contact lenses</criteria>
