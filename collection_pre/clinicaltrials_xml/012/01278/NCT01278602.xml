	<brief_title>R-ESHAP Followed by Autologous Transplantation for Refractory or Relapsed Diffused Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment in patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation for responsive patients. However, the standard of salvage chemotherapy remains uncertain. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R-ESHAP regimen in a multi-center basis.</detailed_description>
