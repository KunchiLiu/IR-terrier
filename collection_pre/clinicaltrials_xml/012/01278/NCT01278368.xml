	<brief_summary>No comparative trial investigating the effect of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer on short-term postoperative outcome has been published so far. The aim of the present study is to assess the potential impact of preoperative chemotherapy on short-term postoperative outcome after pancreatic resection in a case-matched series of cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Of Preoperative Chemotherapy On Short-Term Outcome After Pancreatic Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 2003 and 2011, patients with locally advanced (stage III) pancreatic cancer who were treated with preoperative chemotherapy (PCHT) underwent surgical resection. Each patient was matched with the closest two patients with pancreatic cancer ( control group ) selected from our prospective electronic database who met the following match criteria: age (+/- 3 years), gender, ASA score, type of resection, pancreatic duct diameter (+/- 1 mm), and tumour size (+/- 5 mm).</detailed_description>
