	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Effects on Alcohol Drinking and Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-treatment seeking individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence (N=120) will be recruited through advertisement and paid for their participation. Subjects will have blood drawn for DNA analysis of various brain dopamine system genes. Alcoholics, after baseline evaluation, will be assigned through urn randomization to one of two experimental groups, depending on their baseline level of impulsivity, in which they will receive either aripiprazole (up to 15 mg/day) or an identical placebo. Subjects will take the study drug or placebo for 8 days (day 1-6 being the natural observation period). After a minimum of 24 hours of abstinence from alcohol (day 7-8) they will undergo an alcohol administration (priming dose) and motivated free choice drinking procedure (on day 8). Alcoholic subjects will receive a brief counseling session at the end of the study to enhance their awareness of problem drinking and to motivate them to seek treatment. Referral for treatment will be offered. Each subject will undergo a functional MRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan with cue stimulation on day 7, on the evening before the alcohol administration paradigm. fMRI (functional magnetic resonance) imaging brain imaging technology will be used to determine if alcoholics treated with aripiprazole differ in alcohol cue-induced activity in the nucleus accumbens. It is hypothesized that aripiprazole will reduce nucleus accumbens activation to alcohol cues compared to placebo. Whether dopamine system genetic differences will be predict drinking, nucleus accumbens activity, and aripiprazole response will be explored.</detailed_description>
