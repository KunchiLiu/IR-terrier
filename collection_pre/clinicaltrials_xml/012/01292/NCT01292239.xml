	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 compared with placebo in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (pegIFN alfa-2a) and ribavirin in treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Japan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Study of TMC435 in Treatment-naive, Genotype 1, Hepatitis C-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2-arm, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 (also referred to as jnj-38733214-aaa) versus placebo in combination with the standard of care (SoC) therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a [pegIFN alfa-2a] and ribavirin) in adult treatment-na√Øve patients (who never received treatment for HCV) with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of TMC435 vs placebo by the proportion of the patients with undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). In the TMC435 treatment group, patients will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus SoC followed by an additional 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with SoC. In the placebo treatment group, patients will receive 12 weeks of treatment with placebo once daily plus SoC followed by an additional 36 weeks of treatment with SoC. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally by mouth. The SoC treatment will be given for 24 or 48 weeks. Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0 mL solution with 180 mcg pegIFN alpha-2a and administered subcutaneously (injected by a syringe under the skin) once weekly. Ribavirin is given as 200-mg tablets (daily dose: 600-1000 mg based on body weight), and taken orally by mouth two times a day after meals.</detailed_description>
