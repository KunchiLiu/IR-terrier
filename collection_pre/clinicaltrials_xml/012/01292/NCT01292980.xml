	<brief_summary>Patients with a suspected Deep Tissue Injury (or a purple reddened area over a bony prominence of their body, which is expected to break down into a pressure ulcer) will be place on the Clinitron® Rite HiteTM bed to see if the air fluidized mattress decreases the amount of tissue breakdown from their bruise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Air Fluidized Therapy (AFT) in Patients With Suspected Deep Tissue Injury (sDTI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 15 centers will participate in this case series in acute care and long term acute care facilities. Patients who present with sDTI and consent for study will have the Clinitron® Rite HiteTM bed ordered and delivered within a 12 hour window to be able to participate. They will have their sDTI photographed, and an assessment of expected breakdown will be noted by the clinical team. The patient will be followed during the course of hospitalization and additional photographs and documentation will be performed by the clinical team to demonstrate the actual breakdown that occurred. Information including the pertinent history of current illness, co-morbid conditions, and demographic information will be shared with the sponsor in order to demonstrate each case.</detailed_description>
