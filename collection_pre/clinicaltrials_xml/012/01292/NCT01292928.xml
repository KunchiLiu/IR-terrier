	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether the Innova Stent System shows acceptable performance in long-term (12-month) safety rates and vessel patency when treating femoropopliteal lesions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that has become increasingly recognized in the expanding elderly population as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Atherosclerosis in the vessels of the lower extremities can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from intermittent claudication to ischemic rest pain and critical ischemia with major tissue loss. Typically, femoropopliteal lesions have been difficult to successfully treat with endovascular therapy because the disease is often diffuse and located in an area of the body subject to significant mobility stresses such as extension, contraction, compression, elongation, flexion and torsion. The SuperNOVA clinical study is a prospective, single arm, controlled, multicenter, global study. Approximately 50 centers located in the United States, Europe, Canada and/or Australia are expected to participate in recruiting patients needing treatment of lesions in their femoropopliteal arteries. A maximum of 300 subjects will be enrolled to ensure that a minimum of 296 stented segments are treated with the Innova Stent System.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects age 18 and older 2. Chronic symptomatic lower limb ischemia defined as Rutherford categories 2, 3 or 4 3. Stenotic, restenotic (from angioplasty only) or occlusive lesion(s) located in the native superficial femoral artery or proximal popliteal artery: 1. Degree of stenosis &gt;/=70% by visual angiographic assessment 2. Vessel diameter &gt;/= 4 and &lt;/= 7mm 3. Total lesion length (or series of lesions) &gt;/=30mm and &lt;/= 190 mm (note: tandem lesions may be treated, provided that the tandem lesion segment can be covered with only one stent) 4. If lesion is restenotic, PTA treatment must be &gt;3 months prior to stent placement 5. Target lesion located at least three centimeters above the inferior edge of the femur 4. Patent infrapopliteal and popliteal artery, i.e., single vessel runoff or better with at least one of three vessels patent (&lt;50% stenosis) to the ankle or foot 5. Subject (or Legal Guardian) is willing and able to provide consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed and agrees to attend all required followup visits 1. Previous stent placement in the target vessel 2. Subjects who have undergone prior surgery of the SFA/PPA in the target limb to treat atherosclerotic disease 3. Subjects who have undergone prior percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the target SFA/PPA in the past 3 months 4. Use of atherectomy devices or other adjunctive treatment in the SFA/PPA during the index procedure 5. History of major amputation in the same limb as the target lesion 6. Life expectancy less than 12 months due to other medical comorbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the clinical study, limit the subject's compliance with the followup requirements, or impact the scientific integrity of the clinical study 7. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to contrast dye that, in the opinion of the investigator, cannot be adequately premedicated. 8. Intolerance to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic medications 9. Platelet count &lt;150,000 mm3 or &gt;600,000 mm3 10. Concomitant renal failure with a serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL 11. Receiving dialysis or immunosuppressant therapy 12. Pregnancy 13. Current participation in another investigational drug or device clinical study 14. Known allergy to Nitinol 15. Septicemia at the time of the index procedure 16. Presence of other hemodynamically significant outflow lesions requiring intervention within 30 days of the index procedure 17. Target lesion is within or near an aneurysm 18. Acute ischemia and/or acute thrombosis of the SFA/PPA 19. Persistent, intraluminal thrombus of the proposed target lesion post thrombolytic therapy 20. Perforated vessel as evidenced by extravasation of contrast media 21. Heavily calcified lesions</criteria>
