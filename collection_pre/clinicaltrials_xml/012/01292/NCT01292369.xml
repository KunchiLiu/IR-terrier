	<brief_summary>The concept of breath testing for various diseases has been around since ancient greece. It has been hypothesized that cancer is generating a unique pattern of compounds in patients' breath. This study is trying to characterize a novel system, based on nanoparticles technology, for cancer diagnosis through breath samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breath Testing for Breast and Colon Cancer Diagnosis- NaNose Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer is accompanied by increased oxidative stress and induction of polymorphic cytochrome P- 450 mixed oxidase enzymes (CYP). Both processes affect the abundance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath because oxidative stress causes lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes, producing alkanes and methylalkanes which are catabolized by CYP. In the Technion labs, a new system for breath samples diagnosis, is being developed. The system is based on Nanoparticles technology. The current study will try to identify colon and breast cancer patients through their breath samples and discriminate them from healthy individuals. Men and women coming for colonoscopy or breast biopsy will be recruited for the study. Breath samples will be taken from all volunteers before the medical test. Subjects with positive cancer results by biopsy will be the test groups for both diseases, all others will be the control. The research goal is to test the NaNose system ability to discriminate between healthy and sick.</detailed_description>
