	<brief_summary>The study is a global Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab administered subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult patients aged 12-75 who have been diagnosed with refractory CIU and who remain symptomatic despite standard-dosed H1 antihistamine treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Response Duration and Safety of Xolair (Omalizumab) in Patients With Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU)/Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) Who Remain Symptomatic Despite Antihistamine Treatment (H1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial incorporated a Type I error control plan, as follows: The testing of the primary endpoint was conducted in the following hierarchical order. A p-value that is less than 0.05 can only be claimed statistically significant if statistical significance has been claimed at the previous stage. - Stage 1: Omalizumab 300-mg group vs. placebo - Stage 2: Omalizumab 150-mg group vs. placebo - Stage 3: Omalizumab 75-mg group vs. placebo A hierarchical analysis of the secondary endpoints was performed for each dose found to be significant in the primary endpoint. A p-value that is less than 0.05 can only be claimed statistically significant if statistical significance has been claimed at the previous stage. - Stage 1: Change from baseline in Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at Week 12 - Stage 2: Change from baseline in the weekly number of hives score at Week 12 - Stage 3: Time to weekly itch severity score Minimally Important Difference (MID) response at Week 12 - Stage 4: Proportion of patients with UAS7 â‰¤ 6 at Week 12 - Stage 5: Proportion of weekly itch severity score MID Responders at Week 12 - Stage 6: Change from baseline in weekly size of the largest hive score at Week 12 - Stage 7: Change from baseline in overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at Week 12 - Stage 8: Proportion of angioedema-free days from Week 4 to Week 12</detailed_description>
