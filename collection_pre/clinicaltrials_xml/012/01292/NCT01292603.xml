	<brief_summary>This randomized, parallel-group, multi-center study will compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of subcutaneous administration of MabThera (rituximab) versus intravenous MabThera in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study consists of 2 parts. In part 1, patients who have previously received 4 cycles of intravenous MabThera will receive in Cycle 5 intravenous MabThera and in Cycle 6 subcutaneous MabThera. In part 2, patients will be randomized to receive either 6 cycles of intravenous MabThera, or 1 cycle of intravenous MabThera and 5 cycles of subcutaneous MabThera. Additionally, all patients will receive chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) on Days 1-3 or Days 1-5 of every cycle. The anticipated time on study drug is 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
