	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Low Level Laser Light on Hair Growth on the Female Human Scalp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 20 million women in the United States suffer from hair loss, and about 40% of those women are under forty years of age. The emotional aspects of hair loss for females include anxiety and depression, frustration and poor self-esteem. Androgenetic alopecia is a common cause of female balding and the most likely reason for excessive hair loss. It is believed that light therapy of the scalp will provide an effective means to reduce hair loss and/or stimulate hair growth in females with androgenetic alopecia. Results of previous studies on low level laser therapy (LLLT) have demonstrated a variety of in vitro and in vivo effects including increased blood flow, accelerated wound healing, enhanced production of cytokines and other cellular mediators, increased cellular proliferation, among a panoply of other effects. Enhanced hair growth has been observed adjacent to treated areas in various animal models investigating the effects of LLLT. Uncontrolled studies in humans and spa-based therapies in Europe appear to show that the periodic application of low intensity light therapy reduces hair loss and appears to increase hair growth. The majority of these applications utilize light in the red and near-infrared portions of the spectrum. The Erchonia MLS low level laser is being evaluated for its potential to improve the quality and quantity of hair on the female scalp. This may improve the quality of life as a result of improved self-image and may potentially delay or reduce the need for surgical procedures such as hair transplantation. A successful local therapy would mitigate or reduce the need for systemic agents such as minoxidil and finasteride, thereby minimizing the potential side effects of these therapies.</detailed_description>
