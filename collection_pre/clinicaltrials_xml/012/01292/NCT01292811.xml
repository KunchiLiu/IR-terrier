	<brief_summary>The objective of this research program is to conduct a multi-site clinical randomized control trial that will evaluate the efficacy of functional electrical stimulation based upper limb intervention for people with tetraplegia. This will involve recruiting 84 persons with sub-acute tetraplegia across four sites (Montreal,Toronto, Fredericton and Edmonton) and will serve to evaluate three new Canadian hand function assessments that have been specifically developed for persons with tetraplegia. Although these assessments have been recently tested and have shown considerable promise, further evaluation on their clinical utility (in particular their responsiveness and validity) is required. As well, they need to be compared with one another to determine whether any of these tests is more appropriate for clinical applications or whether further test reduction or augmentation may be required. Having measures that are sensitive and accurate in assessing hand function is key for systematically evaluating emerging therapeutic interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Restoration of Upper Limb Function in Individuals With Sub-Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sustaining a spinal cord injury can impose significant physical dependency and results in financial and psychological challenges to the individual, family and the community at large. For persons with cervical levels of injury (tetraplegia), there is often the loss of hand and upper limb function, which is one of the most devastating consequences of spinal cord injury. The use of hands and upper limbs is needed for daily activities such as feeding, dressing, bathing and toileting. Good hand function plays an important role in the ability to transfer from a bed to a wheelchair, to sit up or to lie down. Not surprisingly, the majority of people with tetraplegia rate recovery of hand function as their highest priority. One of the most promising approaches to improving hand function is functional electrical stimulation, which uses bursts of short electrical pulses to generate muscle contractions. Functional electrical stimulation enables a person, who would otherwise have paralyzed hands, to grasp and release objects. Although Canadian researchers are at the forefront of upper limb rehabilitation, and have recently developed state-of-the-art therapeutic treatments that involve functional electrical stimulation, there is a strong need to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention. A similar situation also exists with upper limb function assessments. At least three clinically promising upper limb assessments have been recently developed in Canada for individuals with spinal cord injury, which require further evaluation to determine their effectiveness. The objective of this research program is to conduct a multi-site clinical randomized control trial that will evaluate the efficacy of functional electrical stimulation based upper limb intervention for people with tetraplegia. This will involve recruiting 84 persons with sub-acute tetraplegia across four sites (Montreal,Toronto, Fredericton and Edmonton) and will serve to evaluate three new Canadian hand function assessments that have been specifically developed for persons with tetraplegia. Although these assessments have been recently tested and have shown considerable promise, further evaluation on their clinical utility (in particular their responsiveness and validity) is required. As well, they need to be compared with one another to determine whether any of these tests is more appropriate for clinical applications or whether further test reduction or augmentation may be required. Having measures that are sensitive and accurate in assessing hand function is key for systematically evaluating emerging therapeutic interventions. The findings of this multi-site clinical trial have the potential to elevate the current standard of upper limb rehabilitation related to hand function by providing higher levels of evidence on the efficacy of functional electrical stimulation therapy intervention. Also, dissemination of the new knowledge gained will translate into better clinical practice since occupational therapists will be able to select better rehabilitation strategies for improving hand function based on solid evidence. By improving the standards of practice, persons with spinal cord injury will have access to a wider range of treatment interventions to restore and improve function in their hands.</detailed_description>
