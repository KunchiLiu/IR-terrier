	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the benefit of the withdrawal of Tacrolimus (Prograf®) on renal function in patients one year after the end of the weaning period. The secondary objectives will focus on assessing the risks and consequences of withdrawal of Tacrolimus (Prograf®).</brief_summary>
