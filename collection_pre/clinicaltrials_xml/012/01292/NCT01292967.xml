	<brief_title>Influence of Sugar on the Bioavailability of Cocoa Flavanols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have conducted a randomized, triple-blind, cross-over study in 15 healthy human volunteers to investigate the absorption and metabolism of cocoa flavanols from a high-flavanol chocolate made with added sugar and a high-flavanol chocolate containing the sugar substitute maltitol; a nutrient-matched low flavanol control product was also fed. All products were matched for macro-nutrients, as well as for alkaloids (theobromine and caffeine), and were similar in taste and appearance. Both high-flavanol products contained ~259 mg cocoa flavanols, whilst the low-flavanol chocolate contained 48 mg of cocoa flavanols. On each study day, subjects were cannulated and baseline blood samples were collected prior to consumption of any of the test chocolates. Additional blood samples were collected at 1, 2 and 4 hours and plasma levels of flavanols were assessed using HPLC with fluorescence detection. All test products were well-tolerated by study participants.</detailed_description>
