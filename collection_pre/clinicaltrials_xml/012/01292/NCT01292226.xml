	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the correlation between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of CellCept in patients undergoing primary kidney transplantation, in order to assess the impact on clinical outcome and the risks of acute rejection. All patients will receive oral CellCept, 1g twice daily, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters will be measured at weeks 2, 4, 12 and 24. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
