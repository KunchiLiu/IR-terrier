	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to establish that hematopoetic stem cells collected on a new centrifugal blood separator, CaridianBCT's Spectra Optia Apheresis System, are able to reconstitute the hematopoetic systems of patients treated with myeloablative therapy, equivalent to hematopoetic cells harvested on the predicate COBE® Spectra platform.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Spectra Optia® Mononuclear Cell Collection Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center (3-5) single-arm study that will compare the performance of the Spectra Optia Apheresis System's MNC protocol to that of the historical performance of the COBE Spectra MNC protocol. In order to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of the two devices, a non-inferiority design will be used. The study will enroll patients with multiple myeloma who are to be treated with myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by bone-marrow rescue with an autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplant. Peripheral blood stem cells will be collected using the Spectra Optia MNC protocol and re-infused following myeloablative chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
