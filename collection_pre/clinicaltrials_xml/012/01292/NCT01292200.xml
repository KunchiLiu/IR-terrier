	<brief_summary>This four-and-a-half-year study will test the efficacy of viewing a theoretically based and culturally sensitive video followed by group discussion (vs. single viewing) in increasing mammography use. The results of this study will lead cancer control efforts to effectively decrease breast cancer screening disparities experienced by Chinese-America women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will conduct a 4.5-year community-based RCT to study the impact of intervention approaches (small-group video discussion vs. single video mode) on mammography used among Chinese immigrant women. The small-group video discussion will be led by trained Chinese community health educators and trained bilingual research staff using a standardized structured protocol at all sites. In the single video mode, we will mail the intervention materials to women to view and/or read at home. We will recruit 974 Chinese women through our strong and well-established Chinese community partnerships in the metropolitan areas of Washington, DC (Lead PI: Dr. Judy Wang, Georgetown University-GU), New York (Site PI: Dr. Grace Ma at Temple University), and southern California (Site PI: Dr. Annette Maxwell, University of California, Los Angeles-UCLA). Participants' eligibility are listed under "eligibility criteria". We will not enroll US-born Chinese women as they are least likely to face cultural and language barriers to mammography and less likely to engage in our small-group discussion, which will be conducted in Chinese languages. Also, we will not enroll short-term visitors as our study involves four interviews over a 2-year period.</detailed_description>
