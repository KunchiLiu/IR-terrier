	<brief_summary>1. To demonstrate that colistin iv. is not inferior to meropenem in empiric treatment of VAP regarding the final point of primary efficacy: mortality in the 28 subsequent days and clinical healing in patients clinically evaluated. 2. To compare the safety of treatment with colistin vs meropenem in VAP. 3. To compare microbiological efficacy of treatment with colistin vs meropenem in VAP</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Colistin Versus Meropenem in Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP) (CR-GNB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study drugs: Patients will be randomized a 1:1 rate and open label fashion to two interventions: group 1: colistin loading dose followed by colistin infusion iv/8h or group 2: meropenem 2 g/iv/ 8 h. The overall treatment time will be a minimum of 8 days. Follow-up visits will be performed at baseline, 72 h, 8 days, the end of treatment, and 28 days from recruitment ICU discharge, hospital discharge or death.</detailed_description>
