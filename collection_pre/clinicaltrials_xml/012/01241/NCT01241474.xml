	<brief_title>Effect of Fish Oil on Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of Type 2 diabetes is related both to age and obesity. The disease impacts on quality of life and treatments represent a major health cost. Prevention or delayed onset of the disease remains a key target. Animal studies have shown that provision of high amounts of fish oil in the diet improves insulin sensitivity but human trials have proved equivocal. Recent dose-response trials in animals have shown the improved insulin sensitivity only occurs when the proportion of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, exceeds 14% of the total phospholipid fraction within tissue cell membranes. To achieve such values in humans would require a high dose of n-3 PUFA supplied over a prolonged period of time. This is tested within the current study where a daily dose of 6 g day of fish oil (containing a total of 3g docosahexaenoic acid plus eicosapentaenoic acid) is supplied for 9 months. As well as improving control of glycemia increased insulin sensitivity may also enhance protein metabolism and reduce the impact of frailty in older subjects.</detailed_description>
