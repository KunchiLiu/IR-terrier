	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by excessive collagen deposition, autoimmunity and by vascular hyper-reactivity and obliterative microvascular phenomena that involves multiple organs. Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) occurs in 5% of patients and mainly with diffuse cutaneous SSc. The routine use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has been reported to dramatically improve outcome, with a fall of the 12-month mortality from 76% to less than 15% in the United-States. Despite prognostic improvement, SRC remains a severe manifestation of SSc and functional outcome and survival remains poor. Bosentan is a specific, orally active, dual endothelin receptor antagonist that has recently been approved for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension and for the prevention of ischemic digital ulcers. Bosentan could have therapeutic benefits on others vascular injuries and particularly in SRC.</brief_summary>
