	<brief_title>Using Videos in Advance Care Planning for Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A.1. Aim 1: To recruit 150 subjects with advanced cancer and randomly assign these subjects to one of two advance care planning (ACP) modalities: 1. a video visually depicting CPR (intervention) or 2. a verbal narrative describing the CPR. Hypothesis 1: It is feasible to recruit and randomize 150 subjects with advanced cancer. A.2. Aim 2: To compare the care preferences for CPR among 150 subjects randomized to video vs. verbal narrative intervention. Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to the video intervention will be significantly more likely to opt NOT to have CPR compared to those randomized to the verbal narrative. A.3. Aim 3: To compare knowledge assessment of CPR for 150 subjects randomized to video vs. verbal narrative intervention. Hypothesis 3: When compared to subjects randomized to the verbal narrative arm, subjects in the video group will have higher knowledge assessment scores when asked questions regarding their understanding of CPR.</detailed_description>
