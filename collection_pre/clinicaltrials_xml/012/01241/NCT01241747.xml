	<brief_summary>Hypothesis #1. Supervised exercise rehabilitation will result in greater increases in exercise performance, peripheral vascular function, and health-related quality of life than compared to the attention-control group. Hypothesis #2. The change in peripheral vascular function will be predictive of improved exercise performance following the supervised exercise program.</brief_summary>
