	<brief_summary>Background of the study: Astaxanthin has been shown to be a powerfull anti-oxidant. Health benefits have been shown in animals and humans. Exercise enhancing effects have been shown in animals via enhancement of fat oxidation. We want to examine the effects of 4 weeks of astaxanthin supplementation on fat oxidation and cycling performance in trained cyclists Objective of the study: To test the hypothesis that 4 weeks supplementation with astaxanthin will improve fat oxidation and improve exercise performance in trained cyclists Study design: Double blind, placebo controlled study. Study population: Well trained cyclists between 18-30 years old Intervention (if applicable): astaxanthin (20 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks Primary study parameters/outcome of the study: performance on a time trial after 90 min steady state exercise. Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable): substrate use plasma glucose plasma lactate plasma free fatty acid plasma astaxanthin Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness (if applicable): The risks involved in participating in this experiment are minimal. Astaxanthin has been shown to be safe. Insertion of the catheters in a vein is comparable to a normal blood draw and the only risk is of a small local haematoma.</brief_summary>
