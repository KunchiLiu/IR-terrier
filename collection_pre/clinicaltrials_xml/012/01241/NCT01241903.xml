	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis for this work is that platelet - leukocyte interactions play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic events. The primary objective of the study is to determine if early, high-dose administration of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin in the setting of acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention exerts beneficial vascular effects by reducing platelet - leukocyte interactions.</brief_summary>
