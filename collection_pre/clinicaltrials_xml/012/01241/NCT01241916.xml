	<brief_summary>Primary Question: "When splinting is used to improve motion in post-traumatic stiff elbows, is there a significant difference in gains in motion achieved between static progressive or dynamic splint approaches?" Secondary Question: "Is there a significant difference in patient compliance with static progressive versus dynamic splint use, and does this effect final ulnohumeral motion outcomes?"</brief_summary>
