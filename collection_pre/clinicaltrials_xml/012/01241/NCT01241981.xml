	<brief_summary>This study will examine a new imaging technique called digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to standard mammography in women under 60 presenting with signs of breast cancer. The reason that we need to do this study is that standard mammography fails to detect the cancer in approximately 20% of these women because younger women have denser breast tissue. We hope that DBT will be more sensitive in detecting breast cancer than standard mammography.</brief_summary>
