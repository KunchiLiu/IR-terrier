	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common ailment affecting a significant portion of the US population. With the advent and increased use of esophageal impedance monitoring, both acid and nonacid reflux disease can be better diagnosed and treated. Patients with severe symptoms or symptoms refractory to medical management may be offered anti-reflux surgery for optimal treatment. Though there are a handful of studies evaluating the efficacy of anti-reflux surgery on those patients with acid or non-acid related reflux disease, the comparison between acid and non-acid reflux disease following surgery is lacking. We propose a prospective study comparing clinical outcomes from those patients with acid versus non-acid reflux disease following anti-reflux surgery with the use of validated and disease specific quality of life surveys.</brief_summary>
