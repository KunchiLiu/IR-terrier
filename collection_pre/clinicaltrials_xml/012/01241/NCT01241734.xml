	<brief_summary>The standard of care therapy for DLBCL in the relapsed setting is RICE with the plan for the patient to proceed to transplant. This protocol will add Revlimid to the first 7 days of the RICE therapy and again after transplant as maintenance. To improve over all outcome and survival. Hypothesis is that combining lenalidomide with standard of care (RICE) may increase overall response rate thus increasing the number of patients able to proceed with autologous stem cell transplant. This in turn may translate into improved overall survival and progression free survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Lenalidomide in Combination With RICE With Lenalidomide Maintenance Post-Auto Transplant for DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-Stage, phase I/II, single-arm, open-label study. The first and second stage of the study will assess the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide, rituximab, Ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (RICER) for the treatment of DLBCL patients in first relapse. The third stage of the study will assess the safety and efficacy of post-ASCT lenalidomide maintenance in patients with DLBC. In stage I of the study, escalating doses of lenalidomide (10, 15, 20, and 25 mg daily x 7 days on Days 1-7) along with RICE therapy will be given to cohorts of subjects in a standard 3+3 design (see section 5.4.2 for dose escalation schema) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined. In stage II, all subjects will be given RICE plus the MTD of lenalidomide. The starting dose of lenalidomide in Stage II will be modified for reduced renal function as outlined in Section 5.4.2. In both stage I and stage II, subjects who have stable disease or progression of disease after 2 cycles of RICER will be taken off study. Subjects who achieve &gt; PR to 2 cycles of RICER will receive a third cycle followed by stem cell collection and ASCT. Each cycle is 14 days. Delays in initiating a new cycle are allowed up to 14 days for Stages I and II. The planned number of cycles is 3. After the second cycle, restaging with PET and CT scans is performed. Patients with progressive disease are removed from the study, chemosensitive patients (CR/Cru and PR) proceed with third cycle of RICER. Stem cell collection will be completed within 10-14 days after third cycle of RICER. HDCMT-autoSCT will be performed after patient recovers from stem cell collection toxicities. HDCMT (high dose chemotherapy) followed by autologous stem cell transplant involves administration of chemotherapy with BEAM (BCNU, Etoposide, Ara-C, Melphalan) followed by infusion of autologous stem cells. Involved-field radiation to the sites of bulky disease will be allowed prior to HDCMT-SCT. Stage III, after recovery from aSCT, but not to exceed 90 days all eligible subjects will receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy (po daily on Days 1-21 q28 days) for up to 1 year. Delays in initiating a new cycle up to 28 days are allowed in Stage III. Subjects will be followed for progression- free survival and overall survival for up to 2 years. The starting dose of lenalidomide maintenance treatment will be based on calculated creatinine clearance within 28 days prior to the start of lenalidomide maintenance</detailed_description>

All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy and surgery, must have been discontinued at least two weeks prior to treatment in this study. 9. ECOG performance status of 2 at study entry (see Appendix B). 10. Laboratory test results within these ranges: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000 /mm³ Platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm³ (unless bone marrow is heavily infiltrated with underlying disease (50% or more) Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min by CockroftGault formula (Appendix E) for patients enrolled into the phase I portion of the study (Stage I). Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min by CockroftGault formula for patients enrolled into the phase II portion of the study (Stage II). See Section 5.4.2 for lenalidomide dose adjustment for calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30ml/min and &lt; 60ml/min. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 3 x ULN. 11. Disease free of prior malignancies for &gt; 5 years with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "insitu" of the cervix or breast. 12. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®. 13. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy.
