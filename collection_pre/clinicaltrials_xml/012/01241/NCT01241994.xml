	<brief_summary>AASD is a new dialysis technique based on the use of a mathematical model of intradialytic solutes and fluid kinetic, for the automatic elaboration of dialysate sodium and ultrafiltration rate profile. The aim of dialysate sodium and ultrafiltration rate profile is to obtain the higher stabilization of intradialytic extra cellular compartment, in consideration of end session targets: body weight and final patient's natremia. In this multicenter prospective controlled randomized trial the primary end-point is the clinical efficiency validation of AASD on intradialytic hypotension but also on thirst, cramps, headache, nausea, vomiting, hypotensive events observed in basal treatment (HD or HDF).</brief_summary>
