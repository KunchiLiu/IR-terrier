	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective study was to compare the 5-year prognostic value of transient elastography (TE), FibroTest (FT), APRI , FIB-4, Lok, and Child-Pugh scores for predicting survival and complications of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognosis Value of Transient Elastography and Non-invasive Markers of Fibrosis in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 1616 patients with chronic hepatitis C was included. At 5 years, 79 patients were dead (39 liver-related deaths) and 16 patients had liver transplantation. Overall survival was 91.7% and survival without liver-related death 94.4%. Survival was significantly decreased in patients diagnosed with severe fibrosis, whatever the non-invasive method used. All these methods were able to predict a shorter survival in this large population. Patients had their prognosis decreased as liver stiffness increased. By multivariate analysis, only FibroTest &gt; 0.74 (OR 4.41, 95%CI 1.62-12.01, p=0.004) was associated with overall survival, and liver stiffness &gt; 9.5 kPa (OR 4.71, 95%CI 1.06-21.01, p=0.04) associated with liver-related death.</detailed_description>
