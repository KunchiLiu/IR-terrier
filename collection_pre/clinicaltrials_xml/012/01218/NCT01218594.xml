	<brief_title>Curative Effect Study of Endostatin Combined With Chemoradiotherapy to Non-small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary:To assess the treatment response rate (RR) of Endostar in combination with CCRT Secondary - The progression-free survival (PFS) - The overall survival(OS). - The failed treatment modality. - The toxicity of this regimen. OUTLINE CCRT:Patients receive chemotherapy comprising Docetaxel(65mg/m2,iv gtt duration&gt;1h) and Cisplatin(65mg/m2,concurrent hydration) on days 1 and 29 and at least 3 hours after chemotherapy undergo concurrent 3D-CRT five days a week for total dose 60-66Gy. Endostatin:Patients receive Endostatin 7.5mg/m2 daily by iv gtt up to 7 days consecutively 1 week before radiotherapy and repeat every 2 weeks. Patients are seen in follow-up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. Physical examination and CT scans of the thorax and upper abdomen are performed routinely.</detailed_description>
