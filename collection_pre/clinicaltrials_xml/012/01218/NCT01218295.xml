	<brief_summary>Many studies suggest that inspiratory muscles training by means of normocapnic hyperpnea improves exercise tolerance in healthy subjects. No information is available about the use of this training in COPD patients even if other methods (such as threshold loading and resistive loading) have been shown to be effective in terms of Inspiratory Muscle Function, Health-Related Quality of Life and Exercise Tolerance. This study is designed to evaluate the effects of normocapnic hyperventilation by means of SpirotigerÂ®, an instrument training the respiratory muscles, avoiding hypocapnia (using the methodology of isocapnic hyperpnoea)in COPD patients.</brief_summary>
