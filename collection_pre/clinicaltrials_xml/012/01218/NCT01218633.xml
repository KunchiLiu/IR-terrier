	<brief_summary>Multiple studies have examined the effect of endogenous GLP-1 secretions by using a competitive antagonist of GLP-1 - Exendin-9,39 - infused at rates of 300pmol/kg/min. However, the presence of an effect does not necessarily imply that this effect is due to the blockade of the endogenous GLP-1 actions at the receptor. It is possible that the supraphysiologic concentrations of Exendin may have effects of its own. To examine the effect of Exendin on glucose metabolism the investigators propose a dose-response study to determine whether the compound has effects in a dose-dependent fashion.</brief_summary>
