	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of a non-adjuvanted vaccine against pandemic influenza A (H1N1)in patients with chronic and or immunocompromised disease, elderly and pregnants. The primary immunological endpoint is to analyze the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more on hemagglutination-inhibition assay 21 days after 1 dose of the vaccine. Volunteers will be monitored for safety during 21 days after vaccination. Volunteers will be recruited based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Vaccine composition is: 15 micrograms of split inactivated virus (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) (NYMC X179A). The hypothesis of the study is that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic in the volunteers recruited.</brief_summary>
