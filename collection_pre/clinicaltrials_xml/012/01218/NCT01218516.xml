	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of farletuzumab versus placebo in combination with either a platinum agent (carboplatin) with paclitaxel or a platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin) with pemetrexed followed by farletuzumab or placebo on investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 or definitive clinical disease progression (eg, new occurrence of positive fluid cytology) in chemotherapynaive participants with folate receptoralpha (FRA)-expressing Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung.</brief_summary>
