	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main cause of death in the European Union. A large part of the aging process, including immunosenescence, is explained by an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory networks, wich results in the low grade chronic pro-inflammatory status termed inflammaging. It can contribute to a number of age-related chronic diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis). Prevention or delay in onset of chronic diseases can potentially benefit a large segment of the elderly population. Now it is hypothesised that a probiotic drink can reduce low-grade inflammation through improvement of the gut barrier function and gut microbiota composition in elderly people with low-grade inflammation.</brief_summary>
