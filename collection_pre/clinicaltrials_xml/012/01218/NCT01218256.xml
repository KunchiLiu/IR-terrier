	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle accounts for up to 40% of the total body weight and is responsible for approximately 75% of the whole body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Resistance training has been shown to improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in patients with T2DM. Therefore the investigators aim to compose the effects of 2 different resistance training protocols in combination with aerobic endurance training (AET) on muscle strength, muscle mass and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (T2DM). The investigators aim to perform an 8 week randomized controlled training intervention in 32 T2DM patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to AET (cycle ergometer, 60-70% of heart rate reserve) combined with hypertrophy resistance training (HRT, n=16, 2 sets, 10-12 repetitions, 70% of the one-repetition maximum) or with endurance resistance training (ERT, n=16, 2 sets, 25-30 repetitions, 40% of the one-repetition maximum). Body composition, blood analyses, physical work capacity and muscle strength will be measured pre- and post-intervention.</brief_summary>
