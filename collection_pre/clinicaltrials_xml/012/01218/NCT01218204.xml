	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Administering Multiple Oral Doses of GSK1292263 Alone and With Atorvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This compound has been studied in healthy subjects and subjects with type II diabetes and is now being studied in subjects with dyslipidemia. Because many patients with dyslipidemia are on statins, it is important to study how GSK1292263 behaves when taken with a potent statin, atorvastatin. The cholesterol lowering drug, ezetimibe, is included for comparison.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adult males and females of nonchildbearingpotential, aged 1875 years who is capable of giving informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory in the absence of a clear postmenopausal history. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until seven days following the last dose. Body weight &gt; 50 kg (110 pounds) and body mass index (BMI) between 19.0 and 39.0 (inclusive). Part A: (i) Subjects who are on 80mg or 40mg atorvastatin for &gt;= 4 weeks and are tolerating the drug well, or (ii) Subjects not on lipidmodifying therapy who have a fasting low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) &gt;= 130mg/dL. In Part B at Screening: Subjects who are on statins or Vytorin treatment for &gt;= 4 weeks. Part B at the end of the 4 week washout: Subjects who have a fasting LDL cholesterol of &gt;=120mg/dL and &lt;=180mg/dL and fasting triglycerides of &gt;=100mg/dL and &lt;=400mg/dL. Part B at the end of the 4 week runin on atorvastatin: Subjects who are tolerating well atorvastatin 10mg or 80mg (as determined by the Investigator). Part B: Subjects must be willing to discontinue statins or Vytorin for the duration of the study. Liver enzymes, AST and ALT &lt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin =&lt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Subjects with Gilbert's syndrome are allowed to participate in the study. Average QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450msec; or QTc &lt; 480msec in subjects with right bundle branch block. A medical history of the following: Clinical or angiographic cardiovascular disease, including history or current evidence of coronary heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease (including stroke and transient ischemic attack [ministroke]), peripheral vascular disease. Subjects pending diagnostic procedures for any of those conditions at the time of screening will not be eligible for participation. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or family history of familial hypercholesterolemia (Part B only). Note: Subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia on 80mg atorvastatin who are tolerating this drug well and fulfill the other eligibility criteria may participate in Part A only. History of recurrent or unexplained muscle aches (e.g., fibromyalgia), myopathy or myositis, whether or not it is related to treatment with statins or other lipid modifying drugs. Renal impairment as defined by a calculated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min History of diabetes mellitus, or history of postprandial and/or random blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl or fasting glucose &gt; 125 mg/dL or currently taking diabetes medications to manage fasting glucose levels (e.g., thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, insulin, metformin).
