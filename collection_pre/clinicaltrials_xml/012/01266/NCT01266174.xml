	<brief_title>Effects of Eltoprazine on Cognitive Impairment Associated With Schizophrenia (CIAS) in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is a common and highly disabling psychiatric disorder with population prevalence around 1%. The manifestations of schizophrenia fall into three major domains: 1) "positive" symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganization of behavior; 2) "negative symptoms," including social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and reduced expression of affect; and 3) cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive deficits are seen in most patients with schizophrenia. Eltoprazine has agonist effects on both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, which suggests that this drug may be useful for normalizing prefrontal cognitive abilities, reducing aggression and impulsivity, and improving cognitive function in schizophrenia. This study will compare the effects of Eltoprazine (as an adjunctive treatment to anti-psychotics) with Placebo in Adults with a DSM IV/DSM IV TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, in potentially improving one or more dimensions of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia.</detailed_description>

Current treatment with any anticholinergic drug in doses above 2 mg daily for benztropine, 5 mg per day for trihexyphenidyl, and 50 mg day for diphenhydramine. Current treatment with benzodiazepines in doses above 10 mg of diazepam (or the equivalent of another drug). Patients with a DSMIV diagnosis of alcohol or substance abuse within the last month or a DSMIV diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence within the last 6 months.
