	<criteria>1. Must meet the World Health Organization criteria for heFH 2. Participants must be on a stable statin dose, with or without ezetimibe, for at least 6 weeks before screening 3. Serum LDLC levels ≥ 100 mg/dL at screening 4. Willing to follow the NCEP ATPIII TLC diet, or an equivalent diet plan, starting at screening and continuing until the last study visit 5. A negative urine/serum pregnancy test at each screening visit and start of the study, for women of childbearing potential Key 1. Participants with homozygous FH (clinically or by previous genotyping) 2. Use of a medication (other than a statin or EZE) to alter serum lipids within 42 days (6 weeks) before screening including, but not limited to: Fibrates Niacin (&gt;500 mg/day) Omega3 fatty acids (&gt;1000 mg/day of DHA/EPA) Bile acid resins 3. Use of nutraceuticals or OTC medications that may alter lipid levels that are not stable for at least 6 weeks before screening and are not planned to remain constant throughout the study. Examples include: Omega3 fatty acids (≤1000 mg/day of DHA/EPA) Niacin (≤500 mg/day) Plant stanols, such as found in Benecol, flax seed oil, psyllium Red yeast rice 4. Disorders known to influence lipid levels, such as nephrotic syndrome, significant liver disease, Cushing's disease, untreated hypothyroidism (patients on stable thyroid replacement for at least 12 weeks before the full screening visit, who are metabolically euthyroid by thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) testing are allowed) 5. Use of thyroid medications (except for replacement therapy which has been stable for at least 12 weeks before the full screening visit) 6. Fasting serum TG &gt;350 mg/dL screening 7. LDL apheresis within 12 months before screening</criteria>
