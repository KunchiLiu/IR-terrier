	<brief_summary>Current tests to detect cancer, including CAT scans and MRI scans, are limited. PET scans use special dyes that are injected into a vein and can better localize possible cancer. The investigators have developed a new particle that can carry a radioactive dye to a very specific area of the tumor. When using a PET scan the radioactive dye can be viewed in areas of possible disease. This particle has been studied in mice and was safe. The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older Histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma or malignant brain tumor at MSKCC Newlydiagnosed or recurrent (local,regional, metastatic) metastatic melanoma or malignant brain tumor patients with Residual clinically or radiographically evident tumor, including primary cutaneous and mucosal melanomas or malignant brain tumor Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery in patients requiring flap reconstruction in the head and neck region. Newly diagnosed patients with previous excisional biopsy. Normal baseline cardiac function based upon preoperative evaluation At the discretion of the physician ANC&gt;1000/mcl and platelets&gt;100,000/mcl. At the discretion of the physician Bilirubin level of &lt; 2.0 mg/dl in the absence of a history of Gilbert's disease (or pattern consistent with Gilbert's). If patients have a history of malignancy other than melanoma or malignant brain tumor they must be diseasefree (excluding primary cancer for metastatic patients) for â‰¥ 5 years at the time of enrollment. All patients of childbearing and childcreating age must be using an acceptable form of birth control Women who are premenopausal must have a negative serum pregnancy test Abnormal thyroid function, such as untreated clinical diagnosis of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or other thyroid disease Known pregnancy or breastfeeding. Medical illness unrelated to the tumor which in the opinion of the attending physician and principal investigator will preclude administration of the tracer. This includes patients with uncontrolled infection, chronic renal insufficiency, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmias other than chronic atrial fibrillation and chronic active or persistent hepatitis, or New York Heart Association Classification III or IV heart disease. History of any malignancy (excluding primary cancer for metastatic patients) other than melanoma or malignant brain tumors for which the diseasefree interval is &lt;5 years. Allergic reaction to iodinecontaining contrast material Weight greater than the 400lb weight limit of the PET scanner Claustrophobia Inability to lie in the scanner for 30 minutes</criteria>
