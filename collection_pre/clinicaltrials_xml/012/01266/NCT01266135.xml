	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), based on an appropriate clinical definition of IPF as detailed in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Statement: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Evidencebased Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management Diagnosis must be confirmed by a diagnostic HRCT or surgical lung biopsy. A 6minute walk test (6MWT) distance â‰¥50 meters at Screening (use of supplemental oxygen allowed). Exclusion criteria Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months).
