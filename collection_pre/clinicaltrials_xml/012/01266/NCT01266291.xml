	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, phase 4 study to examine the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin (Sabril) in Tuberous Sclerosis patients, a subset of the larger refractory complex partial epilepsy population for which the drug is approved. While enrolled on this trial, subjects will continue to take all of their normally prescribed medications, including their other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Alternatively, there is a prospective observational arm that subjects who are about to take Sabril as treatment for seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis may join. Subjects who join this arm will not have any study visits and will not be asked to do anything specifically for the study. The study team will collect all study data from subjects' medical records only.</brief_summary>
