	<brief_title>HLA-A*0201 Restricted Peptide Vaccine Therapy With Gemcitabine With Gemcitabine in Patient Pancreatic Cancer (Phase1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor even with extensive surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. It has been required development of new treatment modalities. Immunotherapy is one of the encouraging modalities for cancer patients. The investigators have to assess its toxicities and immune responsiveness.</detailed_description>
