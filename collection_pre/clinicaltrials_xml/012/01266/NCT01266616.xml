	<brief_summary>Therapeutic HIV vaccines are designed to control HIV infection by boosting the body's natural immune response. There are currently no FDA-approved therapeutic HIV vaccines. This study will test whether giving an HIV-1 vaccine together with or without interleukin 12 (IL-12) is safe and effective. This study will also test a new way of giving the vaccine called electroporation (EP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of and Immune Response to an Investigational HIV-1 Vaccine With or Without Interleukin-12 (IL-12) in HIV-1 Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced HIV infection-related morbidity and mortality, individual response to therapy can be variable. Therapeutic vaccination works by augmenting virus-specific immunity and can be given with or without immunomodulatory agents or adjuvants. In conjunction with HAART, therapeutic vaccination may be a more effective treatment for the suppression of HIV-1 replication. This study will examine the safety and efficacy of giving an investigational vaccine with or without IL-12 in HIV-1 infected adults receiving HAART. This study will also test whether delivering the vaccine using EP is safe and increases the efficacy of the vaccine. Participation in this study will last approximately 36 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of five cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive the HIV multi-antigen plasmid DNA (HIV MAG pDNA) vaccine or placebo intramuscularly (IM) in the upper arm followed by EP. Cohorts 2 through 4 will receive the HIV MAG pDNA vaccine and sequentially increasing doses of GENEVAX IL-12 pDNA or placebo by IM/EP. Cohort 5 will receive the HIV MAG pDNA vaccine with the highest dose of IL-12 pDNA or placebo by needle and syringe in the upper arm. Participants receive two injections at Weeks 0, 4, and 12. Participants will complete a questionnaire that assesses the acceptability of the vaccine and remain at the clinic 30 minutes for observation after each vaccination. Participants will be contacted by telephone 2 to 3 days post-vaccination to assess vaccination-related signs and/or symptoms. All participants will be asked to record their temperatures and any symptoms they experience daily for 4 days following each vaccination on a Vaccination Report Card (VRC). All nonstudy vaccines or medications should also be recorded on the VRC. Study visits will occur at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 24, and 36. At most visits, participants will undergo a physical examination. Women of reproductive potential will also undergo pregnancy testing before receiving injections on Weeks 0, 4, and 12. Blood will be drawn at various time points to evaluate participants' health and measure immunologic markers, CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts, and cytokine levels. Blood and plasma will also be stored for future exploratory studies.</detailed_description>
