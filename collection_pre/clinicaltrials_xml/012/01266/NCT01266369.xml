Patients with one of the following documented mastocytosis: Smouldering systemic mastocytosis Indolent systemic mastocytosis with organomegaly Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis having 2 infiltrated organs (skin and bonemarrow) Any mastocytosis with in the last 6 months at least 3 anaphylactic shocks or syncops requiring either use of adrenaline or medical assistance Cutaneous Mastocytosis (CM) 2. Skin biopsydocumented mastocytosis and evaluable disease based upon: Histological criteria: typical infiltrates of mast cells in a multifocal or diffuse pattern in skin biopsy Clinical criteria: typical skin lesions (maculopapular, urticaria pigmentosa, mastocytoma) 3. Missing data (ckit molecular analysis not done) or documented presence of an activating point mutation in the phosphotransferase domain of ckit such as D816V ckit mutation in at least one infiltrated organ (bone marrow or skin) 4. Refractory to at least one of the symptomatic treatments such as: Anti H1 Anti H2 Proton pump inhibitor Osteoclast inhibitor Cromoglycate Sodium Antileukotriene Other therapies used for the symptomatic care 5.
