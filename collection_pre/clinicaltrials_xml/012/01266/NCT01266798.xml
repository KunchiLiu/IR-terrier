	<brief_summary>Access to the best available evidence, and the ability to obtain and understand such information is seen as necessary to protect the public's interests and critical to empowerment, but is also a precondition for participation in the decision making. A web portal serving as a generic (non disease- specific) tailored tool was developed in the conceptual framework of shared decision making and evidence based practice to improve the lay- public's critical and social literacy skills and activation. A randomized controlled parallel trial using a simple randomization procedure will be conducted, including 200 parents of children &lt;4 with internet access. Parents will be allocated to receive either the portal or no intervention. Primary and secondary outcomes include: the ability to find research based information, critical appraisal skills, perceived behavioural control, attitudes and perceived pressure associated with searching for information, and participation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Parents of children age &lt;4 will be recruited with access to internet. Participants will be excluded if one other in the household already participates in the study (due to spillover effect) and if they do not have children &lt;4. Since the recruitment will be done online, there is no need to screen for access to internet.</criteria>
