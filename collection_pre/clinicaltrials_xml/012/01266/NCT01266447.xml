	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial is studying the how well veliparib, topotecan hydrochloride, and filgrastim or pegfilgrastim work in treating patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by blocking them from dividing. Giving veliparib with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim may cause the body to make more blood cells and help it recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib, Topotecan Hydrochloride, and Filgrastim or Pegfilgrastim in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the antitumor activity (objective response rate by RECIST 1.1) of ABT-888 (veliparib) 10 mg administered orally twice a day on days 1 to 5 with topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride) 0.6 mg/m^2 administered IV once daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle in patients with persistent or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix. II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ABT-888 and topotecan in patients with persistent or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether evidence of an interaction exists between study treatments and tumor expression of poly(ADP-ribos)ylation of E2 protein, E6/E7 proteins, and p53R2 in relation to progression-free and overall survival or metastasis. (Translational) II. To explore the association between methylation of FanCF and BRCA in pre-treatment tumor samples and pre- and post-treatment biopsy samples and response, progression-free and overall survival of patients, and/or metastasis. (Translational) OUTLINE: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily and topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once daily on days 1-5. Patients also receive, according to institutional standard, filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 6, 7, or 8 and continuing until hematopoietic recovery or pegfilgrastim SC on day 6, 7, or 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor tissue samples may be collected periodically for translational studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with documented disease progression; histological documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patient must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III protocol or Rare Tumor protocol for the same patient population Patients must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration; continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy, biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy and immunologic agents must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration; all side effects must have resolved to =&lt; grade 1 or stabilized, prior to enrolling on this study Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration Patients MUST have had one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management of advanced, metastatic, or recurrent squamous or nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix; chemotherapy administered concurrent with primary radiation is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen (e.g.; weekly cisplatin); adjuvant chemotherapy given following the completion of radiation therapy (or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen (e.g.; paclitaxel and carboplatin for up to 4 cycles) Patients who are registered during the safety leadin portion of this protocol are required to have prior pelvic radiation Patients must have NOT received more than one previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen (either with single or combination cytotoxic drug therapy) Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease Patients MUST not be eligible for further curative intent surgical or pelvic radiation treatment for management of recurrent or persistent disease as determined by treating physicians Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN) Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 3 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN Neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to grade 1 Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information Patients must meet preentry requirements Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
