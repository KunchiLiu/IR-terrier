	<brief_summary>To rapidly adapt or deescalate the initially broad antibiotic treatment, an antibiogram analysis is required. E test strips have successfully provided an antibiogram 24 h after having been directly applied to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). An open-label, prospective cohort study of consecutive patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia will be conducted with the aim of validating a new method increasing the rapidity of antibiogram analysis compared to standard methods of culture. This antibiogram will be provided by E test strips directly applied to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples and analyzed from the 6th up to the 24th hour after its completion. The occurrence of major errors (S with E test method, I or R with standard method) and minor errors (I or R with E test method and S with standard method)will be observed and a comparison of H6, H10 and H24 results performed.</brief_summary>
