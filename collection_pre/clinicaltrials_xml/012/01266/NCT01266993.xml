	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the persistence of the immune response of GSK134612 vaccine up to 68 months after vaccination in the primary vaccination study (NCT number = NCT00674583) of 2 to 10 year old subjects. This study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of GSK134612 vaccine subjects who were primed in the primary vaccination study with either GSK134612 vaccine or Menjugate®. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the persistence and booster epochs. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary epoch are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00674583)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistence and Booster Study of GSK Biologicals' Meningococcal Vaccine (GSK134612) in Healthy Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were previously vaccinated at 2 to 10 years of age with GSK134612 or with Menjugate®. The persistence phase starts 32 months after the primary vaccination and blood samples will be taken at 32, 44, 56 and 68 months after primary vaccination. All subjects will receive a booster dose of GSK134612 at 68 months after primary vaccination and a blood sample will be taken 1 month after administration of the booster dose.</detailed_description>

Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representatives(s) of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject (at investigator discretion). Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. All subjects must meet the additional following criteria prior to receiving the booster vaccination: Subjects who had a blood sample taken at Visit 4 during the persistence epoch of the current study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

(For corticosteroids, prednisone &lt;10 mg/day, or equivalent, inhaled and topical steroids are allowed). Concurrently participating in another clinical study or planned participation in another clinical study, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product within 30 days of a blood sample. History of meningococcal disease. Administration of a meningococcal polysaccharide or a meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine since the previous vaccination in the primary vaccination study (NCT number = NCT00674583). Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, based on medical history and physical examination. Serious chronic illness. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products within the 3 months preceding the subject's first visit. Bleeding disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anticoagulant therapy. Subjects in contact with somebody suffering from an invasive infection with meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y or W135. Subjects living in a geographic area where local outbreak with meningococcal serogroup C has occurred. Exclusion criteria for booster vaccination to be checked at Visit 4 (Month 68) Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days preceding the booster vaccination or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster vaccination. (For corticosteroids, prednisone &lt;10 mg/day, or equivalent, inhaled and topical steroids are allowed). Vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine of serogroup A, B, C, W135, and/or Y since the previous vaccination in the primary vaccination study (NCT number = NCT00674583). History of meningococcal disease. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, based on medical history and physical examination. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study or planned participation in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, (from the time of the booster until the end of the study) in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Bleeding disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anticoagulant therapy. Hypersensitivity to latex. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the last 30 days of the dose of vaccine(s) with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Previous vaccination with tetanus toxoids within the last 30 days. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures (although subjects with a prior history of a single episode of benign febrile seizures may be allowed to participate in the study). Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. History of hypotonichyporesponsive episodes (HHEs) following vaccination.
