	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Fluticasone Furoate and GW642444M Combination in Healthy Subjects and in Subjects With Mild, Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In relation to their severity, hepatic diseases can significantly modify drug absorption and disposition and consequently can interfere with drug efficacy and/or produce toxicity. Pathological modifications of liver structure or functionality might result in complex modifications of various factors including liver blood flow, hypoalbuminaemia, indirectly affect renal function and reduce the hepatic drug metabolizing capability including the microsomal oxidase system [Howden, 1989]. Although FF/GW642444M is delivered directly to the site of action, i.e. the lungs, a large portion of the administered dose is swallowed. For both FF and GW642444 any drug absorbed from the GI tract undergoes first pass metabolism via CYP3A4. In addition, drug absorbed into the systemic circulation is metabolised in the liver and removed by biliary clearance. Hence, there is a possibility that when used by patients with impaired liver function the pharmacokinetics of inhaled FF and/or GW642444 may be changed due to reduced first pass metabolism and/or reduced clearance. The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a dose adjustment is justified and in estimating any such adjustments in patients with impaired hepatic function. This is an open-label, non-randomized study which will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled FF 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg in subjects with hepatic impairment following 7 days once daily dosing. Subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment (as defined by a Child-Pugh score of 5-15) will be recruited along with healthy control subjects matched to the moderate subjects (matched on gender, ethnicity, body mass index +/-15%, age +/-5 years). Approximately thirty-six subjects will be recruited: 9 subjects for each severity and 9 matched healthy subjects. All subjects are scheduled to receive FF 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once daily for 7 days. The dose for subjects with severe hepatic impairment may be adjusted to FF 100mcg/GW642444M 12.5mcg after review of the PK and safety data from the moderate and healthy matched control subjects. The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a dose adjustment is required in subjects with hepatic impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) (healthy subjects only) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until completion of the followup visit. BMI within the range 19 33 kg/m^2. Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhalation inhaler. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Single QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhaler. Healthy subjects: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures or outcome. Hepatically Impaired Subjects: Hepatically impaired. To be classified as hepatically impaired, subjects must have: Known medical history of liver disease with or without a known history of alcohol abuse; and A ChildPugh score of 515 to cover all severities (Mild = 56 points; Moderate = 79 points; Severe = 1015 points). The components that contribute to the CP score should be directly related to the underlying hepatic disease and not to nonhepatic disease. Subjects with no significant abnormality, apart from impaired hepatic function and related symptoms, or clinical examination. A subject with a clinical abnormality may be included only if the Investigator considers that the abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Hepatically impaired subjects with other laboratory parameters outside the reference ranges will only be included if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the result is not clinically important and introduces no additional risk factors. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: Suffered a lower respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks before the screening visit. Taken oral corticosteroids less than 8 weeks before the screening visit. Taken inhaled, intranasal or topical steroids less than 4 weeks before the screening visit.

Healthy subjects If, in the opinion of the examining physician, an unstable cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, neurological, haematological or gastrointestinal condition is present or any other medical condition which the investigator considers sufficiently serious to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject. Subjects with any predisposing condition that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or any previous gastrointestinal (GI) surgery (except appendectomy or cholecystectomy more than three months prior to the study) condition which the investigator considers sufficiently significant to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject. Haemoglobin values &lt;12.9g/dL for males and &lt;11.4g/dL for females. A past history or current symptoms of significant hepatic or renal disease, pancreatitis or acute cholecystitis which the investigator considers sufficiently significant to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.

Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inhibitor) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. In particular subjects taking steroids or medications that significantly inhibit P450 CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole) must not be included in this study. Hepatically Impaired Subjects If in the opinion of the examining physician, an unstable cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, neurological, haematological or gastrointestinal condition is present or any other significant medical condition which the investigator considers sufficiently serious to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.
