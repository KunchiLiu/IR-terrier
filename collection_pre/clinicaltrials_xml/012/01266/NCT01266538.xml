	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), undefined IBD and pouchitis (in patients who required IPAA for their colitis) affects about two million people in the world. At this time there is no definitive cure and current treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and inflammation that accompany these diseases. These diseases are predominantly chronic, and patients may experience various gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the location, nature, and extent of their disease. Both genetic and environmental factors play etiological roles. The overall goal of our research is to understand the etiology and course of these diseases in order to prevent and to manage cases more effectively. In order to do so we are aiming at building a comprehensive database that will include detailed clinical data conjoined with dedicated research information and collection of biological specimens that will target the gut epithelium immune system, the microbiota and specific genetic risk factors.</detailed_description>
