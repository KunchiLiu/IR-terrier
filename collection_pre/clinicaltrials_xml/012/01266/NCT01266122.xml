	<brief_title>Addressing Psychosocial Needs and HIV Risk in Indian MSM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MSM in India are at increased risk for HIV in a stigmatizing environment that includes discrimination and violence. There is a need for evidence-based MSM HIV prevention interventions that address HIV risk in the context of these psychosocial issues. This study consists of formative qualitative work followed by the development and testing of a pilot behavioral HIV prevention intervention for MSM in Chennai, India. Study goals are to maximize intervention feasibility and acceptability, estimate an effect size for a power analysis, and prepare for a full-scale trial to follow. PHASE 1-Intervention Development. This phase involved the collection of formative data through MSM focus groups and key informant interviews to develop a subsequent pilot behavioral intervention. PHASE 2-Open Pilot. Following Phase 1, the team conducted an open-phase non-randomized pilot of the intervention. Enrollment involved a baseline assessment that included an interviewer-administered behavioral assessment and voluntary counseling and testing for HIV and the STIs, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Eleven MSM in Chennai then completed 6 group sessions and 4 individual sessions over 3 months. A follow-up behavioral assessment was administered upon completion of all sessions, and 6 months after baseline participants were again administered the questionnaire and HIV/STI testing. PHASE 3-Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial. The study is currently in Phase 3, and the data articulated in this registry is for Phase 3. We are now conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention among 6 "batches" of 8 MSM in each group (n=48). Comparison groups (n=48) will receive the same baseline assessment and voluntary HIV/STI counseling and testing as the intervention groups. Based on Phase 2 findings, the intervention groups will meet for 4 group sessions and 4 individual sessions. Those assigned to receive the comparison condition will not receive these sessions. Participants complete the assessments approximately 3 months after randomization, and again 3 months after that.</detailed_description>
