	<brief_summary>Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common and distressing cardiac arrhythmia and accounts for 1% of the healthcare budget in the UK and it's prevalence is rising. Symptoms of atrial fibrillation include palpitations, chest pain , shortness of breath and fatigue, with quality of life measures reduced for patients with persistent AF, increased stroke risk and increased all cause mortality rates. DC Cardioversion is used to restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF. It has a high success rate but reoccurence of AF is common. The use of anti arrhythmic drugs (AADs) can augment the number of patients remaining in sinus rhythm at one year, with amiodarone currently the most superior. Unfortunately it can have serious side affects. Dronedarone is a related drug designed specifically to minimise the most serious side affects and is no approved and used prominently in the management of non permanent AF. However it has not yet been studied in a post DC Cardioversion population. Patients in persistent AF who are referred for elective DC Cardioversionwill be randomised to receive either Amiodarone or Dronedarone to compare the ability to help maintain sinu rhythm post cardioverion in one NHS hospital. Patients will be followed up for a year post cardioversion to see if they stay in sinus rhythm. Ho: there will be no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm with the use of amiodarone or dronedarone</brief_summary>
