	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess current practice within PROP &amp; lung teams, for treating asymptomatic patients with centrally located non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to observe outcomes for those patients receiving immediate or deferred RT. This is a prospective cohort trial. Patients will be managed by immediate radiotherapy (RT) or a deferred approach according to physicians' individual current clinical practice. Baseline and follow-up data collection will be structured to focus on patient-reported measures to describe clinical outcomes in the two management groups. Indications for prescribing RT and dose fractionation schedules will also be collected. A new intervention will not be introduced during this trial. Instead, a follow-up regimen will be offered to both groups of patients, so that RT can be offered to the deferred group of patients if/when symptoms develop, and we can monitor symptoms/toxicities and QoL in both groups of patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC Central disease, as defined by tumour (either primary or nodal disease) arising or extending within a 2cm circumferential expansion from the centre of the trachea or within the zone of the proximal bronchial tree Disease is visible on thoracic CT (diagnostic or simulation) Asymptomatic from intrathoracic tumour (may have background chest symptoms related to underlying COAD etc, but these symptoms must not have worsened due to tumour) Patient (due to age or comorbidities) or tumour (due to locally advanced or metastatic disease) is not suitable for radical treatment (defined as surgery or RT dose &gt;50Gy in 20 fractions or equivalent). Previous chemotherapy, thoracic RT or surgery is allowed RT to other metastases (e.g. brain, bone etc) is allowed •≥ 18 years of age Able to provide written informed consent Intrathoracic disease is peripheral only, not extending within 2cm of trachea/proximal bronchial tree Symptomatic from intrathoracic NSCLC Histological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, or malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy from another malignancy (not NSCLC)</criteria>
