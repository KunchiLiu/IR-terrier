	<brief_summary>Airway management is one of the most important tasks facing the physician, especially the anesthesiologist. Fast and correct performance of endotracheal intubations done as normal routine in the operating room, but can save life everywhere. To make intubation easier, several newly designed tubes and laryngoscopes are developed and tested every year. Their performance is evaluated subjectively by the acting anesthesiologist, and by using objective parameters such as speed of intubation, the force applied during laryngoscopy , or catecholamines secretion during intubation as a stress parameter . The studies set for testing these parameters lead to establish accepted indications for the treatment of the airway in cases of anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway. In the present study we will compare the performance parameters of intubation using Etview Tracheoscopic Ventilation Tube - TVT to the standard tube, of which most of daily intubations are carried with. The Etview TVT is similar to the standard endotracheal tube; its outer dimensions and material is exactly as the standard tube, the difference is only the inner fiber of the camera.</brief_summary>
