	<brief_summary>The main objective of the multi-centered collaborative study is to evaluate the accuracy, efficacy and clinical advantages of prenatal diagnosis using microarray analysis as compared with conventional karyotyping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prenatal Cytogenetic Diagnosis by Array-Based Copy Number Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically, the aims are as follows: 1. Demonstrate the performance of microarray analysis as a clinical method for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis with regard to: 1. Accuracy in the detection of the common autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploid (trisomies, 13,18,21, 45,X, 47,XXY, etc.) 2. Ability of microarray to diagnose less common, but clinically significant, cytogenetic aneusomies (e.g. DiGeorge, Williams, Smith- Magenis, Prader-Willi syndrome, etc.) currently not detected by conventional karyotype. 3. Evaluation of the utility of microarray in specific clinical scenarios such as ultrasound detection of congenital anomalies and fetal growth disorders. 2. Evaluate the appropriate construction of prenatal diagnostic microarray devices to allow maximal detection of clinically relevant information with minimal detection of unexpected and difficult to interpret findings which have no clinical significance but might provoke patient anxiety. 3. Evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using microarrays as a primary prenatal diagnostic tool. 4. Evaluate approaches to integrate microarray into clinical prenatal cytogenetic diagnostic practice. 5. Develop a prenatal diagnostic tissue repository (TDR) to facilitate the further development of microarray technology. This will be used to investigate the molecular etiologies of specific fetal anomalies and to test newer technologies, such as higher resolution microarrays.</detailed_description>
