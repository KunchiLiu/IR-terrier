	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open label study of up to 20 patients with prostate cancer scheduled for prostatectomy at the NIH Clinical Center. 123I-MIP-1072 image data will be evaluated for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of 123I-MIP-1072 SPECT/CT Imaging With Optional Compact Gamma Camera Probe Imaging in Men With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory, single arm, open label pilot study evaluation of 123I-MIP-1072 intraprostatic uptake determination by SPECT/CT imaging (and optional CGCP imaging), with histological confirmation of disease localization and staging. Methodical evaluation of 123I-MIP-1072 in intraprostatic tumorous and non-tumours regions will provide important preliminary data upon which further clinical studies can be based. The optional additional CGCP imaging was added, because of its inherent potential for higher resolution scintigraphic detection of 123I-MIP-1072 localization. This imaging feasibility data will provide important preliminary information for the use of CGCP imaging in prostate cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must be scheduled to undergo standard of care prostatectomy for presumed localized prostate cancer at the NIH Clinical Center. Have had or will undergo multiparametric endorectal coil 3T MR at the NIH clinical center Recent (within 12 months of study entry) transrectal biopsy indicating the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland Participant must be 18 years or older. ECOG Performance grade of 0 to 2. (see Appendix 1) Ability to understand and provide informed consent. All subjects must sign a document of informed consent indicating their understanding of the investigational nature and risks of the study before any protocol related studies are performed. Participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control, defined as abstinence, barrier or other acceptable, effective contraceptive method until 7 days after the infusion of study drug. Participants for whom participating would significantly delay the scheduled standard of care therapy. Subjects must not have prostate biopsies performed within 12 weeks before imaging; or within 8 weeks before imaging providing that the absence of hemorrhage is confirmed by MR imaging. SGOT and SGPT ≥ 2 x of the upper limits of normal; total bilirubin, of ≥ 1.5 x the upper limits of normal or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. Administered a radioisotope within 5 physical half lives prior to study enrollment. Patients with severe claustrophobia unresponsive to oral anxiolytics Subjects weighing ≥350 lbs or are unable to fit within the imaging gantry Subjects who have received androgen deprivation therapy. Subjects with any medical condition or other circumstances that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would significantly decrease obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives or completing the study.</criteria>
