	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate monitoring methods during ovulation induction cycles with letrozole and their effect on pregnancy rates. Monitoring ovulation induction cycles with letrozole can be done with a variety of methods, the two most commonly utilized are home-based urinary LH kits (or ovulation predictor kits) and office-based midcycle follicular ultrasound. Letrozole coupled with follicular monitoring by ultrasound may add extra cost per cycle with no improvement in fecundability (pregnancy rates per cycle).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of High Cost Monitoring During Letrozole Ovulation Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a randomized controlled trial of adult women with primary and secondary infertility seen at the University of Michigan Health System undergoing ovulation induction (OI) with letrozole as part of their standard clinical care. Patients who are undergoing OI with letrozole as per standard clinical care will be randomized to urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) ovulation predictor kit use versus mid-cycle ultrasound with administration of hCG when appropriate for timing of intercourse or intrauterine insemination. Patients who have been prescribed letrozole as per routine clinical care will be approached to determine willingness to participate in this study. Study period involves up to three ovulation induction cycles or until pregnancy occurs.</detailed_description>
