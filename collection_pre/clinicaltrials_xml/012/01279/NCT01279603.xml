	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is about testing GO-203-2c, which is a newly discovered compound that binds to an oncoprotein (a cancer causing protein) called MUC1 (which is over-expressed in many cancers). By binding to MUC1, GO-203-2c eventually causes tumor cell death in laboratory studies. This study is being done to: - Test the safety of GO-203-2c and see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your cancer - Find the highest dose of GO-203-2c that can be given without causing bad side effects - Examine how much GO-203-2c is in the blood at certain times after it is given and how quickly the body gets rid of it - Observe whether there is any effect of GO-203-2c on the size and activity of cancer in your body</brief_summary>

Corrected serum calcium ≥ lower limit of the institutional normal range (LLN) Serum phosphorus level ≥ LLN Adequate hematologic function: Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000 (cells/mm3) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Urinalysis: No clinically significant abnormalities Adequate coagulation function: PT ≤ 1.25 x ULN PTT ≤ 1.25 x ULN For men and women of childproducing potential, agreement to use effective contraceptive methods during the study New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on ECG Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections requiring systemic therapy Pregnant or nursing women. NOTE: Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, or not fully recovered by Day 1 Minor surgery within 2 weeks prior to Day 1, or not fully recovered by Day 1 Treatment with radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Received systemic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody or other immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 (exceptions: 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin C, or any agent with a known treatment effect &gt; 4 weeks' duration), or not fully recovered from any side effects from previous therapy by Day 1 History of allergic reactions attributed to excipients or chemical products used in the final GO2032c drug formulation Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Subjects with risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation or pulmonary hemorrhage (e.g. unresected luminal intestinal cancers; abdominal carcinomatosis within 3 months before the first dose of study drug, abdominal fistula, acute diverticulitis, peptic ulcer disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, pulmonary hemorrhage, hemoptysis, or tuberculosis) Currently receiving or having received treatment with any other investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, or not fully recovered from toxicities of prior treatment by Day 1 Serious and/or poorly controlled nonmalignant disease (including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, hydronephrosis, hypertension, diabetes, or other conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the sponsor. Patients with such conditions should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment. All medical conditions must be NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or lower at baseline.
