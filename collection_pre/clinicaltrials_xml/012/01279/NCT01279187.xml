	<brief_summary>Good bone healing and bone build-up are necessary for the success of dental implants. Research in animals and humans has shown that a drug, called Forteo, can increase bone build-up and bone strength over time. Forteo has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with a condition where bone is broken down and weakened, called osteoporosis. The investigators do not know, however, whether Forteo is effective for use in humans for improving bone healing after implant placement, and whether it will have the same bone-building and bone-strengthening effects as for patients with osteoporosis. This research study is being done to learn what effect 7 weeks of treatment with Forteo will have on bone build-up and strengthening of bone for patients receiving implants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single center, placebo-controlled, double blind parallel study of teriparatide use in patients requiring dental implant therapy is planned. Subjects who qualify based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups, teriparatide (20 Î¼g/day) or placebo control. Both patients and investigators will be blinded. Serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, radiographs, and a tetracycline-labelled bone core will constitute the main data gathered for analysis. After implant surgery, patients will return at 2 weeks for post-operative care and then at 14 weeks for an implant impression and again at 16 weeks to receive the final restoration. Twelve months after implant placement, patients will be seen for a follow-up exam and standardized radiograph to ensure proper healing.</detailed_description>
