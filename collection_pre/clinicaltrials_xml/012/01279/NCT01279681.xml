	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab with or without oxaliplatin works in treating older patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab is more effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab With or Without Oxaliplatin in Treating Older Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of elderly patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who are randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil)-based therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. In a prospectively planned pooled analysis with a similar trial to be conducted by the Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG), evaluate and compare the overall survival (OS) of elderly patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who are randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin. II. To assess and compare response rates and adverse events of elderly patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on physician decision for fluoropyrimidine. ARM A1: Patients receive fluorouracil intravenously (IV) over 46-48 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 10-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM A2: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on physician decision for fluoropyrimidine. Arm B1: Patients receive mFOLFOX7 comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 10-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm B2: Patients receive XELOX comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>
