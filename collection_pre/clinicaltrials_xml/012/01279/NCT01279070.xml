	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to develop an integrative intervention for schizophrenia taking into account previous efficacious therapies. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of our cognitive remediation group training: Problem Solving and Cognitive Flexibility training (REPYFLEC), focused to improve neurocognition and functioning in schizophrenia patients. We hypothesized that training executive function and metacognition would allow us to achieve improvements in neurocognition, functioning and psychiatric symptoms of patients with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
