	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of hepatic pathology, ranging from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, to cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more advanced form of disease where steatosis is accompanied by hepatocyte injury as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells. Since, both vitamin E and PTX has been found to improve NASH when used alone, a combination of these two should be expected to give better results because of targeting two different pathogenetic mechanisms (cytokines amplification and oxidative stress) in NASH patients. This will be open labelled, prospective, randomized study. The diagnosis of NAFLD will be made on the basis of Ultrasonographic findings suggestive of fatty liver and presence of insulin resistance or features of metabolic syndrome. Subsequently histologic confirmation of the diagnosis of NASH will be made in all cases.</brief_summary>
