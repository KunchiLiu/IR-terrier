	<brief_summary>This project aimed to explore novel methods of detecting small blood vessel disease in a paediatric population with type 1 diabetes mellitus. To do this the techniques of Nailfold capillaroscopy, laser Doppler flowmetry, retinal (eye) vessel analysis and 24-hr Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring were used. Each of these techniques investigated different areas of small blood vessels around the body. It was hypothesized that in a paediatric population with type 1 diabetes mellitus the novel investigations would be associated with small blood vessel disease and that widespread changes to these blood vessels would be detected through associations between the different novel investigations.</brief_summary>
