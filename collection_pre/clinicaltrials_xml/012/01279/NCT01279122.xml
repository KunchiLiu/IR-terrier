	<brief_title>Evaluation of Visual Outcomes of Monovision Patients Bilaterally Implanted With Nanoflex Intraocular Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male or female patients at least 18 years of age. Patients who have bilateral NanoFlex implantation at least 3 months previously. No significant ocular pathology causing DCVA to be less than 20/25 or causing significant visual loss. DCVA of 20/25 or better in both eyes. Spherical equivalent in the dominant eye to be +/.50 or less and in the nondominant eye to be between1.00 and 1.87. Uncorrected VA in dominant eye 20/25 or better. History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery (minor ocular trauma is allowed such as small superficial corneal scar not effecting vision; some prior ocular surgery is allowable so long as it has not impacted visual acuity. Amblyopia or strabismus, significant visual field loss, or posterior capsular opacifcation. Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.).</criteria>
