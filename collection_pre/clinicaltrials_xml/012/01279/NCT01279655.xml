	<brief_summary>In the current study the researchers will firstly investigate whether a bimanual coordination training protocol (20 min/day, for 8 consecutive weeks) correlates with changes in white matter architecture and improved upper-limb functionality in patients with multiple sclerosis. Secondly, the researchers predict that motor learning is more efficient when it is combined with anodal transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation on the left primary motor cortex.</brief_summary>
