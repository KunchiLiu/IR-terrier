	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine whether High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) is a superior respiratory modality for neonates ≥36 weeks with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) when compared to the standard of care modality (NCPAP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal Cannula Versus Bubble Nasal CPAP for the Treatment of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn in Infants ≥ 35 Weeks Gestation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn, fetal lung fluid retention causing poor lung compliance and atelectasis, is a common entity in neonates ≥ 36 weeks in our unit. Currently our standard of care includes using the respiratory modality of bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure (BNCPAP) to support these neonates during this illness. BNCPAP provides positive distending pressure to recruit alveoli and prevent atelectasis, however, it is associated with air leak (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum), nasal irritation and necrosis, and intolerance. HFNC is another respiratory modality that uses high flow gas that also provides positive distending pressure and thus prevents atelectasis. This modality does not cause nasal irritation or necrosis and has a minimal risk of air leak. We postulate that HFNC is a superior modality to BNCPAP in treating neonates ≥ 36 weeks with TTN. This will be determined by comparing the duration of respiratory support (in hours) for newborns ≥ 36 weeks gestation with a diagnosis to TTN randomized to receive either NCPAP or HFNC for respiratory care.</detailed_description>
