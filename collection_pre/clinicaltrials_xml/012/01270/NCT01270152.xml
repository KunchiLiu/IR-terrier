	<brief_title>Determining the Safe Dosage of Ascorbic Acid Used in the Treatment of Occluded Totally Implanted Central Venous Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Totally implanted catheter is often occluded and thrombolytic drugs are usually used to restore permeability. In Brazil, the ascorbic acid has been used successfully by a service specialist in cancer treatment. However, no literature on international research that evaluates the efficacy and safety of this procedure. That was why it was decided to develop this research.</detailed_description>
