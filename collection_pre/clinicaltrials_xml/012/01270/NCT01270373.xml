	<brief_title>NeoSAMBA: Neoadjuvant: Does the Sequence of Anthracycline and Taxane Matters: Before or After?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthracylines and taxanes are the most active chemotherapy agents in the treatment of breast cancer. The usual sequence of an anthracycline followed by a taxane is due to the timing of their discovery and introduction in the treatment armamentarium. More recent evidence suggests that there is pre clinical as well as clinical rational for the reverse sequence. The neoadjuvant approach allows quick evaluation of these different treatment strategies. At the same time, the study will collect tissue biopsies and blood at different time points in order to evaluate predictive biomarkers.</detailed_description>
