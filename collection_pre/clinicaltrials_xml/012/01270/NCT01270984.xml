	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of Luckyvec 400mg Tablet, in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (Crossover) of Luckyvec 400mg tablet(x 1T) and Glivec 100mg(x 4T)as of Imatinib 400mg. Every time before and after each medication, PK parameters and safety of Luckyvec 400mg tablet and Glivec 100mg is performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests(Laboratory test, V/S, Physical Examination, etc) respectively.</detailed_description>
