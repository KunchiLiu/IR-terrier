	<detailed_description>Despite extensive legislative, law enforcement, and public awareness efforts, driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) remains a major cause of mortality and loss of years of productive life. A brief motivational interview (BI) is a non-confrontational, patient-centered discussion during which the individual's motivation and confidence to change health-related behaviors are explored. Previous studies of BIs in health care settings suggest that BIs administered after hospitalization for alcohol-related injury reduce the likelihood of repeat injury hospitalization and arrest for DUI. This study will evaluate whether brief motivational interviews reduce problematic drinking behavior among individuals arrested for the first time for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).</detailed_description>
