	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically documented, advancedstage, primary or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no curative standard therapy exists. Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease. All acute toxic affects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical procedures must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 3.0) Grade â‰¤1; surgery must have occurred at least 28 days prior to study enrollement. Age must be at least 18 years. Last dose of antineoplastic therapy (except for hormonal therapy) must be more than 21 days; subjects may continue to receive luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone analog therapy for prostate cancer. ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patient must meet protocolspecified laboratory values. Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent. Intracranial edema, intracranial metastasis, or epidural disease. Pregnant or breastfeeing women. Female subjects must agree to use effective contraception, must be surgically sterile, or must be postmenopausal. Male subjects must agree to use effective contraception or be surgically sterile. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator or a designated associate. All atrisk female subjects must have a netative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment. Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III or IV) including preexisting arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or subjects with baseline mean QTc interval greater than 450 msec (males) and 470 msec (females) or grade 2 or higher compromised left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by MUGA or ECHO. Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent. Diabetes mellitus (insulindependent or independent disease requiring chronic medication). Previous pericarditis; clinically significant pleural effusion in the previous 12 months or current ascites requiring two or more interventions/month. Malabsorption syndrome or uncontrolled gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea, diarrhea, vomitting) with toxicity greater than NCI CTCAE grade 2. Prior acute or chonic pancreatitis of any etiology. Prior intraor extrahepatic biliary obstruction wtihin the previous 12 months or history of malignant obstruction requiring a bilary stent, unless stably treated with no prior obstruction or blockage of the stent. Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or studydrug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, make the subject inappropriate for this study. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
