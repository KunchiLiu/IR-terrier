	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of anti-VEGF drug (Avastin) adminstration in eyes prior to surgical treatment for Traction retinal detachment (TRD) in patients with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avastin for PDR (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traction retinal detachment (TRD) due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a blinding disease caused by contraction of fibrovascular proliferation, treatment of which is limited to surgery. Fibrosis and neovascularization are both associated with high levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the eye. Small, nonrandomized studies have suggested that pre-operative adjunctive anti-VEGF administration may reduce intra- and post-operative complications and provide visual benefit in patients with this condition.</detailed_description>
