	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Evaluating Performance of the Trevo Retriever Versus the Merci Retriever in Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TREVO 2 protocol was designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Trevo Retriever device and determine if it is substantially equivalent to the predicate Merci Retriever. The trial utilized a Primary Effectiveness Endpoint of revascularization and a composite Primary Safety Endpoint that included procedure-related serious adverse events occurring within 24 hours of the procedure. Subjects who presented to enrolling centers with large ischemic strokes were screened for eligibility in the study. If a subject met eligibility criteria, then Informed Consent was obtained prior to commencing the angiogram. If all inclusion/exclusion criteria were confirmed, including the angiographic criteria, then the subject was randomized.The Primary Effectiveness Endpoint was successful revascularization of the target occlusion, using the TICI score. Success was determined by the central Core Lab.The Primary Safety Endpoint is a composite endpoint, described in the protocol as the "Incidence of procedure-related serious adverse events (PRSAEs) through 24 hours post procedure (-6/+12 hours) defined as: vascular perforation or intramural arterial dissection, symptomatic ICH, embolization to a previously uninvolved territory, access site complication requiring surgical repair or blood transfusion, intra-procedural mortality, device failure (in vivo breakage), or any other complications judged by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) to be related to the procedure."</detailed_description>
