	<brief_summary>Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic infections of the lower respiratory tract that can be caused by one or multiple bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has been particularly problematic to eradicate and been implicated as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Aerosol delivery of antibiotics directly to the lung increases the local concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection resulting in improved antimicrobial effects compared to systemic administration. Bacterial resistance to current aerosol antibiotic treatments indicate a need for improved therapies to treat CF patients with pulmonary infections caused by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria. High concentrations of MP-376 delivered directly to the lung are projected to have antimicrobial effects on even the most resistant organisms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Aeroquin Versus Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (TIS) in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the comparative safety of MP-376 (Aeroquin) and Tobramycin Inhalation solution (TIS) [TOBI® Novartis Pharmaceuticals] over three consecutive cycles of 28-days treatment followed by 28-days off in stable CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. Efficacy data for MP-376 and TIS at the end of the first 28-day treatment period will also be compared, as well as explored over multiple treatment cycles. Study patients participating in Mpex 209 will be given the option to participate in a six-month open label extension phase of the Mpex 209 protocol. The open label extension will allow enrolled patients to receive three additional courses of MP-376 (levofloxacin inhalation solution, Aeroquin™).</detailed_description>
