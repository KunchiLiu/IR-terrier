	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Fentanyl Buccal Tablet Use in the Emergency Department for Isolated Extremity Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subjects/patients will be asked if they would desire a low dose or high dose pain medication regimen. The low dose (low-FBT) group will receive FBT at a dose of 100 mcg, as well as an oral (pill) placebo preparation. The low dose (low-control) group will receive an "inactive comparator" (lansoprazole rapidly-dissolving buccal 15mg, " FBT placebo") and a dose of 5/325 Percocet tablet (oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325). The high dose (high-FBT) group will receive 200 mcg FBT plus 2 placebo tablets. The high dose (high-control) group will receive the "FBT placebo" and a dose of 2, 5/325 Percocet tablets.</detailed_description>
