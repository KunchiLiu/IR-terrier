	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the body). We propose a double-blind, randomized controlled study comparing the effect of liraglutide (a novel anti-diabetic drug with beta-cell protective potential) versus placebo, on the preservation of beta-cell function over one year in patients with T2DM. This study may demonstrate an important beta-cell protective capacity of liraglutide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LIraglutide and Beta-cell RepAir (LIBRA) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients with type 2 diabetes who meet randomization criteria will be randomized to either liraglutide or placebo, with serial assessment of beta-cell function over 48 weeks follow-up. The hypothesis under study is whether liraglutide can preserve beta-cell function.</detailed_description>
