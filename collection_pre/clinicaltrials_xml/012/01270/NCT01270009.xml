	<brief_summary>MM accounts for 10% of hematopoietic malignancies. Despite the use of various drug combinations in chemotherapy, life expectancy of MM patients does not exceed 7 years. Until now, lack of specific markers of the disease has not allowed efficient specific molecular targeting. In view of our preliminary results, the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-B could be a novel diagnostic and pronostic marker of MM. Therefore, our main objective will be to confirm that Bcl-B is indeed a novel diagnostic and pronostic marker and a new potential therapeutic target of MM. Targeting Bcl-2 family member's is a promising strategy for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. In this context, specific targeting of Bcl-B could improve the treatment of patients suffering MM. Of note, this could be achieved by converting the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-B to a proapoptotic one thanks to the use of small mimetic peptides derived from Nur77 one of its interactors.</brief_summary>
