	<brief_summary>Non-invasive brain stimulation can increase cortical excitability in the visual system, but it is not known if this is of clinical value. The investigators now assessed if repetitive, transcranial alternating current stimulation (rtACS) can improve visual field size in patients with optic nerve damage. The investigators hypothesized that rtACS would improve visual functions within the defective visual field sectors of the visual field (primary outcome measure).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Alternating Current Stimulation in Optic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial 22 patients with optic nerve damage were randomly assigned to a rtACS- (n=12) or placebo-group (n=10). Visual field measures, visual acuity and EEG-recordings were collected before and after a daily 20-40min treatment for 10-days and at a 2-months-follow-up. Primary outcome measure was detection accuracy (DA) in defective visual field sectors of computer-based high resolution perimetry (HRP). Secondary outcome parameters included DA in static and kinetic perimetry, reaction time (RT) in HRP, visual acuity (VA), contrast vision, and EEG power spectra.</detailed_description>
