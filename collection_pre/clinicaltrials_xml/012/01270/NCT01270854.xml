	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intravenous salt solution called "Plasmalyte" causes less abnormality of the body's acid levels than a solution called "Normal Saline."</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normal Saline Versus Plasmalyte in Initial Resuscitation of Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrolyte-containing intravenous fluids are routinely administered to patients in the first few hours after acute traumatic injury. Although Normal Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is commonly used in this setting, it causes a hyperchloremic acidosis that may exacerbate metabolic derangements that occur after acute injury. Plasmalyte A is a solution that more closely matches physiologic electrolyte levels. In this study, we will evaluate whether Plasmalyte A results in less disturbance of the base deficit 24 hours following traumatic injury than does Normal Saline.</detailed_description>
