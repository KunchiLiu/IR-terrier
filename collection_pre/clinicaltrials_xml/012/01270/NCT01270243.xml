	<brief_summary>We, the investigators, propose to look at the bacteria on and in tonsils using gene microarrays. We expect to find previously reported bacteria but also the possibility of previously undetected organisms. We think that the bacterial pathogens present on the tonsillar surface are different from the tonsil core. And we also think that the bacteria of the tonsil surface will differ between patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy and normal controls with no adenotonsillar problems.</brief_summary>
