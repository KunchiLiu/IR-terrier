	<brief_summary>Persistent replication of HBV (47-55%) is frequently found in patients with HCC, which in turn leads to deterioration of liver reserve. Moreover, a large proportion of HCC patients who underwent curative therapy died from progressive liver decompensation rather than recurrence of cancer. It had been proved that anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC patients could reduce the rate of tumor recurrence after surgical resection. This is a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of ETV therapy in chronic hepatitis B patients after receiving RFA therapy for HCC.</brief_summary>
