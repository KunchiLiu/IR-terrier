	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to see weather hyperbaric oxygen treatment is beneficial as adjuvant treatment for frost damage. The investigators hope to include at least 20 patients in a randomized manner. Half of the patients are randomized to hyperbaric oxygen, and half of the patients are randomized not to have hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Under hypotheses: The number og surgeries is reduced by hyperbaric oxygen treatment as adjuvant treatment for frost damage. The functional level of the frost damaged patient is better after 6 and 12 months when also treated with hyperbaric oxygen treatment for frost damage.</brief_summary>
