	<brief_summary>National Taiwan University Hospital is the leading center for care of patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The predictable factors associated with outcomes are still lacking in patients with the ECMO support. The aim of this study is to collect the electrical signals stored in the monitor of intensive care units (ICUs), which are analyzed by the bio-informatics software. The pre-, peri-, and post-ECMO heart rate variability, including linear and non-linear analysis is calculated to address the association with outcomes of patients with ECMO. In addition, we collected the demographics, body temperature, respiratory rate, and blood pressure to investigate the causes of heart rate variability.</brief_summary>
