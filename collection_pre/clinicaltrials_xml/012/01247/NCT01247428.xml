	<brief_title>First-In-Human Trial of the MiStent Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) in Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DESSOLVE I clinical trial is to assess the safety and performance of the sirolimus-eluting MiStent for the treatment for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo lesions &lt; 20 mm in length in the native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters between 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm.</detailed_description>
