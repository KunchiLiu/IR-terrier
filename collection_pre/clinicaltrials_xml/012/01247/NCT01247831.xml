	<brief_title>The Effect of Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) on Ocular Rigidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular Rigidity (corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor) is measured with the Ocular Response Analyzer (Reichert) before and 4 weeks after SLT (Q-switched 532 nm frequency doubled neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet laser with a spot size of 400 µm and a 3-ns pulse duration). The trabecular meshwork is treated with 100 spots over 360° and an energy of 0,8 mJ. The purpose is to examine if selective laser trabeculoplasty changes ocular rigidity.</detailed_description>
