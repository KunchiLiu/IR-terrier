	<brief_summary>Prolonged use of parenteral nutrition can lead to parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD). The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of treatment with a smaller amount lipid minimization) of our standard soybean oil based intravenous lipid emulsion (Intralipid) versus a fish-oil based lipid emulsion (Omegaven) in infants with severe cholestasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimization of IntraLipid Versus Omegaven</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants meeting eligibility will be randomized to receive either 1g/kg/day of Intralipid速 20% or 1g/kg/day Omegaven速 10%. Infants randomized to Intralipid速 whose conjugated bilirubin level rises &gt;100umol/L will be crossed over to receive 1g/kg/day Omegaven速. Monitoring includes liver function tests (AST, ALT,ALP, GGT, Conjugated Bilirubin), Fatty Acid Profile (RBC and serum fatty acids; triene/tetraene ratio), INR (coagulation profile) and cytokine measure (inflammatory markers).</detailed_description>
