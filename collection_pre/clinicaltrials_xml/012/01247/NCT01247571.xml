	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with uterine cancer that has come back or has not responded to treatment. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop the growth of uterine cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the activity of pazopanib in patients with persistent or recurrent carcinosarcoma of the uterus as measured by the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

if AST and/or ALT are greater than 1 x ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, THEN the bilirubin must be less than or equal to ULN for patient to be eligible Prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN Patients with a history of hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism must have had stable wellcontrolled thyroid function for a minimum of 2 months as a condition for eligibility and that all other patients must have normal baseline thyroid function tests (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], triiodothyronine [T]3, T4) Patients must have the ability to understand and sign an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information Patients who have met the preentry requirements Patients must be capable of taking and absorbing oral medications;
