	<brief_summary>The objective of this research study is to evaluate the safety and acceptability of the Shang Ring method of medical male circumcision. The Shang Ring is a new circumcision device with a potential role in the safe and cost-effective delivery of circumcision services. The device, developed in China, consists of two concentric plastic rings. Following a ring penile block, the smaller ring is fitted at the base of the coronal sulcus. The foreskin is everted over the inner ring and the larger outer ring is secured over the inner ring. The foreskin is excised and several nicks are made on the incision line to prevent formation of a constricting, circumferential scab. No suturing is required. In this study, the investigators will evaluate wound healing of men randomized to removal of the Shang Ring at one of three different points in time (Days 7, 14 or 21). Leaving the device on for 14 or 21 days constitutes extended wear of the device. Sites: Homa Bay District Hospital, Nyanza Province, Kenya</brief_summary>

Leaving the device on for 14 or 21 days constitutes extended wear of the device. Although male circumcision has a demonstrated protective effect against HIV transmission, currently available surgical techniques and devices have limitations for widespread deployment in resource-poor areas. High costs and scarcity of trained providers hinder access to male circumcision services in resource-poor areas. Its simple design sets the Shang Ring apart from other male circumcision techniques. The Shang Ring has the potential for safe, effective and inexpensive delivery of male circumcision by trained healthcare personnel in HIV endemic countries.</detailed_description>
