	<brief_title>The Effects of Post-hospitalization Telehealth Care in the Patients Who Admitted Via Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, Taiwan's population has become an aging society since recent decade. Those older than 65 years had achieved 10.4% in 2008. Meanwhile, the proportion of hosts with underlying comorbid illness or immunocomprised status is increasing worldwide. In the trend of aging population, telehealth care will be important to extend the care system in post-hospitalization home care. In the past, thelehealth care has shown a good executive performance in the patients with congestive heart failure and post-operation follow-up. However, in dealing the patients with acute illness needing hospitalization, the telehealth system has not implemented yet. In regard to National health insurance (NHI) of Taiwan, hospitalization costs a lot in overall budget. Reduction of re-hospitalization in those with/without co-morbidity is a important issue for Taiwan NHI. Therefore, we plan to conduct the telehealth care system in post-hospitalization course in those admitted from emergency department. We observe the re-hospitalization rate and analyze the risk factors. In addition, we hypothesize the telehealth care will decrease the rate of re-hospitalization.</detailed_description>
