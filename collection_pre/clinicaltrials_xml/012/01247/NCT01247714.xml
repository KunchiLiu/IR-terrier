	<detailed_description>This new complete diet has been carefully formulated, and incorporates functional ingredients based on: 1. A good gastrointestinal and metabolic tolerance of the product. 2. Beneficial outcomes in the nutritional status. 3. A good control of the glycaemic response and the lipidic profile, allowing an improvement of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance indicators and hunger-satiety regulation. The experimental enteral product is a complete diet that includes, as carbohydrates, high-molecular maltodextrin, resistant maltodextrin, fructooligosaccharides and cellulose, and does not contain added fructose.
