	<brief_summary>Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study is an open-label trial for patients with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy who received ataluren in a prior PTC-sponsored study at a US clinical trial site. This trial will be conducted at sites in the US and will evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren, as determined by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ataluren for Previously Treated Patients With nmDBMD in the US</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will enroll boys with nonsense mutation DBMD who have a history of exposure to ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD (PTC124-GD-004-DMD, PTC124-GD-004e-DMD, PTC124-GD-007-DMD, PTC124-GD-007e, and PTC124-GD-008-DMD) at a trial site in the US. Patients will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits during screening and every 12 weeks until the end of the study. Patients must also return to the clinic for a post treatment visit 6 weeks after the last dose of ataluren.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the subject (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial History of exposure to ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD at a trial site in the US Male sex Confirmed screening laboratory values within the specified ranges In subjects who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during ataluren administration and the 6week follow up period Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions Exposure to another investigational drug within 1 month prior to start of study treatment Eligibility for another ataluren clinical trial that is actively enrolling study participants Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of study drug Ongoing use of the following medications: coumarin based anticoagulants, phenytoin, or tolbutamide, or systemic aminoglycoside therapy Ongoing uncontrolled medical/surgical condition, ECG findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the patient or make it unlikely that followup would be completed</criteria>
