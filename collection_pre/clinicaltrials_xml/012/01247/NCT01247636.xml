	<brief_title>Home-Exercise vs General Physical Activity: Effect on Health-related Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older people discharge from hospital often have decreased functional and physiological reserve that make them vulnerable of being dependent of others. Research have shown that older people discharge from hospital are vulnerable for functional decline during hospital stay and this decline can persist 6 to 18 months after discharge from hospital.Exercise interventions are proven to have effect on mobility, balance and falls among community-dwelling older people and several studies have shown that deconditioning as a consequence of disuse is reversible with training even in very old individuals. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of physical activity promotion and exercise intervention among elderly recently discharge from a geriatric outpatient clinic.</detailed_description>
