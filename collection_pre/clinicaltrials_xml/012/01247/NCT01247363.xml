	<brief_summary>Safety study with multiple oral doses of LY2608204 given to patients with type 2 diabetes. Study subjects will receive once daily doses of LY2608204 for a total treatment duration of up to 28 days. In this study, each patient will receive increasing doses of LY2608204 until reaching the highest dose that they can tolerate. Continuous glucose monitoring devices will be employed for each patient to monitor for hypoglycemia during study treatment. Dose titration and dose reduction is determined for each individual patient based on their safety and glycemic data.</brief_summary>

This includes staying inpatient at the CRU for a total duration of up to 31 days Have given written informed consent approved by Lilly and the ethical review board governing the site Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or device or use of a drug or device other than the study drug used in this study, or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have significant history of past or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine (other than diabetes), hematological, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism or elimination of drugs or of constituting a risk when taking the study drug formulations or interfering with the interpretation of data Have a history of a seizure disorder A corrected QT interval greater than 450 msec at screening or any personal history of ventricular tachycardia or unexplained syncope, or other abnormality in the 12lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study Have family history of long QT syndrome or family history of sudden unexplained death Use medications known to prolong the QT interval. Have type 1 diabetes mellitus or a history of ketoacidosis or any other type of diabetes mellitus other than type 2 Use of any known inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A within 14 days prior to the first dosing with study drug or intended use during the study History of a hypoglycemic event with acute mental status alteration that was not preceded by prodromal symptoms recognizable to the patient Fasting serum triglycerides greater than 500mg/dl Serum creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dL in women, greater than 1.5 mg/dL in men Clinical evidence of active diabetic proliferative retinopathy Known clinically significant autonomic neuropathy as evidenced by urinary retention, orthostatic hypotension, diabetic diarrhea or gastroparesis Clinically significant coronary events or symptoms within 6 months prior to study entry Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Have known allergies to LY2608204 or related compounds Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and/or positive human HIV antibodies/antigen Evidence of hepatitis B and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Donation or loss of blood equal to or exceeding 450 mL during the 3 months before the first administration of study drug Patients who have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week (males) and 14 units per week (females) (1 unit equal to 12 oz or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits) or patients unwilling to stop alcohol consumption 24 hours prior to admission until the completion of each inpatient study period Patients who smoke more than 10 cigarettes or other tobacco products per day before study entry. Patients will not be allowed to smoke while in the study Unit Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse Intended use of overthe counter or prescription medications 7 and 14 days, respectively, prior to dosing. If this situation arises, inclusion of an otherwise suitable volunteer may be at the discretion of the investigator. Use of antidiabetic medication [metformin, sulphonylureas, glinides, thiazolidinediones, acarbose, DPPIV inhibitors, Byetta (but not liraglutide)] by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is acceptable for this study Have repeated alanine transaminase levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range at screening, as determined by the central laboratory Have previously been enrolled in this clinical study or any other study of LY2608204. Exclusion Criteria for EU/UK/US Site(s) only Evidence of hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis C antibodies, at screening Use of known drugs of abuse and/or positive findings on urinary drug screening, other than findings consistent with medication prescribed by the patient's physician or overthecounter medications</criteria>
