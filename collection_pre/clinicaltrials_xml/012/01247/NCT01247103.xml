	<brief_title>Assessment of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Oral Doses of AZD4316 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 50 years with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture. Female subjects must not be pregnant, must not be lactating and must be of nonchildbearing potential (i.e. they must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile) Male subjects should be willing to use barrier contraception i.e. condoms and spermicide, from the day of dosing until at least 3 months after dosing with the investigational product Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive. Subjects who are healthy as determined by pre study medical history, physical examination, 12Lead ECG History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the resting ECG, including changes that may interfere with the interpretation of QTcF interval changes. Current smokers, those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous three months. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD4316. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (ie, during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.</criteria>
