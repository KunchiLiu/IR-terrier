	<brief_summary>Intraperitoneal nebulization of local anesthetic is a novel approach to pain management after laparoscopy. Preoperative compared with postoperative administration of analgesia remains controversial. This randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the analgesic efficacy of preoperative with postoperative peritoneal ropivacaine nebulization in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Anesthetic Nebulization for Pain Control After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies evaluating intraperitoneal local anesthetic administration for pain relief after laparoscopic surgery have suggested that the timing of local anesthetic administration may be critical in the success of the technique. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery found that local anesthetic instilled before surgical dissection provided superior pain relief compared to instillation at the end of surgery. Intraperitoneal nebulization of local anesthetic is a novel approach to pain management after laparoscopic surgery. Recently, Alkhamesi et al reported that bupivacaine nebulization performed at the end of laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain. However, clinical benefits of preoperative administration of analgesia, compared with postoperative administration, remains controversial. The investigators hypothesized that pain relief after preoperative and postoperative ropivacaine nebulization would be similar but better than placebo.</detailed_description>
