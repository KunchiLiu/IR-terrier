	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying bone marrow samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To compare the frequency of germline telomerase mutations in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) demonstrating prolonged myelosuppression, defined as ≥ 1 episode &gt; 35 days of neutrophil count recovery after chemotherapy, to the pediatric patients with the expected myelosuppression, defined as consistently &lt; 35 days of neutrophil count recovery after chemotherapy. - To assess association between telomerase mutations and incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis, relapse, and death. - To compare germline (remission) telomere length in pediatric AML patients demonstrating delayed bone marrow recovery with the pediatric patients with consistently expected recovery. - To assess whether a correlation between telomere length and incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis, relapse, and death exist. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Cryopreserved bone marrow samples are analyzed for DNA sequencing and mutation by Sanger-based sequencing methods, quantitative PCR, and SeqMan Pro (Lasergene from DNAStar). Results are then compared with previously published data and existing databases to determine the allele frequency in control populations.</detailed_description>
