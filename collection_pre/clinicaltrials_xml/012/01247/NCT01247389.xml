	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia (IH) is a common complication of midline laparotomy. Despite the hope that laparoscopic colon resection would result in fewer incisional hernias, prospective studies demonstrate a similar incidence to open surgery. Observational studies suggest that the rate of incisional hernia after laparoscopic colon resection may be reduced with the use of a transverse compared to a midline extraction incision. However, no randomized trails are available, and a midline extraction incision for hemicolectomy remains the standard current approach. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a lower abdominal transverse muscle splitting incision for specimen extraction in laparoscopic colon surgery will result in fewer incisional hernias compared to a midline periumbilical extraction incision.</brief_summary>
