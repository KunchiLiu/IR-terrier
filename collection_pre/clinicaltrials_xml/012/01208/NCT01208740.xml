	<brief_summary>Metformin should be administered with caution and could be potentially dangerous in infertile patients with PCOS who show a poor ovarian response and are undergoing gonadotropin-based ovarian stimulation. However, data that address this point are totally lacking. On the basis of these considerations, the aim of the current clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that metformin reduces the ovarian response in infertile patients with PCOS who have a potentially poor ovarian response and who undergo gonadotropin stimulation for IVF cycles.</brief_summary>
