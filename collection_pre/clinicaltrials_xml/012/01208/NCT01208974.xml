	<brief_summary>Overall rationale: Prophylactic NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction for patient with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer will allow better cosmesis and patient's satisfaction. Study design: Phase I trial assessing the safety, feasibility and toxicity of prophylactic NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer. Primary objective: To determine the recommended phase I dose of post-operative prophylactic NAC irradiation. Secondary objectives: To provide extensive descriptive data regarding NAC-sparing surgery with reconstruction, including both surgeon experience and patient evaluation of cosmetic results. Survival and recurrence will be assessed. Study size: Between 12 and 18 patients will be enrolled in this phase I study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nipple-Areola Complex (NAC) Irradiation After Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy and Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The use of NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC (nipple-areola complex) external beam radiotherapy for selected patient with early stage invasive or in-situ breast cancers will be technically feasible and with acceptable complication rates. - The cosmetic results after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative external beam radiotherapy to the NAC will be better comparable with Skin Sparing Mastectomy. - The local control rate in the NAC will be more than expected for a NAC sparing mastectomy without postoperative radiotherapy. - The patient's satisfaction after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC external beam radiotherapy will be better than after Skin Sparing Mastectomy.</detailed_description>
