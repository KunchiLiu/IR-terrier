	<brief_title>Translating Habituation Research to Interventions for Pediatric Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Habituation is one factor that may be related to excess energy intake. Research has shown that the rate of habituation is inversely related to the amount of food consumed and slower habituation may be a factor that is relevant to obesity, as overweight youth and adults habituate slower and consume more energy than their peers. Habituation is a basic form of learning that is observed in many response systems. We believe that habituation is an important process that mediates food regulation during a meal and across meals. However, there has been no research in children that translates basic research on habituation to food into clinical interventions for pediatric obesity. In the first phase, we will implement a series of laboratory studies to assess the effects of stimulus specificity and variety and the simultaneous reduction of variety for high energy density foods on short (within meal) and long-term (across meal) habituation. The second phase is designed to implement a series of field studies that will extend basic research from the first phase as well as define the optimal interval for reducing variety to facilitate long-term habituation to high energy density foods in the natural environment. The third phase is designed to develop and pilot test a family-based behavioral intervention for children that incorporates findings from phase2 into a clinical intervention.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children ages 812 years of age At or above 85th BMI percentile Children must eat almost all meals with the exception of school lunch with the family. Children who do not like the study foods, who are allergic to the study foods or who are on special diets and cannot consume the study foods. Families with children with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis or parents who are depressed, have schizophrenia, substance abuse or a history of eating disorders. The parent and child must not have any physical restrictions that would preclude them from making the requisite behavioral changes. Children must be able to read at a 3rd grade reading level and must be able to demonstrate the ability to keep dietary and activity records in a stimulated interview.</criteria>
