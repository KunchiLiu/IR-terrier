	<brief_summary>After having shown that postconditioning allowed a significant 36% reduction of infarct size as assessed by blood levels of myocardial enzymes in acute myocardial patients, the investigators objective is to assess the effect of postconditioning in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients on microvascular obstruction lesions defined by cardiac MRI images.</brief_summary>
