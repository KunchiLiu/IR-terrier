	<brief_summary>In this randomized study The investigators aim to compare the growth of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants fed either a high protein or a standard protein preterm infant formula. Babies will be fed the assigned formula between the time they achieve full enteral feeds and hospital discharge, for a minimum of 3 weeks. The weight gain (g/d) will be measured and compared between groups. Feeding tolerance, protein-energy status and body composition between the study groups will also be analysed. After discharge, babies will be fed a post-discharge preterm infant formula (PDF) between hospital discharge and 3 m corrected age.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Gestational age &lt;32 w, determined by maternal dates, fetal ultrasound, Dubowitz/Ballard examination or a combination thereof Birth weight ≤1500 g Tolerating an enteral intake of ≥100 ml/kg/d for ≥ 24 h Subject is anticipated to receive the study formula for ≥ 3 consecutive weeks after FEF have been achieved In infants fed human milk, formula is anticipated to provide 50% or more of total energy intake, calculated on a weekly basis and based on the assumption that human milk has an energy density of 67 kcal/dl Written informed consent has been obtained from the legal representative Cardiac failure requiring fluid restriction with diuretic therapy for ≥ 3 consecutive days Peri/intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 34) determined using cranial ultrasonography Renal disease: by symptoms (oliguria, anuria, proteinuria, hematuria) associated with an increased BUN and creatinine Sepsis: defined by symptoms requiring antibiotic therapy and confirmed by a positive blood culture Necrotizing Enterocolitis: defined by feeding intolerance associated with positive xray findings (pneumatosis intestinalis Bell Stage 2; air in the biliary tract or free air in the peritoneum Bell Stage 3) Hepatic dysfunction: defined by jaundice (direct bilirubin &gt;1.0 mg/dl) which is associated with one or more abnormal liver function tests (AST, ALT or GGT) Lung disease, severe enough to require steroid therapy. Small size for gestational age (SGA) body weight ≤ 5th percentile for that gestational age. Participation in another clinical trial that may affect outcomes of this study</criteria>
