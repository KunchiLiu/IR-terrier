	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether pazopanib hydrochloride is more effective than a placebo in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has not progressed after first-line chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well giving pazopanib hydrochloride works and compares it with giving a placebo in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have received first-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride or a Placebo in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Received First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the therapeutic benefit, in terms of overall survival, of maintenance pazopanib hydrochloride in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have not progressed after first-line chemotherapy. Secondary - To compare progression-free survival (PFS) overall and at specific time points (6 and 12 months). - To document the toxicity profile of pazopanib hydrochloride according to the CTCAE v 4. - To assess the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the detection of progression of disease in the maintenance phase of therapy. - To compare quality-of-life of patients on maintenance therapy. - To compare discontinuation rate/treatment compliance of patients treated with these regimens. - To collect health economics data on resource utilization as documented by the EQ-5D generic QoL instrument. Tertiary (correlative) - To evaluate the effect of germline genetic variations on drug response (pharmacogenetics) using PAX gene. - To find relevant biomarkers of VEGFR pathways from plasma samples. - To obtain the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib hydrochloride at 600 and 800 mg. - To evaluate biomarkers in tumor tissue. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to center, histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), performance status (0-1 vs 2 up to 15% of patients), and response to initial chemotherapy (complete response/partial response vs stable disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive an oral placebo daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients complete quality-of life-questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13) at baseline, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and 22 weeks. Health economics data on resource utilization are collected and documented using the EQ-5D questionnaire. Blood samples may be collected periodically for pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetic studies. Samples are analyzed for germline genetic variations on drug response, relevant biomarkers of VEGFR pathways, and concentration of pazopanib hydrochloride. Previously collected tumor tissue is analyzed for biomarkers. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

480 msec, then 2 additional ECGs should be obtained over a brief period of time (e.g., within 1520 minutes) to confirm the abnormality and the average QTc interval will be determined from the 3 ECG tracings by manual evaluation and will be used to determine if the patient will be excluded from the study No history of any of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months: Cardiac angioplasty or stenting myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease No NYHA class IIIIV congestive heart failure (no class II, III, or IV for elderly patients) LVEF normal No other malignancy within the past 2 years except for nonsmall cell lung cancer No poorly controlled hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP) &gt;
