	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of a maintenance therapy with the immunomodulator MGN1703 compared to placebo control. The study will be conducted in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma (AJCC Stage IV) with disease control after first-line standard chemotherapy regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of a Maintenance Therapy With Immunomodulator MGN1703 in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 2 study will be conducted in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma with disease control after first-line standard chemotherapy regimens with oral or intravenous fluoropyrimidines/leucovorin and irinotecan or oxaliplatin combined with a standard dose of bevacizumab lasted between 4.5 and 6 months, whereas the treatment duration with irinotecan or oxaliplatin should not be less than 3 months. Studies confirmed that completely chemotherapy-free intervals can be applicable in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who achieved disease control after initial first-line chemotherapy. Those therapy holidays minimize toxicity and unnecessary treatment load, reduce intensity of treatment, allow patients to stay longer on therapy, prevent therapy discontinuations due to toxicity, preserve the ability to re-administer chemotherapy later, and increase quality of life of the patients. The therapy-free interval represents a possibility to evaluate the efficacy of the study drug, MGN1703.</detailed_description>
