	<brief_summary>Treatment adaptation to biological and anatomical changes occurring during treatment can increase the chance of cure at minimized radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients. This trial investigates the feasibility of using repetitive per-treatment [18F]FDG-PET acquired during treatment in adaptive [18F]FDG-PET-voxel intensity-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx. Primary unresectable tumor and/or patients refused surgery. Stage T14; T34 N0 or Tany N13 for cancer of the glottis. Multidisciplinary decision of curative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. Karnofsky performance status ≥70%. Age ≥ 18 years old. Informed consent obtained, signed and dated before specific protocol procedures. Treatment combined with brachytherapy. Prior irradiation to the head and neck region. Distant metastases. Second primary tumors that are not under control Pregnant or lactating women. Creatinine clearance (CockcroftGault) ≤ 60 mL/min before treatment. Allergy to the CTcontrast agents. Mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. Patient unlikely to comply with protocol, i.e. uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, and unlikely to complete the study.</criteria>
