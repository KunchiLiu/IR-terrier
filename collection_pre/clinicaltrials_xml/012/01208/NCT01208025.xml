	<brief_summary>The possibility of the identification of the risk of rupture of a carotid plaque will have tremendous impact in clinical decision making. Firstly, in symptomatic patients with a 30-69% stenosis, who are currently not operated upon according to the current guidelines, identification of the risk of rupture plaque could identify patients who have a high risk of recurrent stroke, and would benefit of carotid intervention, such as endarterectomy or stent placement. This could potentially prevent a substantial number of strokes. Secondly, in all symptomatic patients with a 70-99% stenosis carotid intervention should be considered, according to the guidelines. However, only one out of six patients with a 70-99% stenosis benefits from a carotid intervention. Identification of patients with a high risk of a recurrent stroke would reduce the number of unnecessary interventions substantially. The main objective is to show whether imaging characteristics assessed at baseline can predict clinical events in patients with a 30-69 % symptomatic carotid stenosis.</brief_summary>
