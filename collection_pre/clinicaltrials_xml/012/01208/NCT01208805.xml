	<brief_summary>The study first aim is to investigate the relationship between different patterns of electrode stimulation and peripheral sensory stimulation and spinal cord-evoked potentials to optimize spinal cord stimulation parameters . The second aim of the study is to investigate the role of the spinal cord in some aspects of cognitive-sensory-motor processing, specifically the presence of top-down attentional effects on the sensory analysis of an external stimulus at the spinal cord level. The study will be performed on patients that will be implanted with a spinal epidural electrode because of chronic intractable pain. From these electrodes, spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEPs) will be recorded.</brief_summary>
