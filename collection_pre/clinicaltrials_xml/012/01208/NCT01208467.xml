	<brief_summary>This research study is studying prognostic biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with endometrial cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To validate the clinicopathologic associations and prognostic significance of ATR mutation in endometrioid endometrial cancer cases with defective DNA mismatch repair. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. DNA extracted from previously collected tumor samples is analyzed to validate the clinicopathologic associations and prognostic significance of ATR mutation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women who were eligible and evaluable for the GOG0210 molecular staging protocol in women with endometrial cancer Women who were registered during the unrestricted enrollment period (through 9/23/07) will automatically qualify Women who were registered during the restricted enrollment period (after 9/23/07) will only be considered if needed Women who had histologically confirmed endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma regardless of stage or grade Women who have defective DNA mismatch repair and are microsatellite instability positive (MSI+ and MSIlow) Women who consented to allow their specimens and clinical data to be used for future cancer research Women who have sufficient highquality genomic DNA from tumor available for mutation analysis of ATR</criteria>
