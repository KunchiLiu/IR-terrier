	<brief_summary>Study phase: phase III Study objective: - Comparison of Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone (VMP) with High Dose Melphalan followed autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) - Comparison of Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone(VRD) as consolidation versus no consolidation - Comparison of single versus tandem high dose Melphalan with ASCT Patient population: Patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma,previously untreated, ISS stages 1-3, age 18-65 years inclusive Study design: Prospective, multicenter, intergroup, randomized Duration of treatment: Expected duration of induction, stem cell collection and intensification is 6 - 9 months. Consolidation with VRD will last 2 months Maintenance therapy with Lenalidomide will be given until relapse. All patients will be followed until 10 years after registration.</brief_summary>
