	<brief_summary>In the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) neurosurgical resection of the tumor is usually considered a a first step of effective therapy. Radical resection of the tumor is highly beneficial to the patient as measured in progression-free survival and overall survival. At the same time eloquent areas of the brain have to remain intact to preserve quality of life. Both 5-ALA fluorescence and intraoperative MRI are used for intraoperative marking of tumor tissue and thereby to improve precision of GBM-Resection. We now study whether the combination of 5-ALA fluorescence and intraoperative MRI increases the number of sites where tumor tissue can be detected. - Trial with surgical intervention</brief_summary>
