	<brief_summary>This study was conducted to obtain safety and immunogenicity data after a booster dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live administered ≥10 years following an initial dose. This information was compared to similar information obtained after Zoster Vaccine, Live administration to age-matched and younger participants who received their first dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live. The study was designed to determine: 1) whether a booster dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live in participants ≥70 years of age induces an antibody response that is noninferior to that of a first dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live in participants matched for age; 2) whether a booster dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live induces an acceptable rise in the level of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies.</brief_summary>
