	<brief_summary>One purpose of this study is to find out if a new combination of immune system treatments (MAGE-A3 vaccine plus activated T-cells) will allow the body to build up protection ("immunity") against the myeloma cells. A second purpose is to find out how well this combination of immune system treatments is able to control the myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Immunotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) can lead to a complete or partial disappearance of the myeloma in about 2 out of 3 patients. However, an ASCT only sometimes leads to a cure of the myeloma. In about half the patients the myeloma comes back after about 1-2 years. In about 90% of patients it comes back by about 10 years after transplant. One possible way to improve upon the results of ASCT for myeloma is to help the body's defense or immune system recover faster after transplant. Another way is to teach the body's immune system to fight against the myeloma cells. In two earlier research studies which included more than 100 patients, certain types of immune cells called "T cells" or "T lymphocytes" were taken out of a patient's body using a procedure called "apheresis". These cells were then grown up in the lab. After the transplant, these T cells were put back into the patients. The replaced T cells helped the patients'immune systems to recover faster after the transplant. In addition, when the T cells were given back to patients they also received a vaccination. The vaccination or injection was for a certain type of pneumonia germ called "pneumococcus". We found that most patients built up protection against this pneumonia-causing germ. In another study, we used a possible myeloma cancer vaccine. However, we found that less than half the patients responded to this vaccine. In this new study, we want to test a different type of myeloma cancer vaccine. This different cancer vaccine is based on a protein called MAGE-A3. The MAGE-A3 protein is found in about 50% of cases of myeloma. This vaccine consists of small pieces of protein (called "peptides") which come from the MAGE-A3 protein. In order to help the immune system respond better we will add two new steps. First we will add an immune system stimulant called "Hiltonol速" to each vaccination. Hiltonol速 is a chemical substance that turns on several parts of the immune system. It may make the immune system better able to respond to the vaccine. It has been tested in several hundred patients and has been used with about a dozen different types of cancer and germ vaccines. Second, starting about 100 days after the transplant procedure, patients will get a medicine called Lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of myeloma. In this study, we want to know whether Lenalidomide could help to improve the body's ability to respond to the vaccinations and help to treat the myeloma itself.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent Patients must be registered with the Sponsor's Monitor Patients must have a diagnosis of myeloma Patients must meet one of the following criteria: 1. Myeloma has relapsed, progressed, or failed to respond after at least one prior course of therapy (consisting of at least 2 treatment cycles or months of therapy). 2. Myeloma has responded partially to initial therapy but a complete response (immunofixation negative and normal serum free light chain studies)has NOT developed after a minimum of 3 cycles or months of initial therapy. 3. Myeloma has highrisk features as defined by the presence of one or more cytogenetic abnormalities known to confer a poor outcome even after standard autotransplants:complex karyotype (&gt; or = to 3 abnormalities),t(4;14),t(14;16),del (17)(p13.1),and/or chromosome 13 abnormalities. Patients must have measurable disease on study entry Patients must be between ages 1880 (inclusive). Patients should have adequate vital organ function as defined by the protocol. ECOG performance status 02 (unless due solely to bone pain) Prior to Lenalidomide maintenance phase, all study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist速 program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist速. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test as per the protocol Lenalidomide treatment phase: able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin). Pregnant or nursing females HIV or HTLV1/2 seropositivity Known history of myelodysplasia Known history of chronic active hepatitis or liver cirrhosis (if suspected by laboratory studies, should be confirmed by liver biopsy). Active Hepatitis B (as defined by + Hepatitis B surface antigen); + Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody is NOT an exclusion Prior autotransplant or allogeneic transplant More than 4 distinct, prior courses of therapy for myeloma History of severe autoimmune disease requiring steroids or other immunosuppressive treatments. Active immunemediated diseases including:connective tissue diseases, uveitis,sarcoidosis,inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis. Evidence or history of other significant cardiac,hepatic,renal, ophthalmologic,psychiatric,or gastrointestinal disease which would likely increase the risks of participating in the study Active bacterial, viral or fungal infections.</criteria>
