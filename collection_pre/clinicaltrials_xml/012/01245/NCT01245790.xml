	<brief_summary>A 2 stage study to evaluate the amount of fostamatinib in the blood and urine in subjects with impaired kidney (renal) function compared with healthy volunteers with normal renal function. Stage 1 will include healthy subjects and subjects with end stage renal disease, while Stage, 2 may include subjects with mild, moderate and/or severe renal impairment dependent on the outcome of Stage 1. The study will also evaluate safety and tolerability in subjects with renal impairment.</brief_summary>
