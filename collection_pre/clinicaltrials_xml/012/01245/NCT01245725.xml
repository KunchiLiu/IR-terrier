	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the efficacy of tirofiban (a 25mcg/kg i.v. bolus followed by a 0.15mcg/kg/min i.v. infusion during a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus two hours after the procedure) is more effective than placebo in the setting of standard therapies (e.g. aspirin, a thienopyridine, and unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin) among patients undergoing PCI, as assessed by the incidence of adverse cardiac ischemic events defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), and urgent target vessel revascularization (uTVR) within 48 hours following study drug initiation. A secondary objective of this study is to assess whether tirofiban (a 25mcg/kg i.v. bolus followed by a 0.15mcg/kg/min i.v. infusion during a PCI plus two hours after the procedure) is safe compared to placebo in the setting of standard therapies (e.g. aspirin, a thienopyridine, and unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin) among patients undergoing PCI, as assessed by the incidence of non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding within 48 hours following study drug initiation. Patient enrollment is pending.</brief_summary>
