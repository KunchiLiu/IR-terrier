	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: 1. To study the effect of whole-body vibration on partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), under hypobaric hypoxic conditions. 2. To study the effects of whole-body vibration and hypobaric hypoxia on visual contrast sensitivity. 3. To se if there is an increase in cytokines and other biomarkers under different hypobaric hypoxic conditions Our main hypothesis is that whole-body vibration may cause PaO2 to drop to a lower level, at a given altitude; than would be the case if there were no vibration present.</brief_summary>
