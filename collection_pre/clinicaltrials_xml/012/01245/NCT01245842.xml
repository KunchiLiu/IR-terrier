	<brief_title>The Hand Osteoarthritis Exercise Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases in an adult population. The disease may have large influences on an individual's function, health related quality of life and participation in the society. In recently published clinical guidelines for management, non-pharmacological approaches are considered as core treatments. Several studies have demonstrated that exercise may reduce pain and improve function in persons with knee OA, and a similar effect is suggested for hip OA. Regarding effect of exercises in hand OA, available research results are limited, and randomised controlled trials (RCT) of good quality are needed.</detailed_description>
