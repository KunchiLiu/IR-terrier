Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject at the time of enrolment. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster vaccine dose. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to vaccination, or planned administration during the study period, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis since primary vaccination in the first year of life. Previous measles, mumps and/or rubella second dose vaccination. Evidence of previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps and/or rubella disease. Known exposure to measles, mumps and/or rubella within 30 days prior to study start. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficiency condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster dose or planned administration during the study period. Occurrence of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an earlier immunisation. Occurrence of any of the following adverse events after a previous administration of a DTP vaccine: Hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine; Encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussiscontaining vaccine; Fever &gt;= 40Â°C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause; Collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination; Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment or within 24 hours of study vaccine administration.</criteria>
