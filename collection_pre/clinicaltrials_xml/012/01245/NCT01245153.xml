	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common and worldwide problem.Although pelvic floor muscle training(PFMT) is the standard recommendation for conservative treatment but some patients had difficulty doing PFMT. They could not locate the pelvic floor muscles, and so could not perform the PFMT properly or increase intensity of the exercise. The authors hypothesized that rectal balloon training(RBT) may improve patients' pelvic floor recognition as well as it is another option of progressive strengthening of pelvic floor muscle. This study's aim is to combine RBT with PFMT using the water-filled balloons of Foley catheters</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study's aim is to combine RBT with PFMT using the water-filled balloons of Foley catheters. The catheter would be inserted into the rectum and used as a tool to help the patient recognize the pelvic floor muscles. The advantages of Foley catheters are that they are cheap, safe for contacting the mucosa, easy for self-insertion, and can be reused. Furthermore, we can increase the load of exercise by increasing the amount of water pushing into the balloon, and can use that as a tool for progressive resistive exercise.</detailed_description>
