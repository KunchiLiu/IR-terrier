	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and severity of extrapulmonary disorders and to quantify the impact of extrapulmonary organ manifestations on morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. Furthermore the investigators evaluate the relationship between systemic inflammation and organ involvement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Systemic Manifestations/Comorbidities on Clinical State, Prognosis, Utilisation of Health Care Resources in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic diseases and comorbidities have an increasing impact on individual life and health care use, as exemplified in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently, independent, comprehensive databases allowing for an integrated view are lacking. The study will for the first time establish a large, comprehensive longitudinal database covering a broad panel of comorbidities an markers of systemic alterations. These data will be of unique value in revealing specific phenotypes of COPD via patterns and risk profiles of comorbidities, enabling a more precise diagnosis and targeting of therapy, and an efficient allocation of resources.</detailed_description>
