	<brief_summary>Delayed clamping of the umbilical cord might prevent or slow the onset of iron deficiency by increasing the infant's iron endowment at birth. Compared with early clamping, a delay of around 2-3 min provides an additional 25-40 mL of blood per kg of bodyweight. The results of previous intervention studies on delayed clamping are mixed, and few followed up infants beyond the perinatal period. All longer follow up studies have been performed in low income countries. The main objectives, therefore, was to assess whether delayed cord clamping improves hematological and iron status at 4 respective 12 months of age in a large sample of full-term, Swedish infants. The investigators also choose to investigate if the timing of clamping the umbilical cord could affect rate of infections during the first four months of life and to assess the infants development at 4 and 12 months of age.</brief_summary>
