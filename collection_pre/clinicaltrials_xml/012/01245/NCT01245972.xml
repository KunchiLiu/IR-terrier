	<brief_summary>This is a research study to find out more about the use of the pulsed dye laser in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and early stage squamous cell carcinoma that has not invaded deep into the skin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of the pulsed dye laser (PDL) can completely clear or regress basal cell carcinoma or early stage squamous cell carcinoma. Pulsed dye laser is a type of laser that is commonly used to treat lesions on the skin that have a prominent blood vessel component. It has been used to treat broken blood vessels on the face, hemangiomas in children and adults, leg veins, port wine stains, and other lesions with a prominent vascular component.</brief_summary>
