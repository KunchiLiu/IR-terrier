	<brief_summary>Loss of total mass of muscles (catabolism) is a serious clinical problem in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The liver might play an important role in this stress-catabolism by increasing the production of urea during the inflammatory process. The purpose of this study is to examine the regulation of urea synthesis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and to study the effect of the anti-inflammatory drugs prednisolone and pentoxifylline on this regulation.</brief_summary>
