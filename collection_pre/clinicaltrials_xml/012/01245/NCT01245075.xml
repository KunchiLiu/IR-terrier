	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a novel treatment in severe opioid addiction. The included patients have been treated so far with a substitute in form of methadone. Our hypothesis is that bilateral DBS of the NAc will significantly reduce the craving for heroin and thus enable the patients to decrease their Levomethadone-dosage substantially.</brief_summary>
