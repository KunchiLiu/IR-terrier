	<brief_summary>This will be a retrospective chart review of 200 charts of adult patients who have undergone a revision TKA at New England Baptist Hospital and who received implant component(s) manufactured by DePuy Orthopedics. The data will be collected retrospectively after patients are seen clinically for a minimum of five years after surgery to answer: 1. What is the five-year survivorship of revision a knee prosthesis containing components manufactured by DePuy Orthopedics among adult revision TKA patients? 2. What patient factors are associated with the need for re-operation after revision TKA among patients receiving DePuy implant components? How do clinical outcomes change from baseline over the five-year follow-up after revision TKA surgery? Data collection will include patient-reported and clinician-reported measures.</brief_summary>
