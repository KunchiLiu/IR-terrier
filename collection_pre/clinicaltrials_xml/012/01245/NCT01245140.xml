	<brief_title>Efficacy of Alitretinoin Treatment in Patients With Pustular Form of Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palmo-plantar pustulosis (PPP) is an inflammatory skin disease affecting palms and soles. The disease is considered as a sub-form of psoriasis and presents with sterile pustules of the palms and the soles. This study investigates the efficacy of alitretinoin in patients who have not responded to topical drugs (e.g., steroid creams), who are suffering for at least 6 month from the condition and whose disease severity is confirmed by a score.</detailed_description>

Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing and either 1) agrees to use a medically acceptable contraception method for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point and continue contraception until the end of the study, or 2) has only samesex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle. 2.
