	<brief_summary>This is a two-arm, open-label, randomized Phase III study comparing single agent GSK1120212 to chemotherapy (either dacarbazine or paclitaxel) in subjects with Stage IIIc or Stage IV malignant cutaneous melanoma. All subjects must have a BRAF mutation-positive tumour sample. Subjects who have received up to one prior regimen of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic melanoma setting will be enrolled into the study. Subjects with any prior BRAF or MEK inhibitor use will be excluded. Approximately 297 subjects will be enrolled with 2:1 randomization (198 subjects into the GSK1120212 arm and 99 subjects into the chemotherapy arm). The primary endpoint for the statistical analysis will be a comparison of progression free survival for subjects receiving GSK1120212 compared to chemotherapy. Subjects who have progression on chemotherapy will be offered the option to receive GSK1120212.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>≥18 years of age Stage III unresectable (Stage IIIc) or metastatic (Stage IV) cutaneous melanoma which is also determined to be BRAF V600E/K mutationpositive by the central laboratory Received no prior treatment or up to one prior regimen of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic melanoma. Prior treatment with immunotherapy (with the exception of prior ipilimumab, which is only allowed if given in the adjuvant setting), cytokine therapy, biological or vaccine regimen is permitted. Prior use of sorafenib is allowed Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Women of childbearing potential and men with reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception during the study. Additionally women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to randomization Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 01 Adequate screening organ function Any prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors. Subjects who have received dacarbazine or paclitaxel prior to randomization will not be eligible to receive the same chemotherapy as study medication (i.e. a subject who received prior dacarbazine cannot receive dacarbazine on this trial and would thus receive paclitaxel if randomized to the control arm) History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been diseasefree for 3 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible. Subjects with second malignancies that are indolent or definitively treated may be enrolled. Consult GSK Medical Monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet requirements specified above Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection which will be allowed) Brain metastases with the following exceptions that are ALL confirmed by the GSK Medical Monitor: All known lesions must be previously treated with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery, and Brain lesion(s), if still present, must be confirmed stable (i.e. no increase in lesion size) for ≥90 days prior to randomization (must be documented with two consecutive MRI or CT scans using contrast), and asymptomatic with no corticosteroids requirement for ≥ 30 days prior to randomization, and no enzymeinducing anticonvulsants for ≥ 30 days prior to randomization History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following: QTcB ≥ 480 msec. History or evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias. Exception: Subjects with controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt;30 days prior to randomization are eligible History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months prior to randomization. History or evidence of current ≥ Class II congestive heart failure as defined by New York Heart Association History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis History or current evidence / risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR): History of RVO or CSR, or predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (e.g. uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes). Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a risk factor for RVO or CSR such as: Evidence of new optic disc cupping. Intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mm Hg as measured by tonography</criteria>
