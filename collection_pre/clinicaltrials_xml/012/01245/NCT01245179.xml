	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find out about the safety and effects of a drug called panobinostat when given to adults with sickle cell disease. Panobinostat is a pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to significantly increase hemoglobin F induction, which is well documented to improve outcomes in sickle cell disease. HDAC inhibitors are also known to potently inhibit cell-specific inflammation, which is a primary contributor to the debilitating effects of sickle cell disease. Given the relevance of these mechanisms of action in SCD, panobinostat may prove to contribute significantly to the management of SCD patients, a population in critical need of further effective treatment options.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Panobinostat (LBH589) in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a one-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase I, dose-escalation study of Panobinostat administered via different dosing schedules. In each schedule, this study is designed to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and DLT (dose limiting toxicities) of panobinostat as a single agent, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of panobinostat in adult patients with sickle cell disease who have failed to respond to hydroxyurea therapy (clinically or hematologically) or are intolerant of or refuse hydroxyurea therapy. The study consists of a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Post-Treatment Follow-up.Screening Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 days of baseline visit (Day 1). Screening assessments will include informed consent, physical exam, vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, and respirations), review of medical history, review of concomitant medications, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and laboratory assessments. Screening laboratory assessments will include the following: CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH, serum ferritin, thyroid function testing, Hb F percentage, F-cells, HIV, urinalysis (with microscopic evaluation if indicated), and serum pregnancy in all females of childbearing potential. Approximately 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of blood will be collected at the screening visit. Treatment The treatment phase is twelve weeks in duration. Each subject will be assigned to a specified dose level and dosing schedule and will remain with the assigned regimen, if tolerated, throughout the twelve week period. Regardless of specific dosing assignment, all subjects will take study drug thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). The first three patients to enroll in the study will be assigned to dose level 1 (10 mg), with a dosing schedule of one week of treatment (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) followed by three weeks off treatment for the entire 12 week treatment period. The next three subjects will be assigned to dose level 1 (10 mg), with two weeks of treatment (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) followed by two weeks off treatment for the entire 12 week treatment period. The following three subjects will be assigned to dose level 1 (10 mg), with continuous thrice weekly dosing during the entire 12 week treatment period. Patient assignment will continue in this same manner until all three dose levels and schedules are filled or until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is found. All three subjects in a given cohort must complete one cycle of treatment before enrollment can begin in the next cohort. If the MTD is identified before all cohorts are completed, all subsequent subjects will be enrolled at that dosage and will be assigned one of the three dosing schedules to be followed for the entire 12 week treatment period. MTD is defined as one dose level lower than the dose on which 2/3 patients developed a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If the MTD is reached prior to patients starting a given dose level, the remaining number of patients required to complete the study will be enrolled at the identified MTD. During the Treatment Phase, safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at specified times, and will include: physical examination, vital signs (weight, blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, and respirations), adverse events assessment, ECG, and laboratory assessments. Treatment phase lab assessments are to be performed at specified visits and include CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH, serum ferritin, Hb F percentage, F-cells, thyroid function testing, inflammatory markers, exploratory studies, urinalysis (with microscopic evaluation if indicated), and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Approximately 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of blood will be collected at each of the treatment visits. For all patients, a minimum of 3 sequential 12-lead ECGs, separated by at least 5 minutes, must be performed on Day 1 (baseline) and Day 5 pre-dose and 3 hours post-dose. Other ECG's (Day 29 and Day 57) are single pre-dose recordings Study personnel should place a telephone call to each patient on Days 50 and 71 to assess interim study drug compliance and to obtain information regarding any adverse events that may have occurred between study visits. Study drug will initially be dispensed at the baseline visit and every four weeks thereafter. Study drug accountability should be assessed at every visit. All baseline assessments will be completed prior to the first dose of study drug. Follow-up A follow-up visit will be performed 4 weeks after the Day 85 visit. Follow-up assessments will include: physical examination, vital signs, adverse events assessment, ECG, and laboratory assessments (CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH, Hb F percentage, F-cells, and inflammatory markers). Approximately 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of blood will be collected at the follow-up visit. Optional genetic sub-study Exploratory genetic labs will be done on subjects who agree to participate. Histone acetylation and methylation assays of gamma genes will be performed as an assessment of the mechanism of action of panobinostat. Approximately 15ml of extra blood will be collected at four separate visits.</detailed_description>
