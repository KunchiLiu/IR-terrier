	<brief_summary>Modification of the EGF signalling pathway and / or HER 2, by Lapatinib in bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 0 of Neoadjuvant Lapatinib in Infiltrative Bladder Carcinoma Before Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with invasive bladder tumor , candidates for radical cystectomy. Patients will receive Lapatinib during 3 weeks +/- 5 days, before cystectomy. A comparison of tissue from the original biopsy and cystectomy after Lapatinib will allow this to occur. TREATMENT AND STRATEGY Lapatinib in bladder carcinoma -Overall there are arguments for considering that egf pathway is involved in bladder carcinoma and so far that drugs inhibiting EGF pathway could have an impact for therapeutical endpoints. Nevertheless it is unclear that from previous studies that adding egf inhibiting drug to chemotherapy is clinically relevant, essentially by difficulties to measure a beneficial endpoint while downstream EGF pathways have been modified by these drugs, as shown with lapatinib (see 2.1.5). Furthermore, there is no argument for initial selection of patients based on the initial egfr and/or her 2 tumor profile, asking for more intense knowledge. LAPATINIB TREATMENT Patients will receive lapatinib therapy at a daily standard dose of 1500 mg. LAPATINIB TREATMENT DURATION Patients will then receive 3 weeks of lapatinib therapy + possible 5 days. As the study is a non direct benefit study, the exposition to the drug is proposed during the standard window of 3 to 4 weeks to organize a radical cystectomy in patients with muscle invasive bladder carcinoma. In this study patients, the standard procedure is not delayed for the purpose of the study. The duration of exposition to lapatinib as to be long enough to have a continuous impact of biological events to induce indeed inhibition of EGF pathway but also to impact on more complex or more distal events as apoptosis and so to be able to measure it. This justifies a 3 weeks of treatment + possible up to 5 days more due to surgical organization procedures. Surgery will take place on the last day of treatment, which is recommended due to the half-life of lapatinib. Nevertheless for surgical purpose, the drug could be not given on the day of surgery.</detailed_description>

Affiliated or profit patient of a social security system Prior pelvic radiation or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
