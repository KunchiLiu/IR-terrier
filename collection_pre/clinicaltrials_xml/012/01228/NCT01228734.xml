	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether the progression free survival (PFS) time with FOLFOX-4 plus cetuximab is longer than that with FOLFOX-4 alone as first-line treatment for mCRC in Chinese subjects with RAS wild-type tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Compare Oxaliplatin, Folinic Acid (FA) and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) Combination Chemotherapy (FOLFOX-4) With or Without Cetuximab in the 1st Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) in Chinese Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (RAS) Wild-type Patients</brief_title>
