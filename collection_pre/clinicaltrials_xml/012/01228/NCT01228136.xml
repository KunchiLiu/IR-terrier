	<detailed_description>Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy is the most common major surgical procedure performed in children. Although it's a relatively simple procedure, may present complications as hemorrhage and death. The mortality associated to the surgery range between 1/1.000 and 1/27.000 in the literature, with approximately 30% due to hemorrhage. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic hemostatic indicated to control bleeding in cases of hyperfibrinolysis or defective hemostasis diseases. It's major indications are prostatic surgery and menorrhagia.</detailed_description>
