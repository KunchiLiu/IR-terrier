	<brief_summary>Because the bladder neck and proximal urethra contain abundant α1-adrenergic receptors, α-blockers or α1-blockers are well-known to reduce bladder neck obstruction in patients with or without neurogenic bladder. α1-blockers seem to have a potential to reduce bladder outlet resistance during voiding in patients with neurogenic bladder. Based on these turnouts, we designed this clinical study to evaluate the clinical effect and safety of silodosin on voiding dysfunction associated with neurogenic bladder.</brief_summary>
