	<brief_title>Observational Study to Assess Genotypes/Phenotypes Correlations in Type-2 Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to to characterize type 2 diabetic patients with initial alterations of diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on three different phenotypes previously identified and different patterns of progression [Lobo, 2004] in order to correlate this data with genetic information (based on a list of candidate genes previously identified as being involved in DR). The results of this study will be used exclusively for scientific purposes.</detailed_description>
