	<brief_summary>Study design: Single-blind (subject and observer-blinded), active-controlled, randomized [6:2:1:2:1; CL184 + purified vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV) vs. human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) + PVRV vs. placebo + PVRV vs. CL184 + human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) vs. placebo + HDCV], mono-center study Study objectives: Primary: To evaluate the safety of CL184 in combination with PVRV in healthy adult subjects. Secondary: To evaluate the safety of HRIG or placebo in combination with PVRV and to evaluate the safety of CL184 or placebo in combination with HDCV in healthy adult subjects. To evaluate the rabies virus neutralizing activity (RVNA) after administration of CL184 or placebo in combination with PVRV, of HRIG in combination with PVRV, and of CL184 or placebo in combination with HDCV in healthy adult subjects. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rabies Virus Neutralizing Activity and Safety of CL184, a Monoclonal Antibody Cocktail, in Simulated Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to explore and obtain further safety and RVNA data on CL184 in comparison to HRIG and placebo as part of a classical post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen. This regimen will be applied as simulated PEP regimen to healthy subjects (i.e. in a pre-exposure setting) in this study. A comparison with placebo combined with each rabies vaccine was included to differentiate between the contribution of immune globulin and vaccine and to investigate potential interactions between immune globulin and vaccine. RVNA provided by CL184 or HRIG, as well as vaccination response will be checked regularly during the study and booster doses can be applied after the study, if necessary. In addition pharmacokinetic data will be collected.</detailed_description>
