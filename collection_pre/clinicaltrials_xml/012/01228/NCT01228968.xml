	<brief_summary>Subjects will undergo a brief magnetic resonance (MRI) scan. The resulting images will be used to compare two abdominal fat segmentation techniques. The first technique is already validated and in use. The second technique was recently developed and has not been validated. The hypothesis is that the second technique will be the faster and more reliable of the two.</brief_summary>
