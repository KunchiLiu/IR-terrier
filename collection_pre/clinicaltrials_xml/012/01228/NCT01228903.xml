	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to understand the effect of lowering serum uric acid levels on vascular function in individuals with chronic kidney disease by comparing the effects of: 1) Allopurinol therapy and 2) Placebo. Patients will receive: 3 month study drug (either allopurinol or placebo), with assessment of serum uric acid levels and vascular function.</detailed_description>
