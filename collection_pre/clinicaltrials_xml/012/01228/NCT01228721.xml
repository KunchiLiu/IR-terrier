	<brief_summary>PURPOSE. To evaluate the impact of self-acting eyetracking and retest software on the reproducibility of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements in glaucoma patients and healthy control subjects using Spectralis® SD-OCT. METHODS. RNFL thickness was measured in 56 normal and 47 glaucomatous eyes by one operator within one session with a brief rest between measurements. Three measurements were taken with the eye-tracker and retest function, and three were taken without this function, alternating between measurement methods. - Trial with medical device</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Visual acuity of more or equal to 0.5 Snellen, refractive error less than ±5.00 diopters (D) spheric and ±3.00 D cylindrical and no history of ocular trauma or of any other severe ocular disease (particularly diseases affecting the optic nerve or surgery other than uncomplicated cataract surgery). Additional inclusion criteria for the glaucoma group were a diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or PEXglaucoma.
