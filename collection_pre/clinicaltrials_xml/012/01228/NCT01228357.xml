	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis is that the variations of the candidate genes are associated with individual symptoms in patients with depression. The Second hypothesis is that patients with the associated genetic variation suffer longer from the associated symptom than the patients without the associated genetic variation.</detailed_description>
