	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Patients starting peritoneal dialysis with a glucose-based regimen have high sympathetic activity in response to an increase in leptin and insulin. Converting patients from a regimen of only glucose containing dialysate to a regimen with non-glucose-based solution, icodextrin, will reduce the insulin and leptin levels and will reverse dialysis-induced increases in sympathetic activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sympathetic Activity in Patients With End-stage Renal Disease on Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular mortality remains higher among patients treated with peritoneal dialysis as compared to patients treated with hemodialysis. Sympathetic hyperactivity is considered a significant emerging risk factor for cardiovascular mortality among patients with ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease). Sympathetic activity, via its hemodynamic effects and trophic effects, and in interaction with RAAS (Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System), does play a major role in cardiac and vascular remodelling, development of LVH and vascular hypertrophy, as well as progression to CHF. Glucose-based dialysate induces hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia. We propose that hyperleptinemia induced by glucose-based peritoneal solution is a significant contributing factor to sympathetic hyperactivity in ESRD patients treated with PD, and could be prevented by non-glucose-based PD solution such as icodextrin-based. Adult patients with ESRD starting PD as their first renal replacement therapy modality will be studied. Patients will be recruited 1-3 weeks prior to starting PD treatment. At baseline, specific studies for microneurography (MSNA), fasting plasma insulin, leptin, catecholamines and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be performed. EKG will be recorded and digitized for further assessment of heart rate variability using power spectral analysis. Extracellular fluid volume status will be assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Central vascular volume will be assessed from inferior vena cava (IVC) by heart ultrasound. Consequently 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring(ABPM)and a 24-h urine collection for urea clearance and creatinine clearance will be done. All participants into the study will receive a PD treatment for 6 weeks with standard glucose-based PD solution Dianeal. The specific studies are repeated at 6 weeks.Then, patients will be randomized to one of the two groups (arms). One group will continue with Dianeal PD solution for another 12 weeks. The other group will receive Dianeal during the day and Extraneal, icodextrin or non-glucose based solution, during the night only, for the next 12 weeks. The specific studies are repeated at 12 weeks after randomization (18 weeks of PD treatment).</detailed_description>
