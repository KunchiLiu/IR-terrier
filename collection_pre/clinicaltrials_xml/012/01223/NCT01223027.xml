	<criteria>Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) with histological or cytological confirmation of clear cell carcinoma or a component of clear cell Patients must have received one and only one prior VEGFtargeted therapy and one and only one prior mTOR inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting. One VEGF targeted therapy (e.g. sunitinib, or pazopanib, or axitinib, or tivozanib or bevacizumab) and one prior mTOR inhibitor therapy (everolimus, or temsirolimus or ridaforolimus) Prior cytokines therapy and prior vaccines in the adjuvant setting is permitted. Patients must have had disease progression on or within 6 months of stopping the last therapy. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion at baseline (by RECIST Criteria Guidelines v1.1) assessed by Computer Tomography (CT) Scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70% Patients must have the following laboratory values: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9 g/dL Serum total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT and AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN (Patients with known liver metastases: AST and ALT ≤ 5.0 x ULN) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Patients who have previously received sorafenib therapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. Patients who have previously received Dovitinib or brivanib in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. Patients with brain metastases. Radiological imaging (e.g. CT or MRI scan) of the brain is required at screening/baseline Patients with another primary malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study treatment, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or nonmelanomatous skin cancer, or insitu carcinoma of the uterine cervix Patients who have received the last administration of an anticancer targeted small molecule therapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment (e.g. sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, everolimus, temsirolimus), or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy Patients who have received the last administration of nitrosurea or mitomycinC ≤ 6 weeks prior to starting study treatment, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy Patients who have undergone major surgery (e.g., intrathoracic, intraabdominal or intrapelvic) ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy Patients with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
