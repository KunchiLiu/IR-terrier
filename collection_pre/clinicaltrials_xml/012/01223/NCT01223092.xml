	<brief_summary>The purpose of this this study is to use DNA screening strategies to identify genes and localize genomic regions that are differentially expressed in patients with infertility to further understand the genetic basis for reproductive competence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Gene Associations and Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental strategies seek to discover small variants in DNA sequences, which are associated with certain infertility parameters. The alleles being analyzed in in vitro fertilization (IVF) population are sought to be associated with functional differences in the expression of the gene product that are then mechanistically linked to infertility.</detailed_description>
