	<brief_summary>WHAT IS THE FEMALE CONDOM? The female condom being examined in this study is investigational (experimental) and is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The female condom is made up of a pouch that adjusts to the shape of the vagina. The female condom that will be used in this study is not lubricated, but a water-based lubricant will be provided for you to use with it. Also, the female condoms used in this study will be provided to you at no cost. WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? The purpose of this study is to find out: - How well the female condom works to prevent pregnancy - How well the female condom works to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted diseases - How safe the female condom is to use - If urinary tract infections and symptomatic vaginal infections occur while using the female condom - How well women like the female condom - How well the female condom performs. WHAT DOES THE STUDY INVOLVE? There will be approximately 10 clinics in the study with about 500 women from all over the United States participating in this study. You are being asked to participate in a research study because you are a woman between the ages of 18 and 40, are in general good health, have regular menstrual cycles, do not want to become pregnant for at least the next 7 months, and are willing to rely on the female condom as your primary method of contraception during study participation. HOW LONG DOES THE STUDY LAST? Enrollment for this study is expected to last about 12 months. You will need to come to the clinic for a screening/admission visit and then 2 or more visits. You will also be asked to complete a diary every day about your use of the female condoms. The clinical staff will help set up your planned clinical visits during the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter, Open-Label, Non-Comparative Study of the Safety and Contraceptive Efficacy of the Woman's Condom</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase III multicenter, open-label, non-comparative trial of the Woman's Condom to evaluate contraceptive efficacy as the primary method of contraception. Secondary evaluations include safety assessment, incidence of UTIs, symptomatic vaginal infection, performance of the Woman's Condom (clinical breakage, slippage, misdirection, and invagination) and overall acceptability of the product. We will perform a Substudy to assess the semen biomarker as a means of detecting product failure in a subset of subjects.</detailed_description>
