	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to verify the relationship between coronary plaque regression and cardiovascular prevention in long term follow up of the Japan Assessment of Pitavastatin and Atorvastatin in Acute Coronary Syndrome (JAPAN-ACS) study [NCT00242944]. In addition, the effect of serum lipid levels or different type of statins on cardiovascular prevention will also be examined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended Japan Assessment of Pitavastatin and Atorvastatin in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several previous multicenter studies using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging have revealed that statins attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis or even provide regression of plaque volume. Indeed, the Japan Assessment of Pitavastatin and Atorvastatin in Acute Coronary Syndrome (JAPAN-ACS) trial [NCT00242944] has revealed that early aggressive statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) significantly reduces the plaque volume of non-culprit coronary lesions On the other hands, a direct relationship between atheroma progression and regression on IVUS and clinical events has not been clearly defined. To verify that relationship, long term follow up of the JAPAN-ACS study will be performed. Clinical outcome of patients with regressed plaque and progressed plaque will be compared. In addition, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of serum lipid levels or different type of statins on cardiovascular prevention.</detailed_description>
