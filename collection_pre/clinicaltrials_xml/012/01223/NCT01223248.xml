	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out which way of giving high-dose radiation works best for treatment of cancer that has spread to bone, the spine, soft tissue, or lymph nodes. This study will look at the effects, good and/or bad, of giving 27 Gy in three fractions (3 days) or 24 Gy in one fraction (1 day) using image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT). IG-IMRT is radiation that is given directly to the cancer site and reduces the exposure to normal tissue. Currently there are no studies that compare the effects of giving radiation in either hypofractionated doses (higher total doses of radiation spread out over several treatment days) or a single-fraction dose (entire radiation dose given in one treatment session). The patient may be asked to participate in an additional part of this study where we will get a a (DW/DCE) MRI before treatment start and within one hour after radiation treatment. If the patient is asked to take part in this portion of the study, all they will need to do is get up to 3 MRIs with standard contrast injection. The purpose of this is to see if as a result of the treatment there are changes in the blood flow going to the cancer which could suggest that the treatment may be successful. In addition some patients can present new lesions and may be asked if they would like to have these new lesions treated on the protocol. If they are given this option, this will not extend their follow up period. The follow up of the new lesions will match with the prior follow up dates.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer (including epithelial carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma) The diagnosis can be done at MSKCC or at participating institutions. Sites of metastatic disease to be treated on protocol are limited to bone, spine, soft tissue, and lymph nodes only. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (6th edition, 2002) Stage IV cancer with distant metastases Age 18 years or older Life expectancy &gt;3 months Maximum tumor dimension of ≤6 cm in lymph nodes, soft tissue, osseous metastases, or spinal metastases seen on imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or PET/CT) and considered amenable for RT. If the lesion(s) to be treated are softtissue or lymph Nodes unidimensionally measurable disease is required. Bone &amp; spine lesions are eligible even if considered nonmeasurable. Measurable disease is defined as: ≥ 10mm for softtissue lesions ≥ 15mm on the short axis of lymph nodes KPS ≥ 80 Patients must have normal bone marrow function as defined below:(within 2 months of registration) Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/μl Platelets ≥100,000/μl Prior radiotherapy delivered to the target region Disease to be treated on protocol is less than 2 mm from the spinal cord and therefore will not meet dose constraints* Pregnancy or BreastFeeding (Participants of childbearing potential are eligible but must consent to using effective contraception during therapy and for at least 3 months after completing therapy). Chemotherapy given on the day of the planned radiotherapy treatment Lesions which comprise &gt;70% of the width of weight bearing bones, such as the femur. Existing cortical bone destruction, where orthopedic stabilization would be required. Areas to be treated on protocol do not include metastases to liver, brain or lung. Note: Patients with eligible and ineligible lesions will be accrued to this protocol. Only target eligible lesions will be treated per protocol. Other eligible and ineligible lesions will be treated at the discretion of the treating physician."</criteria>
