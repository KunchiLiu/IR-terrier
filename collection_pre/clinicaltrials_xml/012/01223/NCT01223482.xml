	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that a majority of pregnancies that end in miscarriage are due to a chromosome abnormality usually involving a duplicated or missing chromosome. Often this happens by chance and is not likely to occur in future pregnancies. For many women, a miscarriage can be a traumatic experience and can cause feelings of loss and grief. The option of genetic testing, such as karyotyping, may offer an explanation for the miscarriage and may help some women find closure in their loss. However, no literature exists on a women's experience with genetic testing following a miscarriage. This assumption that the knowledge that can be gained from karyotyping may be a positive experience for a woman following a miscarriage should be studied and the results published. This study will address whether routine karyotyping should be offered following a miscarriage for the purpose of benefiting the patient's experience.</brief_summary>
