	<criteria>1) Chronic hepatitis with spontaneous manifest HE (mental state grade 1 or 2 according to the West Haven criteria) and an NCTA performance time &gt;30 seconds; 2) Hyperammonemia (venous ammonia concentration &gt;50 mmol/L); 3) Cooperative, hospitalised, adult patients with liver cirrhosis diagnosed by clinical, histological and ultrasonographic findings (reduced dimensions of the liver as well as splenomegaly) and oesophageal varices at stage II and III observed by endoscopy. 1) Major complications of portal hypertension, such as gastrointestinal blood loss, hepatorenal syndrome or bacterial peritonitis; 2) Acute superimposed liver injury; 3) Patient with other neurological disease and metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, unbalanced heart failure and/or respiratory failure or endstage renal disease; 4) Alcoholic toxic cirrhosis because toxic brain damage may interfere with the assessment of HE; 5) Severe HE; 6) Administration of antiHE medications such as neomycin, branchedchain amino acids; 7) Any additional precipitating factors such as high protein intake (additional highprotein meals), constipation or intake of psycho stimulants, sedatives, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or benzodiazepinesantagonists (flumazenil), betaadrenergic blockers, neuromuscular blocking agents, certain antibiotics; 8) Patients with fever, sepsis or shock were also excluded to avoid variations caused by body temperature; 9) Illiteracy.</criteria>
