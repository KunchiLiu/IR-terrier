	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that non-optimally treated carbohydrate counting-na√Øve patients with type 1 diabetes can achieve better metabolic control by counting carbohydrates and that the metabolic control can be further improved with concurrent use of an integrated glucose meter and bolus calculator. The investigators want to test the hypothesis in this study.</brief_summary>
