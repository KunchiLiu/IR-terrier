	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: 6 To assess the efficacy of insulin glargine given once daily (QD) on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels over a period of 24 weeks in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) aged at least 6 years to less than 18 years. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the effects of insulin glargine compared to NPH insulin over 24 weeks on: - Percentage of patients reaching International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) recommended target of HbA1c &lt; 7.5%, - Fasting blood glucose (FBG), - Nocturnal blood glucose (BG), - 24-hour blood glucose profile based on 8-point self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) values, - Daily total insulin dose and basal insulin dose, - Rates of asymptomatic and/or symptomatic, severe, nocturnal and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia. - To assess the safety and tolerability of insulin glargine versus NPH insulin based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). - To assess anti-insulin and anti-glargine antibody development in both groups. - To assess insulin glargine pharmacokinetic(PK) for all patients treated with insulin glargine in selected sites with approximately 45% of insulin glargine population to rule out accumulation tendency of insulin glargine after repeated dosing</brief_summary>
