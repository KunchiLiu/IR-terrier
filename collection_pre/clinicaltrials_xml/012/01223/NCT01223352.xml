	<criteria>1. PAH diagnosis confirmed with right heart catheterization (RHC): Idiopathic or heritable PAH, or Associated PAH persisting after complete repair of a congenital heart defect (PAH has to be persistent for at least 6 months after surgery) or PAHCHD associated with systemictopulmonary shunts (after global amendment dated 09 May 2012) 2. WHO functional Class I, II or III 3. Male or female ≥ 3 months and &lt; 12 years of age (maximum age at randomization is 11.5 years) 4. Body weight ≥ 3.5 kg 5. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 88% (at rest, on room air) 6.

During the study, all background treatments should remain stable 7. Signed informed consent by the parents or legal representatives 1. PAH etiologies other than listed above 2. Nonstable disease status 3. Need or plan to wean patient from intravenous epoprostenol or intravenous or inhaled iloprost 4. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 80% of the lower limit of normal range 5. AST and/or ALT values &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range. 6. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment, i.e., ChildPugh Class B or C 7. Hemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels &lt; 75% of the lower limit of normal range. 8. Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to bosentan or any of the excipients of the dispersible Tracleer tablet 9. Treatment with forbidden medication within 2 weeks or at least 5 times the halflife prior to randomization, whichever is the longest: Glibenclamide (glyburide) Cyclosporin A Sirolimus Tacrolimus Fluconazole Rifampicin (rifampin) Ritonavir Coadministration of CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, voriconazole) and moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, erythromycin, ketoconazole, diltiazem, itraconazole) Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) other than bosentan 10. Treatment with another investigational drug within 1 month prior to randomization or planned treatment</criteria>
