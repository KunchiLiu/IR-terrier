	<brief_summary>The immune system of the body has the ability to fight and eliminate infections and cancers. Immune treatments, such as in this study, seek to teach the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. The purpose of this study is to test whether it is safe to treat the cancer with a vaccine and another drug called bevacizumab (also known as Avastin).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically documented epithelial carcinoma arising in the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum. Patients who have received cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy with at least one platinum based chemotherapy regimen. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible. Patients with relapsed ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have now completed chemotherapy and/or surgery for recurrent disease. Eligible patients are those who would be appropriate to enter a period of observation if standard management were considered. Patients who have asymptomatic residual measurable disease on CT scan or be in complete clinical remission. Patients may have an elevated CA125. (Complete clinical remission is defined as serum CA125 ≤ 35 IU/ml, negative physical examination and without objective evidence of disease by computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis.) Adequate hematologic, coagulation, renal and hepatic function. ANC &gt; = to 1,000 cells/mm3; platelets &gt; or = 100,000 cells/mm3 PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is &lt; 1.5 (or an inrange INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) Serum creatinine &lt; or = to 1.5 mg/dl Bilirubin, SGOT, Alk Phos &lt; 2.5x upper limit normal Urine protein : creatinine (UPC) ratio must be &lt; 1 . If UPC ratio &gt; 1, collection of 24hour urine measurement of urine protein is recommended as part of the patient's medical management offstudy. Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% Expected survival of at least 4 months Age ≥ 18 years. This protocol does not include children because the number of children with cancer is limited, and because a nationwide pediatric cancer research network already accesses the majority. Furthermore, the incidence of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer in children is extremely infrequent. Patients who are ≥ 4 weeks from completion of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prior bevacizumab and/or immunotherapy treatment are permitted Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures Current or recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study) participation in another experimental drug study. Active malignancy, other than superficial basal cell and superficial squamous (skin) cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within last five years Patients must have undergone standard cytoreductive surgery as part of primary treatment to be eligible for this study and therefore are not of childbearing potential.Nursing mothers are excluded. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg) Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (see Appendix C) History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1 Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of hemoptysis (≥ 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to Day 1 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) or tumor involving major vessels. Major surgical procedure such as laparotomy, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to Day 1 History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6 months prior to Day Patients with clinical symptoms or signs of GI obstruction who require parenteral hydration, parenteral nutrition, or tube feeding Patients with evidence of abdominal free air not explained by paracentesis or recent surgical procedure Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture Known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab Allergy to seafood Active autoimmune disease (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis etc); or immune deficiency (HIV, hypogammaglobulinemia); or known active infections with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C; or those receiving immunosuppressive drugs (such as chronic systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporin, etc); or those receiving chronic antiinflammatory drugs (intermittent use of antiinflammatory drugs is permitted).</criteria>
