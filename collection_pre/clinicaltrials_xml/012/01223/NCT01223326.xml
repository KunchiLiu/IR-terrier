	<brief_title>N-acetylcysteine to Reduce Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the most important factors in the pathophysiology of liver dysfunction after hepatic surgery is the cellular damage derived from the interruption of blood flood with reperfusion of the organ. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has proved beneficial in several conditions involving oxidative damage. This study investigates the effects of NAC to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury in liver resection performed under ischemic preconditioning and intermittent portal triad clamping. Methods: 46 ASA II-III patients scheduled to undergo liver resection where randomised to receive NAC (initial dose: 150 mg/Kg; and infusion of 50 mg/kg, from 30 minutes before the ischemia up to 60 minutes later to the reperfusion) or placebo in a phase IV clinical trial. Blood, hepatic and urinary markers were obtained at basal status and 1, 3 and 24 h post final reperfusion.</detailed_description>
