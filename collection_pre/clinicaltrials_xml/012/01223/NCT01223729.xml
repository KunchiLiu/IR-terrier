	<brief_summary>Minimal hepatic encephalopathy represents a common complication present in well-compensated cirrhotic patients that impairs patients daily functioning and health-related quality of life. Acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to be useful in improving blood ammonia and cognitive functions in cirrhotic patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. This study evaluated the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine treatment on health related quality of life and on depression in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy.</brief_summary>
