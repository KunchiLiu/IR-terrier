However, how to maintain adequate hemodynamic status in order to keep the patients with well organs perfusion is the main issue of the intensive care physicians. The choices of vasoactive drugs in the guidelines or experts' suggestions nowadays used are still limited in the western medicine. Si-Ni-Tang, a remedy previously used in ancient China and now widely prescribed in Taiwan and China, is used for treating patients diagnosed as shock or heart failure.
