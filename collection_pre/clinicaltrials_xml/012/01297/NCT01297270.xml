	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Chronic hepatitis C infection, diagnosed by positive antiHCV antibodies and detected HCV RNA at screening in addition to: 1. positive antiHCV antibodies or detected HCV RNA at least 6 months prior to screening; or, 2. liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection. 2. HCV genotype 1 infection confirmed by genotypic testing at screening. 3. Therapyna誰ve to interferon, pegylated interferon, ribavirin or any antiviral / immunomodulatory drug for acute or chronic HCV infection. 4. HCV RNA = 1,000 IU/mL at screening 5. Documentation of a liver biopsy within 3 years or fibroscan within 6 months of the screening visit. Note: If cirrhosis has been previously demonstrated on a biopsy, then biopsies obtained more than 3 years before enrolment need not be repeated. Biopsies can be waived for patients who would be placed at risk from the procedure. Inability to do a liver biopsy should not exclude patients from a trial. 6. Age 18 to 70 years 7. Female patients: (c) with documented hysterectomy, (d) who have had both ovaries removed, (e) with documented tubal ligation, (f) who are postmenopausal with last menstrual period at least 12 months prior to screening, or (g) of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and Day 1, that, if sexually active, agree to use one of the appropriate medically accepted methods of birth control from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin in addition to the consistent and correct use of a condom. Patients must agree not to breastfeed at any time from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin. Medically accepted methods of contraception for females in this trial are ethinyl estradiolcontaining contraceptives, diaphragm with spermicide substance and intrauterine device. Male patients: 1. who are documented to be sterile, or 2. who are without pregnant female partner(s) and consistently and correctly use a condom while their female partner(s) (if of childbearing potential) use one of the appropriate medically accepted methods of birth control from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin. It is in the responsibility of the male patient to ensure that his partner(s) is not pregnant prior to screening into the study or becomes pregnant during the treatment and the observation phase. 8. Signed informed consent form prior to trial participation Exclusion criteria: 1. HCV infection of mixed genotype (1/2, 1/3, and 1/4) diagnosed by genotypic testing at screening. 2. Evidence of acute or chronic liver disease due to causes other than chronic HCV infection. 3. HIV coinfection. 4. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on presence of HBsAg. 5. Active malignancy, or history of malignancy within the last 5 years prior to screening (with an exception of appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix) 6. Active or, history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse other than cannabis within the past 12 months 7. A condition that is defined as one which in the opinion of investigator may put the patient at risk because of participation in this study, may influence the results of this study, or limit the patient多s ability to participate in this study. 8. Usage of any investigational drugs within 28 days prior to screening, or planned usage of an investigational drug during the course of this study. 9. Received concomitant systemic antiviral, hematopoietic growth factor, or immunomodulatory treatment within 28 days prior to screening. Patients being treated with oral antivirals such as acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir for recurrent herpes simplex infection; or with oseltamivir or zanamivir for influenza A infection, may be screened. 10. Received silymarin (milk thistle), glycyrrhizin, or Shosaikoto (SST) within 28 days prior to screening and throughout the treatment phase. 11. Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drugs. 12. Alpha fetoprotein value &gt;100 ng/mL at screening; if &gt;20 ng/mL and =100 ng/mL, patients may be included if there is no evidence of liver cancer in an appropriate imaging study (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI) within last 6 months prior to randomization (Visit 2). 13. Decompensated liver disease, or history of decompensated liver disease, as defined by the presence of: hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, or esophageal variceal bleeding and/or laboratory results of any of the following: 1. International normalized ratio (INR) of =1.7 2. Serum Albumin =3.5 g/dL 3. Serum total bilirubin =2.0 mg/dL (except when the increase is predominately due to unconjugated bilirubin and related to Gilberts syndrome). 14. Preexisting psychiatric condition that could interfere with the subject多s participation in and completion of the study including but not limited to prior suicidal attempt, schizophrenia, major depression syndrome, severe anxiety, severe personality disorder, a period of disability or impairment due to a psychiatric disease within the past 5 years.</criteria>
