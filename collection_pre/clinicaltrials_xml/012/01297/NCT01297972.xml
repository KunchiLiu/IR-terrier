	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Severe Acquired Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquired aplastic anemia is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by and empty bone marrow and low blood counts. Most of the cases are immune-mediated. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the preferable treatment modality for patients younger than 40 years with a matched sibling donor. Patients not eligible for transplant are treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy often based on anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. However, up to one third of patients treated with immunosuppression are refractory and one third of those who response eventually relapse. Refractory and relapsed cases may be the result of insufficient immunosuppression and these cases may benefit from additional immunosuppression. Mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be a potential treatment option, considering its properties to modulate the immune system. Refractory or relapsed patients with aplastic anemia will be treated with conventional immunosuppressive regimen (anti-thymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine) combined with intravenous infusion of allogeneic unrelated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.</detailed_description>
