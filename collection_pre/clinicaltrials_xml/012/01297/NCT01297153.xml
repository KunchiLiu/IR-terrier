	<brief_title>Aphakia Versus Pseudophakia in Children Under 2 Years Undergoing Bilateral Congenital Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of IOLs in pediatric patients has become increasingly popular in recent years and may represent a standard of care for older children. The refinements in surgical techniques attained in adult cataract surgery have been translated to pediatric cataract surgery to produce a technically safe eye. Nevertheless, the use of IOLs in children younger than 2 years remains controversial. Exaggerated inflammation, capsular opacification and changing refractive status of the developing eye should be considered before the use of IOLs in the first two years of life. Further more, there is concern about the unknown risks of an IOL over the long life span. Currently, there are 3 methods of optical rehabilitation following congenital cataract surgery : 1. Primary IOL implantation. 2. Aphakic glasses. 3. Contact lenses. At present, there is no randomized clinical trial reported to document the safety and efficacy of IOL implantation in children less than 2 years. Aim : To compare the technical outcome (safety) and functional outcome (benefits) following primary IOL implantation and aphakia in children less than 2 years.</detailed_description>
