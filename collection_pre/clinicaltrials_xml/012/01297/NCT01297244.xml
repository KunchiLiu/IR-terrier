	<brief_title>A Biomarker Study of Tivozanib in Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm, multi-center, study of orally administered tivozanib to approximately 100 subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study is designed to evaluate biomarkers in blood and archived tissue samples, and their correlation with clinical activity and/or treatment-related toxicity in subjects with advanced RCC, and estimate the percentage of tivozanib-treated subjects who are progression-free at 6 months, overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Subjects will be stratified by histology (clear cell vs. non-clear cell). Enrollment of non-clear cell subjects will be limited to ≤ 30% of the entire study population. Study enrollment is anticipated to complete in approximately 9 months. Treatment duration is estimated to last approximately 6 months from the subject's first dose of tivozanib with a follow-up period of 30 days. After 6 months, treatment with tivozanib may continue by participation in a rollover protocol (AV-951-09-901). Maximum duration of subject participation in this Phase 2 study is approximately 8 months.</detailed_description>
