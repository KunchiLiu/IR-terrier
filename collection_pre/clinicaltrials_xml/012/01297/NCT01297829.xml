	<brief_summary>Caldolor速 is an intravenous (IV) formulation of ibuprofen encompassing analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic (anti-fever) properties. Caldolor速 is the first IV antipyretic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), providing an alternate route for administration of ibuprofen when the oral route is not preferable. Recent studies have reported that Caldolor速 decreases morphine use and pain at rest and with movement compared to patients not receiving this drug. The hypothesis of the proposed study is that a single dose of Caldolor速 800 mg given 30 minutes preoperatively for patients undergoing laparoscopic or open inguinal and/or umbilical hernia repair will result in a &gt;20% decrease in postoperative narcotic use within the first 24 hours and at 7 days, and decreased VAS Pain Score at 2 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after surgery. The use of less postoperative narcotics has been associated with a faster return of normal bowel function and resumption of normal ambulatory status thus resulting in improved general well being for the patient.</brief_summary>
