	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the diffusion area (cephalic, lateral, medial and caudal points) of the botulinum toxin type A in the frontal muscle for usual concentrations and dilutions of the drug. A basal line control and After the application control will be made, and the investigators will evaluate the drug effects, based on clinical aspects, photographic registers and through electromyography exam (EMG). Considering the results of our investigation, the investigators may propose a pattern of application of BOTULINUM TOXIN TYPE-A Botox® in the frontal area.</brief_summary>
