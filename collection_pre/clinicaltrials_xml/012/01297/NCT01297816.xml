	<brief_summary>This process appears as a incredible and progressive event that will not stop till reattachment of RPE and neurosensory retina happened . Process of degeneration begins from first hours of RD (Retinal Detachment) establishment Neuroprotection of photoreceptor following RD is a novel and debatable discussion encountered in recent years . How to stop this phenomena and neuroprotective agent role in this issue are a new interest of researcher. In the study the investigators are planning to perform a clinical trial to demonstrate the minocycline neuroprotective effect in a double blind design as this impact has been implicated previously in a animal study</brief_summary>
