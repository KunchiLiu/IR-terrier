	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, cross-over single-dose study employing administration of two oral formulations of crizotinib (OLF and FC) in the fasted state to healthy adult subjects. Twenty-two (22) subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 20 evaluable subjects who complete the study. Each subject will receive two treatments (A and B) with a washout period of at least 14 days between each treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m^2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing). Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy). A positive urine drug screen. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21 drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 halflives preceding the first dose of study medication. 12lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at screening. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential, including those with tubal ligation. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal supplements and hormonal replacement therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of â‰¤1 g/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a casebycase basis following approval by the sponsor. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more within 56 days prior to dosing. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this protocol. Subjects who are investigational site staff members or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the trial. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. A positive serology for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Subjects who currently smoke.</criteria>
