	<brief_title>Incidence of Urinary Tract Infection After Urodynamic Investigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction after spinal cord injury need lifelong urologic control examinations with CMG (urodynamic examination). The manipulation may cause urinary tract infections which have to be treated. Patients often noticed an infection after a CMG examination. Aim of this study is the determination of the infection rate and germs. Also should be noticed the pre-interventional infections and differences between the causing germs. Simultaneously the investigators test the reliability of the quicktest for urinary infection. Additionally the investigators will examine the Quality of Life in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.</detailed_description>
