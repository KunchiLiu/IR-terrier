	<brief_summary>The purpose is to investigate tocilizumab administration in patients with moderately to severely or sight-threatening GO (Graves' ophthalmopathy) without response to treatment with corticoid intravenous pulses. Currently, these patients only have surgery as therapeutic alternative. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of tocilizumab treatment in order to provide a better alternative to surgery for this patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tocilizumab Treatment in Graves´ Ophthalmopathy (Graves´ Orbitopathy or Thyroid Eye Disease)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid orbitopathy or Graves´orbitopathy (GO) is manifested for inflammation of the orbital and periorbital soft tissues. Ten percent of patients with GO will have long-term serious eye problems. The cause of the GO is complex. Autoreactive T cells recognize an autoantigen, the TSH receptor present in the orbit and thyroid follicular cell, secrete cytokines (IL-6), which stimulate the fibroblasts to synthesize glycosaminoglycan, which draws liquid produce periorbital edema and muscle, causing exophthalmos. This approach suggests that inhibition of IL-6 can be an effective treatment for this problem on the basis that tocilizumab specifically binds to the receptors of the IL-6, both soluble and membrane-bound. Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit signaling mediated for IL-6Rm IL-6Rs.</detailed_description>
