	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Tarceva versus combination of Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with stage IIIA-N1,N2 NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation in exon 19 or 21.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of Erlotinib Versus Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent Chemoradiation therapy remain the standard treatment for stage IIIA disease, but its treatment-related life threaten toxicity limit its use for those patients. Tarceva monotherapy have been demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival and disease progression free survival when used for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC, after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. It is well tolerated without the side effects usually associated with chemotherapy. Based on the encouraging results reported from the SLCG phase II study reported the efficacy of Tarceva as first line treatment for metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutation patients would prolong overall survival, delay disease progression and be well tolerated, mOS reached 27 months, ORR reached 71%. Besides, with different mechanism and more tolerable than chemo, Tarceva may provide an important treatment alternative for local advanced pts with EGFR mutation.</detailed_description>
