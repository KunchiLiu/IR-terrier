	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled trial tests the efficacy of a mental health peer-led educational intervention called BRIDGES (Building Recovery of Individual Dreams and Goals through Education and Support). The BRIDGES program is a 10-week, manualized education course designed to provide basic information about the etiology and treatment of mental illness, self-help skills, and recovery principles in order to empower participants to return to valued social roles within their communities. BRIDGES is a peer-led program and all instructors are adults with mental illnesses. Hypothesis #1: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report increased feelings of psychological empowerment. Hypothesis #2: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report increased feelings of hopefulness. Hypothesis #3: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report enhanced coping ability. Hypothesis #4: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report enhanced recovery. Hypothesis #5: Compared to wait-list controls, intervention participants will report greater ability to advocate for themselves with health care providers. Hypothesis #6: Compared to wait-list controls, those in the BRIDGES education course will report increased knowledge of the causes and treatment of mental illness and recovery principles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligibility criteria included having a diagnosis of serious mental illness and experiencing severe functional impairment in one or more life roles. All study participants completed telephone interviews at three points in time: study entry (pre-intervention); 8-weeks later (immediate post-intervention); and 6-months after intervention (approximately 8 months after study entry). Blinded interviewers administered valid and reliable outcome assessments that measured changes in subjects' knowledge about mental illness; emotional well-being; empowerment; hopefulness; self-advocacy; and recovery. All study participants were compensated for their time at each interview. All BRIDGES instructors were people in recovery from serious mental illnesses who were certified and experienced BRIDGES teachers. Fidelity to the BRIDGES curriculum was assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study.</detailed_description>
