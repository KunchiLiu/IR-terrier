	<brief_summary>The purpose of this two-stage phase II study is to assess the efficacy of BKM120, as measured by determining the progression free survival (PFS), in patients with pretreated metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that exhibits PI3K pathway activation. BKM120 will be investigated in two groups of NSCLC patients according to the histology of the cancer: squamous and non-squamous.</brief_summary>
