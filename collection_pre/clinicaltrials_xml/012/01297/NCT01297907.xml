	<brief_summary>Background: Latent pulmonary involvement is described in Crohn Disease(CD). Bronchial hyperreactivity measured by the Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT) has been evaluated in two studies involving mainly adults.Our aim was to determine the frequency of bronchial hyperreactivity in pediatric patients followed and treated for Crohn disease. Methods: Twenty-three children with Crohn disease completed a questionnaire, followed by spirometry, Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT) and determination of Fractional Exhaled NO (FENO). The control group included patients evaluated for functional cough who had negative Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT).</brief_summary>
