	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) relative to each of its individual active components in patients with open-angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Brinzolamide 1%/Brimonidine 0.2% vs. Brinzolamide 1% and Brimonidine 0.2%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 6 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the Screening/Eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and the Treatment phase, which included 3 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1. Patients who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized (1:1:1) to receive treatment with 1 of 3 study drugs for 3 months. Study drug instillation began the morning after the second eligibility visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sign Informed Consent document. Diagnosis of openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, with mean intraocular pressure within protocolspecified range at eligibility visit/s. Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply. Females of childbearing potential if pregnant, lactating, or not using highly effective birth control measures. Any form of glaucoma other than openangle glaucoma. Severe central vision loss in either eye. Chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye disease. Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months. Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the preceding 3 months. Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment. Bestcorrected visual acuity score worse than 55 letters using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart. Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the administration of study product. Ocular surgery within the preceding 6 months. Ocular laser surgery within the preceding 3 months. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Any other conditions, including severe illness, which could make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study. Other protocolspecified exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
