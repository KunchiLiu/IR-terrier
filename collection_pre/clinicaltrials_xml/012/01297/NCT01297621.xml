	<brief_title>Physical Activity and Sexuality After Reduction Mammaplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast hypertrophy is a frequent condition among women; reduction mammaplasty is one of the most performed procedures in plastic surgery.Previous studies have demonstrated that breast hypertrophy is associated to back pain, and patients often complain about physical limitations due to this condition, as well as sexual impairment. Thus, this trial was designed to test the hypothesis that reduction mammaplasty may improve physical and sexual performance of breast hypertrophy patients,and patients'satisfaction with the results of the operation. Three validated tools were used: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Female Sexual Quotient and the Breast Evaluation Questionnaire.</detailed_description>
