	<brief_summary>Application of antimetabolite agents such as mitomycin_c has improved trabeculectomy results and better control of intraocular pressure complications such as corneal endothelial cell loss. However, Mitomycin_c can be applied remain a concern before or after sclera flap dissection. Mitomycin_c application after sclera flap dissection probably increases corneal endothelial cell loss. This study compares Mitomycin_c application two methods: before and after sclera flap dissection with regard to success rate and complication. patients on base of Mitomycin_c application time (1-2-3) minutes will be match randomise in to two groups( before and after sclera flap dissection) corneal. Endothelial cell density, polymorphism, polymegathism and intraocular pressure before and one month, three months, six months after surgery will measured.</brief_summary>
