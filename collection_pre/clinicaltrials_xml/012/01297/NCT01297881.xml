	<brief_summary>Pulmonary function tests including spirometry, lung volumes, measurements of resistance and diffusing capacity are essential in the diagnosis of several pulmonary diseases. These tests are an integral part of the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, but until now there is no clear evidence for the use of many of the pulmonary function tests because of a lack of adequate studies. The obscurity largely pertains to the conditions under which combinations of the various tests are indicated. Therefore the Belgian Thoracic Society, assembling all pulmonologists and the pneumology LOK/GLEMâ€Ÿs, will investigate this matter.</brief_summary>
