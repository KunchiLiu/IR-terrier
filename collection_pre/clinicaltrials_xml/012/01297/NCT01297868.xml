	<brief_summary>Objective The investigators assessed the acute impact of physical exercise on retinal vessel regulation. This might be of clinical importance if retinal vessel regulation is examined with the very sensitive method of the dynamic vessel analyzer Design Forty middle aged (age range 18 to 31 years, mean age 24 years) healthy subjects (26 female / 14 male) had retinal examinations with static and dynamic vessel analysis prior and after (0.5h, 1.5h, 2.5h) intense exercise of 20 minutes.</brief_summary>
