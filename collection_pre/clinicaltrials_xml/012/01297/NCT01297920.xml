	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new ophthalmic suspension (Brinz/Brim) in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) relative to its individual active components in subjects with open-angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Month Efficacy/Safety Study With a 3-Month Safety Extension of Brinzolamide 1%/Brimonidine 0.2% vs. Brinzolamide 1% or Brimonidine 0.2%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 7 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and the treatment phase, which included 4 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, Month 3, and Month 6. A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized to 1 of 3 study drug groups. The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine over a 3-month period, with an additional 3 months of study drug exposure intended to provide further safety data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sign Informed Consent document. Diagnosis of openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, with mean intraocular pressure within protocolspecified range at eligibility visit/s. Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply. Females of childbearing potential if pregnant, lactating, or not using highly effective birth control measures. Any form of glaucoma other than openangle glaucoma. Severe central vision loss in either eye. Chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye disease. Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months. Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the preceding 3 months. Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment. Bestcorrected visual acuity score worse than 55 letters using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart. Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the administration of study product. Ocular surgery within the preceding 6 months. Ocular laser surgery within the preceding 3 months. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Any other conditions, including severe illness, which could make the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study. Other protocolspecified exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
