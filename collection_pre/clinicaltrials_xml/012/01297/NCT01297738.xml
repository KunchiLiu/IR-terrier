	<brief_summary>Obesity and insulin resistance may be in part explained by an altered reward system with changes in the serotonin/dopamine system. These changes might be caused by changes in dietary habits, especially by an increased intake of liquid sugar and an increase in meal frequency. The investigators hypothesize that increasing meal frequency compared to increasing meal size and when consuming a hypercaloric high-sugar diet (HS) compared to a hypercaloric high-fat-high-sugar diet (HFHS) will result in a reduction in cerebral serotonin and dopamine transporters and in a more prominent increase in insulin resistance. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the changes in insulin sensitivity will be independent of changes in abdominal (visceral) and liver fat and that changes in insulin sensitivity due to the dietary manipulation will co-occur with changes in insulin signaling pathways in peripheral fat and muscle tissue.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lean, healthy, young men will follow a hypercaloric HF- or HFHS diet for 6 weeks. Before and after the dietary intervention, the investigators will perform a SPECT-scan for serotonin and dopamine transporters with the radioligand [123I]FP-CIT, administered intravenously. The investigators will also perform a structural MRI for localization. Furthermore the investigators will perform a liver MRS and abdominal MRI for liver fat- and abdominal visceral fat measurement. The investigators will also perform a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp to measure insulin sensitivity and muscle- and fat biopsies to examine changes in insulin signaling pathways and fat metabolism. After the hypercaloric diet subjects will follow a hypocaloric diet until their weight is back to baseline.</detailed_description>
