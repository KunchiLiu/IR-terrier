	<brief_summary>Vitamin B12 deficiency is more widespread in the population than has been assumed so far. Since a deficiency in this vitamin can lead to irreversible neurological damage, early diagnosis is essential. Vitamin B12 is synthesized exclusively in micro-organisms, and in humans it is an essential component in methyl group transfer and cell division. The vitamin is crucially involved in the proliferation, maturation, and regeneration of neural cells. In combination with folic acid, as an enzymatic essential cofactor in the metabolism of homocysteine, vitamin B12 maintains low homocysteine levels. The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between religious origin and age, and Vitamin B12 and Folic acid plasma levels in non Jewish population in Western Galilee. The investigators assumption is that the results of the study will contribute to early detection and treatment of Vitamin B12 and Folic acid deficiencies in order to prevent long term complications.</brief_summary>
