	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiva VASCADE™ Vascular Closure System (VCS) in sealing femoral arterial access sites. Hypothesis: The Cardiva VASCADE™ VCS provides times to hemostasis (TTH) and time to ambulation (TTA) results that are less than manual compression by a clinically meaningful and statistically significant margin. The rate of major access site-related complications with the Cardiva VASCADE™ VCS is non-inferior to the major complication rates of manual compression for sealing femoral arterial access sites.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>PreOperative Patients undergoing an elective, nonemergent diagnostic or interventional endovascular procedure via the common femoral artery using a 6 or 7 Fr introducer sheath PreOperative 1. Advanced refusal of blood transfusion, if necessary; 2. Active systemic or a cutaneous infection or inflammation; 3. Preexisting immunodeficiency disorder and/or chronic use of systemic steroids; 4. Known, significant history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, von Willebrand's disease or current platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3, baseline INR ≥1.8, or fibrinogen level less than 150 mg/dl (if received a fibrinolytic agent within prior 24 hours); 5. Severe coexisting morbidities having a life expectancy of less than 30 days; 6. Currently involved in any other investigational clinical trial; 7. Ipsilateral femoral arteriotomy within the previous 30 days; 8. Planned endovascular procedure within the next 30 days; 9. Previous ipsilateral femoral artery closure using a permanent implantbased closure device; 10. Previous vascular grafts or surgery at the target vessel access site; 11. History of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, revascularization or deep vein thrombosis in the ipsilateral limb; 12. Unilateral or bilateral lower extremity amputation(s); 13. Significant anemia with a hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL or a hematocrit less than 30%; 14. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of &gt; 2.5 mg/dl); 15. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant within 3 months of the procedure, or lactating; 16. Extreme morbid obesity (BMI greater than 45 kg/m2) or underweight (BMI less than 20 kg/m2); 17. Unable to routinely walk at least 20 feet without assistance (see protocol); 18. Known allergy/adverse reaction to bovine derivatives, sodium hyaluronate or hyaluronan preparations; 19. Procedures that extend hospitalization (e.g., staged endovascular procedure, CABG); 20. Administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within 8 hours of the procedure. Intraop Exclusion Criteria 1. An introducer sheath with an overall length greater than 11 cm, or not 6 Fr or 7 Fr diameter; 2. Femoral artery diameter less than 6 mm at access site; 3. Difficult insertion of procedural sheath or needle stick problems at the onset of the procedure (e.g., multiple stick attempts, "back wall stick", etc.); 4. Angiographic evidence of more than minimal calcium, atherosclerotic disease, or stent within 1 cm of the puncture site; 5. Overlapping Common Femoral Vein and Femoral Artery at access site; 6. Placement of ipsilateral venous sheath during procedure; 7. Arterial access site located not at common femoral artery (e.g., on or below the bifurcation, above the lower border of the inferior epigastric artery, or above the pelvic brim); 8. More than one access site required; 9. Loss of distal pulses in the ipsilateral extremity during the procedure; 10. Subjects receiving unfractionated heparin with an ACT greater than 300 seconds in the absence of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor or greater than 250 seconds in the presence of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (may wait to remove introducer sheath until ACT level reaches the target value); 11. Intraprocedural bleeding around sheath, or suspected intraluminal thrombus, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula; 12. Systemic hypertension (BP greater than 180/110 mmHg) or hypotension (BP less than 90/60 mmHg) prior to randomization; 13. Length of the tissue tract, the distance between the anterior arterial wall and skin, is estimated to be less than 2.5 cm; 14. If the physician deems that a different method should be used to achieve hemostasis of the arterial site or that the subject should not attempt ambulation according to the protocol requirements.</criteria>
