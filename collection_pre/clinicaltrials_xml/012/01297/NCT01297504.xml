	<brief_title>A One-Year Observation of Palivizumab in Infants at Risk for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Latin America</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RSV causes significant disease. There is a paucity of data from developing countries even though existing data clearly indicate that RSV accounts for a high proportion of acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in children. This is a multi-center study in a cohort of infants at risk for RSV infection in Latin America who have received palivizumab in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of marketing authorization with regard to dose, population and indication. Enrolled participants were followed for one year after their first dose of palivizumab. Epidemiological and clinical data as well as information about compliance, hospitalizations and safety was collected.</detailed_description>
