	<brief_summary>This study is intended to determine the efficacy of topical application of E-101 Solution directly into the surgical incisional wound in the prevention of infection of superficial and deep surgical incisional wounds. E-101 Solution is an enzyme-based antiseptic that is being developed for direct application to a surgical incision.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of E-101 Solution for Preventing Surgical Site Infections After Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this standard-of-care, pivotal Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical E-101 Solution after direct application into the principal surgical incision in the prevention of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections (SSI) within 30 days after elective colorectal surgery. The study is intended to support a target indication statement of: "E-101 Solution is indicated for the prophylaxis of incisional surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery". E-101 Solution is comprised of the active ingredients of glucose oxidase (GO) and porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO) that produce coupled reactions after the addition of glucose substrate. The hypothesis is that E-101 Solution topically applied directly into the principal incision is safe and significantly reduces the incidence of incisional SSI compared to placebo topical application. (The principal surgical incision is ≥ 5cm and &lt; 35 cm used as a hand port, colorectal specimen extraction port, or extracorporeal manipulation port depending on the specific colorectal surgical approach.)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Scheduled to undergo elective colon and/or rectal surgical procedures involving open laparotomy, handassisted laparoscopy, and laparoscopicassisted approaches. The principal incision must have a length of &gt; 5 cm and &lt; 35 cm in length. Eligible surgeries are: left hemicolectomy, right hemicolectomy, transverse colectomy, ileocolic resection, total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, total abdominal proctocolectomy (portion of specimen to be extracted via laparotomy), low anterior resection, sigmoid resection, nonemergent Hartmann procedure, colostomy takedown through laparotomy (not peristomal) incision, ileopouch anal anastomosis, and abdominal perineal resection of the rectum. 2. Able to give informed consent. 3. Male or female ≥18 years of age. 4. If female, is nonpregnant (negative pregnancy test result at the Screening/Randomization Visit) and nonlactating. 5. If female, is either not of childbearing potential (defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile [status post bilateral tubal occlusion, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy]) or practicing 1 of the following methods of birth control and agrees to continue with this regimen over the study surveillance period: Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives for 3 consecutive months before the Baseline/Randomization Visit Intrauterine device Double barrier method (condoms, sponge, or diaphragm with spermicidal jellies or cream) Not sexuallyactive. Agreement to be available for evaluation at the study site for scheduled visits. 1. Hypersensitivity to porcine products. 2. History of known antimyeloperoxidase autoantibodies (i.e., pANCA), as well as patients with known idiopathic necrotizing glomerulonephritis and certain systemic vasculitis conditions [e.g., microscopic polyangiitis of small blood vessels, Wegener's granulomatosis, and ChurgStrauss Syndrome]). 3. Use of microbial sealant (IntegusealTM), any antibioticembedded suture, or any antimicrobialembedded suture to close the principal incision or any suture in the surgical field that has not been formally approved by the relevant local national regulatory authority. 4. Absolute contraindication to general anesthesia. 5. Hypersensitivity reactions to steristrip tapes, medicalsurgery tapes, adhesives, or sutures. (Note: If there can be assurances that the subject will not be exposed to these materials that cause hypersensitivity, alternatives will be allowed.) 6. History of keloid or hypertrophic scarring within or near an incision from a prior surgery. 7. Body mass index [BMI]: &gt; 50 or &lt; 20 (both due to the extremely high risk of poor wound healing). 8. ASA score &gt; 3. 9. Undergoing emergency colorectal surgery such that standard bowel preparation and other standard preoperative precautions and assessments cannot be performed in time before the indexsurgery. 10. The planned indexsurgery involves removal or placement of mesh (either synthetic or biological) as part of closure in the principal incision or traversing any part of a preexisting mesh (either synthetic or biological) in the principal incision. 11. There are clinical signs of overt infection necessitating systemic antibiotics via oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes (e.g., infection of the abdominal wall, peritonitis, pneumonia, and sepsis/septic shock) prior to the indexsurgery. 12. Preoperative severe neutropenia (total neutrophil count ≤500 X 109/L). (Note: Testing should be performed at the local laboratory.) 13. Receiving any oral or intravenous antibiotics within 24 hours prior to the indexsurgery. (Note: It is permissible to administer conventional oral prophylactic antibiotics as bowel preparation up to the time of the index surgical procedure, as well as intravenous or intramuscular prophylactic antibiotics just prior to the indexsurgery as per the treating surgeon's standard of care.) 14. Preoperative evaluation that the intraabdominal process might preclude full closure of the skin incision due to severe or morbid obesity (i.e., any mechanical reason that would prevent/preclude primary intent wound healing) at the principal incision. 15. History of major organ transplantation (e.g., lung, liver, or kidney), including bone marrow transplantation, or intent to perform major organ transplant as a concomitant surgery. 16. History of a complicated laparotomy within 30 days prior to planned indexsurgery. 17. Planning to undergo a second colorectal surgical procedure (e.g., colostomy or ileostomy takedown) or any other general surgery in less than 30 days of indexsurgery. 18. Likely preoperative urinary tract infection, as evident by: i) symptoms of upper urinary tract infection (e.g., fever and/or flank pain) or ii) symptoms of lower urinary tract infection (e.g., urinary frequency, dysuria, urgency, and/or suprapubic pain); accompanied by any one of the following: 1) bacteriuria of ≥104 bacteria/mL urine or 2) positive urine leucocyte esterase or positive nitrite urine dipstick tests. Also exclude any man under age 60 years who has both positive urine nitrite and leucocyte esterase dipstick tests even if he is asymptomatic (unless he has predisposing factors for urinary tract infection e.g., spinal cord injury). (Note: Testing should be performed at the local laboratory.) 19. Undergoing a significant concomitant surgical procedure (e.g., hysterectomy) or any mesh repair (either synthetic or biological mesh) as part of closure. The following concomitant procedures are allowed: appendectomy, cholecystectomy, oophorectomy, removal of Meckel's diverticulum, primary repair of small ventral hernia (i.e., &lt;30 cm2), liver biopsy/wedge resection (but not liver resection). 20. Patients with a condition (e.g., recurrent urinary tract infections, nail infections, sinusitis, dental infections, vaginitis/vaginosis, or chronic bronchitis) requiring frequent or chronic administration of antimicrobials (received antibiotics/antimicrobials at least twice for ≥ 2 weeks during past 6 months). 21. Preoperative prothrombin time or INR &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal. (Note: Testing should be performed at the local laboratory.) 22. Postsurgical life expectancy ≤ 60 days (in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion). 23. Any patient in which the planned surgery would include: i) placement of a stoma in the principal incision; ii) placement of a drain into the supraperitoneal fascia space that emerges through the principal incision; iii) placement of a drain into the intraperitoneal space that emerges through the principal incision; and iv) supplementation of any of the irrigation fluid with antibiotic or antiseptic drugs. 24. Patients with severe COPD that are likely to need &gt; 24 hours postoperative ventilator support (e.g., patients on chronic or intermittent supplemental oxygen or an estimated forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 50% of expected based on bedside spirometry). 25. If, in the opinion of Investigator, the potential subject would likely be unable to maintain adequate care of the principal incision postoperatively. 26. Anticipate that patient will not be available for study visits/ procedures or if in the opinion of Investigator there is concern that patient might not comply with study visits/procedures (e.g., due to ongoing illicit drug usage or alcohol abuse). 27. Lack of willingness to have personal studyrelated data collected, archived, or transmitted under a blinded condition to regulatory agencies. 28. Participation within 30 days before the start of this study in any experimental drug or device study; or currently participating in a study in which the administration of investigational drug or device within 60 days is anticipated.</criteria>
