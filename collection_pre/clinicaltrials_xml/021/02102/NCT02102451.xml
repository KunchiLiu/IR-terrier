	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of rapid scale-up of new hepatitis C (HCV) treatments, known as interferon-free Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) drugs, and impact on the proportion of people with HCV within the HIV-HCV coinfected population of Australia. It is hypothesised that a rapid scale-up of hepatitis C treatment with interferon-free therapies in individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection will assist in controlling HCV infection in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Control and Elimination Within Australia of Hepatitis C From People Living With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project has five major components which will occur independently but are linked to the central theme of controlling and eliminating HCV infection from the majority of the Australian HIV positive population. Database of HIV-HCV individuals (CEASE-D): Surveillance of HIV-HCV positive individuals will occur through the enrolment into the CEASE-D observational study database. The proportion with HCV viraemia in this population will be determined through three cross-sectional surveys; at enrolment (2014-2015), follow-up 1 (2016) and follow-up 2 (2018). Participation will involve providing informed consent, collection of limited clinic and demographic information, a dried blood spot sample, patient completed CEASE questionnaires and FibroScan® (where available). It is estimated that approximately 1000 HIV-HCV coinfected individuals will be enrolled into the CEASE-D database. Modelling (CEASE-M): Mathematical modeling will be undertaken to examine various treatment strategies, including HCV treatment scale-up timelines. The data from the first cross-sectional survey of the HCV surveillance phase (CEASE-D) will inform components of the modeling. HCV Education for HIV prescribers (CEASE-E): A comprehensive education program in HCV treatment with interferon-free DAA therapy will be conducted with HIV prescribers with high HCV caseloads in preparation for the rapid scale-up of HCV treatment. HCV Treatment Scale-Up (CEASE-T): HCV treatment scale‐up with PBS listed regimens will involve primary and tertiary clinics. All patients who are commencing HCV treatment will be invited to participate in CEASE‐T which will involve data collection regarding treatment with PBS listed regimens. The regimen and duration will be determined by the treating clinician according to PBS prescribing guidelines. At selected sites subjects will be offered enrollment into a more intensive follow‐up substudy (I‐STEP) involving collection of research EDTA plasma samples, patient completed behavioural questionnaires and FibroScan® (where available). Patients with recurrent viraemia during or following treatment (relapse/reinfection) may also be entered into a separate substudy cohort (CEASE‐V) Recurrent Viraemia Treatment (CEASE-V) At selected sites patients with on‐treatment virological failure (nonresponse or viral breakthrough) or post‐treatment recurrent viraemia (relapse or reinfection) will be entered into an intensive follow‐up cohort (CEASE‐V). Participation will involve providing informed consent, collection of research EDTA plasma samples and patient completed behavioural questionnaires. Patients may be offered retreatment with PBS listed regimens. The decision to retreat as well as the regimen and duration will be determined by the treating clinician according to PBS prescribing guidelines</detailed_description>
