	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed study is to analyze the effect of the incorporation of phototherapy into a therapeutic exercise program on pain, functional capacity, range of motion, muscle strength in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knees. The participants will be allocated to different groups through a randomization process using opaque envelopes containing cards stipulating one of the three following groups: Group A (exercise protocol); Group B (exercise protocol + phototherapy protocol); and Group C (exercise protocol + placebo phototherapy protocol).
