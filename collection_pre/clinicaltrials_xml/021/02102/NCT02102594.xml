	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the application of proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade®, approved for therapy of multiple myeloma) in patients with therapy-refractory antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. The investigators hypothesis is that the proteasome inhibition will lead to reduced antibody titers and improved clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
