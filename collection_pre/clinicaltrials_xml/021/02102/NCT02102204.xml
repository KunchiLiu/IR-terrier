	<brief_title>To Assess the Long-term Safety of AMG 416 in the Treatment of SHPT in Subjects With CKD on Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, single-arm, extension study in which subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism currently receiving hemodialysis previously treated in AMG 20120231, 20120334, or 20120360 will continue to be treated with AMG 416. The study will assess the long-term safety and tolerability of AMG 416 as well as measuring the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total serum albumin, corrected calcium (cCa), and serum phosphorous (P) values in these subjects during the course of their treatment.</detailed_description>
