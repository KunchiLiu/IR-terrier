	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single dose of IV acetaminophen can improve post-operative pain, nausea, and vomiting in the outpatient setting. Patient satisfaction, time to readiness of discharge, and the amount of opiates post operatively will also be measured.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Dose of Intravenous (IV) Acetaminophen Verses Placebo in the Pre-operative Setting and Outcomes on Post-operative Pain, Nausea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if using a one time pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen has an effect on post-operative nausea, vomiting, and pain. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study on patients from the Katzmann Breast Center undergoing outpatient breast surgery (including excisional biopsy, lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary node dissection, or ductal excision). IV acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been in Europe and other countries. In the U.S. the FDA approved IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev) in November of 2010. Since then, it has been used in many different ways, but most commonly in the first 24 hours post operative recovery period. There will be two arms included in this study. Patients in Arm One will receive a one gram dose of IV acetaminophen in the pre-operative area. Patients in Arm Two will receive a dose of the placebo (IV normal saline). The medication will be disguised in the same bag as the normal saline, so no one (including the patient) in the pre-operative area will know which arm the patient is in. This prospective, randomized, double blind study will compare post-operative nausea, vomiting, and pain rates in patients from both arms. The primary endpoint of this study will be to compare post-operative pain in patients receiving a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen to patients receiving the normal saline placebo. Secondary endpoints will include post-operative nausea and vomiting, recovery times, and overall satisfaction of pain management throughout their experience (assessed on post operative day one). If this study shows that IV acetaminophen given in the pre-operative setting decreases post-operative nausea, vomiting, and/or pain and/or shortens recovery time, and improves patient satisfaction in regards to their pain management, it could also become a routine medication given to all patients in the pre-operative setting.</detailed_description>
