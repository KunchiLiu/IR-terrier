	<brief_title>Conventional or Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique for the Treatment of Furcation Defects Using Enamel Matrix Derivative and Anorganic Bovine Bone - a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a split-mouth design, fifteen patients with bilateral class II and III furcation defects were treated with MIST (Test Group) or CST (Control Group). Furcation defects in both groups were filled with anorganic bovine bone (ABB) and enamel matrix derivative (EMD). Patient-centered outcomes including analyses of pain, discomfort, edema, hematoma, root hypersensitivity and daily activities interference were recorded using a Visual Analogue Scale seven days after surgeries. Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed at baseline and 6 months postoperatively. Data were statistically analysed.</detailed_description>
