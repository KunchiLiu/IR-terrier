	<brief_summary>Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive disease that affects 15 persons per million. Although current therapy has improve disease prognosis, PAH still has a poor survival, with a median survival of 2.8 years after diagnosis. In the last few years new key elements in PAH pathogenesis have been discovered, such as the role of metabolism in disease onset and progression. In fact, PAH pulmonary smooth muscle cells switch into a glycolytic phenotype which resembles the metabolism of cancer cells. The investigators hypothesis is that "fatty acid oxidation inhibition reverts the PAH adverse phenotype by restoring mitochondrial function and morphology, decreasing proliferation and restoring apoptosis susceptibility in pulmonary smooth muscle cells "</brief_summary>
