	<brief_summary>To study the short-term effects of tourniquet use in different ways in total knee arthroplasty,60 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (30 cases/group): group A using the tourniquet throughout the operation, and group B using the tourniquet starting from the implantation of prosthesis to the completion of the operation. Operation time, total measured blood loss, intraoperative transfusion volume, and complication were recorded. Hemoglobin level was recorded preoperatively and in postoperative 1, 3, 7 and 14 days, and the limb circumference, pain score, and knee joint range of motion were also recorded preoperatively and in postoperative 3,7 and 14 days.Investigators want to observe the difference between the two groups. Hypothesis was made that patients in group B may feel better after operation for short time use of tourniquet.</brief_summary>
