	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized multi-center clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of intraoperative mitomycin C(MMC),amniotic membrane transplantation(AMT) and Conjunctival Autograft(CAG) for primary pterygium surgery. The investigators will also evaluate particular risk factors related to pterygium recurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Mitomycin C, Amniotic Membrane Transplantation and Conjunctival Autograft for Primary Pterygium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with primary pterygium will be randomly assigned to undertake pterygium excision followed by intraoperative mitomycin C application,amniotic membrane transplantation or conjunctival autograft in five clinical centers. Multi-center collaboration and quality monitoring will be based on a website designed for this study. The patients will be followed at least 12 months. Corneal Recurrence as the primary outcome measure, is considered as a fibrovascular ingrowth beyond the limbus with conjunctival drag.</detailed_description>
