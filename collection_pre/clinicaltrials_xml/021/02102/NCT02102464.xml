	<brief_summary>The pilot study objective is to evaluate the potential benefits of LipiFlow® System treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye by assessing for improvement in meibomian gland function and reduction of dry eye symptoms in comparison to an untreated control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction and Dry Eye in Contact Lens Wearers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized clinical trial of LipiFlow® treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye. All subjects undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the Baseline status. Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow® treatment (Treatment Group) or no LipiFlow® treatment (Untreated Control Group). Study endpoints are evaluated at 3 Months by comparing the Treatment Group to the Untreated Group. To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated Control group receives Crossover LipiFlow® treatment (Crossover Treatment Group) at 3 Months. Both the Treatment and Crossover Treatment groups are also evaluated one month after receiving LipiFlow® treatment.</detailed_description>
