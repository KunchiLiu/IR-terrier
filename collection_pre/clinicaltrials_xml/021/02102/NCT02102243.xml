	<brief_summary>Patients with high aldosterone hormone have higher blood glucose than normal people. This study is being done to understand how aldosterone hormone affects the nerve activity that controls blood flow in the muscles and blood glucose. The information may be helpful in selecting blood pressure medications which can improve not only blood pressure but also improve blood sugar.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Mechanism of Aldosterone-induced Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with primary aldosteronism are known to have impaired insulin sensitivity, which is improved after removal of aldosterone-producing adenoma. In patients with essential hypertension, plasma aldosterone levels have been also shown to positively correlate with indices of insulin resistance. Mechanism underlying aldosterone-induced insulin resistance is unknown. Aldosterone has been shown to interfere with insulin signaling the vascular cells by increasing production of reactive oxygen species via activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in decreased availability of nitric oxide (NO), the key mediator for insulin-mediated vasodilation. Treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Aldosterone has also been shown to increase resting sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity to the peripheral circulation. However, effects of aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on insulin-mediated skeletal muscle vasodilation, sympathetic activation, and vascular oxidative stress have not been assessed in humans. The investigators will collect venous endothelial cells, and measure skeletal muscle microvascular perfusion using Octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agents, and measure sympathetic nerve activity in normotensive controls (NT), stage 1 essential hypertensive subjects (ET), and patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.</detailed_description>
