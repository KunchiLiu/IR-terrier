	<brief_title>Investigating Immune Mechanisms in Atopic Eczema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 15-20% of children and 12% of adults and leads to significant loss of quality of life. It results from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors, and is characterised by dysregulation of the cutaneous immune system. Specifically, in the skin of eczema patients there is a persistence of T lymphocytes (a crucial cell involved in regulating the immune system), and an overproduction of certain cytokines (signalling molecules that are essential in producing inflammatory responses). The study intends to investigate the causes of atopic eczema by examining the number, characteristics and function of T lymphocytes in the skin and the blood of eczema patients, as well as the types of cytokine they produce. To achieve this the investigators aim to take skin biopsies, tissue fluid (from induced skin suction blisters) and blood samples from adult eczema patients and healthy controls for analysis. Additionally, in these groups a cutaneous immune response will be initiated by injecting tuberculin protein purified derivative (the Mantoux test) into the skin, to further investigate how the behaviour of T lymphocytes varies between eczema patients and healthy controls. This research is important in view of the high prevalence of atopic eczema in the population. An improved understanding of its causes will hopefully lead to more effective treatments for this condition in future.</detailed_description>
