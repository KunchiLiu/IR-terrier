	<criteria>Male or female patients ages 0 to 11 years. Undergoing an open surgical procedure expected to result in at least moderate pain based on an age appropriate scale. Body mass index (BMI) â‰¤ 95th percentile of age. Surgical procedures that would allow the subject to likely remain in the hospital until the morning of postoperative day 3 (to complete PK sample collection). With parental assistance, willing and able to complete the study procedures and pain scales and to communicate meaningfully with the study personnel. In generally good health and capable of undergoing surgery. Females at risk of pregnancy were to use an acceptable form of birth control and have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (although it is anticipated that all 011 year old subjects will be premenarchal). Willing to refrain from use of nonstudy analgesics for the duration of the study, from the day of surgery up to postoperative Day 4. Assents to participation and his/her parent or guardian is willing and able to sign the informed consent approved by the IRB. Surgical procedure performed exclusively by laparoscopy. Known allergy or sensitivity to ketorolac, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Prior nasalseptal injury or surgery. History of peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux, or gastrointestinal bleeding. History of advanced renal impairment or a risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Clinically significant (in the Investigator's opinion) laboratory test value outside the normal range. Use of either (a.) oxycodone at a dose of 30 mg/day or more or (b.) an equivalent dose of another opioid analgesic for a total of more than half of the days during the preceding month. The patient requires regular use (daily use in at least 25 days per month) in the 3 months prior to surgery of NSAID's , COX2 inhibitors, tramadol, or acetaminophen at daily dose of more than 2 g for the management of pain. Contraindication to the use of morphine, general anesthetics, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, lidocaine, other local anesthetics, muscle relaxants, hydrocodone, ondansetron, or acetaminophen (e.g., significant history of allergic reactions or intolerance to these or related substances). Known bleeding diathesis or other disorder or current use of agents affecting coagulation. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis of the surgeon's choice is permitted postoperatively. Current use of Central Nervous System (CNS) active drugs such as benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) for pain. These drugs are permitted for nonpain indications if the dose has been stable for at least 30 days. The use of lorazepam and other sleep medications, except those containing analgesic properties, are permitted. Current diabetes mellitus and HbA1C &gt; 9.5 or a history of prolonged uncontrolled diabetes. Use of an antihypertensive agent or diabetic regimen at a dose that has not been stable for at least 30 days. Any medical condition that in the investigator's opinion could adversely impact the patient's participation or safety, conduct of the study, or interfere with the pain assessments, including active infection. History of drug, prescription medicine, or alcohol abuse that would interfere with the subject's safety or the assessments of efficacy in this trial, in the judgement of the investigator. History of nasal mucosal damage or active seasonal allergies, nasal congestion or upper respiratory tract infection sufficient to interfere with intranasal drug delivery. Administration of an investigational product within 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug, or scheduled to receive an investigational product, while participating in the study. Use of Toradol (ketorolac tromethamine) in any formulation within the past 30 days prior to study entry and throughout study participation.</criteria>
