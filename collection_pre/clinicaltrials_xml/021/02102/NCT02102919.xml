	<brief_summary>The goal of this randomized controlled study was to examine the effects of a 8 weeks innovative training regime (stochastic resonance whole-body vibration [SR-WBV] and virtual virtual games [VG]) in the skilling up phase on physical performance and strength in elderly in need of care population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovative Training Program for Elderly in Need of Care Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sensorimotor and strength exercise are methods to increase strength &amp; power in the field of geriatrics. The question that arise what exercises are best suited to and most effective for elderly in need of care individuals. Such populations are advised first to enter a "skilling up program" before more traditional forms of training exercises are implemented. Goals in the skilling up phase: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity. The aim of the study in the skilling up phase: Study the effect on physical performance Study the effects on muscle strength.. The participants will be recruited in Canton Bern - Switzerland and will be randomly allocated to an intervention group or sham group.</detailed_description>
