	<brief_summary>The present study aims to explore the effects of a novel multidisciplinary non-pharmacological intervention designed to improve health parameters and well-being in overweight and obese women. The proposed program is health- and quality of life-oriented, without a focus on weight loss, following the philosophical principles from "Health at Every Size", and may provide an alternative mode of intervention to the traditional one, which is focused on the concept of "weight loss at any cost". To evaluate the efficacy of the intervention, a mixed-method design combining both qualitative and quantitative assessments will be applied.</brief_summary>
