	<brief_summary>Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. Given that it is known that impaired regulation of choroidal vascular tone is present in patients with AMD, the current study seeks to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in risk alleles for AMD are associated with altered choroidal blood flow regulation in healthy subjects. For this purpose a total of 220 healthy volunteers will be included. Choroidal blood flow regulation will be evaluated by measuring choroidal blood flow during isometric exercise. In addition, flicker induced vasodilatation will be studied and retinal vessel calibers will assessed, as well as retinal thickness and macular pigment optical density.</brief_summary>
