	<brief_summary>It is established that the local anesthetic that is administered during an interscalene block affects the autonomic outflow to the heart. This is very well seen during shoulder surgery when the patient is positioned in beach chair pasition. The investigators want to study the different effect of the two concentrations (0.5% and 0.375%) of ropivacaine on the autonomic nervous system through blood pressure and heart rate measurements.</brief_summary>
