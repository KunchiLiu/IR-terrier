	<criteria>Confirmed HIV infection Infection with HCV genotype 1 only, confirmed at screen visit, with a HCVRNA ≥ 1000 InternationalUnit(IU)/mL at screen visit Treatmentexperienced subjects with: previous virological failure to tritherapy with Peginterferon/Ribavirin and protease inhibitor, or premature discontinuation of previous tritherapy with Peginterferon/Ribavirin and protease inhibitor due to intolerance to Peginterferon or protease inhibitor AntiHCV treatment stopped for at least the last 3 months Patients on a stable (for more than 1 month) antiretroviral treatment consisting of an emtricitabine/tenofovir or lamivudine/tenofovir standard of care backbone plus efavirenz or raltegravir or rilpivirine or enfuvirtide. Alternative combinations of the above listed medications may be allowed. Dendritic cells 4 &gt; 100/mm3 and &gt; 15% at screen visit HIVRNA &lt; 50cp/ml for more than 3 months at screen visit Any liver fibrosis grade, with the assessment of the presence or not of cirrhosis at screening, cirrhosis being defined as a METAVIR score of F4 on the liver puncture biopsy and/or with hepatic impulse elastometry ≥ 15 kilopascal (kPa): Previous liver biopsy exhibiting cirrhosis lesions (METAVIR F4), and/or significant liver biopsy (cumulative length ≥ 15mm and ≥ 6 portal spaces), within the past 18 months and/or significant and reliable liver stiffness assessment (Fibroscan®) within the past 6 months (at least 10 measures with IQR less than 25% of the mean value and a success rate of at least 80%). Female patients with childbearing potential, and their heterosexual partners must use adequate contraception from the date of screening until 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug. Male participants must agree to consistently and correctly use a condom, while their female partner must use adequate contraception from the date of screening until 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug Body weight ≥40 kg and ≤125 kg Informed and signed consent for the main study and the Pharmacokinetic (PK ) substudy (for the participating patients) Patients with Health insurance Non inclusion Criteria: ChildPugh B or C cirrhosis or history of decompensated cirrhosis. Coinfection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (AgHBs +) with HBV DNA &gt; 1000 UI/ml Pregnant or breastfeeding women Transplant recipients Opportunistic infections (stage C), active or occurred within 6 months prior to baseline Evolutive malignancy, including hepatocarcinoma which should be controlled prior to baseline Alcohol or drug consumption which may affect the study participation according to the investigator. Patients included in a programme of substitution with methadone or buprenorphine could be enrolled. The opinion of a consultant in addictology is recommended for patients presenting with current drug use or drug use during the previous year. Patients with a history of nonadherence, who will be at risk of being unable to respect the study followup timetable Patients participating in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to inclusion Hb &lt; 10 g/dL (female) or &lt; 11g/dL (male) Platelets &lt; 50 000/mm3 Neutrophil count &lt; 750/mm3 Renal failure defined as creatinin clearance (MDRD) &lt; 60ml/min Other antiretroviral drugs than those allowed in the study Contraindications to Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir Contraindicated treatment likely to interfere with the study drugs as listed in the protocol</criteria>
