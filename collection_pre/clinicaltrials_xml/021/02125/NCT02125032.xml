	<brief_summary>The aim of this study, is to determine whether treatment using transcranial low voltage pulsed electromagnetic fields (T-PEMF) can reduce the symptoms patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) experience. The symptoms include movement, mentality and the nervous system in general. Furthermore the purpose of this study is to clarify whether a group of patients with PD, gain a statistical improvement in their symptoms when treated with active T-PEMF, compared to a group of patients with PD who receive placebo T-PEMF .</brief_summary>
