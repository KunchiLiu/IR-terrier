	<brief_summary>Pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatments have been suggested to be a safe and effective therapeutic approach for treating basal cell carcinomas. Robust supporting evidence is, however, lacking due to inconsistent design of available studies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PDL's efficacy and safety in treating superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) at low risk anatomical sites in an evidence based study setting.</brief_summary>
