	<brief_summary>The study is a multicenter, randomized, 2-period, open-label, two arm, cross-over study to show the superior effect of a 4 week treatment each with QVA149 versus tiotropium on lung function. Similarly, this study aims to evaluate patient preference after experiencing both treatment regimens in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD (GOLD 2013) and a moderate to severe airflow limitation who are symptomatic (defined as CAT score of at least 10) at screening despite being treated with tiotropium</brief_summary>
