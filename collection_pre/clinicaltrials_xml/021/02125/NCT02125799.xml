	<brief_summary>High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has shown safety and efficacy for treatment-resistant depression, but requires daily treatment for 4-6 weeks. Accelerated HF-TMS (aHF-rTMS), in which all treatments are delivered in less time, would have significant advantages in terms of access, patient acceptance and costs. In the present open label trial the investigators intend to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a novel aHF-rTMS protocol (i.e., 2 daily sessions over 2 consecutive weeks; 6,000 pulses per day). For this, depressed outpatients will receive the aHF-rTMS protocol and will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 9 with several clinician- and patient- reported measures as well as with computerized neurocognitive tests.</brief_summary>
