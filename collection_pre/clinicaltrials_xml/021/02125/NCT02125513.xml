	<criteria>Female patients ≥18 years. Karnofsky Performance Scale ≥ 60% Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma with the exception of mucinous, clear cell and carcinosarcoma histologies. Documented International Federation of Gynecologic Oncology (FIGO) stage IIICIV unsuitable for complete primary cytoreductive surgery. Inoperability must be confirmed by open laparoscopy or by laparotomy. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function to receive chemotherapy and subsequently to undergo surgery: white blood cells &gt;3,000/µL, absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/µL, platelets ≥100,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, serum creatinine &lt;1.25 x upper normal limit (UNL) or creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min according to CockroftGault formula or to local lab measurement serum bilirubin &lt;1.25 x UNL, AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 x UNL. Signed informed consent obtained prior to any studyspecific procedures Mucinous, clear cell and carcinosarcoma histologies. Synchronous or previous other malignancies within 3 years prior to starting study treatment, with the exception of adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (of the cervix or breast or other sites). Patients with brain metastases, seizure not controlled with standard medical therapy, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 months from the enrollment on this study. Any other concurrent medical conditions contraindicating surgery or chemotherapy that could compromise the adherence to the protocol (including but not limited to impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, active or uncontrolled infections, HIVpositive patients on antiretroviral therapy, uncontrolled diabetes, cirrhosis, chronic active or persistent hepatitis, impaired respiratory function requiring oxygendependence,serious psychiatric disorders).
