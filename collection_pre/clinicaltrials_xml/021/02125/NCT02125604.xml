	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of symptomatic therapies on gastrointestinal-related events reported by participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis initiating therapy with BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate, DMF) in the clinical practice setting. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are as follows: To evaluate gastrointestinal-related events requiring symptomatic therapy and the role of those therapies over time; To evaluate gastrointestinal-related events that lead to a physician's decision to manage the events with BG00012 dose modification; and To evaluate gastrointestinal-related events that lead to BG00012 discontinuation after the use of symptomatic therapy.</brief_summary>
