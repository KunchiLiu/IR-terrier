	<brief_summary>Chronic neuropathic pain is a common problem for breast cancer survivors. Even with the best medical treatment, some survivors continue to experience disabling pain. It is well-established that an interdisciplinary approach is key to the treatment of some types of chronic pain, but little research has been done on the effectiveness of interdisciplinary treatments for cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach combining medical treatment and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to reduce disability and improve quality of life among breast cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. The investigators will also evaluate the impact of the program on psychological distress, pain cognitions, biomarkers of stress and immune function, cognitive function, as well as brain structure and function. The investigators will recruit 108 adult women survivors of breast cancer living with chronic neuropathic pain. All will have their medical treatment optimized by a pain medicine specialist before being randomly assigned to either an 8-week group MBSR program or a wait-list. All participants will complete self-report questionnaires, provide a hair sample for cortisol measurements and a blood sample to measure several markers of immune function at four different time points: before medical treatment, after medical treatment and before randomization to MBSR or waiting, after the completion of MBSR as well as at 3-month follow-up. A sub-sample will complete a series of tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after participation in MBSR. The primary outcome is pain interference. The investigators will compare the proportion of participants who report reduced pain-related disability, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference Scale, in each group. The primary hypothesis is that at 3-month follow-up, there will be at least 30% more responders (≥1.0 decrease in mean Brief Pain Inventory Interference score) in the interdisciplinary program in comparison to medical treatment alone.</brief_summary>
