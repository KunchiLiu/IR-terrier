	<brief_summary>Bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a challenge for both surgeons and anesthesiologists despite several measures available for improving the surgical field. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of desmopressin on blood loss and the quality of the surgical field in FESS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Desmopressin on Blood Loss and the Quality of the Surgical Field During Endoscopic Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, has been employed as a non-transfusional treatment for hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease. Hemostatic effects of desmopressin include: 1) an increase in plasma factors through endogenous release of coagulation factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and tissue plasminogen activator; 2) an increase in platelet adhesiveness; and 3) a reduction in bleeding time. Randomized, double-blind studies have been performed on patients undergoing various types of surgical procedures. A study in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery showed a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss and a study in patients undergoing lumbar fusion concluded that desmopressin was effective in reducing intraoperative blood loss. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of administration of desmopressin on intraoperative blood loss in patients undergoing FESS.</detailed_description>
