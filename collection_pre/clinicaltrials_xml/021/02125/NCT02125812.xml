	<brief_summary>The adjunctive use of systemically administered antibiotics has been shown to provide a better clinical outcome, particularly in terms of probing depth (PD) reduction and attachment-level gain than SRP in subjects with Aggressive Periodontitis. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of moxifloxacin as an adjunct to scaling and root planing versus scaling and root planing over placebo in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis.</brief_summary>
