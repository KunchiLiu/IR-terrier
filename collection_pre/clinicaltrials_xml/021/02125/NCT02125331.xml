	<brief_summary>This study is required to demonstrate that the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement algorithms on two commercially available multifunction hemodynamic acquisition modules, the Patient Data Module (PDM) equipped with the DINAMAP® SUPERSTAT algorithm ("PDM-SUPERSTAT") and the Patient Side Module (PSM) equipped with Datex-Ohmeda GE algorithm ("PSM-Datex-Ohmeda"), provide accurate NIBP measurements in accordance with the guidelines provided by the most recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 81060-2:2013. Notably, the new ISO 81060-2:2013 supersedes the previous 2009 version of this standard, and this study is being conducted in accordance with the most recent applicable standards. This study will assess neonate, infant, children, pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients as well as adults with chronic atrial fibrillation in a population that requires non-emergent heart catheterization. This is a study conducted to satisfy both standards for two NIBP devices and, as such, does not require a statistical hypothesis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects will be included that: 1. Are aged &gt;29 days requiring clinically indicated nonemergent heart catheterization OR aged ≤29 days with placed or scheduled placement of an indwelling femoral or umbilical arterial monitoring line; 2. Have an upper limb (right OR left side) that fits a cuff size of the device (circumference ranging 3 cm to 40 cm) OR have a thigh (right OR left side) that fits a cuff size of the device (circumference ranging 38 to 50 cm); 3. Are expected to be able to provide blood pressure measurements using both IBP and NIBP; 4. Are able and willing to provide written informed consent or have a legally authorized representative willing to provide written informed consent with assent from minor patients, as required by IRB policy. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects will be excluded that: 1. Have previously participated in this study (no subject may participate more than once). 2. Exhibit signs or symptoms or have a current diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease in upper AND/OR lower limbs; 3. Have current, uncontrolled circulatory shock; 4. Exhibit injuries, deformities, intravenous lines, or other abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator, may prevent proper cuff application or functioning; 5. For women of childbearing potential, are currently pregnant, suspected to be pregnant, or are currently lactating; 6. Have any condition that could interfere with the subjects ability to tolerate the procedure, including having a maximum of 4 fast flushes (adult, adolescent, or pediatric patients aged &gt;29 days) or 1 fast flush (neonates aged &lt;29 days); 7. If aged greater than 29 days but less than 12 years of age, have previously had any clinical or research procedure requiring general anesthesia in the last 3 month period; 8. If aged greater than 29 days but less than 12 years of age, are expected to require more than three (3) total hours of continuous general anesthesia for the scheduled procedure (including clinically necessary anesthesia and anticipated 25 minute extension for study purposes).</criteria>
