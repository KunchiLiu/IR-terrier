	<brief_summary>The objective is to study the cognitive functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) and patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to healthy controls. The cognitive functions are tested with and without oxygen therapy to clarify the effect of oxygen therapy. Driving simulations is used to test the cognitive functions. The hypothesis is that patients with chronic lung disease have decreased cognitive functions and that oxygen therapy will increase their cognitive functions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>COLD with forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) &lt;50%, without long term oxygen therapy COLD with FEV1 &lt;50%, with long term oxygen therapy ILD with diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 50%, without long term oxygen therapy comorbidity which decreases cognitive function comorbidity which decreases concentration physical comorbidity which makes it impossible to complete the test</criteria>
