	<criteria>Key Male and female patients aged ≥ 10 years Patients with transfusiondependent thalassemia and iron overload, requiring deferasirox DT at doses of ≥ 30 mg/kg/day as per the investigator's decision OR Patients with very low, low or intermediate (int) risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and iron overload, requiring deferasirox DT at doses of ≥ 20 mg/kg/day as per the investigator's decision. History of transfusion of at least 20 PRBC units and anticipated to be transfused with at least 8 units of PRBCs annually during the study Serum ferritin &gt; 1000 ng/mL, measured at screening Visit 1 and screening Visit 2 (the mean value will be used for eligibility criteria). Key Creatinine clearance below the contraindication limit in the locally approved prescribing information. Creatinine clearance will be estimated from serum creatinine at screening Visit 1 and screening Visit 2 and the mean value will be used for eligibility criteria. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 xULN at screening measured at screening Visit 1 and screening Visit 2 (the mean value will be used for eligibility criteria). ALT (SGPT) &gt; 5xULN, unless LIC confirmed as &gt;10 mg Fe/dw within 6 months prior to screening visit 1. Significant proteinuria as indicated by a urinary protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 mg/mg in a nonfirst void urine sample at screening Visit 1 or screening Visit 2. Patients with significant impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral deferasirox (e.g. ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection). Liver disease with severity of ChildPugh Class B or C</criteria>
