	<criteria>Summary 1. Male or female ≥18 years old. 2. A wide neck, intracranial, bifurcating or branch aneurysm with a neck ≥4 mm or a dometoneck ratio &lt;2, including nonde novo aneurysms where no stent was utilized. 3. Subject's aneurysm arises from a parent vessel with a diameter ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 4mm, measured by 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). 4. Subject responds to anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy according to the test used in each study center. 5. Subject is eligible to undergo a procedure with the use of contrast media. 6. Subject is willing to comply with protocol requirements and return to the treatment center for all required clinical evaluations and followup. 7. Subject has given written informed consent. 8. Life expectancy &gt; 12 months. Summary 1. Subject presents with ruptured aneurysm, unless rupture occurred 30 days or more prior to screening. 2. Subject is currently undergoing radiation therapy. 3. Subject has known allergies to nickeltitanium metal. 4. Subject has known allergies to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, or clopidogrel. 5. Subject has a lifethreatening allergy to contrast media (unless treatment for allergy can be tolerated). 6. Subject has a known cardiac disorder, likely to be associated with cardioembolic symptoms such as atrial fibrillation (AFIB). 7. Subject has any condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would place the subject at a high risk of embolic stroke. 8. Subject is currently participating in another clinical research study. 9. Subject has had a previous intracranial stenting procedure associated with the target aneurysm. 10. Subject is unable to complete the required followup. 11. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.(Females of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test and provide written proof that they are not pregnant prior to inclusion.) 12. Subject has participated in a drug study within the last 30 days. 13. Subject who cannot or is unwilling to take ASA/Clopidogrel for a minimum of at least 3 months following the procedure. 14. Extradural aneurysms.</criteria>
