	<brief_summary>This study is largely a qualitative study with a small survey component. The aim of the survey would be to gain a quantitative perspective of how women use NRT after this has been prescribed by stop smoking services (SSS). The aim of the qualitative study would be to enhance knowledge of pregnant smoker's views and attitudes about their experiences of using NRT and in particular to understand why pregnant women who start using NRT often discontinue this early or do not use the medication as it is prescribed. This information is important for a number of reasons; firstly it will help health professionals and researchers gain an in depth understanding about how women experience using NRT, which may be used to help devise strategies for encouraging better adherence and which could be used in future clinical trials to gain a clearer understanding as to whether or not NRT is effective in pregnancy.</brief_summary>
