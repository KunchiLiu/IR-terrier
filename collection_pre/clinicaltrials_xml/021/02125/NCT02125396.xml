	<brief_summary>Despite advances in our understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its diagnosis, the prognosis for patients with HCC remains disheartening, due to a high recurrence rate and frequent intrahepatic metastasis. Various therapies for use after hepatic resection have been reported, but they are associated with adverse side effects or they fail to improve overall survival. Nowadays, adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as the most effective therapy for postoperative HCC. And the indication is patients with risk factors of recurrence. While more and more prospective studies revealed that radiotherapy is effective for advanced HCC. And the side effects of radiotherapy are controlled. Until now, no prospective or retrospective study compared the efficacy of adjuvant TACE and radiotherapy for postoperative HCC.</brief_summary>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within seven days prior to the start of study drug. Both men and women enrolled in this trial must use adequate barrier birth control measures during the course of the trial. Excluded therapies and medications, previous and concomitant: Prior use of any systemic anticancer treatment for HCC, eg. chemotherapy, immunotherapy or hormonal therapy (except that hormonal therapy for supportive care is permitted). Antiviral treatment is allowed, however interferon therapy must be stopped at least 4 weeks prior randomization.
