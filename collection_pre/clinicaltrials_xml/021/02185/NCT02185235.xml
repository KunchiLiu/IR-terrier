	<brief_summary>Female pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) include urinary incontinence,pelvic organ prolapse (POP), and fecal incontinence—which often occur together. Pelvic floor disorders impair multiple aspects of the life quality, including the sexual function of women. Surgery became the first choice of treatment, however, and not until 1980s was the renewed interest in conservative therapies. This may be because of higher awareness among women and cost of and morbidity after surgery. The conservative treatment included pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, vaginal cones, and biofeedback. The outcome was up to 35~70 % improved rate as the literature before. Current guidelines recommended conservative management as a first-line therapy. However, there was no consistent consensus on this issue due to variations in stimulation parameters、adjuvant concurrent modality or duration of treatment course, and insufficient result about large and long term follow up of randomized- controlled studies. Therefore, the investigators try to conduct one randomized-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment for Pelvic floor disorder (Pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, chronic pelvic pain etc.). At the aspect of Quality of life, our studies tried to focus on the different domains of pelvic disorder and sexual quality by means of validated questionnaire more objectively.</brief_summary>
