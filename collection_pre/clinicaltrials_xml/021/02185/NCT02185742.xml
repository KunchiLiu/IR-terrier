	<brief_summary>Planning for SUCCESS (Sustained, Unbroken Connections to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) is a project to improve the connection to community care for HIV infected persons leaving Fulton County Jail or Atlanta City Detention Center in Atlanta. Hypothesis: Participants who receive the intervention will be more likely to link to medical care after jail release than similar participants who do not receive the intervention. Rationale and objective: This project aims to make sure HIV positive persons leaving jail maintain medical care. Case managers will use strength based case management and phone texting technology to improve release's connections to care in the community. This study will have extensive tracking of outcomes. The key outcome will be whether HIV infected participants receiving an intervention experience suppression of their viral load after release from jail . The investigators wish to demonstrate the ability to recruit participants into the SUCCESS intervention and repeatedly check community medical records to see how well their infection is being controlled after they linked to care. Investigators also want to conduct a survey at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. Investigators will compare the viral load of participants receiving the intervention to participants passing through the jail who do not receive the outcome.</brief_summary>
