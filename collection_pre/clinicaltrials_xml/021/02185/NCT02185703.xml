	<brief_title>Chordate System S020 Acute Migraine Clinical Investigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One single migraine attack will be treated either with the Chordate System S020 or with Chordate System in placebo mode. After a screening visit, up to 3 months before treatment, eligible subjects will be asked to return to the center at the onset of their next moderate to severe migraine attack. Subjects will be re-checked for eligibility, randomized and treated at the center (treatment visit). The subjects will record their response over the next 48 hours using a diary card. A follow-up visit will be scheduled 3 to 7 days after the treatment. In addition the subjects will be contacted within 24 to 48 hours after treatment initiation via a telephone contact to discuss their health including new or ongoing AEs.</detailed_description>
