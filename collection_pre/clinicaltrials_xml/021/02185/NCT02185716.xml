	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain is a significant cause of increased morbidity in the perioperative period, leading to patient discomfort and greater hospital length of stay. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy associated with significant postoperative pain, a substantial component of which is derived from abdominal wall incisions. Ultrasound-guided TAP block increasingly has been used for providing pain relief following abdominal surgeries. We designed this study with the hypothesis that, administering TAP block with levobupivacaine in laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides superior analgesic effects than port-side infiltration. In this randomized and double-blind study, 75 patients who are in American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I-II risk group, between the ages of 20-60, and who will undergo elective laporoscopic cholecystectomy operation under general anesthesia will be accepted. The patients will be divided into three groups and they will be given postoperative pain treatment with patient-controlled analgesia device. In hours of postoperative 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24,VAS I (superficial pain), VAS II (deep pain), postoperative total analgesic proportion, nausea, and vomiting will be recorded under evaluation Postoperative sedation score will be recorded (as conscious:0, asleep:1, deep sleep:2 ) in hours of postoperative 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24.</brief_summary>
