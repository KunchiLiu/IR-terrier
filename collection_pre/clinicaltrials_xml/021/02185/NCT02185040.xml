	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of CC-220 to Treat Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of 3 parts. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CC-220 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) subjects. Subject participation in Part 1 consists of 3 phases: - Pre-treatment Screening Phase: up to 28 days prior to the first dose of the investigational product (IP) - Treatment Phase: up to 84 days - Observation Phase: 84 day post-treatment A total of approximately 40 subjects will be randomized into 4 dose groups with a 4:1 ratio of CC-220 (0.3 mg every other day [QOD], 0.3 mg everyday [QD], 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days and 0.6 mg QD) or matching placebo (8 subjects in the CC-220 arm and 2 subjects in the placebo arm for each dose group). Subjects will be randomized into the first two dose groups of 0.3 mg QOD and 0.3 mg QD in parallel. Following confirmation of safety of the first two dose groups, remaining subjects will then be randomized into the 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days and 0.6 mg QD dose groups in a sequential, dose ascending manner (first the 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days dose group followed by the 0.6 mg QD dose group) A subject will only be permitted to reduce their dose one time during the study. The Treatment Phase will be up to 84 days in duration for all dose groups. Subjects who discontinue IP early and all subjects who complete the 84 day treatment phase will enter into the Observational Follow-up Phase for an 84 day period. In all cases of early termination from the study, subjects will be encouraged to complete an Early Termination Visit. Part 2 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CC-220 in SLE subjects with skin involvement. It will only be initiated once up to 8 subjects have completed 28 days of treatment in the 0.6 mg QD dose group for Part 1 and the 28 day safety assessment of the 0.6 mg QD dose group in Part 1 is completed. Subject participation in Part 2 will consist of 3 phases: - Pre-treatment Screening Phase: up to 28 days prior to the start of the IP - Treatment Phase: Up to 84 days - Observation Phase: 84 day post-treatment Up to a total of approximately 100 subjects will be randomized into 4 dose groups of CC-220 (0.3 mg QOD, 0.3 mg QD, 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days and 0.6 mg QD) or matching placebo (20 subjects in each CC-220 dosing arm and 20 subjects in the placebo arm). The dose groups included in Part 2 will be dependent on results from Part 1. Any dose group which does not demonstrate adequate safety, tolerability, PK or PD may not be used in Part 2. The Treatment Phase for Part 2 will be up to 84 days in duration. Subjects who discontinue IP early and all subjects who complete the 84- day Treatment Phase will enter into the Observational Follow-up Phase for a 84-day period. In all cases of early termination from the study, subjects will be encouraged to complete an Early Termination Visit. Upon completion of, or discontinuation from the Treatment Phase for Part 1 or Part 2, all subjects (including premature discontinuations) will be have visits 28 days and 84 days after their final treatment visit during the 84 day Observational Follow-up Phase. The Active Treatment Extension Phase (ATEP) is an extension of the core CC-220-SLE-001 study to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety/tolerability of CC-220 in SLE subjects who completed Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study. Subjects who complete the Treatment Phase of Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study will be eligible to receive CC-220 in the ATEP for up to 2 years. All subjects who participate in the ATEP will receive the same active treatment they received during their participation in Part 1 or Part 2 with the exception of those on placebo or 0.3 mg every other day (QOD) (see below for information on dosing for these subjects). Subjects who complete the Treatment Phase of Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study will be eligible to enter this phase of the study and should be enrolled immediately to avoid dose interruption. In the event the ATEP has not been implemented by a subject's study center at the time they have completed the Treatment Phase, subjects will enter the Observation Phase of the core study and be eligible to enroll in the ATEP upon implementation of this amendment. There are no time restrictions on how long subjects can be off CC-220 prior to entering the ATEP as long as they completed treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study. Subjects who terminate the Treatment Phase of Part 1 or Part 2 early will not be eligible for entry into the ATEP. Subject participation consists of two phases: - Active Treatment Extension Phase: Up to 2 years - Observational Follow-up Phase: One month</detailed_description>
