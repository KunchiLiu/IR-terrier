	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a major cause of death in intensive care units. Despite the investigators improved understanding, which has reduced the risk of dying with sepsis, the number of people who die each year continues to increase due to an overall increase in the number of cases.In our previous study, the investigators have showed that 100% oxygen or 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane/sevoflurane in 60% oxygen protect mouse macrophage cell line against in-vitro sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, the investigator hypothesized that treatment of 100% oxygen or 0.5 MAC isoflurane/sevoflurane in 60% oxygen protected against clinical in-vitro models of sepsis induced by LPS or plasma from septic patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>100% oxygen or 0.5 MAC isoflurane/sevoflurane in 60% oxygen would inhibit increases of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 in the cell culture supernatant after stimulation of LPS or plasma from septic patients, and also inhibit the nuclear location of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 subunit.</detailed_description>
