	<brief_title>Evaluation of Environmental Emissions From Electronic Cigarettes and Tobacco-Burning Cigarettes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondhand smoke is the aged and diluted combination of smoke exhaled by a smoker and sidestream smoke (smoke from the lit end of a cigarette). Electronic cigarettes are different from tobacco-burning cigarettes in that they produce vapor, not smoke. For consistency with common usage, secondhand smoke (SHS) refers to true secondhand smoke from cigarettes and secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes. The goals of this study are to 1) increase understanding of the composition of SHS from e-cigarettes, 2) quantitatively compare the amount of SHS generated by e-cigarettes and a market sample of commercial e-cigarettes to leading brand styles of commercial tobacco-burning cigarettes, and 3) quantitate the emission factors of e-cigarettes including the market-sample e-cigarettes.</detailed_description>

Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use a form of contraception acceptable to the Investigator from the time of signing informed consent until study discharge or be surgically sterile for at least 90 days prior to enrollment; 5. Able to safely perform the required study procedures, as determined by the Investigator. 1. Clinically significant or unstable/uncontrolled acute or chronic medical conditions at Screening, as determined by the Investigator, that would preclude a participant from participating safely in the study (e.g., hypertension, asthma, or other lung disease; cardiac disease; neurological disease; or psychiatric disorders) based on screening assessments such as safety labs and medical history or physical examination at Enrollment; 2. Selfreports or safety labs indicate diabetes; 3. At risk for heart disease, as determined by the Investigator; 4. Use of medicine for treatment of depression or asthma; 5. Systolic blood pressure of ≥150 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of ≥95 mmHg, measured after being seated for 5 minutes; 6. Postponing a decision to quit smoking (defined as planning a quit attempt within 30 days of the Screening Visit) to participate in this study; 7. Employed by a tobacco company, the study site, or environmental test chamber vendor; 8. Females who have a positive pregnancy test, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to become pregnant during the course of the study; 9. History of claustrophobia; 10. Regularly exposed to solvent fumes or gasoline (e.g., painter, gasstation mini mart employee); 11. Determined by the Investigator to be inappropriate for this study, including a participant who is unable to communicate or unwilling to cooperate with the clinical staff.</criteria>
