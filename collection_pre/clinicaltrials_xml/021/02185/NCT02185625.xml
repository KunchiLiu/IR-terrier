	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of the Safe Delivery smartphone application by midwives can reduce excess blood loss from bleeding, and infant death during childbirth in Ghanaian women. Moreover, it will be investigated whether the Safe Delivery application can increase midwives' knowledge and skills in managing childbirth. Fifteen hospitals in Greater Accra, Ghana, will be cluster randomized to either use the Safe Delivery application (intervention), or to no intervention (control). In the intervention hospitals, midwives will be educated in the use of Safe Delivery. Pregnant women will be enrolled at delivery and followed until 7 days postpartum. Data collection will begin July 2014 and is expected to be finished by October 2014.</brief_summary>
