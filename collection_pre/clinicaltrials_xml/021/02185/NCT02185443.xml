	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II study to determine the efficacy of SBRT to treat liver metastases in patients with Colorectal Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma of the Anal Canal and Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors that are not amenable to surgery. Patients should have no evidence of extra-hepatic disease or have disease that is planned to be treated with curative intent. Therefore, SBRT is being considered as a potentially curative procedure.</brief_summary>
