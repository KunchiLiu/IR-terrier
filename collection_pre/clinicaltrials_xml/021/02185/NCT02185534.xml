	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, randomised, three-way crossover study in healthy male and female subjects, performed at a single centre. The objective of the study is to assess the bioequivalence between one test formulation (Clopidogrel 75 mg tablet (commercial blister from KRKA) and two reference formulations (Clopidogrel 75 mg tablet [Plavix, sourced in US and Japan]).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture. Females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on each admission to the clinical unit, must not be lactating and if of non childbearing potential, confirmed at screening by fulfilling one of the following criteria: Postmenopausal defined as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range. Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation. if of childbearing potential and are sexually active must use, with their partner, 2 approved methods of highly effective contraception from the time of IMP administration until 3 months after the last dose of IMP. Have a body mass index between 18,5 and 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive. Be able to understand, read and speak the German language. Exclusion criteria History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the potential subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the potential subject's ability to participate in the study. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous 3 months. History of haemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, lupus anticoagulant, or other diseases/syndromes that can either alter or increase the propensity for bleeding. A personal history of vascular abnormalities including aneurysms; a personal history of severe haemorrhage, haematemesis, melena, haemoptysis, severe epistaxis, severe thrombocytopenia, intracranial haemorrhage; or rectal bleeding within 1 year prior to screening; or history suggestive of peptic ulcer disease; or at the discretion of the Investigator. Use of aspirin, ibuprofen, NSAIDS, or any other drug known to increase the propensity for bleeding for 2 weeks before randomisation.</criteria>
