	<brief_summary>MEK162 has shown significant inhibition of tumor growth as a single agent in NSCLC xenograft models in mice and human cancer cells in vitro, which have KRAS and/or other mutations. These data suggest that MEK162 may provide a potential benefit in cancer indications harboring these mutations. MEK162 is currently being investigated in phase I clinical testing and has been well tolerated up to an MTD of 45mg BID in cancer patients. There has been little change in survival benefit for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in recent years. Emerging new treatment options relying on molecular and genetic markers are being studied extensively. Thus, there has been a shift to manage non-small cell lung cancer with molecular targeted therapies in combination with standard chemotherapy. This study will be targeting patients with KRAS mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/Ib Study of MEK162, a MEK Inhibitor, in Combination With Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in Patients With Non-squamous Carcinoma of the Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES 1.1 Primary Objectives - To assess the safety of MEK162 administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed as first line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). - To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MEK162 to be used when given in a continuous dosing schedule together with pemetrexed and carboplatin administered on a 3-weekly schedule as first line treatment in advanced NSCLC. - To explore the efficacy (as measured by tumor response in the Phase Ib portion) of the combination of MEK162 in addition to pemetrexed and carboplatin in treatment-naïve patients with EGFR wild-type, ALK-rearrangement negative NSCLC of the lung. 1.2 Secondary Objectives - To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of MEK162 administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Phase I). - To explore relationships between KRAS mutation (and sub-types) and additional genomic mutations and objective clinical response. 1.3 Trial End-points Primary Phase I • Development of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), (defined in section 4.3) as measured with NCI CTC AE v4. Phase Ib • Objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST v1.1. Secondary Phase I • Adverse events, serious adverse events, changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs, ECGs. Phase Ib - Evaluation of response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate (DCR) for patients with and without KRAS mutation in tumor tissue. - Exploratory analysis of KRAS mutation sub-type. Exploratory end-points • A limited sampling strategy pharmacokinetic model will be used to ensure that the clearance of MEK162 is not influenced by the concurrent administration of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible for enrolment on the study must meet all of the following criteria: Patients with histologically confirmed nonsquamous EGFR wildtype, ALKrearrangement negative carcinoma of lung. Patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed small and nonsmall cell carcinoma or squamous carcinoma are not eligible. Tissue available for KRAS mutation status analysis. Patients must have metastatic disease (Incurable stage IIIB/stage IV). Patients must have clinically and/or radiographically documented measurable disease. At least one site of disease must be unidimensionally measurable by RECIST v1.1 as follows (Eisenhauer et al.): CTscan, physical exam ≥10 mm Chest Xray ≥20 mm Lymph node short axis ≥15 mm All radiology studies must be performed within 28 days prior to registration (35 days if negative). Lesions in previously irradiated areas should not be selected unless there is clear evidence of progression in such lesions. Patients may not have received any prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Patients who have received adjuvant treatment or chemoradiation for stage III disease should have completed this ≥12 months prior to study enrollment. Patients with stable CNS metastases are permitted if stability of disease is documented with imaging ≥28 days after treatment completion, are and off corticosteroids by day 1 of study treatment. Patients may have had prior malignancy if definitively treated and/or, in the opinion of the investigator, the only active malignancy is NSCLC. Patients with mixed small cell lung cancer histology are excluded. Patients who have received radiotherapy to &gt;30% bone marrow are excluded. Consult PI if unsure whether second malignancies meet requirements specified above. In patients treated for other malignancy, all prior treatmentrelated toxicities must be CTCAE v4.0 ≤ Grade 1 (except alopecia) at the time of enrollment. Able to swallow and retain oral medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels. Patients receiving medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2, CYP2A19, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and/or UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 are eligible but these drugs must be used with caution (Appendix C). Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequentlyupdated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; Patients must be aged ≥18 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 Adequate organ and laboratory parameters, defined below. Laboratory Requirements within 7 days prior to enrollment: Haematology: absolute granulocytes ≥1.5 × 109/L platelets ≥100 × 109/L Biochemistry: bilirubin ≤1.25 × institutional upper limit of normal AST(SGOT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal /ALT(SGPT) or ≤5 × institutional upper limit of normal in the presence of liver metastases creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Patients must be able to provide Informed Consent based on the details below: absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. History or current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR): History of RVO or CSR, or predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled systemic disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes).
