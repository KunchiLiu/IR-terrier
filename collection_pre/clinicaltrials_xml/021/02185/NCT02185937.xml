	<brief_summary>The most common sites for GIST to occur are the stomach (60-70%) and proximal small intestines (20-25%). Therefore patients with GIST often have altered GI-tract due to tumor resection or palliative surgery which might affect imatinib exposure. Indeed, Yoo et al. showed that steady state imatinib trough levels in patients with advanced GISTs after major gastrectomy are lower compared to patients with a previous wedge resection or without gastric surgery. Patients that underwent major gastrectomy had an average imatinib plasma trough levels below 1000 µg/L. This while imatinib trough levels above 1000 µg/L are correlated to more beneficial treatment out-comes (longer Progression Free Survival). Since imatinib easily and rapidly dissolves at pH 5.5 or less, a lack of gastric acid secretion might be causing the decreased exposure in the patients that underwent major gastrectomy. Therefore the investigators would like to study if the exposure to imatinib in patients after major gastrectomy can be improved by creating a more acidic environment for absorption through combining imatinib intake with Coca-Cola.</brief_summary>
