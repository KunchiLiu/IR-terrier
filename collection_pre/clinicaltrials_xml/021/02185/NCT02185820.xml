	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Carfilzomib, Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed And/Or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients (CPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TREATMENT PERIOD Patients will start the salvage treatment with CPd, as soon as the screening visits of the pre-treatment period have been terminated. Patients will receive 8 CPd cycles. PHASE I In the phase I part of the study, the following dose levels of pomalidomide will be studied with a constant dose of dexamethasone and carfilzomib: Level -1 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only followed by 27 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 27 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28). Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days. Level 0 (starting dose) Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only followed by 36 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 36 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28). Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days. Level +1 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only followed by 45 mg/ m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 45 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28). Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days. Level +2 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only followed by 56 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 56 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28). Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days. Patients will be observed during the first cycle of therapy for the assessment of side effects and observation of DLTs. Dose escalation will proceed as follows: 3 patients will be entered at dose level 0. If none of the 3 experience DLT, dose escalation will continue. If one of three patients experience DLT, three additional patients will be added to this cohort (max 6). If two of three patients experience a DLT at any given dose, the MTD will have been exceeded and the MTD will be the preceding dose at which &lt; one of 6 patients experienced a DLT. If no further patients experience DLT (1 of 6) dose escalation will continue. If 2 patients experience DLT (2 of 6) the MTD will have been exceeded and the MTD will be the previous dose at which &lt;1 patient of 6 experienced DLT. The phase I of the study will end once the MTD has been defined. PHASE II The phase II of the study will start after the MTD has been defined in the phase I of the study. The dose used to treat patients in the phase II will be the MTD defined in the phase I of the study. In the second part of the study, the MTD of the association CPd (or in absence of any MTD observed) the doses of dose level 3 (maximum per protocol dose) will be administered to a total of 45 consecutive patients in order to assess response rate and clinical efficacy. THE PHASE 2 OF THE STUDY WILL START ONLY AFTER THE ANALYSIS OF THE PHASE 1 RESULTS AND THE RELEVANT STUDY REPORT. MANTEINANCE PERIOD At the end of 8 courses, maintenance phase will start. Patients will receive: Carfilzomib = at the MTD achieved in the phase I of the study on days 1, 8, 15 in 28-days cycles. Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22. Patients will be stopped at PD or intolerance. For the maintenance period a continuous assessment of the toxicity and tolerability profile of the CPd combination could permit to the Investigators to continue the treatment using Pomalidomide or Carfilzomib alone according to the dose modification plan.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02. Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Female patient is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Patients who are primary refractory or relapsed/refractory to Lenalidomide. Subjects must have been received at least 2 consecutive cycles of a prior treatment that include Lenalidomide alone or in combination. Subject must be primary refractory or relapsed/refractory to Lenalidomide, defined as: 1) never achieved any response better than progressive disease (PD) to any Lenalidomidecontaining regimen; 2) documented disease progression during or within 60 days of completing their last myeloma Lenalidomidecontaining regimen. Both relapsed and/or refractory to Bortezomib and naive to Bortezomib patients can be enrolled. Patient has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, ≥ 0.5 g/dL of Mprotein) and, where applicable, urine lightchain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours.

We anticipate that less than 10% of patients admitted to this study will be oligo or nonsecretory MM with free light chains only in order to maximize interpretation of benefit results.

Subject with pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis or ascites requiring paracentesis within 14 days prior to baseline. Any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed consent.
