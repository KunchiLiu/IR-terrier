	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is divided in 4 different steps: - the first step has two different purpose: assess the impact of the storage medium of fresh prostatic chips on fluorescence signal and adjust the entire chain (immunolabelling,counter-stain and imaging), - the second step is the adaptation of immunolabelling protocol on histopathology slides, using fresh prostatic tissue, - the third step is to validate the use of: 1. the medical device created by the FEMTO-ST institute use for the detection of fluorescence signal on fresh tissue, 2. the Light-CT scanner use for tissue structural observation. - the four step is to check the preservation of morphological structure of tissue under the effect of laser excitation from the medical device.</brief_summary>
