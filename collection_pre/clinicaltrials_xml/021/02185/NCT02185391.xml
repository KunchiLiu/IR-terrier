	<brief_summary>Coronary Heart Diseases are responsible for a high number of deaths in Germany. To determine the risk factors secondary prevention is of great importance. After their residence in rehabilitation centers patients often get rid of newly required skills. In addition to that parameters like BMI, blood pressure and cholesterol level return to their initial value. Using an Audience Response System (ARS) during oral presentations in rehabilitation centers should improve the learning effect of patients. Furthermore patients will receive motivating telephone calls in the follow-up. These methods should lead to a sustainable improvement of learning effects, health care behavior and quality of life.</brief_summary>
