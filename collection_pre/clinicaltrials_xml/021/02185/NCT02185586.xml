	<brief_summary>We have designed a new method which could be used in laparoscopic cholecy- stectomy.Account to this new method, the three incisions are all located on the lower abdominal, theoretically it could get more beautiful outlook and less stress response than traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy(two of the three incisions located on upper abdomen) or single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy(one large incision located on umbilicus). We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare those there methods of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in order to find out if there will be some advantages of this new method,such as in lowering the stress response,reducing impact on respiration, relieving post-operation pain and improving appearance.</brief_summary>
