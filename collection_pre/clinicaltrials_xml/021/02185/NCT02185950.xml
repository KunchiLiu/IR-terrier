	<brief_summary>Burning produces changes in the biomechanical properties of the skin causing limitation of movement. The increase in skin suppleness is very important in the rehabilitation process, since its increase makes therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing the range of motion, thus improving functional pattern. Will be evaluated 60 volunteers of both sexes aged 20-80 years seen at the Burns Unit of the Clinical Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto. There will be a traditional physical therapy evaluation as well as evaluation of the specific characteristics of the burn and scar. The temperature of the region will be assessed by thermography, and biophysical parameters and biomechanical skin evaluated by Cutometer and their accessory probes (mexameter, reviscometer, sebometer) before, immediately after and 10, 20 and 30 minutes of application of therapeutic resources. Volunteers will undergo continuous application of ultrasound with 3 MHz and intensity of 1 W/cm2 in the region due to scar deep second degree burn or third degree, and the application time of 2 minutes for each effective radiation area of the head (ERA) in a predetermined region of 9X5 cm a total of 4 minutes of application, therapy paraffin 20 minutes and 4 minutes endermology negative pressure between 100 and 200mmHg, in a continuous mode with glass head (1.5cm in diameter .) Applications will be set by random draw (design crusader cross-over) with an interval of 7 days between applications (wash-out). The data will be submitted to analysis of normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the behavior of the effect between groups and pre-and post-intervention will be evaluated by two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc (Bonferroni) or Friedman, p &lt;0.05</brief_summary>
