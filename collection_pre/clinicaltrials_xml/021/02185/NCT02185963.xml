	<brief_summary>The patients who have achieved LDL-C levels below the currently recommended targets may still experience cardiovascular events. To reduce further the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), raising HDL-C and lowering TG may be the secondary therapeutic target. However, increased HDL-C levels do not mean increase in functional HDL-C. It also remains controversial whether functional HDL is more important than total circulating levels of HDL-C in reducing CHD. Actually, the increased concentration of HDL alone might be ineffective indicating that qualitative changes in HDL levels in response to drug interventions are required to result in clinical benefit. The investigators set up a clinical trial investigating effect of (rosuva)statin treatment on functional HDL-C levels particularly in Asian populations, who have relatively low HDL-C.</brief_summary>
