	<brief_summary>Imaging procedures including chest X-ray and low-dose computed tomography may be effective in lung cancer early detection. Yet it is unknown whether low-dose computed tomography combined with computer aided detection （CAD) is more effective than LDCT in screening of early lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening for Early Lung Cancer in Shanghai, China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomized clinical trial is to investigate and compare the effectiveness of CAD-guided low-dose computed tomography and low-dose computed tomography in lung cancer screening for community individuals in Shanghai, China. Thus, an imaging protocol which can detect early lung cancer in asymptomatic high risk patients will be proposed.</detailed_description>
