	<brief_summary>This is a 3 to 4 months, multi-site, prospective randomized clinical study of patients diagnosed with a chronic wound. The primary objective is to assess changes in healing rate, by measuring differences in wound area when treating chronic wounds with the Next Science Wound Gel compared to the Triple Antibiotic Ointment Neosporin (Standard of Care, SOC). At the end of the study period, patients may continue receiving their assigned study treatment provided they have signed the "Continuation of Treatment Informed Consent" and the rational for continuation is documented by the investigator.</brief_summary>
