	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, multicenter study involving patients with chronic HCV infection who had a liver transplantation; developed HCV-related liver fibrosis and/or incomplete cirrhosis; achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) following anti-HCV therapy; but still have fibrosis and/or incomplete cirrhosis on liver biopsy to see if treatment with IDN-6556 is better than placebo in reversing or stopping the progression of the damage to the new liver caused by HCV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of IDN-6556 in Post Orthotopic Liver Transplant for Chronic HCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are data to suggest that with eradication of the HCV virus, improvements in liver fibrosis can be seen in the post-transplant population. However, amelioration of inflammatory activity, and deceleration of fibrosis progression is a gradual process over the course of many years. This placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the effects of IDN-6556, compared to placebo, on markers of apoptosis and inflammation, and liver histology.</detailed_description>
