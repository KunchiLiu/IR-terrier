	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, dose-finding, multicenter study of intravesical BCG plus ALT-803 in Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QUILT-2.005: A Study of Intravesical BCG in Combination With ALT-803 in Patients With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ALT-803 and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) level of ALT-803 combined with BCG in patients who have nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. The anti-tumor activity of BCG+ALT-803 will also be assessed. In addition, the study will characterize the molecular, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile of BCG+ALT-803. The study includes a dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) and an expansion phase (Phase II). The dose escalation phase is concluded when the MTD is determined. A dose level (RD) will be designated for the phase II study. For the noncomparative randomized phase II, patients will be randomized to two treatment arms: either ALT-803 at the RD level in combination with BCG (50 mg) or BCG (50 mg) alone.</detailed_description>
