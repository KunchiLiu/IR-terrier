	<brief_title>Long-term Effects of Intensive Insulin Treatment in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Stockholm Diabetes Intervention Study (SDIS) aimed to determine whether intensified insulin treatment were feasible and led to less serious diabetic complications. 102 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus were randomized (October 1982 to March 1984) to intensified conventional treatment (ICT; n=48) or standard treatment (ST; n=54). The randomized SDIS study lasted for 7.5 years, whereas 96 patients were fully evaluated. Thereafter patients were assigned to their regular clinical visits. In the present interventional study we wanted to study all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes (i.e. myocardial infarction and stroke), and renal failure in the SDIS cohort until december 31 2011.</detailed_description>
