	<brief_summary>Primary hypothesis: A large reduction in weight is not associated with a change in accurately measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (51Chromium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma clearance (51Cr-EDTA)). Secondary hypothesis: A large reduction in weight is associated with a greater change in estimated GFR (The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-formula)) than in accurately measured GFR. Other formulas for estimated GFR (Cockcroft Gault, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), CKD-EPI with cystatin C) are better correlated with accurately measured GFR.</brief_summary>
