	<brief_summary>Development of neuropathic pain is one of the most disabling sequels after spinal cord injury (SCI) and in peripheral nerve diseases. The functionality of the pain pathway in humans as well as its plastic changes following SCI can be assessed in vivo by surface electrophysiological recordings and functional magnetic resonance imaging after noxious heat stimulation of the skin. Aims: a) establishing a clinically applicable assessment of the pain pathway and characterizing its changes as a consequence of SCI and in peripheral nerve diseases in an objective manner, b) characterizing plastic changes in the pain pathway in SCI patients with neuropathic pain and in patients with peripheral nerve diseases and relating them to the development of neuropathic pain syndromes.</brief_summary>
