	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well thyroid gland removal with or without central lymph node dissection works in treating patients with thyroid cancer or suspected thyroid cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes. Currently, the standard treatment for thyroid cancer is total thyroidectomy, or complete removal of the thyroid. Sometimes, the lymph nodes in the central part of the neck may also be surgically removed, called central lymph node dissection. Prophylactic removal of the lymph nodes may increase the risk of life-threatening complications, and may reduce post-surgery quality of life. It may also prevent the cancer from returning and reduce the need for additional surgery. It is not yet known whether recurrence rates and complication levels are lower after thyroid gland removal alone or with central lymph node dissection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thyroid Gland Removal With or Without Central Lymph Node Dissection in Treating Patients With Node Negative Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the rate of transient hypoparathyroidism as defined by a day 1 serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of &lt;10 pg/ml SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the rate transient and permanent hypocalcemia II. To determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems. III. To determine the degree to which quality of life (QOL) is compromised. IV. To determine clinical recurrence rates. V. To determine the degree to which accurate quality of life measures can be extracted from patient interview narratives using natural language processing techniques. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy alone. ARM II: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic central neck dissection (CND). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 1, 2 and 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
