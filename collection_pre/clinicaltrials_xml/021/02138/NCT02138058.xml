	<brief_title>Topiramate Trial for Compulsive Buying</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compulsive buying is a prevalent disorder with no approved pharmacological treatment. Previous reports suggest that topiramate could be useful in reducing impulsivity in pathological gambling and other impulse control disorders, as well as craving in substance addictions. The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of topiramate combined with brief cognitive restructuring in treating compulsive buying, compared with just cognitive restructuring treatment+placebo.</detailed_description>
