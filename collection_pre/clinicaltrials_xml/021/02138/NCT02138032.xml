	<brief_summary>Message framing involves "the presentation of choice alternatives, either in a positive or negative manner" (Huber, Neale, &amp; Northcraft, 1987; p.137). Positively framed health messages contain potential gains of participating/refraining in specific health behaviour. Alternatively, negatively framed health messages contain potential losses of participating/refraining in specific health behaviour (Verlhiac, Chappe, &amp; Meyer, 2011). The primary aim and rationale of this study will be to investigate which type of framing has the greatest effect on intentions to quit smoking in patients with vascular arterial disease. The secondary aim is to investigate what other factors may have an effect on intention to quit and also what factors play a part in a patient's intention to quit smoking.</brief_summary>
