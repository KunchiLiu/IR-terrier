	<brief_summary>The 1.2 million households living in public housing are disproportionately affected by obesity, where prevalence is estimated at 50%. An ecologic framework hypothesizes that this disparity is related, in part, to social and environmental factors within these neighborhoods that influence residents' lifestyles. Social networks and the built environment may work together to promote or inhibit lifestyle behaviors; however, combined social network-built environment interventions have not previously targeted changes in diet. We hypothesize that an intervention that combines a social network approach with strategies that address public housing residents' challenges related to the built environment will improve dietary habits. Our overall aim is to develop a combined social network-built environment intervention to reduce intake of beverages high in added sugars and to pilot test the intervention among residents of public housing developments in Baltimore, MD. Our aim for this work is: 1) To develop a combined social network-built environment intervention to reduce intake of beverages high in added sugars and to pilot test the intervention among residents of public housing developments in Baltimore, MD. We hypothesize that a social network intervention will be feasible and acceptable in promoting healthy lifestyle change, and that this intervention will alter lifestyle behaviors among public housing residents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sugar Champ: Pilot Social Network Intervention to Reduce Intake of Sugary Drinks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will conduct a 6-month non-randomized trial of the social network intervention described below. This will be a single arm trial in which we compare the outcomes of interest pre- and post- intervention. We will adapt an HIV risk reduction social network intervention to create a new social network intervention targeting reduction in intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). Our primary outcomes will be to test the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and its components as well as estimate the likely effect of the intervention. In the intervention, individuals will be recruited and trained to be "Peer Educators" who will participate in group sessions and then communicate this information with members of their social network ("Sidekick") and work to make changes to reduce intake of added sugars together. Given the frequent intake of SSB in this population, the intervention will focus on reducing added sugar intake through the reduced consumption of SSB. Peer Educators will participate in 6 core group sessions over a 6-week period as well as 3 additional booster sessions after completing the core curriculum. All sessions will be delivered by a facilitator and assistant facilitator using a guide. All groups will be held in a room in each public housing development's administrative building.</detailed_description>
