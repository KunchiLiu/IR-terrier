	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Herbal-Based De-Pigmenting System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study is being conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of a de-pigmenting regimen when used by subjects with mild to severe mottled hyperpigmentation and melasma. Efficacy will be assessed using visual grading, device measurements and digital photography. Tolerance and safety will be evaluated by grading for objective and subjective signs of irritation, and the incidence and severity of adverse events. Efficacy and tolerance of this product are compared to that of Hydroquinone, which is applied to one side of the subject's face while the herbal de-pigmenting regimen is applied to the other side of the face. The two product pigmentation reducing herbal regimen is based on the novel concept of inhibiting all 14 major and the 3 branch steps in the melanin cascade.</detailed_description>
