	<brief_summary>The exact innervation of the bladder and the changes after a spinal cord injury have been not yet been illustrated. Diffusion tensor imaging with magnetic resonance imaging is a new technique which can be used to visualize single nerve fibers, and thus represent the neural supply of a region in vivo. There are studies in which both the sacral plexus and the lumbar nerve roots have been represented using diffusion tensor imaging. However, there is no study concerning the innervation of the bladder. The investigators are therefore using diffusion tensor imaging with magnetic resonance imaging to represent the bladder innervation of individuals with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and individuals with normal bladder function.</brief_summary>
