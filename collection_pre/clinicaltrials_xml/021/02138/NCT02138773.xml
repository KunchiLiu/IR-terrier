	<brief_title>A Study to Compare How Tamsulosin is Absorbed to the Body After Administration of Two Types of Tamsulosin Formulation Under Fed and Fasted Conditions in Chinese Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be two studies. One study will be conducted under fed condition, and the other study will be conducted under fasted condition. Each study is a single center, randomized, single dose, open-labeled, cross-over study. Study 1 will be conducted under fed condition: Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine their eligibility within 7 days prior to the study enrollment. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility in the evening prior to dosing for each period. All subjects will receive tamsulosin formulation-A and formulation-B in one of two randomly assigned treatment sequences at 0.5h after the start of a standard breakfast. There will be a 7-day washout period between each dose. Study 2 will be under fasted condition: A single oral dose of tamsulosin formulation-A or formulation-B will be given to subjects under fasted condition (fasting for at least 10 hours since 20:00PM the night before the administration). Blood will be sampled at the same time point as in Study 1. Also, safety evaluation will be performed at the same selected times throughout the study as in Study 1.</detailed_description>
