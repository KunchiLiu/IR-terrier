	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to look at the impact of using the Peanut Labor Ball (PLB) after epidural anesthesia in patients who have never given birth. The study will measure the impact on the length of labor, cesarean section rate, operative vaginal delivery rate (vacuum or forceps use), and third or fourth degree laceration rates. This study will determine the impact of PLB use by comparing two cohorts of nulliparous patients: one with the PLB use and one with traditional wedge and pillow positioning. If benefits related to use of the PLB can be demonstrated, it is our intention that each labor room will be stocked with a PBL for use as standard of care. This study will test the following hypotheses: 1. The Peanut Labor Ball (PLB) will impact the cesarean section and operative vaginal delivery rate in low risk nulliparous patients who receive epidural anesthesia compared to similar cohort using traditional wedge and pillow positioning. 2. Using the PLB will impact the amount of time from epidural placement to complete dilation and the time of second stage of labor, when compared with the control cohort. 3. Use of the PLB will impact the third and fourth degree laceration rates when compared with the control cohort.</brief_summary>
