	<brief_summary>Stretching and flexibility exercise such as yoga and functional resistance exercise are two forms of exercise that are growing in popularity. However, they have not been scientifically tested to demonstrate their ability to improve body composition, fitness, heart and metabolic health, and mood state in overweight/obese women. The investigators hypothesize that during an 11 week intervention, both forms of exercise will improve body composition, heart and metabolic health and mood state.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study was a 11 week protein-rich whole food diet and exercise training intervention in middle aged overweight/obese women. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Protein-rich whole food only consumed as 20-25 grams per serving 4-6 per day (P); protein and resistance exercise training (R); and protein and stretching/yoga exercise training (S). All outcomes, including the primary outcomes of body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers were measured at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 12) in all study subjects.</detailed_description>
