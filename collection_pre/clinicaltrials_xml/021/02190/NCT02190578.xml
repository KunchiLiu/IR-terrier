	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of an improved rapid diagnostic test using venous whole blood and fingerstick whole blood. The clinical performance of Reveal G4 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test will be determined by comparing the results with patient infected status for HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1). The study will consist of a single one-hour visit, at which time blood samples will be collected and tested with the investigational device (Reveal G4) and FDA approved comparator assays for detection of HIV-1 antibodies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of Reveal G4 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is a multi-center study to assess the performance characteristics of a rapid in vitro diagnostic assay, the Reveal G4 Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test (Reveal G4). Specifically, the objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Reveal G4 in finger stick and venous whole blood, relative to FDA approved reference assays for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies. Approximately 1500-2000 subjects in total will be enrolled in the study across all sites, into three different study populations. Population 1 will be comprised of at least 500 subjects from a population at risk of infection with HIV. Population 2 will be comprised of at least 500 subjects that are known HIV positive individuals. Population 3 will be comprised of at least 500 subjects from a population at low risk of HIV infection. Reveal G4 will be used to test fingerstick whole blood and venous whole blood samples from all study subjects. For enrolled subjects in Populations 1 and 3, who are of unknown HIV antibody status, a plasma sample prepared from the venous whole blood sample will also be tested with an algorithm of FDA-approved assays for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies. For Population 2 subjects who are known HIV-positive individuals, results of previous HIV tests will be obtained from the subjects' medical records. The sensitivity and specificity of Reveal G4 will be determined in fingerstick and venous whole blood relative to HIV-1 antibody status as determined by an algorithm of FDA-approved assays. The primary analysis will involve comparison of Reveal G4 results for anti-HIV-1 in each sample matrix (fingerstick whole blood and venous whole blood) with the subject's HIV-1 antibody status as determined by FDA-approved assays. Based on the above, the sensitivity and specificity of Reveal G4 will be determined with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals for both fingerstick and venous whole blood.</detailed_description>
