	<brief_title>Impact of Early Respiratory Rehabilitation in the Exacerbations of Re-admitted COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open clinical trial with 1 year follow up comparing the impact of an Early Respiratory Rehabilitation (ERR) program with the conventional Respiratory Rehabilitation (CRR) in COPD re-admitted patients. Outcomes will be exacerbations, symptoms, functional capacity and quality of life related to health (HRQOL). Sixty patients will be randomized into the two groups: ERR starts the program during admission and continues at home immediately after discharge for a period of 3 months; CRR was started at home one month after discharge from hospital and continues for 3 months. Recruitment of patients and starting the RR program will occur in the first year. In the second year we will continue the intervention to those who have not completed the year. Follow-up will last until the completion of the year of all patients.</detailed_description>
