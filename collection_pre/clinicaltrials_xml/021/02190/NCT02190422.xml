	<brief_summary>Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has extensively allowed pregnancy for infertile couples. However, the long-term effect of ART exposure on cardiovascular development and potential association with ART procedure and parental factors is confused. The aim is to shed more light on the pattern and extent of cardiovascular developmental alteration among ART children and its association with potential confounders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Assisted Reproductive Technology on Cardiac Development in Childhood Assessed by Echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A historic cohort study was designed with prospective follow-up of ART children conceived in the Clinical Centre of Reproductive Medicine (CCRM) and born in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU) of First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (FAHNMU) from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2012. The present design is a prospective single-center study in FAHNMU. ART group will be recruited by a non-random, consecutive sample on the basis of the unique personal identification number assigned to ART children conceived in CCRM and born in MFMU. The controls will be recruited by a non-random, consecutive sample on the basis of the spontaneous conception population attending the MFMU of FAHNMU during the same period as ART group for prenatal screening and subsequent delivery considering their age.</detailed_description>
