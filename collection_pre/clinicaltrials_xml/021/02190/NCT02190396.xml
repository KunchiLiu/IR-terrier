	<brief_summary>Maternal vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to influence fetal and neonatal health. The role of placenta in vitamin D regulation is known but alteration of Vitamin D levels at placental pathologies is unknown. Placental calcification is usually thought to be a physiological aging process. Nevertheless, it can be a pathological change resulting from the effects of environmental factors on the placenta. The aim of the investigators study was to evaluate the relationship between placental calcification and maternal and cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 [25(OH)D] and calcium concentrations in low-risk obstetric population at term and their consequences.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Deficiency and Placental Calcification in Low-risk Obstetric Population - Are They Related?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency is a public health problem prevalent throughout the World. Low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 25OHD ) level was found to be associated with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, infectious diseases, decrease in fetal bone mineralization, and increase in fetal respiratory infections and infant wheezing [1]. Requirement of vitamin D is primarily met by the exposure of skin to sun and secondarily by intake of food. The provision of vitamin D from the skin depends upon melanin pigment, the use of sun screens, age, dressing style and seasonal changes [1]. Placenta plays an important role in Vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy and some independent risk factors increasing the risk of placental dysfunction at fetomaternal interface also influence vitamin D metabolism [2,3]. Nevertheless, there can be a pathological change resulting from the effects of environmental factors on the placenta .</detailed_description>
