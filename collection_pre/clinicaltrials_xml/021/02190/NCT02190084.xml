	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a major public health problem. Apathy, a profound loss of motivation, is seen in majority of patients with AD. Dysfunction of the front of the brain and loss of dopamine, a type of neurochemical, in this part of brain results in apathy. Presence of apathy is linked to deficits in planning sequential tasks such as keeping a routine. Patients with apathy have poor physical function and their caregivers experience extra burden. Unfortunately there are no good medications to treat apathy. FDA has approved the use of brain stimulation by a magnet known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for treatment of depression. rTMS increases dopamine when applied to frontal lobe of brain so we propose that rTMS would be a good treatment option for apathy in AD. Study hypotheses include that rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will improve apathy and executive function better than sham treatment in those with AD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a major public health problem. Apathy, a profound loss of motivation, is seen in majority of patients with AD. Dysfunction of the front of the brain and loss of dopamine, a type of neurochemical, in this part of brain results in apathy. Presence of apathy is linked to deficits in planning sequential tasks such as keeping a routine. Patients with apathy have poor physical function and their caregivers experience extra burden. Unfortunately there are no good medications to treat apathy. FDA has approved the use of brain stimulation by a magnet known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), for treatment of depression. rTMS increases dopamine when applied to frontal lobe of brain so we propose that rTMS would be a good treatment option for apathy in AD. Specific Aims: To determine the efficacy of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in treating apathy in mild AD in comparison to sham treatment. • To compare the efficacy of rTMS to the DLPFC on executive function in mild AD in comparison to sham treatment. Research Plan: Current study is a prospective randomized sham controlled study of daily rTMS. Methods: Up to 500 subjects will be pre-screened to enroll 100 subjects for screening and randomizing up to 50 subjects to analyze 20 completers. Subjects with mild AD and apathy will be randomly assigned to rTMS or sham treatment after consent. All subjects will be tested for memory, behavioral problems, functioning and caregiver burden. Apathy will be assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Memory, executive function, functional status and caregiver burden will be assessed. Subjects will receive daily treatments for 4 weeks with either rTMS or sham coil for a total of 20 treatments. Neither the subject nor the investigators will know which treatment the subject is receiving. Testing will be repeated at the end of 4 weeks and at 8 and 12 weeks after treatment.</detailed_description>
