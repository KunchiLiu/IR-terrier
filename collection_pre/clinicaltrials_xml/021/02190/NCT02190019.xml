	<brief_summary>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor of dementia. Apathy, a profound loss of motivation, is a common behavioral problem in MCI. Presence of apathy may increase the chance of MCI patients converting to Alzheimer's Dementia. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive tool, has been recently approved for treatment of refractory depression. Since dysfunction in the frontal lobe of the brain is seen in patients with apathy, rTMS to the frontal lobe might be helpful in treating the same. Study hypotheses include that rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will improve apathy and executive function better than sham treatment in those with MCI</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor of dementia. Apathy, a profound loss of motivation, is a common behavioral problem in MCI. Presence of apathy may increase the chance of MCI patients converting to Alzheimer's Dementia. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive tool, has been recently approved for treatment of refractory depression. Since dysfunction in the frontal lobe of the brain is seen in patients with apathy, rTMS to the frontal lobe might be helpful in treating the same. Specific Aims: - To determine the efficacy of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in treating apathy in MCI in comparison to sham treatment. - To compare the efficacy of rTMS to the DLPFC on executive function in MCI in comparison to sham treatment. Research Plan: Current study is a randomized sham controlled cross-over study of daily rTMS. Methods: 20 subjects with MCI and apathy will be enrolled to randomize 8 to a total of 20 sessions of treatment (2 weeks sham, 2 weeks rTMS, with 4 weeks of washout period). Subjects will be randomly assigned to rTMS or sham treatment after consent. After 2 weeks of treatment there will be a 4 week period with no treatment. At the end of the 4-week wash out period, subjects will be crossed over to the next treatment arm (i.e. those who received rTMS in the beginning will receive sham treatment and vice versa). Subjects will be followed for four additional weeks after treatment. Apathy will be assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Memory, executive function, functional status and caregiver burden will be assessed.</detailed_description>
