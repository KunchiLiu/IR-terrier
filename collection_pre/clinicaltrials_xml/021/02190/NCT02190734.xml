The purpose of this study is to see if there are immediate changes in pushing behaviors in individuals who have had a stroke before and after sitting in a wheelchair, walking on the treadmill, and walking overground. The investigators do not think there will be a change with sitting in the wheelchair, but the investigators think there may be an improvement in pushing behaviors after walking training.</brief_summary>
