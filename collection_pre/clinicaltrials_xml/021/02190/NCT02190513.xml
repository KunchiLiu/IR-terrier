	<brief_summary>Celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) are distinct diseases of the gastrointestinal tract with specific clinico-pathological characteristics. In recent years, in the literature, several children who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for suspected CD, which was confirmed histologically, were also found to have coexistent EE. There are reports of coexistent CD and EE. We would like to see the prevalence of EE in children with CD and the prevalence of CD in children with EE in our population, and to do so would like to review medical records. Our objectives are to determine if children with celiac disease have a high prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis.and to determine if children with eosinophilic esophagitis have increased risk of developing celiac disease.</brief_summary>
