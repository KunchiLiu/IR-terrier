	<brief_summary>The overall aims of this project are to 1) determine the quality of life effects and safety of a combination herbal galactagogue tea in lactating women, and 2) measure changes in maternal blood concentration of oxytocin, prolactin, and milk production. The defined outcome measures will include quality of life measures and safety parameters in the breastfeeding woman and basic infant health. If the tea proves safe and effective, then it can provide a proven all-natural and organic supplement for increasing lactation in women. This in turn will increase quality of life for both the infant and the mother.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of an Herbal Tea to Support Lactation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to establish the quality of life and safety effects of combination herbal galactagogue tea in lactating women, a randomized controlled trial of combination herbal galactagogue tea vs. placebo is being undertaken in 120 fully lactating women beginning at 2-12 weeks postpartum for four weeks. Women will be randomized to one of two teas: combination herbal galactagogue tea vs. an herbal placebo tea. The study duration will be 4 weeks total beginning in the second to twelfth week postpartum, with follow up phone calls at postpartum months 3, 6, 9 and 12, to ascertain if the mother is continuing to breastfeed. During the 4-week study, participants and their infants will have three scheduled outpatient visits to the Medical University of South Carolina or an affiliated study center: one visit at 2-12 weeks postpartum, a second visit at 4-14 weeks postpartum, and a final visit at 6-16 weeks postpartum. The first visit, will include watching a video on how to correctly steep the tea and then brewing tea in the presence of the study coordinator, in addition to the procedures listed below. This initial visit will last approximately 90 minutes. Each subsequent visit will take less than 60 minutes for a maternal blood drawing, pumping a breast milk sample, answering questionnaires, and both weighing and measuring the infant. Study participants will be given a study journal to be completed with the number of cups of tea they drink every day and to document an assessment of how they felt throughout the day both physically and emotionally. All participants will receive telephone calls/texts, depending on the study participants preferred method of communication. This will be done by a Study Coordinator at the end of weeks 1 and 3 of the study in order to ensure safety and to remind them to complete their journals. This call will also be an opportunity to assess if the participant is in need of additional dietetic or lactation support by the team professionals or if she is having any difficulty brewing her tea. At the last study visit, participants will be asked to call and report any adverse events for 3 months after the end of their time on the active study. Post Active-Study Communication: After the active-study, the Study Coordinators will call each study participant when their infants are 3, 6, 9 and 12 months old, if applicable in order to record the number of months that she continues to fully or partially breastfeed.</detailed_description>
