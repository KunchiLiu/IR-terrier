	<brief_title>Exercise and Diabetes - an Observational Study of Exercise and Blood Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal seeks to gather continuous blood glucose and physical activity data from individuals with and without diabetes who are physically active and exercising for health benefits. The investigators hypothesize that insulin requirements will be inversely related to intensity of activity and an algorithm will be able to detect physical activity and automatically adjust insulin doses. Once such an algorithm has been determined for an individual, it can be applied to future similar situations, but ideally the algorithm will be dynamically refined based on closed-loop feedback information.</detailed_description>
