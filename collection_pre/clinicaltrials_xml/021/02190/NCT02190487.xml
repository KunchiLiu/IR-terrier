	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most frequently encountered and prognostically significant complications after cardiovascular surgery. However, there is no definitive treatment to intervene after development of AKI, therefore, preventive strategy has been the major issue. By this time, incidence of AKI after cardiovascular surgery has been reported 3-50% based on the studies with various definition of AKI and different patient cohorts. Development of unified definition for AKI in the early 2000s opened a new era in AKI study. According to the previous studies, aortic surgery, especially thoracic aortic surgery was known to be highly prevalent of AKI, which was considered to be caused by use of total circulatory arrest (TCA), relatively high number of emergency cases, combined malperfusion syndrome before surgery and relatively complicated surgical procedure. However, there has not been many studies of AKI in thoracic aortic surgery because of its low incidence and urgent clinical presentation of aortic pathology, which hinder large randomized controlled study. Moreover, there are conflicting reports of incidence and risk factors of AKI after thoracic aortic surgery, no conclusive result has been made. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the incidence and risk factors after thoracic aortic surgery only due to dissection.</brief_summary>
