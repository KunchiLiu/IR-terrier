	<brief_title>Wii-Fit For Balance And Gait In Elderly Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives/Rationale Falls are a major public health problem. They are the leading cause of injuries and injury-related deaths in those aged over 65 years. Balance and gait abnormalities are major reasons for falls in elderly. Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in the elderly. Despite the many proven benefits of exercise, many older adults in the US remain sedentary. This study targets at improving balance and gait with use of Wii-Fit as an exercise program. Specific aims 1. To establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of an 8-week Wii-Fit program to improve measures of balance, and gait in older adults, compared to a cognitive remediation program, Brain fitness. 2. To compare the effect of an 8-week Wii-Fit program to Brain fitness program, on measures of biomechanical assessment, adherence, safety, physical activity, fear of fall, enjoyment, functional status, cognition and quality of life. Design 8-week, randomized, parallel group, active intervention study Methods Patients will be recruited via IRB approved flyers posted in various locations of the Little Rock and North Little Rock CAVHS campuses and via referrals from the CAVHS providers. Thirty elderly Veterans will be randomly assigned to Wii-Fit arm or Brain fitness arm. Both groups will participate in the intervention for approximately 45 minutes 3 days a week for 8 weeks. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, and approximately week 4 and after completion of week 8. Balance and gait will be assessed by Berg Balance Scale. Secondary outcome measures include biomechanical testing for gait and balance, Safety, Adherence, measures of functional status, cognition, quality of life, fear of falling, physical activity and physical activity enjoyment.</detailed_description>
