	<brief_title>An Invivo Study to Compare the Stability of Dental Implants With or Without Platelet Rich Fibrin Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives:Achieving accelerated implant osseointegration could provide immediate or early loading of implants. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is widely used to accelerate soft and hard tissue healing. Activated platelets in PRF release growth factors resulting in cellular proliferation, collagen synthesis and osteoid production. The aim of this study was to compare the stability of dental implants inserted with one-stage surgical protocol with or without PRF application. Design: Non-randomized, Active Controlled Trial. Material and Methods: Twenty healthy patients (n=10 test group, n= control group) with adequate alveolar bone, having 2 or more adjacent missing teeth, extracted at least 6 months ago were included in this study. Minimum two tapered implants (Ankylosis, DentsplyFriadent) were placed to each patient. After surgical preparation of implant sockets, PRF that was prepared preoperatively was placed randomly to one of the sockets (PRF+). Acellular plasma portion of PRF was used to wet the implant placed into the PRF-coated socket. Resonance frequency measurements were made by Osstell ISQ after placement of implants, at 1 week and one month postoperatively. Key Words: Dental implant stability, Platelet Rich Fibrin, Resonance frequency analysis</detailed_description>
