	<brief_title>Mindfulness Interventions and Chronic Widespread Pain in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to test the feasibility, safety, tolerability and acceptability of a mindfulness meditation intervention for adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia/chronic widespread pain. The purpose of the program is to test how effective an 8-week meditation and stress reduction class is in helping adolescents with chronic symptoms (including but not limited to fibromyalgia or chronic widespread pain, irritable bowel syndrome, joint pain, chronic fatigue, and others). Participants will attend group sessions led by an instructor experienced in MBSR in an academic setting. The mindfulness meditation group sessions will take place at the Yale School of Medicine. Participants will attend 90-minute weekly group sessions and a 4-hour retreat with approximately 6-8 other study participants at Yale School of Medicine. Participants are asked to practice at home by listening to pre-recorded 15-20 minute guided meditations.</detailed_description>
