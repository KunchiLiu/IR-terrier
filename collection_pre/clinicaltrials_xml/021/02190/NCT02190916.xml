	<brief_title>Vasculitis Illness Perception (VIP) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients enrolled in the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium's Contact Registry were invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who self-identify as having one of the following types of vasculitis: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu's arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet's disease, Henoch-Schöenlein purpura, or CNS vasculitis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding that they will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible. The introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required elements for informed consent in a brief format. Once participants agreed to participate in the study, then they were directed to the online questionnaire. When completing the questionnaire, patients were asked a series of questions. Some of the follow-up questions depended on initial answers. The questionnaire content was included as an appendix. The online questionnaire version was thoroughly tested for usability. It was expected that most participants would require approximately 20-30 minutes to complete the questionnaire. The survey data is stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified. Names or other personal health information are not be collected.</detailed_description>
