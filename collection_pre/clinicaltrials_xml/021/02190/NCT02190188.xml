	<brief_summary>Research on the implications of orthotic devices and the recovery after knee arthroscopy are widely known. But only a handful of specific issues have been studied to date. However, the effect of orthotic devices on the recovery after partial meniscectomy are largely unknown. To our best knowledge, there are no studies that deal with the treatment of partial medial or lateral meniscectomy with wedge insoles, valgus or varus knee braces. The purpose of this study is to find out if using wedge inserts or knee orthoses improve the outcomes after partial meniscectomy. We therefore verify the following hypothesis: In patients with partial meniscectomy can be by the postoperative use of exculpatory wedge deposits or relieving knee brace achieve a significantly better clinical outcome than without specific treatment.</brief_summary>
