	<brief_summary>112 migraine subjects will be initially randomly assigned to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a Stress Management for Headache group (SMH). Outcomes, including headache frequency and impact and brain activity, will be assessed at baseline, prior to intervention, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Outcomes of Mindfulness Meditation for Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects in the MBSR group undergo a standardized 8-week MBSR course plus an additional 4 sessions over another 8 weeks that further emphasize and train subjects on MBSR concepts and skills. The SMH group will have 12 sessions spread out in a similar fashion to MBSR. Clinical outcomes are compared between groups at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess efficacy of MBSR. MRI scans are performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months changes in MRI metrics after MBSR and changes in MRI metrics associated with long-term MBSR practice. 30 healthy controls will also undergo MRI scanning to determine abnormal brain activity and structure in migraineurs compared to healthy controls across the 6 month period of observation.</detailed_description>
