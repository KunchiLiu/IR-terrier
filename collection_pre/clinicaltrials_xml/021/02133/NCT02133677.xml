	<brief_summary>Brain metastasis (BM) is among the most feared complications in cancer because even small tumors may cause incapacitating neurologic symptoms. It is observed in more than 50% of patients with lung cancer and 15% to 25% of patients with breast cancer. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that crosses blood-brain barrier (BBB). This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus concomitant TMZ in lung cancer and breast cancer patients with BM.</brief_summary>
