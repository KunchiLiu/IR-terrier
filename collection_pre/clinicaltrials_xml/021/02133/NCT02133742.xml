	<brief_summary>Despite substantial improvements of patients outcome in advanced RCC, durable and complete response is uncommon. The majority of patients eventually develop resistance and exhibit disease progression. Combining a PD-1 inhibitor, which has shown single-agent efficacy with axitinib may provide additional clinical benefit compared to axitinib alone.</brief_summary>
