	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 639667 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses. Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose proportionality as well as investigation of linearity and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BI 639667 after single dosing and the assessment of the PK/PD relationship.</brief_summary>
