	<brief_title>Non-Inferiority Quantitative Transmission Ultrasound Case Collection Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective case collection study for the purpose of collecting cases for the subsequent Reader Studies at a minimum of two clinical sites. Potential subjects will be recruited from a group of women who have undergone diagnostic mammography and demonstrate a mammographic lesion in at least one view. Approximately 300 women will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo QTUS following a diagnostic XRM with a mammographically-detected lesion(s) in at least one mammographic view and will have a lesion seen on HHUS corresponding to the XRM lesion(s). Potential Subjects will be eligible for enrollment at the time the corresponding lesion is identified on HHUS. All subjects will undergo an ultrasound guided aspiration/biopsy with cytology to determine whether the lesion is a cyst or solid. Each study site is projected to collect approximately 75 cyst cases and 75 solid cases for a total of 150 cases, stratified across the four (4) recognized breast tissue density categories with at least 50% of cases from subjects with heterogeneous and extremely dense breast compositions. The composition of the cyst cases at each site is projected to consist of 25 simple cysts and 50 complicated and complex cysts for a total of 75 cyst cases. All enrolled subjects will undergo ultrasound guided aspiration or biopsy or surgical excision, as applicable for the index lesion. Cytologic or histologic results for all lesions will be performed and collected.</detailed_description>
