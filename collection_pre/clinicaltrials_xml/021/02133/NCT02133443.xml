	<brief_summary>Determining the optimal Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) level remains challenging, and several methods have been suggested. However none of them seems easily utilisable. Thus the investigators propose to test a way of NAVA level titration according to ventilator comfort.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAVASET: Nava Level Titration Using Comfort Scales</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physiological comparison of different levels of ventilator assistance during Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) to evaluate the effect of these on tidal volume, inspiratoy activity, comfort scales. We propose to evaluate the ability to guide the titration according the patient's comfort scale. The intensity of the breathing sensations will be evaluated using the labeled visual analog scale (Banzett Scale).</detailed_description>
