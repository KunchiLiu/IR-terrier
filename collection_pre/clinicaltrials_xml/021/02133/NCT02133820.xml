	<brief_title>A Study to Assess How the Body Processes a Strong Painkiller When it is Given Alongside a Drug That Counteracts the Side Effects of Strong Painkillers in a Fasted and Fed State.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory study to assess the influence of an opioid antagonist on the pharmacokinetics of a strong painkiller when co-administered in a fasted and fed state. Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 32 hours post-dose, following an administration of a single oral dose. Pharmacokinetics parameters of AUC and Cmax are the primary endpoints.</detailed_description>
