	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Study the Effect and Safety of Rotavirus Vaccine Against Severe Rotavirus Gastroenteritis in Healthy Indian Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that a three dose series of BRV-PV administered orally to healthy Indian infants, with the initial dose given at 6-8 weeks of age and followed by vaccinations at monthly intervals, will significantly reduce the incidence of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE). Duration of follow-up is until aged 2 years of each enrolled child. The study is powered to detect vaccine efficacy significantly greater than 10% (95% confidence interval lower bound &gt; 10%) if the true vaccine efficacy is 50% or higher.</detailed_description>
