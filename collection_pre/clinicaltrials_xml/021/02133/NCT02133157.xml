	<brief_summary>Sulfatinib (HMPL-012) is a novel oral small molecule that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3 and inhibits FGFR kinase activity has demonstrated potent inhibitory effects on multiple human tumor xenografts. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for phase II ,to evaluate the pharmacokinetics , safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HMPL-012 at single doses and multiple doses .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Sulfatinib(HMPL-012) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, phase I study. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of HMPL-012 after a single administration followed by a 28-Day continuous course of therapy; evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in an open-label administration of at the MTD. All subjects of this study will be permitted to continue therapy with only safety monitoring and monthly assessments for progression, if the product is well tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better</detailed_description>
