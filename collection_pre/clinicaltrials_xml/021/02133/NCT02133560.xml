	<brief_summary>Purpose: Assess whether intensive training with education and daily remote monitoring with provider involvement has a lasting positive impact on adherence to medication management. The study will seek to enroll 25 subjects with sickle cell disease or thalassemia, and less than 100% compliance for taking iron chelators in the previous three month prior to participation in the study. Subjects will be asked to monitor their daily iron chelator administration by taking a video recording of preparing it and ingesting at least one sip. Subjects will also use a medication log to record daily administration of medication, and meet with study staff monthly for educational activities. The data collected will be analyzed to describe patient adherence and comfort level with the process of daily recording of medication management. Mean percent adherence in the pre-study periods and each of the study periods will be analyzed and compared.</brief_summary>
