	<brief_summary>This multicenter, retrospective and prospective observational, cohort study will examine the effect of second-line Tarceva treatment on long response in NSCLC patients with wild type or unknown EGFR status. Patients will be observed from the start of treatment for 8 months or until death. The extension of the retrospective versus prospective observation will depend on the lag between the date of the patient enrollment and the date of beginning of erlotinib therapy.</brief_summary>
