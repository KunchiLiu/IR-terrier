	<brief_summary>This non-therapeutic trial is for women who have received results of genetic testing for BRCA1/2 mutations. The trial compares decision support tools designed to facilitate informed decision making regarding risk management following testing to usual care. The researchers will test separate decision support tools for women who receive positive test results and women who receive negative/inconclusive test results. Among women who receive a positive test result, an interactive decision support intervention will be compared to a print intervention. Among women who receive an inconclusive result, an interactive intervention will be compared to usual care.</brief_summary>
