	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of ASP7991 in Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, Cinacalcet hydrochloride-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ascending study. Subjects judged to be eligible will be registered and randomized into either ASP7991 group (receiving ASP7991 and cinacalcet-placebo) or Cinacalcet group (receiving cinacalcet and ASP7991-placebo), and will receive 12-week (84 days) administration of study drug from first dialysis day in a week (treatment period), in a double-blind manner. The dose of the study drugs will be increased every 3 weeks in dose-ascending manner. Follow-up assessment will be performed before starting first dialysis in a week, 1 week (7 days) after the completion of the treatment period.</detailed_description>
