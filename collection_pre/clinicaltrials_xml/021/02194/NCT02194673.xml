	<brief_title>Acute Effects of Natural and Interesterified Fats-margarine on Lipemic and Insulinemic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study was to investigate whether IE-fat blends behave differently on postprandial serum lipid, insulin, C-peptide and glucose concentration compare to TFPM. A randomised, double-blind crossover (3 Ã— 3 arms) orthogonal Latin-square design was used and conducted on 10 males and 10 females adults. During postprandial challenge day, each subject received an a test muffin incorporated with test margarine. Blood samples were collected at half-hourly intervals until 4 hr by using cannulation technique.</detailed_description>
