	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial studies the overall tumor response of vaccine therapy in patientswith previously untreated Stage III or IV, asymptomatic, non-bulky follicular lymphoma. The vaccine contains an extract of the patient's own cancer cells and the immunostimulant protein, interleukin-2 (IL-2). It is hoped that when injected under the skin, the vaccine will enable the patient's immune system to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. The trial will also assess the safety of the vaccine, the time from vaccine treatment until the patient requires another type of anti-lymphoma treatment, progression-free survival, and the anti-tumor immune response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oncoquest-L Vaccine in Patients With Previously Untreated Stage III or IV, Asymptomatic, Non-bulky Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm open-label pilot Phase II study. Following informed consent, eligible subjects will undergo excisional biopsy of a lymphoma-containing lymph node for diagnosis and for generation of the Oncoquest-L vaccine. Patients will receive subcutaneous injections consisting of their autologous tumor-derived Oncoquest-L vaccine starting at approximately 4 to 8 weeks after the biopsy. The first two doses will be given at a 2-week interval and the remaining 3 doses at monthly intervals. Patients will be monitored for response by performing imaging studies at baseline and 1 month after the fifth vaccination (Week 19). Additional imaging studies will be performed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months during the second year until relapse or disease progression whichever occurs sooner.</detailed_description>
