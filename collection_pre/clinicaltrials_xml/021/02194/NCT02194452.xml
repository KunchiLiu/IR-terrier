	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies gallium Ga 68-edotreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in finding brain tumors in younger patients. Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT imaging, may help find and diagnose brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of 68Ga-DOTATOC Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT in Children and Young Adults With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if 68Ga-DOTATOC (gallium Ga 68-edotreotide) PET when combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will differentiate embryonal tumors such as medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) from the low and high grade gliomas. II. To determine if 68Ga-DOTATOC PET will aid in the identification of residual tumor post operatively in those patients who were 68Ga-DOTATOC PET positive prior to surgery. OUTLINE: Patients undergo gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT at baseline and 1-30 days after surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients presenting with brain tumors will be eligible for this study Eligible subjects must be able and willing to undergo the procedures of the study Electronic version of presurgery MRI must be available for coregistration purposes Fresh frozen tumor, and/or paraffin block of biopsy or resected tumor is recommended, but not required to determine expression of somatostatin receptors in tumor by immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal fragments or foreign objects in the eyes, skin of body that would preclude obtaining an MRI as part of the initial study evaluation Inability to complete the needed investigational and standardofcare imaging examinations due to other reasons Presence of any additional medical condition such as intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance</criteria>
