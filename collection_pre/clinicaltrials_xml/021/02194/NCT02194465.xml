	<criteria>Have a history of hypertension. If participants are naïve to treatment of hypertension, or have not been treated with any antihypertensive medications within the 30 days immediately prior to screening: Have seated SBP of ≥140 and &lt;170 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) at screening and at the end of the leadin period. If participants are currently being treated for hypertension: Are taking a stable dose of 1 or 2 antihypertensive medications for at least the previous 30 days. A combination antihypertensive medication from 2 classes is considered as 2 antihypertensive medications. Are willing to discontinue the antihypertensive medications during the study. Have seated SBP of ≥140 and &lt;170 mmHg at the end of the leadin period. Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5 and &lt;40 kilograms/m^2. Have a history of severe hypertension (defined as SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥120 mmHg), secondary hypertension, symptomatic postural hypotension, or hospitalization due to hypertension. Have SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥110 mmHg at screening, leadin period, or randomization. Have a history of hospitalization due to hyperkalemia, or history of drug discontinuation due to elevated serum potassium levels. Have a serum potassium ≤3.5 or &gt;5.0 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;50 milliliters/minute/1.73 m^2.</criteria>
