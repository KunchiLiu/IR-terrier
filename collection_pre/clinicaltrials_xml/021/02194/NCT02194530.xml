	<brief_summary>This pilot study is collaboration between the Weill Cornell Medical College, Department of Genetic Medicine and Yale University and will examine the pathways involved in allergic response, primarily in food allergy; specifically peanut allergy.We will also study non-allergic donors as well as patients with atopic disorders, primarily as control subjects.We believe that this study will lead to discovery of significant pathways involved in the allergic pathway that can be explored in more detail during follow-up studies in order to address mechanistic questions that cannot be answered in a pilot trial. We believe that such a pilot study represents the ideal approach to identify effective therapeutic interventions and to simultaneously better understand the underlying mechanistic properties involved in the allergy cascade. We think that this study forms the basis for a novel avenue of research into the pathogenesis of allergic pathways, a disease that is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction of Peanut Reactivity and Immune Modulation With Anti-IgE Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aims to characterize the pathways involved in the allergic response, primarily in food allergy; specifically peanut allergy. We will also study non-allergic donors as well as patients with atopic disorders, primarily as control subjects. All eligible study participants will have documented elevated total IgE levels, peanut positivity or another antigen/allergen specific elevated IgE (ie common indoor/outdoor allergens) prior to being enrolled in the study.Our study will focus on allergic as well as non-allergic individuals. We plan on collecting samples from a total of 80 patients during one time point (peanut allergic individuals, non-atopic/allergic individuals, atopic individuals-other than peanut allergy). We believe that such a pilot study represents the ideal approach to identify effective therapeutic interventions and to simultaneously better understand the underlying mechanistic properties involved in the allergy cascade. We plan to obtain a detailed history prior to enrollment as well as objective data (ie SPT as well as Immunocap testing results). There will be 4 study groups and studies will be performed on approximately 20 peanut allergic patients,20 non-allergic controls, 20 allergic (non-peanut allergic, but allergic to indoor/outdoor allergen) controls as well as 20 patients currently on xolair therapy (as controls). There will be one blood draw required at each visit (weeks 0, 4, 8). Each blood draw will require 105 ml of whole blood to be collected in ten heparinized 10-mL tubes and one EDTA tube. We plan to assess the levels of total IgE and IgG as well as antigen specific IgG and IgE in the peripheral blood of patients. We will specifically perform ELISA testing that detects these levels. We will also perform in vitro CD4+ T cell proliferation assays. For this purpose, patients' peripheral T cells will be isolated with a combination of magnetic beads and flow cytometric sorting.</detailed_description>
