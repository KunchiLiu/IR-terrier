	<criteria>Participants should be healthy males and females Age range from 21 to 50 years Broca Index: within 20% of their normal weight All female volunteers must use a safe contraception (i.e. oral contraception, spiral, sterilized) All female volunteers must have a negative pregnancy test Prior to admission to the treatment after giving his/her informed consent (in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation) in writing each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a complete medical examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as well as a 12lead ECG within 14 days before the administration of the test substance. Hematopoietic, hepatic and renal function test will be carried out in the laboratory. The subjects will fast for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory evaluations Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or with psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator Intake of a drug with a long halflife (&gt;= 24 hours) within ten halflives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study or during the study Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial within two weeks prior to administration or during the trial Participation in another study with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) Inability to refrain from smoking on study days Alcohol abuse (&gt; 40g/day) Drug abuse Blood donation (&gt;= 100 ml) within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial Excessive physical activities within five days prior to administration or during the trial Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance For female subjects: Pregnancy Positive pregnancy test No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraceptives, sterilization, intrauterine pessary (IUP) Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period Lactation period</criteria>
