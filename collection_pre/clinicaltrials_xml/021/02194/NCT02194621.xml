	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of two toothpastes containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% copolymer and 0.234% sodium fluoride in a silica base as compared to a control regular fluoride toothpaste on anaerobic and malodor bacteria 12 hours after 13 days of product use. A secondary objective was to demonstrate that a toothpaste containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% copolymer, 0.234% sodium fluoride and a flavor with odor-masking ingredients in silica base (Colgate Total Toothpaste-Flavor Option 1) provides a level of antibacterial efficacy that is "equivalent" to a toothpaste containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% copolymer, 0.234% sodium fluoride and a regular flavor in silica base (Colgate Total Toothpaste-Flavor Option 2) after 13 days of product use.</brief_summary>
