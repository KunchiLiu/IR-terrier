	<brief_summary>This multicenter study in patients with HER2-positive eBC will investigate patients' pain and discomfort of subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab (Herceptin) administered either via a single-use injection device (SID) or via vial for manual administration using a hand-held syringe (SC vial). In total, patients wil obtain at least 18 cycles/1 year of trastuzumab (4 cycles of IV and 14 cycles of SC trastuzumab).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female and male patients aged &gt;/= 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 Hormonal therapy allowed as per institutional guidelines Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &gt;/= 55% measured by echocardiography (ECHO) prior to first dose of trastuzumab HER2positive disease immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or insitu hybridization (ISH) positive as determined in a local laboratory that is experienced/certified in HER2expression testing using an accurate and validated assay Histologically confirmed nonmetastatic primary invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast No evidence of residual, locally recurrent or metastatic disease after completion of surgery and chemotherapy, or during concurrent chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) Patients who have completed all (neo)adjuvant treatment or patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) to whom the 4 subsequent cycles of Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel are indicated per local practice Not more than 3 months should have elapsed since the last dose of adjuvant chemotherapy in case of subsequent treatment scheme Previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant breast cancer treatment with an approved or investigational antiHER2 agent History of other malignancy that can affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results. Patients with curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma, and patients with other curatively treated malignancies who have been diseasefree for at least 5 years, are eligible. Patients with previous ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast are also eligible for the study Patients with severe dyspnea at rest or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy Patients with other concurrent serious diseases that may interfere with planned treatment, including severe pulmonary conditions/illness Prior maximum cumulative dose of doxorubicin &gt;360 mg/m2 or maximum cumulative dose of epirubicin &gt;720 mg/m2 or equivalent Serious cardiac illness or medical conditions that would preclude the use of trastuzumab, specifically: history of documented congestive heart failure (CHF), highrisk uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina pectoris requiring medication, clinically significant valvular disease, evidence of transmural infarction on electrocardiogram (ECG), diagnosed poorly controlled hypertension Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) Pregnant or lactating women Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial using an investigational anticancer treatment, including hormonal therapy, bisphosphonate therapy and immunotherapy, within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment Known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, to any of the excipients of HerceptinÂ®, or the adhesive of the SC device, or a history of severe allergic or immunological reactions, e.g. difficult to control asthma Inadequate bone marrow, hepatic, or renal function Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment or anticipated need for major surgery during the course of study treatment</criteria>
