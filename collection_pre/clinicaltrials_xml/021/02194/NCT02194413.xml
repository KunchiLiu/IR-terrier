	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies healing touch or usual care in improving quality of life in patients undergoing stem cell transplant. Healing touch may improve the quality of life of patients undergoing stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Healing Touch on Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: I. To estimate the effects of healing touch (HT) vs usual care in the following clinical outcomes of stem cell transplant (SCT) patients; length of hospital stay, days to engraftment, and number of hospital readmissions during 100 days post-transplant. II. To estimate changes in quality of life (QoL) which occur during hospitalization of SCT patients who receive HT vs. usual care. III. To examine differences in effects of HT vs. usual care (UC) in patients receiving related allogeneic (Allo) transplant compared to those receiving autologous (Auto) transplant. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive daily HT sessions comprising pain drain, chakra connection, magnetic clearing, and mind clearing over 30 minutes from day 1 until 2 days before discharge from the hospital. ARM II: Patients receive routine nursing care from doctors and nurses from day 1 until 2 days before discharge from the hospital. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.</detailed_description>
