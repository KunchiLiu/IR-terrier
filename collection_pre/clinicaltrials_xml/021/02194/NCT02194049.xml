	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 when given together with cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing , or by stopping them from spreading. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with cisplatin and etoposide may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin, Etoposide and PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and feasibility of combining BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor BKM120) with cisplatin and etoposide in advanced solid tumors, with emphasis on small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the MTD (maximally tolerated dose) of BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide. II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and toxicity profile associated with BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide. III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of BKM120 in combination with cisplatin/etoposide in an expanded cohort of patients with SCLC. IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BKM120 in this combination. V. To collect blood samples for future exploratory biomarker analysis. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120. Patients receive PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.</detailed_description>
