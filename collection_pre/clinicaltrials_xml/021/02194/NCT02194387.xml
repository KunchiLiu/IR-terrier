	<detailed_description>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Survivor: Study Procedures: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the study staff will schedule a time, date, and location at MD Anderson for you to receive an accelerometer. The study staff will also provide you with instructions for wearing the accelerometer for 7 days before your visit. You will also wear the accelerometer for the 7 days before your 2nd visit (about 4 months later). You will return the accelerometer at each visit. At the first visit, you will receive a Fitbit (a small device you will wear that will track your activity), access to the Fitbit website, a Fitbit account with which you can view your information and record diet and non-walking/running physical activity, a guidebook, and brochures. At these visits: - You will complete multiple fitness tests to measure your strength, flexibility, balance and endurance. To measure your hand and forearm muscle strength, you will squeeze and release your hand on a handgrip tool. You will also complete a 6-minute walk test to measure your endurance. To complete this test, you will walk as fast as you can in an indoor hallway for 6 minutes. The distance you walk will be recorded. To measure your flexibility, you will do a sit-and-reach test (reaching in front of you) and a back scratch test (reaching behind your back). To assess your lower body strength, we will record how many times you can stand up from a chair and sit back down in 30 seconds. To assess your upper body strength, we will measure how many arm curls you can do with a dumbbell weight in 30 seconds. To measure your agility and balance, we will time how long it takes for you to get up from a chair, walk around a cone that is 8 feet away from you, and sit back down again. - Blood (about 1Â½ tablespoons) will be drawn. You must fast, have nothing to eat or drink but water for 12 hours before these visits. These samples will be sent to the University of Houston for analysis. Any remaining blood samples will be stored for future testing on biomarkers. We will also request your recent blood results from your doctor in order to compare those results with the blood samples we collect from you. You will not be informed of any findings from the blood tests. - Your height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will be measured. Each visit will take up to 2 and a half hours. You will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 16 study groups. The study staff will call you to explain which group you are in and which interventions you will receive. The 16 groups will each receive a different combination of each of the 4 following factors: 1. Weekly telephone coaching or email coaching 2. Text messages or no text messages 3. Resistance training or no resistance training 4. 4-7 days/week self-monitoring or one day/week self-monitoring. For example, 1 group will receive weekly telephone coaching, text messages, resistance training, and daily self-monitoring; and 1 group will receive email coaching, no text messages, no resistance training, and one day/week self-monitoring. The other 14 groups will receive a combination of each of the 2 different kinds of the 4 factors. You will receive your interventions for 16 weeks. If you receive telephone coaching, you will have 30-45 minute telephone calls 1 time each week with a telephone coach trained in motivational interviewing. These calls will be based on your Fitbit data. The coach will discuss your diet and fitness goals with you, as well as any difficulty you may be having with meeting your goals. Telephone sessions may be audio recorded for quality control. The audio recordings will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study. If you receive email coaching, you will be called during the first week to discuss the interventions. This call will last about 10-15 minutes. You will then receive 1 email each week in weeks 1-16 in which the coach will provide feedback about your goals and ask 1-2 questions similar to what the telephone coach would ask. If you respond to the coach, the conversation will continue until you make no further response. If you receive text messaging, you will receive 7-12 messages each week that will contain support and/or information about diet and physical activity. If you receive resistance training, you will be given a set of resistance exercise bands, a list of exercises and instructional videos on how to do each exercise. You will be asked to log your resistance exercises on a weekly activity log. If you are in a 4-7 days/week self-monitoring group, you will enter additional information about your diet and weight 4-7 days per week. If you are in a one day/week self-monitoring group, you will do this 1 day each week. Study Questionnaires: You will complete online questionnaires at the beginning of the study as well as 8 and 16 weeks after that. The online questionnaires will be sent to you by email, text message, and/or a letter with a link to the survey. If you prefer to complete a paper questionnaire, you may request this when you start the study and the study staff will provide you a paper questionnaire by mail with a self-addressed stamped envelope. In the questionnaires, you will record your self-measured height and weight. The questionnaires will also ask you about your demographic information (such as your age), medical history, body composition, physical activity, readiness to change, and your general health. These questionnaires should take about 30-45 minutes to complete. You will complete additional online questionnaires to measure your diet, called the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). You will be provided a secure web link with a username and password and instructions on how to complete the questionnaire. This DHQ should take about 45-60 minutes to complete. After your completion of the study, you may be contacted by telephone to complete a brief follow-up interview. The interview questions will ask for your feedback about the study and any suggestions for ways to make the study better. Length of Study: Your study participation will be over after you complete the questionnaires at Week 16. Your study participation may be stopped early if you become injured, if you become ineligible (for example, if you need to have treatment), or if the study staff thinks it is in your best interest. This is an investigational study. Up to 32 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. High Risk Families: Study Procedures: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be mailed an accelerometer, measuring tape, instructions for wearing the accelerometer for 7 days and measuring hip and waist circumference, and a return mailer for these items. You will also be mailed a FitBit (a small device you will wear that will track your activity), access to the FitBit website, a FitBit account with which you can view your information and record diet and non-walking/running physical activity, a guidebook, and brochures. You will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 16 study groups. The study staff will call you to explain which group you are in and which interventions you will receive. The 16 groups will each receive a different combination of each of the 4 following factors: 1. Weekly telephone coaching or email coaching 2. Text messages or no text messages 3. Social networking or no social networking 4. 4-7 days/week self-monitoring or one day/week self-monitoring. For example, 1 group will receive weekly telephone coaching, text messages, social networking, and daily self-monitoring; and 1 group will receive email coaching, no text messages, no social networking, and one day/week self-monitoring. The other 14 groups will receive a combination of each of the 2 different kinds of the 4 factors. You will receive your interventions for 16 weeks. If you receive telephone coaching, you will have 30-45 minute telephone calls 1 time each week with a telephone coach trained in motivational interviewing. These calls will be based on your FitBit data. The coach will discuss your diet and fitness goals with you, as well as any difficulty you may be having with meeting your goals. Telephone sessions may be audio recorded for quality control. The audio recordings will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study. If you receive email coaching, you will be called during the first week to discuss the interventions. This call will last about 10-15 minutes. You will then receive 1 email each week in Weeks 1-16 in which the coach will provide feedback about your goals and ask 1-2 questions similar to what the telephone coach would ask. If you respond to the coach, the conversation will continue until you make no further response. If you receive text messaging, you will receive 8-12 messages each week that will contain support and/or information about diet and physical activity. If you receive social networking, you will be invited to use a private online forum to discuss your goals with other participants in the study who are receiving social networking. At the beginning of the study, you will be mailed a Fitbit, as well as instructions on how to use it. If you are in a 4-7 days/week self-monitoring group, you will enter additional information about your diet and weight 4-7 days per week. If you are in a one day/week self-monitoring group, you will do this 1 day each week. Study Questionnaires: You will complete online questionnaires at the beginning of the study as well as 8 and 16 weeks after that. The online questionnaires will be sent to you by email, text message, and/or a letter with a link to the survey.

Length of Study: Your study participation will be over after you complete the questionnaire at Week 16. Your study participation may be stopped early if you become injured, if you become ineligible (for example, if you need to have treatment), or if the study staff thinks it is in your best interest. This is an investigational study. Up to 96 families will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. MD Anderson Employees: Study Procedures: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the study staff will schedule a time, date, and location at MD Anderson for you to receive an accelerometer. The study staff will also provide you with instructions for wearing the accelerometer for 7 days before your first visit. You will have 2 study visits at MD Anderson: at the beginning of the study and at the 4 month time point. At these visits, study staff will measure your height, weight, and waist and hip circumference. You will also return your accelerometer in person at that time. These study visits will last no longer than one hour. At the first visit, you will receive a FitBit (a small device you will wear that will track your activity), access to the FitBit website, a FitBit account with which you can view your information and record diet and non-walking/running physical activity, a guidebook, and brochures.

The other 14 groups will receive a combination of each of the 2 different kinds of the 4 factors. You will receive your specific interventions for 16 weeks. If you receive telephone coaching, you will have 30-45 minute telephone calls 1 time each week with a telephone coach trained in motivational interviewing. These calls will be based on your Fitbit data. The coach will discuss your diet and fitness goals with you, as well as any difficulty you may be having with meeting your goals. Telephone sessions may be audio recorded for quality control. The audio recordings will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study. If you receive email coaching, you will be called during the first week to discuss the procedure. This call will last about 10-15 minutes. You will then receive 1 email each week in weeks 1-16 in which the coach will provide feedback about your goals and ask 1-2 questions similar to what the telephone coach would ask. If you respond to the coach, the conversation will continue until you make no further response.
