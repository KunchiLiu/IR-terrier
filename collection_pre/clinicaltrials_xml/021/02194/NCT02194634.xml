Serum HbA1c ≤ 10%; 5. Study eye must meet the following criteria: Visual acuity impairment caused by DME with involving foveal; BCVA score ≥ 24 and ≤ 73 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at 4 meter/1 meter of ETDRS test(Equivalent Snellen chart 20/40 to 20/320); Visual impairment due to Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to high myopia.
