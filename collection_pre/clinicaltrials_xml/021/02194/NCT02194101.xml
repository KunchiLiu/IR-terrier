	<brief_title>Supernormal Goal for Proximal Femur Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Augmentation of oxygen delivery using fluids with or without inotropes has been shown to improve surgical outcome in high-risk patients. Patients with proximal femoral fracture are considered high risk. However, most of this cohort elderly patients have poor cardiovascular condition and may not achieve the oxygen delivery goal. We will perform an observational pilot study whether the supernormal oxygen delivery is a valid hemodynamic goal for patients with proximal femoral fracture.</detailed_description>
