	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Participants should be healthy males and females Age range from 21 to 50 years Body Mass Index (BMI) is to be within 18.5 to 29.9 kg/mÂ² (BMI calculation: weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation each volunteers are supposed to give their written informed consent prior to admission to the study As part of the screening (within 14 days before drug administration), each subject was to receive a complete medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, medical history, documentation of demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria and concomitant therapy) as well as a 12lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and a rhinomanometry (in order to familiarize the subject with this method; screening rhinomanometric values were not to be reported). Moreover laboratory parameters (including drug screening, HBs antigen (HBsAg), anti Hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies, anti Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibodies and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test as well as pregnancy test for female subjects are to be determined. Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or with psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator Intake of a drug with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than ten halflives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study (except substitution therapy regarding thyroid gland/or ovaries) Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial within 1 week prior to administration or during the trial Participation in another study with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day) Inability to refrain from smoking on study days Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60g/day) Drug abuse Blood donation (&gt;= 100 ml) within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial Excessive physical activities within the last week before the study Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance For female subjects: Pregnancy Positive pregnancy test No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraceptives, sterilization, intrauterine pessary (IUP) Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period Lactation period</criteria>
