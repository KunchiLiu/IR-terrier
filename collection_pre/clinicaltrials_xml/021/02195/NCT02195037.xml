	<brief_summary>Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended a delay of 30-60 seconds in umbilical cord clamping for all newborn infants. This delay allows the newborn to receive his/her own blood from the placenta (placental transfusion) which helps their transition in the first hours of life. The purpose of the study is to learn about the amount of blood flow to and from the baby's heart during normal newborn transition</brief_summary>
