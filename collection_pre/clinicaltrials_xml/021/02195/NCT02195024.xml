	<brief_summary>Aim of this trial is to investigate feasibility of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) in patients with long term implanted coradial leads upgraded to an MRI conditional pacemaker system, to assess MR-image quality and to prove the safety of MRI in this specific population in the short term as well as during long term follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial is designed 1. To investigate the cardiac MRI related adverse event-free rate in patients with long term implanted coradial pacing leads (Fineline-II) after implantable pulse generator (IPG) exchange to a MRI conditional system (short term and long term): Safety. 2. To assess the technical performance of MRI conditional pacemaker systems with long term implanted coradial pacing leads, for cardiac MRI (short term and long term): Effectiveness pacemaker. 3. To assess the image quality (IQ) and the diagnostic value (DV) of the cardiac MRI scans in patients with implanted MRI conditional systems: Effectiveness cardiac MRI. 2) To evaluate the clinical incidence of MRI procedures in the population of long term implanted pacemaker patients (long term-follow up)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Approved clinical indication for pectoral pacemaker exchange (e.g. elective replacement indication (ERI), end of service (EOS)) Implantation of a CE certified / market released MRI conditional pacemaker (BSCI) consistent of a single or dual chamber MRI conditional pacemaker (BSCI) or Any comparable successor IPG (MRI conditional system, BSCI) compatible with Implanted FinelineIIleads (BSCI), MRI conditional Leads electrically intact and with stable and normal function The ascertained lead impedance is between 200 and 1500 Ohm. All pacing capture thresholds (PCT) do not exceed 2.0 V @0.4 or 0.5 ms in pacemaker dependent patients Adherence to the MRI conditions of use is given Male or female 18 years or older Understand the nature of the procedure Give written informed consent Able to complete all testing required by the clinical protocol Ability to measure atrial and/or ventricular pacing threshold(s) at 0.4 or 0.5 ms Patient body height greater or equal to 140 cm Pectoral implanted device Subjects who are able and willing to undergo elective cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) scanning without sedation (MRIgroup) Subjects who are geographically stable and available for followup at the study center for the length of the study â€¢ Non MRI conditional leads implanted Pacing threshold(s) (at 0.4 or 0.5 ms) and/or sensing amplitude(s) and/or impedance(s) are not measurable Meet one or more of the contraindications for MRI including Psychiatric disorders, anxiety, claustrophobia Cardiac disorders that represent a contraindication to MRI Cardiac surgery already scheduled in the next three months Have other medical implants that may interact with MRI, e.g. abandoned implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) leads or pacemaker leads other than MRI conditional, lead extensions, other active medical devices, nonMRI compatible devices, mechanical valve Have other metallic artifacts/components in body that may interact with MRI Subjects for whom a single dose of 1.0 milligram (mg) dexamethasone acetate may be contraindicated Subjects who require a legally authorized representative to obtain consent Subjects who are immediate candidates for an ICD Subjects with medical conditions that preclude the testing required by the protocol or limit study participation Subjects who are enrolled or intend to participate in another clinical trial (of an investigational drug or device, new indication for an approved drug or device, or requirement of additional testing beyond standard clinical practice) during this clinical study Being pregnant Have a life expectancy of less than three months Subjects with exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g. age, breastfeeding)</criteria>
