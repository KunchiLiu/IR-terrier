	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of experimental sodium fluoride-silica dentifrice formulations, with and without zinc, on remineralization of enamel in situ. Following the remineralization phase, the acid resistance of the new mineral formed will be assessed. Fluoride uptake during the remineralization phase will also be measured.</brief_summary>
