	<brief_title>A New and Innovative Method for CO2 Removal in Anesthetic Circuits: Replacing Chemical Granulate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CO2 removal is a mandatory part of modern anesthesia systems. Current chemical absorbers pose problems as the chemical granulate reacts not only with the CO2 but also the anesthetic drugs, producing organ toxic substances. The proposed CO2 absorber provides a solution to the problem of organ-toxin production in anesthetic circuits. This new absorber can be easily integrated into any anesthesia circuit, and can effectively remove CO2 without reacting with anesthetic drugs, thus eliminating organ-toxic by-products. It uses advanced membrane technology to separate gas flows within the circuit, separating the expensive anesthetic vapors from the CO2 (the main by-product of metabolism). Anesthetic vapors thus remain in the closed loop circuit, while CO2 is separated and exhausted to the atmosphere, rather than being absorbed through a chemical reaction.</detailed_description>
