All abnormal laboratory values greater than Grade 1 are subject to approval by the trial clinical monitor Acceptable medical history, physical examination, 12lead electrocardiogram, and chest Xray (if not conducted within the last 12 months and deemed necessary by investigator) are required prior to entering the treatment phase of the study Willingness to abstain from the following starting 14 days prior to any administration of study drugs up until the end of the study: Grapefruit or grapefruit juice Red wine Seville oranges St. John's Wort or Milk Thistle Willingness to abstain from alcohol starting 2 days prior to administration study drug up to the end of the study Willingness to abstain from the following within 72 hours of pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling: Garlic supplements Methylxanthine containing drinks (coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, chocolate, etc.) Willingness to abstain from over the counter herbal medications for the duration of the study Have been nonsmokers for 3 months Willingness to abstain from vigorous physical exercise during intensive PK Days 6, 7, 13 Reasonable probability for completion of the study Female subjects who are of reproductive potential and: Have a positive serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at Visit 1, or on Day 0 or Day 1 Have not been using a barrier contraceptive method for at least 3 months prior to Visit 3 (Day 1) Are not willing to use a reliable method of barrier contraception (such as diaphragm with spermicidal cream/jelly or condoms with spermicidal foam), during the trial and 60 days after completion/termination Are breastfeeding Participation in another trial with an investigational medicine within 60 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) Use of any prohibited medication listed in the protocol within 30 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) Use of any pharmacological contraceptive (including oral, patch or injectable contraceptives) within 1 month of study initiation and for the duration of the study. Use of DepoProvera is excluded for six months prior to study initiation Use of hormone replacement therapy within 1 month of study initiation and for the duration of the study Administration of antibiotics within 10 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) or during the trial History of acute illness within the past 60 days. Subjects will be excluded for these disorders greater than sixty days if, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject does not qualify as a healthy volunteer History of thrombotic disease History of migraine headache Have serological evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) Have serological evidence of exposure to HIV Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse (within 1 year of study period) Blood or plasma donations within 30 days of Day 0 (Visit 2) or during the trial Subjects with a seated systolic blood pressure either &lt;100 mm Hg or &gt;150 mm Hg; resting heart rate either &lt;50 beats/min or &gt;90 beats/min. For subjects with a resting heart rate below 50, or above 90, the investigator may discuss exclusion with the medical monitor on a casebycase basis Subjects with a history of any illness or allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering TPV, RTV or FCZ to the subject Subjects who have had an acute illness within 2 weeks prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) Subjects who are currently taking any overthecounter or prescription drug within 7 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) that, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation with the Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd./Ltée clinical monitor, might interfere with either the absorption, distribution or metabolism of the test substances Known hypersensitivity to TPV, RTV, FCZ, or sulphonamide class of drugs Inability to adhere to the protocol Cautions or warnings in the FCZ package insert which, in the judgment of the investigator, should exclude a subject from the study</criteria>
