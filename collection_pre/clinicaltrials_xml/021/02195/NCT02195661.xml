	<criteria>All children who were referred to the neurophysiology department who were either unable to keep still for their EEG, or required a sleep EEG as part of their epilepsy "workup" and whose caregivers agreed to the administering of sedation with melatonin. Those children undergoing prolonged EEG monitoring (telemetry) or within 24 hours of status epilepticus (prolonged or cluster of seizures). Those children are not sedated as natural sleep is always attained with the prolonged monitoring studies, and for those with status epilepticus, there is usually evidence on the EEG of alteration secondary to the effects of status, and the medications administered to control the presenting event. Any child deemed to unwell to undergo a nonemergency procedure. Any child already receiving anticoagulant medications. Any caregiver who deferred sedation for their child was also excluded from the study and in the unit the procedure attempted without sedation.</criteria>
