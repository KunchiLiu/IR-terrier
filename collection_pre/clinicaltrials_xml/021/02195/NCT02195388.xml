	<brief_summary>Myocardial infarction is related with endothelial function, arterial stiffness and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, but also with arterial hypertension. Hypertension by itself is also related with endothelial function, arterial stiffness and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Primary aim of study is to investigate how complex cardiac rehabilitation influence endothelial function, arterial stiffness and autonomic nervous system activity according to presence or absence arterial hypertension. Secondary aim is to obtain correlation between methods for the assessment of particular disorders and intercorrelation between different disorders for example endothelial function and autonomic nervous system activity.</brief_summary>
