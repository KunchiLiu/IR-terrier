	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to determine if remote ischemic preconditioning reduces incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with reduced kidney function undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of RIPC to Reduce AKI for Patients Undergoing PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury negatively impacts on prognosis after PCI, and only hydratation have shown to reduce this complication. Remote ischemic preconditioning has been demonstrated to reduce periprocedural MI, while impact on aki remains to be assessed</detailed_description>
