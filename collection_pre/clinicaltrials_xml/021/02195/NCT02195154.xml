	<brief_title>18F-DTBZ PET and Multi-modal MRI in the Patients With Vascular Parkinsonism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study duration is expected to be completed in a period of 3 year. The study will enroll 40 patients with VP and 20 healthy subjects. This neuroimaging study includes the 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET, MRI structure images, diffusion tensor imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging, resting state and gait-related imagery task functional MRI. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject group, each subject will have 3 visits in this study. Safety measurement for 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.</detailed_description>

Patients should be fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of vascular parkinsonism (Appendix I). 2. Twenty healthy subjects whom must: i. Male or female patients; age range 45~80 years old. ii. Written and dated informed consent by self or by legal representative, to be obtained before any of the study procedures. 1. Pregnant or becoming pregnant during the study (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening or at any date during the study according to the PI discretion) or current breast feeding. 2. Any subject who has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, and/or clinically significant or unstable medical or psychiatric illness. I. Clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or endocrine disturbances. II. Current clinically significant cardiovascular disease. (cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months; unstable angina; decompensated congestive heart failure; significant cardiac arrhythmia; congenital heart disease.) 3. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year, or prior prolonged history of abuse. 4. History or presence of QTc prolongation. 5. History of intracranial operation, including thalamotomy, pallidotomy, and/or deep brain stimulation. 6. History of repeated head injury, hydrocephalus, encephalitis or cerebral tumors. 7. History of neurotoxin exposure 8. Any documented abnormality in the brain by CT or MRI of brain, which might contribute to the motor function, such as hydrocephalus or encephalomalacia, will be excluded. Cerebral vascular lesions are allowed for VP patients. Mild cortical atrophy will be allowed for all subjects. 9. Patients who have neurodegenerative diseases, such as spinocerellar atrophy (SCA), Wilson's disease, Parkinson's disease or Parkinson plus syndrome, are excluded. 10.
