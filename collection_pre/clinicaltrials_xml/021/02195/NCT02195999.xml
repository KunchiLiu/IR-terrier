	<brief_summary>This study seeks to develop and validate non-invasive assessments of cardiac and respiratory muscles with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better predict the natural disease progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in affected individuals over time, as well as determine whether peripheral skeletal muscle dysfunction can predict cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that non-invasive MRI measures of the heart, muscle, and peripheral skeletal muscles can sensitively predict future cardiopulmonary decline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Cardiopulmonary Function in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the heart and breathing muscles, special breathing tests (called pulmonary function testing), special exercise tests (using a stationary bike), and possibly an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart, commonly known as an "echo") will be completed up to 4 times per year for up to 4 years. Most participants will complete testing once or twice each year; however, some participants will be asked to repeat some of the tests twice during each visit.</detailed_description>
