	<brief_summary>The purpose of the EMBARK Follow-up Project (EFP) is to determine if there is a significant correlation between post-study massage-seeking and changes in pain reported by participants during the Exploring Massage Benefits for Osteoarthritis of the Knee (EMBARK) parent study (NCT00970008). The EFP hypothesizes that a positive correlation exists between pain relief during the parent study and post-study massage-seeking behavior.</brief_summary>
