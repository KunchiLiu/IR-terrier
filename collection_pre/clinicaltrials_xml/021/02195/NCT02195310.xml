	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the use of Prevena™ Incision Management System (IMS) versus standard wound care for the incision in subjects undergoing a sternal midline incision (sternotomy). The subjects targetted for the study are at high risk for surgical complications (like infections) around the environment of the incision. The study is conducted in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of PrevenaTM on Clean Closed Sternal Midline Incisions in Subjects at High Risk for Surgical Site Occurrences.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Prevena™ IMS is intended to manage the environment of closed surgically incision and surrounding intact skin for patients with an increased risk for developing post-operative complications such as infection.The purpose of this study is to compare the use of Prevena™ Incision Management System (IMS) versus standard wound care for the incision in subjects undergoing a sternal midline incision (sternotomy). The subjects targetted for the study are at high risk for surgical complications (like infections) around the environment of the incision. The Prevena™ IMS is a small portable device, which consists of a mild vacuum unit that delivers negative pressure and a dressing that is intended for use over closed incisions after surgery. It is used for a minimum of 4 days up to a maximum of 7 days. This system is commercially available and has a CE mark, which means that it is approved for the use on the European market. It is intended to be applied immediately post sternotomy surgery on a closed clean incision. The results of this study could contribute to a better and faster healing of the incision. The study is conducted in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Wound Infection</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Is scheduled for elective cardiac surgery for which a median sternotomy is needed Is at high risk for wound complications after surgery, like BMI of &lt;18 kg/m2 or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, Insulin dependent Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic lung disease GOLD ≥ 2 Is pregnant Has a systemic infection at the time of surgery: systemic infection is diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs of sepsis with or without a positive culture of an organism from the bloodstream Has a requirement for competing wound therapy and procedures. Any concomitant therapies (including other NPWT treatment) or procedures deviating from the clinical standard incision treatment or with investigational device at the location of the sternotomy (e.g. use of NPWT at other location of the body is allowed) Any other therapies or procedures that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would affect or influence postoperative wound stability or healing Is simultaneously participating in another interventional trial Requires use of liquid skin adhesives or glues during skin closure</criteria>
