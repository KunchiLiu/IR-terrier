	<brief_summary>This study is a phase I, randomised, double blind (sponsor unblinded), placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study GSK2831781 administered by IV. GSK2831781 is a humanized Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced monoclonal afucosylated antibody that is specific to the Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 (LAG-3) protein. This is the first administration of GSK2831781 in humans and will evaluate in two parts the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity of single IV doses of GSK2831781 administered to healthy subjects previously vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) (Part A delayed type hypersensitivity [DTH] cohorts) and patients with plaque psoriasis (Part B). The inclusion of DTH and psoriasis subjects to explore the mechanism in biopsies and clinical response endpoints in these populations, as well as investigate systemic biomarkers will provide useful information prior to conducting studies in other immune-inflammatory disease which will involve more invasive tissue biopsies. Measuring the pharmacology of GSK2831781 using the depletion of LAG-3+ T-cells in skin biopsies from Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) skin challenge and lesional skin biopsies from patients with psoriasis, will be helpful in understanding of the dose response relationship, which will be important for designing future studies in immuno-inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Approximately 67 subjects will be enrolled to complete dosing and critical assessments. The subject numbers will be split to approximately 40 healthy subjects (Part A) and 27 patients with psoriasis (Part B).</brief_summary>

A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator in consultation with the Glaxosmithkline (GSK) Medical Monitor, if required, agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) cohorts only Subjects with a history of Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccination as evidence by either: A BCG scar and verbal confirmation of BCG vaccination ; Or documented medical history of a BCG vaccination with or without a BCG scar Subjects with a history of current vaccination for Tetanus, diphtheria, measles, pertussis, mumps and rubella For Part B study subjects only Subject has psoriasis covering Body Surface Area (BSA) &gt;=3 percent as assessed at Screening and Day1 Subject has had a confirmed diagnosis of chronic plaquetype psoriasis (without recent documented flare within 30 days prior to screening) for at least 6 months Subject has at least 2 stable plaques assessed at Screening and Day 1. One of a suitable size and in a site suitable for repeat biopsy, and one for index lesion Plaque Lesional Severity Score (PLSS) scoring. Both must have a PLSS lesional score of &gt;=2 for the induration component (moderate or above), &gt;=1 for erythema and scaling with a total score of &gt;=5. The biopsy lesion must not be on the face, groin or scalp and must be protected from the sun A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening and negative urine hCG test at Day 1 for Females of Reproductive Potential [FRP]), not lactating, and at least one of the given conditions applies: Nonreproductive potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation; or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; or hysterectomy; or documented bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels)]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Reproductive potential and agrees to use a barrier method (male condom or female diaphragm) plus to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in FRP from 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until completion of the followup visit. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.
