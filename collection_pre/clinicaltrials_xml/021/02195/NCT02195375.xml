	<brief_title>Flutiform® Compared With Seretide® in the Treatment of COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study in male and female subjects conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of flutiform in the treatment of COPD. Subjects will be randomised to one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Throughout the study subjects will be assessed on a mixture of symptom based and lung function measurements to monitor their progress in the study.</detailed_description>
