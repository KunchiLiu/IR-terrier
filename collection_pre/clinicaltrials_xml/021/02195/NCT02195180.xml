	<brief_summary>A new approach that aims to destroy pancreatic tumor cells through modification of the tumor environment. Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) is an enzyme wich synthetise asparagine. Asparagine is an essential nutriment for pancreatic cancer cells which have no or low level of ASNS. by L-asparaginase encapsulated in erythrocytes deplete (supress) Plasma asparagine. in selected patients having no or low ASNS, may provide a new therapeutic approach.</brief_summary>
