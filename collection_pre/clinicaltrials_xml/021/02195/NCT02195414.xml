	<brief_summary>The NeoVas First-in-Man study is a prospective, two centers, single arm trial, which will enroll a total of 30 patients. The hypothesis of this study is to evaluate clinical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of NeoVas sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable coronary scaffold in the treatment of patients with de novo coronary lesion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NeoVas Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold First-in-Man Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint of cardiac death, target vessel related myocardial infarction, and ischemia driven target lesion revascularization (TLF) at 1 month follow up. At 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years follow-up, clinical endpoints include TLF (its individual components), Patient-oriented cardiac event (all cause death, all MI, and all revascularization) target vessel revascularization, scaffold thrombosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age must be between 18 and 75 years, men or unpregnant women Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable angina, unstable angina) Total number of target lesion =1 per patient Target lesion must be ≤ 20mm in length (visual estimation) and 2.75 to 3.75 mm in diameter（Online QCA） Target lesion is with a visually estimated stenosis of ≥ 70% (or ≥50% and evidence of myocardial ischemia) with a TIMI flow of ≥ 1 The target lesion can be covered by one scaffold Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft. Patient is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment of receiving the NeoVas bioresorbable coronary scaffold and he/she or his/her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any clinical investigation related procedure, as approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site. Patients has had a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 30 days preceding the procedure; CK and CKMB have not returned within normal limits at the time of procedure Chronic total occlusion lesions(TIMI 0 grade blood flow prior to implantation), left trunk vessel lesion, ostial lesion ,multibranch lesions needing treated, fork and bridge vessel lesions of branch vessels whose diameter ≥2.0mm(branch opening stenosis exceeds 40% or need balloon expansion); there is thrombus visible in the target blood vessels. Severe calcified lesions and twisted lesions which cannot be preexpanded, and lesions unsuitable for delivering and expanding stents Instent restenosis lesion Patient has undergone previous stenting anywhere within the target vessel(s) within the previous 12 months, or will require stenting within the target vessel(s) within 6 months after the study procedure; target vessels that has been planted stents over a year. Severe heart failure(over NYHA III grade ), or left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF)&lt; 40%( supersonic inspection or left ventricular radiography ) Known renal insufficiency (e.g., eGFR &lt;60 ml/min, or subject on dialysis) Patients with hemorrhage tendency, an active digestive ulcer history, a cerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage history, or cerebral apoplexy within half a year, and these patients who contraindicate against platelet inhibitors and anticoagulant therefore can not bear anticoagulation treatment Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, contrast agent, polylactic acid or sirolimus that cannot be adequately premedicated Life expectancy &lt; 12 months Patient is participating in another device or drug study that has not reached the primary endpoint of the study. Patient's inability to fully cooperate with the study protocol which in the investigator's opinion may limit his/her ability to participate in the study Patient has a heart transplant. Patient has current unstable arrhythmias, such as high risk ventricular premature beat and ventricular tachycardia. Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30 days prior to or after the procedure Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, coumadin) Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt;3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis) Patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion</criteria>
