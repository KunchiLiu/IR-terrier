	<brief_summary>This project will address vital questions regarding how best to design web-based materials for the growing population of patients with basic literacy and computer skills but lower levels of health literacy, building on our previous experience of developing web-based materials for people with lower levels of literacy and health literacy. This study will be carried out two phases. Phase 1 will use qualitative methods to understand user experiences of the web-based materials through observational 'think-aloud' interviews with users. Phase 2 will test the newly developed web-based materials to a static (non-interactive) version of the materials online.</brief_summary>
