	<brief_title>Transverse Abdominal Block for Analgesia in Casarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will study 60 ASA [American Society of Anesthesiologist] physical status I and ІІ patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery at tanta University Hospital, in a prospective, randomized, comparative, clinical trial. Patients will be randomly allocated to two equal groups (n = 30) using closed envelopes labeled 1,and 2 reflecting group 1and 2 respectively. The drugs are prepared by the anesthesiologist who is not involved in the study or data collection. Group I: (n=30) will receive pre-delivery bilateral TAP block with 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % mixed with 10 ml saline and 10 μg dexmetonedine in 20 ml syringe labeled G 2. Group II: (n=30) will receive post-delivery bilateral TAP block with 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % mixed with 10 ml saline in 20 ml syringe labeled G2.</detailed_description>
