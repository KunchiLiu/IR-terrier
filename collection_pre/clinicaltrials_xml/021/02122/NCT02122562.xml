	<brief_summary>Objective: Glutamate-based medications including the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine result in rapid, robust and sustained (up to one week) antidepressant effects in randomized controlled trials in treatment-refractory unipolar and bipolar depression. Previous work by our group has demonstrated that a family history of alcohol dependence predicts a more robust antidepressant response to ketamine in both treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depression. Recently-detoxified alcoholics and affected first-degree relatives display blunted psychotomimetic, cognitive and other neuropsychiatric effects with a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Also, a family history of alcoholism alone predicts differential response to intravenous alcohol. Based on our prior post hoc results, we seek to prospectively demonstrate that a family history of alcohol dependence predicts a more robust antidepressant response to ketamine. We will also explore potential biomarkers of ketamine s antidepressant effects in treatment-refractory depressed patients at risk of alcohol dependence (using physiological and neurochemical responses to alcohol). Study Population: 21-65 year old treatment-resistant major depressive disorder without psychotic features patients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate severity will be recruited and enrolled in this protocol. All subjects must also be free of a lifetime substance use disorder diagnosis with the exception of a nicotine or caffeine use disorder) and will be psychotropic medication-free for at least two weeks prior to the first alcohol infusion. Our targeted number of completers will be 50 depressed subjects (60 signing consent to account for attrition): 25 FHP subjects [as defined by either one first degree relative or two second-degree relatives with alcohol dependence on the Family Interview for Genetics Studies (FIGS) and Family Tree Questionnaire (FTQ)] and 25 FHN negative subjects. Design: This study is a single-site, open-label protocol in psychotropic medication-free depressed subjects admitted to the Clinical Research Center s Mood and Anxiety Disorder Inpatient Research Unit (7-SE). This protocol consists of two phases (Phase I and Phase II). The first phase consists of the medication taper and drug-free period. The second phase will have three subphases: Subphase IIA ( alcohol clamp infusion #1 with neurophysiological assessments), IIB ( alcohol clamp infusion #2 during 7 Tesla-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/Imaging (7T-MRS/I)) and IIC (subanesthetic/antidepressant dose ketamine infusion during 7T-MRS/I). Outcome Measures: The primary hypothesis/outcome measure will be change in mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from the pre-ketamine infusion baseline-to-7 days post-infusion between the FHP and FHN groups. Other exploratory measures include neurophysiological responses to intravenous alcohol infusion, brain neurochemical alterations during intravenous alcohol infusion, brain neurochemical alterations during intravenous ketamine infusion and resting state (task-free) functional magnetic resonance imaging as a function of family history of an alcohol use disorder.</brief_summary>
