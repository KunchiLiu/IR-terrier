	<brief_title>Amiloride for Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of amiloride added to triple antihypertensive treatment in patients with resistant hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus in an open-labelled, non- controlled and non-randomized interventional study. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the additional effects of amiloride on: - Urinary albumin excretion - Blood pressure control, how many patients reached blood pressure control when amiloride was added to previous triple antihypertensive treatment. - Plasminogen and plasmin excretion (ENaC activity) in the micro-and macroalbuminuric patients in the cohort. - Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity</detailed_description>
