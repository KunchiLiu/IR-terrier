	<brief_summary>There is evidence that inflammatory processes may play a key role during surgical myocardial reperfusion. The hypothesis of this study is that colchicine, an anti-inflammatory agent, may lead to reduction in periprocedural infarct size, when administered during elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The study will enroll patients 18 years old or older who are eligible to undergo CABG surgery. Excluded are patients: with age &gt; 80 years old scheduled for concomitant valve surgery scheduled for coronary surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass with peripheral vascular disease aï¬€ecting the upper limbs with acute coronary syndrome within the previous 4 weeks on inotropic or mechanical circulatory support before induction of anaesthesia with any disorder that could potentially increase preoperative cTnI concentrations (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention within the previous 6 weeks) with active inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases or known malignancy under treatment with corticosteroids, antiinflammatory agents or disease modifying agents with known hypersensitivityallergy to colchicine under chronic treatment with colchicine with severe renal failure (eGFR &lt; 35 ml/min/1.73 m2) with hepatic failure (Child Pugh class B or C)</criteria>
