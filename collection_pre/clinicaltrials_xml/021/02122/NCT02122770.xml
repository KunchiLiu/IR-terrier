	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple-dose administration of fluconazole on the single-dose intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetics (PK) of MLN4924; and the effect of multiple-dose administration of itraconazole on the single-dose IV PK of MLN4924.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Fluconazole and Itraconazole CYP3A-Mediated Inhibition on the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of MLN4924 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is MLN4924. MLN4924 is being evaluated to assess drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with the moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors, fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively, in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the blood concentrations of MLN4924 as it relates to treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole. The study will enroll approximately 52 patients. In Part A, patients will be administered MLN4924 via a 1-hour (± 5 minutes) intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with either fluconazole or itraconazole administered orally. After patients complete Part A, they will have the opportunity to begin treatment in Part B. In Part B, patients will be administered MLN4924 via a 1-hour (± 5 minutes) IV infusion in combination with either docetaxel or carboplatin + paclitaxel, the three of which would also be administered intravenously. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participation in Part A of this study will include a screening visit and two weeks of treatment; participation in Part B of this study will include up to an 8-week drug washout period (from last dosing in Part A) and treatment until patients experience symptomatic deterioration, progressive disease, until treatment is discontinued for another reason, or until the study is stopped.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants 18 years of age or older. 2. Must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced and incurable solid tumor that is deemed appropriate for treatment with 1 of the 2 chemotherapy regimens in Part B of this study, or have progressed despite standard therapy, or for whom conventional therapy is not considered effective. The tumor must be radiographically or clinically evaluable or measurable. 3. Recovered (ie, ≤ Grade 1 toxicity) from the effects of prior antineoplastic therapy. 4.

Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dL or calculated/measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/minute 7. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through four months after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) 8. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 9. Participants who are willing to refrain from donating blood for at least 90 days after their final dose of MLN4924 and (for male participants) willing to refrain from donating semen for at least 4 months after their final dose of MLN4924. 1. Prior treatment with MLN4924; however, prior treatment with docetaxel, paclitaxel, and carboplatin is allowed. 2. Treatment with any systemic antineoplastic therapy or investigational products within 21 days before the first dose of study treatment. 3. Radiotherapy within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment. 4. Prior treatment with radiation therapy involving ≥ 25% of hematopoietically active bone marrow. 5. Known hypersensitivity or history of severe intolerance or toxicity to studyassigned chemotherapy.
