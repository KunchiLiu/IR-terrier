	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Although vitamin D is well known for its function in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralisation, several studies have shown immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in patients with COPD.. Objective: To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in patients with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency. Study design: Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. Study population: 240 patients aged 40 years and older with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration(25OHD)&lt;50 nmol/l) with a COPD exacerbation. An exacerbation is defined as sustained worsening of respiratory symptoms during 48 hours and requiring oral corticosteroid, antibiotic or combination treatment that was initiated by a physician. Respiratory symptoms include at least one of the Anthonisen criteria (increased dyspnoea, sputum volume or purulence). Patients with a severe vitamin D deficiency (25OHD&lt;15 nmol/l), known osteoporosis and/or use of vitamin D supplementation &gt; 400 IU per day will be excluded. Intervention: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive vitamin D3 16800 IU or placebo orally once a week during 1 year. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is exacerbation rate.</detailed_description>
