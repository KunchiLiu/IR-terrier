	<brief_summary>Fractures of the proximal humerus account for between 5% and 8% off all reported fractures. Post-operative shoulder pain is highly frequent. Due to either surgical procedure, soft tissues surrounding the shoulder area can be damaged. The purpose of the current clinical trial was to compare the effects of physiotherapy versus physiotherapy plus TrP-DN on pain and function in patients who exhibit post-operative shoulder pain after a PHILOS procedure for proximal humeral fixation or rotator cuff tear repair.</brief_summary>
