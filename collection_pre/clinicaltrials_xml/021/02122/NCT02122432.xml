	<brief_summary>In France, there is usually a long delay (approximately 6 weeks) before a general practitioner can obtain a specialized advice by dermatologists for diagnosis of "unusual" dermatologic conditions of their patients. Previous studies have shown that teledermatology is a reliable way for diagnosis in dermatology. We hypothesize that a teledermatology advice could reduce delay before diagnosis and therefore treatment for patients.</brief_summary>
