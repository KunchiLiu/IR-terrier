	<brief_title>Lifestyle vs.Surgery for Morbid Obesity Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral/lifestyle interventions produce acceptable success in treating moderately obese subjects. However, their effectiveness on weight loss and maintenance in morbidly obese subjects remains elusive. Twenty-nine morbidly obese females participated in this non-randomized study. Fifteen subjects were assigned to the lifestyle group and 14 underwent vertical banded gastroplasty. Subjects in the lifestyle group attended 30 behavioral modification sessions over three years, whereas the surgery group received the standard of care nutrition. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, physical activity, body composition measurements and dietary intake data were assessed at standard time points during the first 3 years post-intervention. Follow-up data on body weight and physical activity were also collected 9 years later.</detailed_description>
