	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well afatinib dimaleate works in treating patients with urothelial cancer that cannot be removed surgically and has grown after treatment with standard first-line chemotherapy. Afatinib dimaleate may turn off the function of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptors, which may slow the growth of cancer cells or cause some of the cells to die.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the 3-month progression free survival (PFS) rate in metastatic urothelial cancer patients receiving afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) who have progressed despite prior platinum-based chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]), median progression free survival, and overall survival for the same treated population. II. To determine whether tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or HER2 overexpression influences 3-month PFS in patients treated with afatinib. OUTLINE: Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>
