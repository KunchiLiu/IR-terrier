	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of orally administered larotrectinib in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors that have progressed or are non responsive to available therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral TRK Inhibitor LOXO-101 for Treatment of Advanced Adult Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial dose escalation phase of larotrectinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This will be followed by an expansion phase in solid tumor subjects with an NTRK fusion, documented alteration of the TRK gene or investigator documentation of perceived benefit from a TRK targeted agent. During the escalation phase, larotrectinib will be taken once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). During the expansion phase, the larotrectinib dose selected from the escalation phase will be explored in approximately 40 additional subjects. The objectives of the dose escalation phase are to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and recommended dose of orally administered larotrectinib. The objectives of the expansion phase are to better characterize the safety and efficacy of larotrectinib in patients with specific NTRK genes or proteins, or patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may derive benefit from a highly selective TRK inhibitor such as larotrectinib.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Escalation Phase [Inclusion] Locally advanced or metastatic adult solid tumor that has progressed or was nonresponsive to available therapies, are unfit for standard chemotherapy or for which no standard or available curative therapy exists; ECOG score of 0, 1 or 2; Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function; Expansion Phase [Inclusion] Escalation Phase inclusion criteria Evidence of the NTRK or TRK molecular characteristic as specified for that cohort, such as an NTRK translocation, amplifications, mutations or other alterations that may interfere with TRK signaling as previously determined with prior testing from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)certified or equivalent certified laboratory. Additionally, patients who, in the opinion and clinical judgement of the local Investigator, may derive benefit from a targeted TRK inhibitor like larotrectinib, may also enroll. Exclusion (for both Escalation and Expansion) â€¢ Current treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor or inducer (EIAEDs and dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, on a stable dose, are allowed)</criteria>
