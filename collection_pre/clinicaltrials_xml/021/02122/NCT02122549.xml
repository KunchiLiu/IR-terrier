	<brief_summary>This study will obtain device-human interaction evaluations for the HWD1000 within the controlled environment of the hospital as well as establish that the safety profile is similar to outpatient wearable cardioverter-defibrillators use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hospital Wearable Defibrillator Inpatient Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center prospective study of hospitalized patients whom a physician deems at risk of sudden cardiac arrest during the hospitalization period, wearing the HWD1000 hospital wearable defibrillator in order to evaluate caregiver and patient interactions with the device. In addition, ECG signal quality will be reviewed to confirm the HWD1000 safety profile.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients whom a physician deems at risk of sudden cardiac arrest during the hospitalization period (patients will be monitored using the hospital's telemetry system). Specific inclusion criteria are: Hospitalized patients having continuous independent ECG monitoring. Patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest during the hospitalization period as determined by the investigating physician. Patient â‰¥18 years of age (over the legal age of providing consent). Patients with an active implantable cardioverterdefibrillator. Patients with an active unipolar pacemaker. Patients with physical or mental conditions preventing them from interacting with or wearing the device as determined by the investigating physician.
