	<detailed_description>The investigators will measure exercise capacity in patients with heart failure or heart failure plus type 2 diabetes prior to and following a 12-week exercise training program (5d/wk, 30 min/d, 60-75% VO2max) to determine whether improvements in exercise capacity in response to exercise training are mitigated in patients with combined heart failure plus type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
