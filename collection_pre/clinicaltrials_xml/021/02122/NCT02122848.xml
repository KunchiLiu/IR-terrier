	<brief_title>Exercise Tolerance in Patients With Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure causes limitation of functional capacity and worsening of exercise tolerance. The airway pressure as adjuvant of cardiac rehabilitation has demonstrated improvement of functional capacity, decrease of respiratory work, increase of oxygenation and pulmonary compliance. Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the bilevel positive airway pressure (BILEVEL) in the increase of exercise tolerance in patients with decompensated heart failure. Method: this is a cross-over randomized clinical trial, with individuals who will undergo a submaximal progressive exercise test of the lower limbs with a cycle-ergometer using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and BILEVEL in a random order. Patients will also be evaluated using a health related quality of life questionnaire, pulmonary function test, inspiratory muscle and peripheral muscle strength tests. Hypothesis: The increase in exercise tolerance might be greater during the use of BILEVEL.</detailed_description>
