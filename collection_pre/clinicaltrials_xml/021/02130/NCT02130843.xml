	<brief_title>Tiemann Mounted Urodynamic Catheter Technique for Difficult Bladder Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The urodynamic catheter is mounted on a 12F Coud√© tip Tiemann catheter, which then carries the tip of the urodynamic catheter beyond the obstruction site into the bladder. The Tiemann catheter-mounted urodynamic catheter technique can serve as a suitable option to insert a urodynamic catheter into the bladder in all male patients in whom it fails due to kinking.</detailed_description>
