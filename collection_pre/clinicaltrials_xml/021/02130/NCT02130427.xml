	<brief_summary>This pilot study will determine changes over time in tumor volume/motion &amp; patient anatomy, as well as dose distributions to normal organs. The study will inform medical decision-making about need for (and timing of) re-calibration of radiation dosimetry plans. Weekly CT and/or serial MR scans will be employed for those patients receiving 7-8 wks of radiation therapy. The study will enroll 30 patients in each stratum: Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Head &amp; Neck, gastrointestinal (GI) and Gynecologic tumor.</brief_summary>

Biopsy proven diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, head and neck, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, anal, hepatic, biliary, colorectal, cervical, endometrial, vaginal, vulvar, ovarian cancer and any other gastrointestinal or gynecological cancers requiring definitive radiotherapy alone with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Able to provide written informed consent and comply with all study procedures. Entire course of radiotherapy will be delivered at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.</criteria>
