	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to understand if more frequent education of dialysis patients (patients with kidney failure who get their blood cleaned and fluid removed by a machine instead of their kidneys) on reducing sodium intake reduces the amount of fluid weight that patients gain between dialysis sessions. Patients who usually gain more fluid than is considered ideal will be recruited for this project. Because all patients gain different amounts to start, data will be collected for 3 months while the patients receive their usual amount of dietitian education. Then the patients will receive intensive (2x/month) education on reducing sodium intake from the dietitian and the same data will be collected to see if they gain less after the education. After 3 months of intensive education, data will be collected for one more month to see if patients keep gaining less or if they go back to their old patterns.</brief_summary>
