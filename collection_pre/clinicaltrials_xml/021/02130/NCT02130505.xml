	<brief_title>Inflammatory Aspects of Glucose in Hyperlipidemia and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is number one killer in the Netherlands. Insulin resistance and dyslipideima are the main causes of CVD. Recently, we have shown that there is an acute leukocyte activation after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in patients with newly-diagnosed diabets mellitus type 2 (T2DM). Leukocyte activation is an important and obligatory aspect in the process of atherosclerosis. Complement system is another important inflammatory component in atherosclerosis, which becomes activated in the postprandial phase. In this study, we will investigate both inflammatory systems in healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM on insulin therapy and hyperlipidemia (both familial hyperlipidemia (FH) and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH)) during an OGTT.</detailed_description>
