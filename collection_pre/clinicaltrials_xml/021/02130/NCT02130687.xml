	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibition attenuates the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition but not angiotensin receptor blockade or calcium channel blockade. The investigators further hypothesize that this effect is mediated by substance P.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Chronic ACE and DPP4 Inhibition on Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is growing rapidly. The majority of patients with T2DM are also taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in order to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. DPP4 and ACE inhibitors share the common vasoactive substrate substance P. Substance P acts as a vasodilator but also activates the sympathetic nervous system. Understanding the interactive effects of DPP4 and ACE inhibitors on blood pressure and neurohumoral activation has important implications for the millions of patients with T2DM who take these drugs concurrently.</detailed_description>
