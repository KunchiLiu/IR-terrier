	<brief_summary>Rubber band ligation is a simple and effective procedure for the management of hemorrhoidal disease. However, 90% of patients have some degree of discomfort associated with the procedure and up to 40% develop clinically significant pain. Some studies have used local anesthesia to reduce pain with promising results, but the use of topical anesthesia has not been reported before. The investigators hypothesize that the use of topical anesthesia before rubber band ligation significantly reduces post procedure pain.</brief_summary>
