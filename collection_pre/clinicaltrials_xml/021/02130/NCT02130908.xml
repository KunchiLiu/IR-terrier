	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot study to investigate whether intake of lean or fatty fish, or lean meat would affect parameters related to health in healthy non-obese adults, and will serve as basis for future calculation of group sizes in coming studies. Participants consumed 750g/week of fillets of fish or meat for 4 weeks. Hypothesis: High intake of either lean or fatty fish will not affect serum concentrations of lipids and inflammatory markers as well as improve glucose tolerance during the 4 week intervention period when compared to lean meat intake.</brief_summary>
