	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that there may exist different quantitative sensory profiles between radicular pain patients who respond and those who do not respond to the standard therapy of epidural steroid injections (ESI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Somatosensory Profiling in Radicular Pain Patients And it's Correlation With Treatment Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are comparing warm/cold sensation, heat/cold pain threshold, heat/cold pain tolerance, wind-up, and diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) as measured by Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) between subjects with a radicular pain condition. The investigators are comparing those who respond and those who do not respond to standard therapy (ESI) before and after the treatment.</detailed_description>
