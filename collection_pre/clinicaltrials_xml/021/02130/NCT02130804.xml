	<brief_summary>Background: The prevalence of obesity has increased throughout the last three decades due to genetic, metabolic, behavioral, and environmental factors. Obesity and high-fat western diets activate inflammatory processes, which promote development of insulin resistance as well as other metabolic complications. Increasing obesity rates are a major public health concern in the Hispanic population due to the large number of Hispanics suffering from obesity. Based on preliminary data, we propose a double-blind randomized clinical trial of Salsalate therapy in obese Hispanic young adults. Salsalate treatment shows promise for decreasing inflammation under conditions of weight stability by reducing macrophage infiltration of adipocytes. Hispanics have the greatest amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), liver fat, and inflammation when compared to other ethnic groups, thereby increasing the potential for treatment effects in this high-risk population. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate through a "proof-of-concept" trial that Salsalate induced reductions in adipose tissue inflammation are possible under conditions of weight stability. Methodology: We will recruit obese Hispanic young adults (18 - 35 years) from hospitals, clinics, and community centers. Study Endpoints: Primary outcomes will be macrophage infiltration as assessed by the presence of crown-like structures (CLS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) biopsies, liver fat, insulin sensitivity, and fasting glucose. We will also assess plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and SAT gene expression of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and insulin signaling pathways. Intervention and Follow-up: Participants will be randomly assigned to four weeks of treatment with Salsalate (4 g/d) or placebo and will be studied under weight maintenance conditions. These measures will enable us to determine if Salsalate treatment is capable of reducing adipose tissue inflammation and related metabolic outcomes in the absence of weight loss.</brief_summary>
