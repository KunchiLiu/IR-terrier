	<brief_summary>Sepsis is the body's response to a life-threatening infection. This study will determine if zinc supplementation is safe to use in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. This study will also gather preliminary information to evaluate the impact that zinc has on the immune system (the body's defense system against infection) and whether zinc can help monocytes and macrophages (specific types of cells that remove infections from the body) work more effectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Zinc Supplementation on Innate Immunity and Patient Safety in Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research has shown that zinc supplementation reduces the length and severity of some types of medical infections (examples include the cold virus and diarrhea). Because zinc has been shown to improve the immune system's function, some doctors provide mineral supplements such as zinc to their patients in the Intensive Care Unit. However, there are no studies to show how effective zinc is or that have evaluated what dose(s) of zinc are safe in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Nor have studies examined if tolerable doses for septic patients can improve how the immune system functions. If zinc is shown to improve how the immune system functions during sepsis, it could be used in the future as part of the treatment regimen for patients with sepsis.</detailed_description>
