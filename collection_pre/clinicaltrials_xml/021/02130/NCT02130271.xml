	<brief_title>PET/MRI Imaging of Neuraxial Inflammation in Sciatica Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if inflammation around the spinal nerves can be identified using a radioactive tracer [11C] PBR28 and integrated PET/MRI scan for the purpose of better treating patients who have radicular lumbar pain with epidural steroid injections.</detailed_description>
