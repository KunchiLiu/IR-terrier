	<brief_summary>The evidence linking chocolate with lowered blood pressure has been observed. However, the interventions have been short, at most 4 weeks. The aim of this study is to find out if the habitual consumption of dark chocolate for 8 weeks has an effect on blood pressure. Also, more insight to the mechanisms linking chocolate to individual healt-responses is needed.</brief_summary>
