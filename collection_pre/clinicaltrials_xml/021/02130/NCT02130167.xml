	<brief_summary>Myopia is the leading cause of blindness in Taiwan. The younger children with myopia, the higher risk of high myopia in later life and complications such as retinal detachment and maculopathy will occur. We have reported the low concentration of atropine (0.05%) with the effect on retarding the myopia progression. Recently the 0.01% atropine was also reported effective and with less visual side effects such as mydriasis. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy in controlling myopia progression and visual side effects of 2 low concentration of atropine(0.05% vs 0.01%) in children aged 6-12 years with myopia of at least -0.5 diopters (D) and astigmatism of -1.50 D or less.</brief_summary>
