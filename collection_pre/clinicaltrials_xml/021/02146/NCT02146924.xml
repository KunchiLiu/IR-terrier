	<brief_title>Cellular Immunotherapy in Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the activity and safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded memory T cells that are enriched and genetically-modified to express a cluster of differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinge optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Arm 1: CD19R(EQ)28zeta/truncated human EGFR [EGFRt]+ central memory T cells [TCM]; Arm 2: CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ naive and memory T cells [TN/NEM]) shortly following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen for adults with poor prognosis CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). II. To determine the Phase II recommended dose (RP2D). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study additional antitumor activity endpoints of CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM and CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM. II. To explore the efficacy of infusional cetuximab to eliminate transferred CD19R(EQ)CD28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM and CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. ARM I: Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-10 days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease, whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells after 28 days. ARM II: Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-10 days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease, whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cells after 28 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.</detailed_description>

additionally, CD19 positivity must be documented in a pathology report; however, it is not a requirement that the CD19 testing be performed by a COH pathologist; patients in second complete remission (CR2) or higher with history of CD19+ ALL on previous bone marrow biopsy are also eligible for the study Research participants with confirmed 1st or higher relapse of disease by morphology, cytogenetics or molecular, or research participants with refractory or residual disease * MRD will be defined in this protocol by presence of malignant cells at 0.01% or more by flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis at the completion of initial remission induction therapy Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of &gt;= 70% Life expectancy &gt;= 16 weeks at time of enrollment Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for six months following duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately All research participants must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent Note: For research participants who do not speak English, a short form consent may be used with a COH certified interpreter/translator to proceed with screening and leukapheresis, while the request for a translated full consent in processed; however, the research participant is allowed to proceed with lymphodepletion and T cell infusion only after the translated full consent form is signed PROTOCOLSPECIFIC CRITERIA: COH pathology review confirms that research participant's diagnostic material is consistent with ALL;
