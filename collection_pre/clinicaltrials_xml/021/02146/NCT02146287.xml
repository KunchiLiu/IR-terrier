	<brief_summary>Preterm babies cared for in the intensive care nursery are exposed to amounts of light that are very different from the exposures to an unborn baby or the newborn term baby. Currently many nurseries try to protect premature babies from too much light. They may also try to create light conditions of day and night like many parent homes. Some studies have shown improvements in health and development of babies cared for in nurseries that try to change light for premature babies.</brief_summary>
