	<brief_title>Renal Denervation in Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are theoretical reasons why renal denervation might be beneficial for patients with chronic heart failure. It is not known whether they would suffer large drops in blood pressure which might compromise safety. This pilot study required patients to remain in hospital for one week during which they had careful monitoring of blood pressure with the ability to halt the trial if any patient suffered any dangerous effect such as a large drop in blood pressure. It also monitored blood pressure after discharge for six months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients were required to have chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure (NYHA class III or IV) on maximal tolerated medical therapy, including betablocker, ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and spironolactone. Clinically unstable patients or those with significant valvular disease An estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;35 ml/min Unfavourable renal anatomy Tortuous femoral arteries were not eligible</criteria>
