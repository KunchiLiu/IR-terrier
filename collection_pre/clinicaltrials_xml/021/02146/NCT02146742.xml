	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Single Ascending Doses of ASP1707 in Healthy Young Japanese Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first group receives the lowest dose while the last group receives the highest dose. ASP1707 or matching placebo is administered as a single dose under fasted conditions. Screening takes place from Day -22 to Day -2. Subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -1 and remain until Day 5. An end of study visit (ESV) takes place 7-14 days after discharge. Escalation to the next higher dose takes place after review of the safety and tolerability data from the previous dose. Safety assessments are performed throughout the study. Plasma and urine samples are collected for pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. Serum samples are collected for pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis.</detailed_description>
