	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial will implement and evaluate the effects of a pediatric continuity care intensivist (CCI) program. The study will evaluate how effective the modified communication training for providers is to perform this new role. The primary outcome for the study is whether a CCI will affect several patient level outcomes for patients who have been admitted to the PICU longer than 7 days. Patient length of stay, hospital acquired conditions, time to limitations of interventions and new medical technology will be assessed comparing the intervention and usual care arms. The study will also determine the impact of the CCI program on parent/family satisfaction with provider communication and decision-making for their child.</detailed_description>
