	<brief_summary>In this study, HIV-infected patients with poor recovery of CD4+ T cells and successful viral control after treatment with antiretroviral therapy will be enrolled to receive once a day Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Immune parameters will be monitored for 12 weeks in both arms. The main outcome is CD4+ T cell recovery. Secondary outcomes will include NK cells and T cells immune parameters.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, HIV-infected patients with poor recovery of CD4+ T cells and successful viral control after treatment with antiretroviral therapy will be enrolled to receive once a day Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo in a double-blind, randomized fashion. The main objective is to investigate whether the continuous, once a day, 12-weeks use of Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota could affect immunological parameters in HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral treatment with poor CD4+ T cell recovery. A total of 48 volunteers will be followed for 12 week after initiation of daily use of Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo, randomized in a 1:1 ratio. We hypothesize that use of the Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota after 12 weeks of continuous use will increase the level of CD4+ T-cells, at least, 50 cells/mmÂ³. We also propose to investigate several markers of immune response, including T cellular activation and NK cells function, and changes in the intestinal microbiota.</detailed_description>
