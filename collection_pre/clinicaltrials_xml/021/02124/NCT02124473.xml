	<brief_summary>Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care clinicians and specialists worldwide. Patients with RHTN have higher rates of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with patients with more easily controlled hypertension. In addition, RHTN is often complicated by metabolic abnormalities. Homeopathy, although widely used in hypertension, but no study has been taken to evaluate the impact on resistant hypertension. The aim of this trial was to evaluate individualized homeopathy on BP in patients with resistant hypertension.</brief_summary>
