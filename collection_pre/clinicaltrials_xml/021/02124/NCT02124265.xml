	<brief_summary>In patients with moderate to severe thermal injuries (&gt; 20% TBSA) adequate fluid resuscitation is the main priority to achieve successful outcomes. Soon after burn injury substantial amounts of fluid accumulate rapidly in the wound while more is lost in the third space. Without intervention this process leads to hypotension and shock. The Parkland formula was devised to calculate how much intravenous (IV) fluid, i.e. crystalloids, is needed for adequate resuscitation during the first 24 hours post-burn. However, IV resuscitation can lead to overexpansion of (third space) volume, leading to severe complications such as compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema. In major population centers, catastrophic events causing mass casualties will disrupt many hospital and emergency services, potentially delaying acute IV fluid resuscitation. Burn patient case reports have shown that oral rehydration therapy (ORT) used to supplement or in place of IV therapy is efficacious. ORT could be easily applied in mass burn casualties. ORT is generally known in the third world for treating life-threatening dehydration due to diarrhea. The glucose-sodium co transport mechanism enables the affected human intestine to absorb a sufficient amount of water and electrolytes to replace large fluid losses due to severe diarrhea, even under adverse field conditions. No electrolyte disturbances have been recorded in such cases. Studies on enteral resuscitation in animal burn models showed high rates of small intestinal absorption which should be adequate for resuscitation following major burn injury. The optimal composition of oral rehydration solution for resuscitation in burn wounds has not been determined. In cholera patients, Ceralyte速 has proven superior to the WHO Oral Rehydration Solution, increasing fluid absorption of the intestine. The Ceralyte速 90 solution, with 90mEq/L sodium and a low osmolarity of &lt;275mOsm, may also contribute to optimal intestinal fluid uptake without causing electrolyte disturbances in thermal injury. ORT use might reduce the occurrence of compartment syndrome and pulmonary edema since fluid is regulated by the intestine according to physiologic requirements. The investigators propose to conduct a prospective study using Ceralyte速 90 to show that oral resuscitation therapy (ORT) in burns can reduce the total amount of IV fluid needed for adequate resuscitation and to test the efficacy and safety of ORT in the resuscitation of burn patients.</brief_summary>
