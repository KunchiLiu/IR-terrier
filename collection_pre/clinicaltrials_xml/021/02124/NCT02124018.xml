	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the prevalence and the prognostic value of non-invasive indexes and programmed ventricular stimulation for sudden cardiac death in post-MI patients with LVEF &gt;40%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Stratification in Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1000 asymptomatic post-MI patients&gt;40%, at least 40 days till 3 years post-MI, revascularized or without needing further revascularization (in any case without any evidence of ischemia) will be enrolled. The patients will be divided into two categories: 1. Asymptomatic patients with revascularized STEMI (remaining stenoses in non culprit vessels &lt;70%) at 40 days post-MI (when LVEF&gt;40% will be re-assessed) 2. Asymptomatic patients late (at any time after 40 days) after MI (initially STEMI-NSTEMI at discharge Q-non Q) with LVEF&gt;40% right after a negative stress test or right after a negative for stenoses control coronary catheterization All patients will undergo non-invasive evaluation (ECG, Holter monitoring and 45-min high resolution recording). In case they fulfill at least one out of seven pre-specified criteria they will undergo programmed ventricular stimulation and ICD implantation (if inducible) All patients will be followed-up for 3 years for sudden cardiac death and its surrogate (appropriate ICD activation)</detailed_description>
