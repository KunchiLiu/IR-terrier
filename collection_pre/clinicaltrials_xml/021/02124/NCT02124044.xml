	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated 180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading indication for liver transplantation. Within HIV/HCV co-infected patients, liver disease due to Hepatitis C progresses even more rapidly. While combination of ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV alone in HCV monoinfected patients, treatment is still associated with a high incidence of adverse events (AEs), discontinuations and poor cure rates in several populations. Within the HIV/HCV co-infected population treatment for HCV remains complicated given drug interactions between anti-retrovirals and HCV protease inhibitors, in addition to the extensive side-effects due to PEG +RBV alone. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a combination of anti-virals which target HCV without interferon (IFN) can cure HCV, without additional toxicities. These novel therapies that do not rely on an IFN backbone may additionally enhance cure rates in HIV/HCV co-infected, a population which has historically been difficult to cure. This is an open label study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of asunaprevir (ASV) 100 mg BID and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg daily (selective HCV NS3 and NS5A inhibitors respectively) in 20 HIV/HCV co-infected treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve and treatment experienced HCV genotype 1b individuals. The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.</brief_summary>

Liver biopsy obtained within 36 calendar months prior to the baseline (Day 0) visit to verify the presence or absence of cirrhosis, except as indicated below. If no recent (&lt;36 months) liver biopsy is available, a liver biopsy may be performed prior to the baseline visit. 1. Cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following: 1. Any biopsy showing cirrhosis (at any time, not restricted to the 36 calendar months prior to baseline visit). 2. A FibroSUR[trademark] score, of &gt;0.75 and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) platelet ratio index (APRI) of &gt;2 within the last year. 2.

A FibroSUR[trademark] score, within the last year, of &lt;0.48 and an APRI of &lt;1. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by the criteria detailed above, a liver biopsy is required. The FibroSURE[trademark]test can be performed and the results can be used to determine the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with Child Pugh B or C cirrhotics are excluded 9. Ability to communicate effectively with the study investigator and other key personnel. 10. Willingness to comply with the study restrictions and requirements. 11. Opioiddependent individuals must be participating in a supervised treatment program. 12. Subjects must have an external primary care doctor (outside of the Clinical Center and the NIH) for their medical management. 13.

Otherwise healthy status as determined by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory measurements performed at screening. Contraception The effects of ASV and DCV on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to study entry and until 5 weeks (women ) and 14 weeks (men) after last dose of study medication. Hormonal contraception is NOT considered an effective form of birth control for female subjects on this study. Oral contraceptives are not as effective in women taking ASV and DCV so women cannot rely on this form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Females of childbearingage must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving ASV and DCV. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects of being pregnant during the course of the study, she should inform the study staff and her primary care physician immediately. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1.
