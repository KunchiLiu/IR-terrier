	<brief_summary>This is a 3-part (Part A, Part B, Part C), Phase I/IIa, multi-center, open label, study in pediatric subjects with refractory or recurrent tumors. Part A is a repeat dose, dose escalation monotherapy study that will identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) on the continuous dosing schedule using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation procedure. Part B will evaluate the preliminary activity of trametinib monotherapy in 4 disease-specific cohorts of subjects. Each cohort will enroll at least 10 response-evaluable subjects (evaluable for response is defined as a subject with a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose disease assessment or clinical assessment of progression of disease). Part C is will be a 3+3 study design to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary activity of the RP2D of trametinib in combination with a limited dose escalation of dabrafenib. Part C will enroll up to 18 subjects. . The overall goal of this trial is to efficiently establish safe, pharmacologically relevant dose of trametinib in infants, children and adolescents and determine preliminary activity of trametinib monotherapy in selected recurrent, refractory or unresectable childhood tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General Eligibility Criteria (All Parts) Written informed consent a signed informed consent and/or assent (as age appropriate) for study participation including PK sampling will be obtained according to institutional guidelines. Male or female between one month and &lt;18 years of age (inclusive) at the time of signing the informed consent form (Part C between 12 months and &lt;18 years of age, inclusive). Must have a disease that is relapsed/refractory to all potentially curative standard treatment regimens or must have a current disease for which there is no known curative therapy, or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life. Prior therapy: The subject's disease (i.e. cancer, neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1] with plexiform neurofibroma [PN], or Langerhans cell histocytosis [LCH]) must have relapsed after or failed to respond to frontline curative therapy or there must not be other potentially curative treatment options available. Curative therapy may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or any combination of these modalities. All subjects must have recovered to grade &lt;=1 from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to enrollment. Prior therapy includes; myelosuppressive chemotherapy, differentiating agents/ biologic response modifiers (small molecules, antibodies, viral therapies) (anticancer agent), nonmyelosuppressive anticancer agents, investigational agent, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation or infusion, number of prior treatment regimens, colony stimulating factors, corticosteroids.

Additionally, females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to start of study drugs, throughout treatment period and for 4 months after last dose of study drugs. Must have adequate organ function as defined by the following values: renal function 24 hr creatinine clearance (revised Schwartz formula), or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;=60 milliliter (mL) per minute per 1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73m^2); or a serum creatinine &lt;=upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and gender; liver functions as bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) &lt;=1.5 x ULN for age, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2.5 x ULN; for the purposes of enrollment and toxicity monitoring the ULN for ALT will be 45 unit per liter (U/L); cardiac function corrected QT (QTcB) interval &lt;480 milliseconds (msec), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=lower limit of normal (LLN) by ECHO. Able to swallow and retain enterally (per oral [PO] or nasogastric or gastric tube) administered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels. Adequate Blood Pressure Control defined as: Blood pressure &lt;= the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender. French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Specific Eligibility Criteria, Part A Subjects must meet general eligibility criteria. For the initial dose escalation to identify the maximum tolerable or PK target dose, age between 2 years and &lt;18 years (inclusive) at the time of signing the informed consent form. Children &lt; 2 years of age will be enrolled once the age specific expansion cohorts are open. Histologically confirmed solid tumors, which may include but are not limited to rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatic tumors, germ cell tumors, primary brain tumors, NF1 associated PF and LCH. In subjects with brain stem gliomas the requirement for histological confirmation can be waived if a biopsy was not performed. For plexiform neurofibromas, histologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and radiological findings, but should be considered if malignant degeneration of a PN is clinically suspected. Measurable or evaluable tumors. Subjects with neuroblastoma that is only detectable by Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan are eligible. Subjects with neuroblastoma that is only detected by bone marrow aspirate/biopsy or elevated homovanillic acid / vanillylmandelic acid (HVA/VMA) are not eligible.
