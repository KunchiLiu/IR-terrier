	<brief_summary>A study in healthy males to look at how multiple doses of TA-8995 affect blood levels and rate of removal of other drugs, using single doses of digoxin and midazolam as examples, to see if there are any potential drug interactions that might affect patients in future studies. The study will examine whether co-administration of TA-8995 affects the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and midazolam measured by area under the curve (AUC).</brief_summary>
