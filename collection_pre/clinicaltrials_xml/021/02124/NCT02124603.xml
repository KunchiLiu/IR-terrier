	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to elucidate the spectrum of ocular flora and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in patients undergoing routine cataract surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microbiological Evaluation of the Ocular Flora Before Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A conjunctival and palpebral swab will executed at least 14 days before routine cataract surgery. Isolates will be identified using standard microbiological protocols. In vitro susceptibility will be determined using a breakpoint minimal inhibitory concentrations. In case of positivity, the swab will be repeated the day of surgery. Topical antibiotic may be used in case of positivity at the discretion of the surgeon. Descriptive statistics will be calculated.</detailed_description>
