	<brief_summary>This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination regimen of ALA-PDT (Aminolevulinate-Photodynamic Therapy) to a conventional regimen for treatment of actinic keratoses. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination approach will be less painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is being done to compare two modified versions of the standard ALA-PDT (Aminolevulinate-Photodynamic Therapy) treatment of actinic keratoses. The treatment has been modified in one of two ways, either: (#1) a shortened incubation time (1 hr), or (#2) light exposure that begins immediately after application of the Levulan. We hypothesize that this will yield a therapeutic efficacy equivalent to the standard ALA-PDT regimen, but will cause less pain during the light exposure. The study employs a bilateral design in which the left versus right sides of the treatment area are compared on the same patient.</detailed_description>
