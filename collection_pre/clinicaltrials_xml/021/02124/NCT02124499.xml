	<brief_summary>Prospective association study to analyse perioperative patients' outcome. Outcome comprises intraoperative and postoperative complications e.g. cardio-vascular events, allergic reactions, postoperative side-effects like nausea and vomiting, impaired wound healing, increased or decreased drug effects, severe pain, long-lasting pain as well as long-term outcome. Possible variables which might have on influence: patient- and surgery-related data, patients' genetic background etc.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Anesthesia and surgery are related to unwanted adverse events, side effects and postoperative discomfort. Whereas severe complications like cardiovascular events are rare, postoperative side effects like nausea and vomiting, pain, long-lasting pain and pain-related interference of daily activities are frequent. The question arises which patient is at specific risk for these sequelae. Pre-existing predisposing factors (e.g. patients' genetic background), surgery- and anesthesia-related variables (drugs, techniques administered for anesthesia and analgesia) as well as psychological and social factors might influence the outcome. In this prospective association study these variables will be investigated in a well-described patient cohort presenting for scheduled surgery. Objective The aim of this study is to associate perioperative and postoperative complications and side effects as well as long-term outcome after surgery to patient- and surgery-related variables, including genetic variants.
