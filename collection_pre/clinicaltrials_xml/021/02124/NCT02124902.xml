	<brief_summary>This is a single arm open label phase II study in women with clinical stage 2 or 3 triple negative breast cancer to assess the anti-tumor activity (in terms of pathologic complete response rate) of neoadjuvant docetaxel in combination with carboplatin. Patient derived xenografts will also be developed simultaneously for the purposes of genoproteomic analysis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Newly diagnosed clinical stage II or III breast cancer with complete surgical excision of the breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as the treatment goal. Patients with PR+ tumors are allowed. HER2 negative by FISH or IHC staining 0 or 1+. ER less than Allred score of 3 or less than 1% positive staining cells in the invasive component of the tumor Tumor size at least 2cm in one dimension by clinical or radiographic exam (WHO criteria). Patients with palpable lymph nodes may be enrolled regardless of tumor size. At least 18 years of age. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Serum bilirubin within (or under ) normal limits (OR total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x IULN with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert Syndrome) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) within (or under ) normal limits Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Patients may be pre or postmenopausal. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). If consenting to participate in the optional PET/MR imaging substudy, the patient must be able to tolerate PET/MRI with intravenous contrast administration and must complete the applicable MRI screening evaluation form Prior systemic therapy for the indexed breast cancer. A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with bilateral or inflammatory breast cancer. Currently receiving any other investigational agents. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to docetaxel or carboplatin. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry if premenopausal. Known HIVpositivity. Sentinel lymph node biopsy For patients who agree to participate in PET/MR imaging: renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) measured within the past 60 days which precludes safe administration of the contrast agent on dialysis prior allergic reaction to gadoliniumbased MR contrast agents</criteria>
