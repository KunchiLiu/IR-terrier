	<brief_summary>Our aim is to establish multi-center national Egyptian database of information for inherited and acquired neuromuscular diseases in infants and children from 0 to 18 years of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Registry for Egyptian Pediatric Neuromuscular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: An open-ended multi-center, national Egyptian study to collect and analyze data for children with Neuromuscular Diseases (NMD) inherited NMD (spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne/Becker and congenital muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD, CMD), congenital myopathies, and congenital myasthenic syndromes) and acquired NMD (neuropathies, myasthenia gravis and myositis). Participants: Eligible infants and children with inherited and acquired neuromuscular diseases. DESIGN: This study is a prospective cohort study. Outcome measures: Motor development assessment, respiratory and cardiac examination.</detailed_description>
