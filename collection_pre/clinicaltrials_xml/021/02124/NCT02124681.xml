	<brief_summary>Current options to treat insulin resistance in diabetes are fairly limited. For this reason, novel treatments would represent a major progress. The generic drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has poorly understood effects on blood sugar metabolism. In this study, the investigators will examine the mechanisms by which this drug affects glucose metabolism and which cells are affected. Findings emanating from this project will help establish whether HCQ may be a viable treatment for disorders of glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
