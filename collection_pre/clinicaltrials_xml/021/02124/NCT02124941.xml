	<brief_summary>Given prior evidence of reduced resting-state glucose uptake in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as measured by [18F]-FDG PET (Volkow 1992, 1993) and direct neurometabolic coupling of cortical glucose oxidation and glutamate transmission, we hypothesize that [13C]-MRS measures of VTCA and VCYC will be reduced in individuals abstinent from cocaine as compared to HCs. We will also explicitly explore potential relationships between VCYC and neurocognitive tests of PFC function and clinical outcomes (i.e., measures of relapse at 90-days outpatient follow-up). In addition to assessing resting-state glucose uptake in the PFC, we will explore whether open-label administration of either of three different pharmacological treatments (N-acetyl cysteine, riluzole, or pentoxifylline) increases VCYC, in cocaine users (CU) in comparison to their abstinence baseline.</brief_summary>
