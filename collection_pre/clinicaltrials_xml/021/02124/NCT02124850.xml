	<brief_summary>Protocol VRXP-A106 will enroll patients with Stage II-IVA head and neck cancer patients who will be treated with surgical resection. Cetuximab and motolimod (Cohort 1); and cetuximab, motolimod, and nivolumab (Cohort 2) will be administered for a 3-4 week period before surgery. The primary objective of the study is to determine the extent to which the administration of neoadjuvant motolimod plus cetuximab and motolimod plus cetuximab and nivolumab modulates immune biomarkers (NK, mDC and T cell activation as well as tumor infiltration and serum cytokines) in peripheral blood and head and neck cancer tumors. An exploratory objective of the study is to assess whether modulation of biomarkers as described above can predict anti-tumor response.</brief_summary>
