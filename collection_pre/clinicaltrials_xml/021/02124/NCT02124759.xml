	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high fat consumption on the intestinal microbiome, metabolic endotoxemia, and insulin action, in lean normal glucose tolerant subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanism of Microbiome-induced Insulin Resistance in Humans (Aim 1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will test the hypothesis that a high fat diet given to lean, normal glucose tolerant subjects will modify gut microbiome composition and enhance intestinal permeability, which will increase plasma LPS concentration, induce an inflammatory response in peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle), and impair insulin signaling and sensitivity. Also we will test the hypothesis that the inflammatory response and insulin resistance caused by high fat ingestion can be ameliorated by administering - a synbiotic (Bifidobacterium longum R0175 and oligofructose) which protects the intestinal epithelial barrier and decreases intestinal translocation of LPS; and - sevelamer, an agent which sequesters lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gastrointestinal tract limiting its translocation into the circulation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Both genders. All races and ethnic groups. Premenopausal women in the follicular phase, nonlactating, and with a negative pregnancy test. Postmenopausal women on stable dose of or not exposed to hormone replacement for ≥6 months. Hematocrit (HCT)≥ 34%, serum creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dl, and normal serum electrolytes, urinalysis, and coagulation tests. Liver function tests (LFTs) up to 2 times normal. Stable body weight (±2%) for ≥ 3 months Two or less sessions of strenuous exercise/wk for last 6 months. Presence of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance based on ADA criteria. Current treatment with drugs known to affect glucose and lipid homeostasis. If the subject has been on a stable dose for the past 3 months, the following agents will be permitted: calcium channel blockers, βblockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins History of allergy to sevelamer. History of Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or systemic steroid use for more than a week within 3 months. Current treatment with anticoagulants (warfarin). Aspirin (up to 325 mg) and clopidogrel will be permitted if these can be held for seven days prior to the biopsy in accordance with the primary physician. Use of agents that affect gut flora (e.g. antibiotics, colestyramine, lactulose, PEG) within 3 months. History of heart disease (New York Heart Classification greater than grade II; more than nonspecific STT wave changes on the ECG), peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease, smokers. Poorly controlled blood pressure (systolic BP&gt;170, diastolic BP&gt;95 mmHg). Active inflammatory, autoimmune, hepatic, gastrointestinal, malignant, and psychiatric disease. History of gastrointestinal surgery or gastrointestinal obstruction within two years.</criteria>
