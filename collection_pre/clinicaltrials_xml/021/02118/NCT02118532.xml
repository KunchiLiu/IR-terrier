	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 85 years. Subject with documented diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) classified as Rutherford class 234 in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or proximal popliteal artery (PPA) above the knee, located in the arterial segment starting at least 1 cm beyond the Common femoral artery (CFA) bifurcation between the superficial and profunda femoris arteries (proximal anatomical landmark to the distal P1 segment of the popliteal artery at the level of the proximal edge of the patella (distal anatomical landmark). Target lesion consists of a single de novo or nonstented restenotic lesion (or a tandem lesion) or is a combination lesion Reference vessel diameter ≥ 4 mm and ≤ 7 mm by visual estimate. Subject able to walk without assistive devices (e.g. walker, cane). If subject has ipsilateral/contralateral iliac disease that requires treatment during the index procedure Angiographic evidence of adequate distal runoff to the foot (at least one native calf vessel [posterior tibial, anterior tibial, or peroneal arteries] is patent, defined as &lt; 50% diameter stenosis). Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test ≤ 7 days before index procedure and willing to use a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study or must have documented adequate birth control. Signed and dated Patient Informed Consent (PIC) form. Understands and accepts the duration of the study and is able and willing to comply with all requirements, including followup visits and evaluations. Life expectancy, in the Investigator's opinion, of at least 12 months. In the investigator's opinion subject is unlikely to comply with the followup schedule. Stroke or STEMI within the 3 months prior to index procedure. Either local or systemic thrombolytic therapy within 48 hours prior to the index procedure. Inability to tolerate oral anticoagulation therapy (blood thinners such as warfarin) while on concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, aspirin (ASA), other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies, and/or paclitaxel or an allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately pretreated prior to the index procedure. Breastfeeding woman. Chronic renal insufficiency with serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL within 14 days prior to index procedure. WBC &lt; 3.0 (3,000 cells/mm3) within 14 days prior to index procedure. PLT count &lt; 80,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 within 14 days prior to index procedure. Known or suspected active systemic infection evidenced by WBC &gt; 14.0 (14000/mm3) within 14 days prior to index procedure. Diagnosed with bleeding diatheses or hypercoagulable state. Subject is enrolled in another investigational device, drug or biologic study or subject was previously enrolled to the IN.PACT SFA China trial. Any major (e.g., cardiac. peripheral, abdominal) surgical procedure or intervention performed within 30 days prior to the index procedure. Any major (e.g., cardiac. peripheral, abdominal) elective procedure or intervention within 30 days post index procedure. Contralateral SFA/PPA disease requiring treatment in the same setting as index procedure. Presence of additional lesions in the target vessel that require treatment during index procedure but do not meet the definitions of tandem lesions. Target lesion is an instent or postDEB restenosis or has been previously treated with bypass surgery. Failure to successfully cross the target lesion with a guide wire Lesion within or adjacent to an aneurysm. Acute or subacute thrombus in the target vessel. Angiographic evidence of severe calcification Target lesion known in advance of enrollment to require treatment with alternative therapy such as drugeluting stent (DES), drugeluting balloon (DEB), laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, reentry devices, cutting/scoring balloon, brachytherapy. Use of embolic protection devices is also prohibited. Predilation resulted in a major ( ≥ Grade D) flowlimiting dissection (observed on 2 orthogonal views) or residual stenosis &gt; 70% and translesional peak gradient &gt; 10mm Hg.</criteria>
