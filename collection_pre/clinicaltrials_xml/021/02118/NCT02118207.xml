	<brief_summary>SCUBA diving frequently involves repetitive exposures over multiple days. The goal of this study was to see how exercise impacts microparticles (MPs), endothelial function, and venous gas emboli (VGE) over a series of dives. 16 divers in 2 groups each completed 6 dives. One group completed 3 control dives followed by 5 days rest then 3 dives preceded by exercise. The other group completed the opposite protocol. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) data and blood for MP analysis was collected before and after each dive. VGE were monitored via transthoracic echocardiography 30, 60, and 90 min after surfacing. Exercise before diving consisted of 60 min running outdoors including 8x4 min intervals at 90% VO2max effort.</brief_summary>
