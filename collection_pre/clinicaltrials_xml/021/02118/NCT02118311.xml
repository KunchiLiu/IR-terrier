	<brief_summary>This is a Simon's optimal two-stage phase II trial designed to estimate grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after infusion of T regulatory (nTreg) in a fixed dose ratio to the combined CD3+ cell count of the two graft units in recipients of double UCB transplantation. The nTreg cells (manufactured from a 3rd cord blood unit) are infused on day 0 at least 1 hour after the 2nd unit of the double umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant. The nTreg cells require an 18 day (±2 days) lead time based on the planned transplant day. The combined CD3+ cell content from the two graft UCB units is enumerated upon thaw (day 0). The patient then receives the number of nTregs cells from the 3rd cord product to achieve a Treg:CD3+ cells ratio of 5:1. The nTreg cell dose depends on the CD3+ cell content of the two graft UCB graft units, but it will not exceed the highest dose level safely tested in the ongoing University of Minnesota phase I Treg dose escalation study MT 2006-01.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must be ≥18, but &lt; 70 years of age with no matched 5/6 or 6/6 sibling donor patients ≥ 70 and ≤ 75 years of age may be eligible if they have a CoMorbidity score ≤ 2 (Appendix II) Three UCB units composing the graft will be selected according to the current University of Minnesota umbilical cord blood graft selection algorithm. Each UCB unit must be matched at 46 HLAA, B, DRB1 antigens with the recipient. This may include 02 antigen mismatches at the A or B or DRB1 loci. Each unit must be a 46 HLAA, B, DRB1 antigen match to each other, not necessarily at the same loci they are matched to the recipient. Disease Criteria Acute Leukemias: Must be in remission by morphology (&lt;5% blasts). Note cytogenetic relapse or persistent disease without morphologic relapse is acceptable. Also a small percentage of blasts that is equivocal between marrow regeneration versus early relapse are acceptable provided there are no associated cytogenetic markers consistent with relapse. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1) that is NOT considered favorablerisk as defined by the presence of at least one of the following: Adverse cytogenetics such as t(9;22), t(1;19), t(4;11), other MLL rearrangements White blood cell counts of greater than 30,000/mcL (BALL) or greater than 100,000/mcL (TALL) at diagnosis Recipient age older than 30 years at diagnosis Time to CR greater than 4 weeks Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) that is NOT considered as favorablerisk. Favorable risk is defined as having one of the following: t(8,21) without CKIT mutation inv(16) without CKIT mutation or t(16;16) Normal karyotype with mutated NPM1 and not FLTIND Normal karyotype with double mutated CEBPA APL in first molecular remission at end of consolidation Acute Leukemias in 2nd or subsequent CR Biphenotypic/Undifferentiated in first or subsequent CR, adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma in first or subsequent complete remission (CR) Burkitt's Lymphoma in CR2 or subsequent complete remission (CR) Natural Killer Cell Malignancies Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia: all types except refractory blast crisis. Chronic phase patients must have failed or been intolerant to at least one tyrosinekinase inhibitor Myelodysplastic Syndrome: any subtype including refractory anemia (RA) if severe pancytopenia or complex cytogenetics. Blasts must be less than 5%. If 5% or more requires induction therapy pretransplant to reduce blast count to ≤5%. LargeCell Lymphoma, Hodgkin Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma with chemotherapy sensitive disease that has failed or patients who are ineligible for an autologous transplant. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Marginal Zone BCell Lymphoma, Follicular Lymphoma, which have progressed within 12 months of achieving a partial or complete remission. Patients who had remissions lasting &gt; 12 months, are eligible after at least two prior therapies. Patients with bulky disease should be considered for debulking chemotherapy before transplant. Patients with refractory disease are eligible, unless has bulky disease and an estimated tumor doubling time of less than one month. Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma, MantleCell Lymphoma, Prolymphocytic Leukemia are eligible after initial therapy if chemotherapy sensitive. Patients must have undergone an autologous transplant ≤ 12 months prior to allogeneic transplantation or have received multiagent or immunosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 months of the preparative regimen. Adequate performance status defined as a Karnofsky score ≥ 70% Adequate organ function within 14 days (30 days for cardiac and pulmonary) of enrollment defined as: Renal: creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL, for patient with a creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dL or a history of renal dysfunction an estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 is required Hepatic: bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal, Pulmonary function: DLCOcorr &gt; 40% normal, Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 35% Voluntary written consent signed before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care Untreated active infection at time of transplantation History of HIV infection Pregnant or breast feeding. The agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into breast milk. Females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to registration to rule out pregnancy Prior allogeneic transplantation Less than 3 months from myeloablative conditioning for autologous transplantation</criteria>
