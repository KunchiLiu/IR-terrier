	<brief_summary>Induction of autologous repair chondrogenesis to regenerate injured articular cartilage using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) after in vitro expansion under restricted culturing conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Knee Cartilage Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fourteen patients from both genders, age range 40-68, will be enrolled according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, divided into two equal groups based upon receiving autologous MSCs alone, or MSCs supported by platelet lysate through percutaneous injection. The patients are followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the injected knee. The investigators hypothesize that the two groups will give satisfactory clinical outcomes, but the investigators are looking forward to assessing the best product that will activate chondrogenesis and heal cartilaginous injury.</detailed_description>
