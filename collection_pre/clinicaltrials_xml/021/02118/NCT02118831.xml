	<brief_summary>Comparable data for bevacizumab and aflibercept are lacking, as are studies comparing the systemic levels of ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept and their relative effects on circulating vascular endothelial growth factor. In the present prospective study, the investigators evaluated serum drug levels and plasma free vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration following intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, bevacizumab and aflibercept.</brief_summary>
