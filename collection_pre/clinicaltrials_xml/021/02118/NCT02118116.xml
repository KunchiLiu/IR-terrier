	<brief_summary>Gatekeeper training is where people in the community are trained to recognize and identify those who are at risk for suicide and assist them in getting care. Gatekeeper training has been widely implemented around the world. There are two types of gatekeepers: 1) Designated gatekeepers - individuals who have been trained in helping professions (medicine, psychology, social work, nursing), and 2) Emergent gatekeepers - individuals who are not in caregiving roles (family members, police, teachers, clergy). Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) has been implemented in Manitoba. However, a recent randomized controlled trial in First Nations community members (emergent gatekeepers) from the Swampy Cree Tribal Council (Northwestern Manitoba) demonstrated that the training had no positive impact on self-reported gatekeeper skills or behavior. Also, compared to a resilience retreat, the ASIST training was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation. The demonstrated lack of efficacy and the possibility of adverse effects associated with this training program in this vulnerable group have raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of ASIST. There were several key limitations of the previous study. First, the study only recruited community members (emergent gatekeepers), therefore findings may not be generalizable to designated gatekeepers (clinicians, nurses, counselors). Second, the study had a small sample size (n=55) and may have not been large enough to detect small effects that are often associated with educational interventions. Finally, the increase in distress in the ASIST trained group may not have been directly related to the training. To overcome the above limitations, we aim to conduct a larger evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of gatekeeper training that is occurring in Manitoba First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities. Based on previous work that suggests designated gatekeepers are more likely to benefit from gatekeeper training than emergent gatekeepers, we will examine these groups separately. Hypotheses: 1) ASIST will be associated with an increase in gatekeeper skills and behaviors; 2) ASIST will have a stronger impact on designated gatekeepers than emergent gatekeepers; 3) ASIST will not be associated with an increase in suicidal ideation or distress.</brief_summary>
