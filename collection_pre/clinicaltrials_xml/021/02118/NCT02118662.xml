	<brief_summary>The study is designed to measure the energy expenditure associated with a common office task (i.e., typing) while 1.) seated in an office chair, 2.) pedaling using a prototype pedal desk, and 3.) walking on a treadmill.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure During Seated, Seated Cycling, and Treadmill Walking Work Conditions (EE-Work)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anthropometrics will be measured first. The height and body weight will be collected by clinic staff in the clinic. The metabolic testing of all conditions will take place in a real office setting. The participant will be fitted with a heart rate monitor fastened around their chest using an elastic strap. They will also be fitted with a portable metabolic system (COSMED). This unit fits around their waist and back, much like a backpack. The unit is attached to a face mask that fits over their mouth and nose and is secured by elastic straps which wrap around their head. The participants will first rest motionless in a chair for 20 minutes. Following this, they will complete three different simulated working conditions by typing at a computer while 1) seated in an office chair, 2) seated pedaling while using a prototype pedal desk, and 3) walking on a treadmill. The order of testing for the seated pedaling and treadmill walking working conditions will be counterbalanced with participants randomly assigned to the two possible order permutations. They will complete the 3 working conditions for 15 minutes each at their own self-selected level of effort. A rest period of 5 minutes will be given between each condition. During the working conditions, they will be asked to retype a displayed standard set of text.</detailed_description>
