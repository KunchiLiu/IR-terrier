	<brief_summary>This is a single center phase I trial designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the oral IDO inhibitor INCB024360 when administered as part of a larger regimen of intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of haploidentical donor NK cells and IL-2 after a non-myeloablative cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (Cy/Flu) preparative regimen for the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Natural Killer Cells and INCB024360 for Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haploidentical donor NK cells and the 1st dose of IL-2 are infused intraperitoneally (IP) after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. IP IL-2 continues three times a week for 5 additional doses. INCB024360, at the assigned dose, begins 2 days before the NK cell infusion (on day -2) and continues twice daily for 90 days. Follow-up for disease response and survival is for 1 year from the NK cell infusion with the possibility of re-treatment for patients who experience at least a clinical benefit for a minimum of 6 months prior to disease progression. The MTD of INCB024360 will be determined using the continual reassessment method (CRM). The 1st 2 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1 (50 mg bid) of INCB024360. Each new cohort of 2 patients will be sequentially assigned to most appropriate dose by the study statistician based on the updated toxicity profile. Up to 4 dose levels of INCB024360 will be tested (50, 100, 200, and 300 mg bid) with a dose level -1 (25 mg bid) used in the event that 50 mg bid proves to be too toxic. The MTD will be identified when the total sample size of 20 patients is exhausted.</detailed_description>
