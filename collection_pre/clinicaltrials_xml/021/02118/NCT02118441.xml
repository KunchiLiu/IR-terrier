	<brief_summary>When a patient undergoes heart surgery, their Anesthesiologist will insert a tiny plastic tube, called a catheter, in the artery of the patient's wrist. This is called a radial artery catheter. A radial artery catheter allows accurate measurement of the patient's blood pressure during surgery. There are two common techniques for placing the radial artery catheter. The first is a "blind" technique whereby the Anesthesiologist feels for the pulse in the patient's wrist and places the catheter using the location of the pulse as a guide. The second technique, less commonly used, is one whereby the Anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine (painless to the patient) to "see" the artery, and thereby uses the ultrasound to guide the catheter placement. Our study will test the hypothesis that ultrasound-guided radial artery catheterization will have faster insertion times, with fewer complications compared with palpation-guided insertion.</brief_summary>
