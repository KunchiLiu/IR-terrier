	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to evaluate the clinical results and the inflammatory response of the minimal extracorporeal circulation system (MECC) Compared with off-pump coronary revascularization (OPCABG). This is a randomized and prospective study in 230 patients with indications for coronary surgery, with 113 patients in the OPCABG group and 117 in the MECC group. The endpoints were the clinical and biochemical results, intra-operative outcomes and the determination of 19 inflammatory circulating markers, 17 of them for the first time analyzed comparing both techniques.</brief_summary>
