	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of mental practice, associated with physical practice, on gait (cinematic parameters and mobility) in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It is believed that familiarity with the normal gait pattern, associated with mental practice and physical practice can trigger significant changes in spatiotemporal and angular parameters that are not observed in the group not submitted to mental practice.</brief_summary>
