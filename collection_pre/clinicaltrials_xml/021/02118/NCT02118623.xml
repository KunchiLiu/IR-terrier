	<brief_title>Internet-Based Interventions for Bipolar Disorder (MoodSwings 2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine whether exposure to the three different components of the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention results in decreased depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and decreased manic symptoms as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The three components of the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention are: - Moderated peer discussion board - Psychoeducation learning modules - Interactive psychosocial tools This study will also examine whether there is an association between graduated levels of involvement and resulting improvement. These graduated levels are: - Moderated peer discussion board only (Level 1) - Moderated peer discussion board and psychoeducation learning modules (Level 2) - Moderated peer discussion board, psychoeducation learning modules and interactive psychosocial tools (Level 3). We expect that those participants assigned to the control condition (Level 1), will have fewer positive outcomes than those in Level 2 or Level 3 conditions.</detailed_description>
