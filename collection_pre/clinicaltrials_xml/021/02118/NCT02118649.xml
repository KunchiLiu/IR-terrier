	<brief_summary>Participants will play a computer game that is controlled by their gaze patterns and designed to direct attention their attention to specific on-screen targets. Visual attention to targets will be rewarded. Both visual behavior and brain response will be recorded during game play. It is hypothesized that that, over the course of the game, relative to baseline, participants will show (a) increased looking to targets, (b) decreased response time to targets, and (c) enhanced, more efficient neural response to visual cues. It is hypothesized that clinical variability will associate with visual attention and brain response.</brief_summary>
