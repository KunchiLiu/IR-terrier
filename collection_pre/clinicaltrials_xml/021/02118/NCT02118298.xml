	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are to 1. Investigate the sensitivity of allocentric visual memory when compared to more established measures of cognition in identifying cognitive difficulties among MS subjects when compared to controls. 2. Determine which cognitive test variable will be most strongly associated with self and informant reports of cognition. 3. Determine which MRI metric will be most strongly related to neuropsychological test performance 4. Determine the degree to which allocentric visual memory is related to functional connectivity on fMRI.</brief_summary>
