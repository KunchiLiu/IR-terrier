	<detailed_description>PDT uses a non-toxic drug that is activated by exposure to light in the presence of oxygen. The excited state this drug transfers energy or electrons to ground state molecular oxygen producing cytotoxic effects on cell. There are productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupts several of the cell's functions. This results in bacterial disinfection. In order to perform the PDT on the oral cavity, a device based on blue LED with transparent acrylic diffuser tip and cylindrical shape was developed.</detailed_description>
