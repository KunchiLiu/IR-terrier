	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of JNJ-54861911 on the QT/QTc intervals in healthy participants, when administered at therapeutic (50 milligram [mg] once-daily) and supratherapeutic (150 mg once-daily) doses for 7 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effects of JNJ-54861911 on Electrocardiogram Intervals in Healthy Particiants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, double blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participants is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo and positive-controlled, multiple-dose, 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one study group to another) study. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening period (Days -21 to -2), Double-blind treatment period and End-of-study/early withdrawal assessment period (9 to 13 days after last dose). Treatment period will comprise of 4 treatment regimens each consisting of a baseline assessment and a treatment regime (Days -1 to 9). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequence groups (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, and DCAB) based on a computer-generated randomization schedule and will receive the following 4 treatments in the order specified by the randomization: Treatment A (JNJ-54861911, 50 milligram (mg) once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment B (JNJ-54861911, 150 mg once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment C (JNJ-54861911-matched placebo once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment D (JNJ-54861911-matched placebo once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 7). Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 6 - 10 days. Total duration of study for a participant will be 93 days. Change from Baseline in QT/QTc intervals at Day 7 will be evaluated as primary end point. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
