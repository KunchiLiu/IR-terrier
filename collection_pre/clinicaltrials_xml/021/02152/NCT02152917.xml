	<brief_summary>The total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well established option for the treatment of osteoarthritis in this joint. Nevertheless, there are still some concerns related to the peri-operative management of elderly patients, highlighting the complications related to medical comorbidity and bleeding produced by surgery. One of the proposed methods to decrease postoperative bleeding, which has been accumulating favorable evidence, is the use of tranexamic acid (TA). Several studies (including prospective randomized trials with placebo group) showed excellent results with TA intravenous administration during TKA, reducing the amount of bleeding, the drop in hemoglobin and the need for blood transfusion. Another alternative to minimize bleeding is the use of topical hemostatic agent Floseal®, composed of thrombin and bovine gelatin. This substance has presented significant benefits on bleeding control in several areas of medicine, including orthopedic surgery, but no action has yet been established in TKA. The main objective is to evaluate the amount of bleeding, the drop in hemoglobin and the need for blood transfusion after TKA, comparing the use of TA, Floseal® and a control group. The secondary objective is to evaluate the rate of adverse events in the studied groups.</brief_summary>
