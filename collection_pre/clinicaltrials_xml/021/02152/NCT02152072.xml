	<brief_summary>Dyspnea is a common symptom encountered frequently by medical practitioners. The differential diagnosis for a patient with such a symptom is broad and time consuming, while immediate management for distressed patients is what is desired. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a relatively new technique that will help physicians more accurately diagnose and manage patients who present with dyspnea. Focused medical ultrasonography education is becoming integrated into many physician residency training programs. Recent studies indicate a possible relationship between focused ultrasonography training in medical school curricula and improved physical examination accuracy. Thus, a short-term training program in LUS during medical school will have a major impact on physicians to be comfortable in using this skill when dealing with distressed patients in their prospective residency training. It will reduce educational burdens for physician residency programs and improve overall physician competency. Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is ideally suited for offering effective training in a zero-risk environment. It enables trainees to gain knowledge and confidence in dealing with stressful clinical scenarios without exposing patients to any additional risk. SBME has also been shown to be a reliable tool for assessing learners' procedural skills and for teaching topics such as teamwork and communication. The investigators hypothesize that simulation-based training of medical students will enable them to more effectively evaluate patients with shortness of breath using LUS.</brief_summary>
