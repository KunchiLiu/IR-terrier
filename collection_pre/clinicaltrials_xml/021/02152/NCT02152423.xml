	<brief_summary>Because of their anti-Xa and ease of administration activity, the Low molecular weight heparin represent an attractive alternative to the unfractionated heparin. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that Low molecular weight heparin was more effective than Unfractionated heparin without increasing bleeding complications. Enoxaparin has been the most studied. Its use is recommended. Demonstrate that Enoxamed® is comparable to that of Lovenox® in the anti-Xa activity action.</brief_summary>
