	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to develop and test a Home-based Continuing Care intervention that will help parents support the recovery of their Young Adult (YA) child who is leaving residential substance abuse treatment. The two phase pilot study will 1) interview 50 parents and 50 YAs recruited from residential treatment programs and from parent groups to inform the development of the intervention and 2) conduct a two-arm pilot study that will recruit a maximum of 20 parents and their young adult children into one of two conditions (Home-based Continuing Care [HCC] intervention group or Services as Usual [SAU] comparison group) with the main goal of determining whether conducting such an intervention is acceptable and sustainable, and to collect preliminary efficacy data. We hypothesize that pilot testing will indicate that: (a) HCC is acceptable and potentially sustainable; (b) conducting a randomized clinical trial is feasible, and (c) the magnitude of outcomes from HCC will be clinically meaningful.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home-based Continuing Care for Young Adults Leaving Residential Substance Abuse Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several models of continuing care (CC) have been studied for adolescents and Young Adults (YAs) including online relapse prevention, brief telephone counseling and Assertive Continuing Care (ACC). Five sessions of in-person therapy or brief telephone counseling both have reduced relapse in youth completing treatment relative to a no CC condition, consistent with a growing body of research with adults supporting the efficacy of telephone-based CC (TCC). ACC has been thoroughly evaluated for adolescents. Some applications also have incorporated contingency management (CM) for engaging in activities including needed services; but ACC has not applied CM to biologically-verified abstinence -- an efficacious approach in adult CC. A significant drawback of ACC is that it is quite intensive, requiring extended clinician training and home visits. This increases the costs of the intervention and the difficulty of dissemination and implementation; therefore we plan to develop a less clinician-intensive continuing care model for YAs. The two phase pilot study will 1) interview 50 parents and 50 YAs recruited from residential substance abuse treatment programs and from parent groups to inform the development of the intervention and 2) conduct a two-arm pilot study that will recruit a maximum of 20 parents and their YA children into one of two conditions (Home-based Continuing Care [HCC] intervention group or Services as Usual [SAU] comparison group) with the main goal of determining whether conducting such an intervention is acceptable and sustainable, and to collect preliminary efficacy data. We hypothesize that pilot testing will indicate that: (a) HCC is acceptable and potentially sustainable; (b) conducting a randomized clinical trial is feasible, and (c) the magnitude of outcomes from HCC will be clinically meaningful.</detailed_description>
