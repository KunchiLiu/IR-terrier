	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the capacity of a 6-week treatment with neuromuscular electrical stimulation to improve walking in individuals whose mobility has been compromised by multiple sclerosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation and Mobility in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms. Those in one arm will receive a treatment with narrow stimulus pulses (0.4 ms) and those in the other arm will receive wide stimulus pulses (1 ms). The electrical stimulation will be delivered with a Vectra Genisys System.</detailed_description>
