	<brief_summary>This proposed study aims to compare the effects of unilateral and bilateral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). It will compare the effectiveness of bilateral TENS + task-oriented training (TOT) with unilateral TENS+TOTin improving muscle strength, co-ordination, dynamic standing balance, walking performance, and functional mobility in patients with chronic stroke. The null hypothesis will be that bilateral TENS+TOT and unilateral TENS+TOT are not significantly different in promoting the recovery of these functions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will be recruited from local selfhelp groups through poster advertising. \ Subjects will be included if they (1) are between 55 and 85 years of age Have been diagnosed with ischaemic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage by MRI or computed tomography within the previous 1 to 10 years Are able to walk 3 metres independently with or without a walking aid Are able to score &gt; 6 out of 10 on the abbreviated mental test Are able to follow instructions and give informed consent Have no skin allergy which would prevent electrical stimulation. Subjects will be excluded if they have any additional medical, cardiovascular or orthopedic condition that would hinder proper treatment or assessment Use a cardiac pacemaker Have receptive dysphasia Have significant lower limb peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetic polyneuropathy) Are involved in drug studies or other clinical trials.</criteria>
