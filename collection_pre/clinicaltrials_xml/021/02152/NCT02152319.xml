	<brief_title>Automated Telehealth Diagnostics for Remote Parkinson Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there is limited access to movement disorder specialist centers for a significant portion of the PD population. Treatment effectiveness is judged during office visits by improvement of patient motor symptoms and quality of life. Clinicians evaluate patients by having them perform specific motor tasks and rating the severity on a 0-4 scale. A major limitation is that a single evaluation in a clinical setting may not accurately reflect motor symptom fluctuations experienced over the course of a day, week, or month. Clinicians currently lack effective, affordable medical devices that can be easily delivered to a patient's home for monitoring symptoms on a more continuous basis as motor symptoms typically change throughout the day. Kinesia HomeView provides a repeatable, automated system clinicians can use to remotely monitor PD motor symptoms on a more continuous basis in a patient's home. The investigators hypothesize use of the Kinesia HomeView system will improve outcomes and decrease costs especially for patient populations in areas not in close proximity to movement disorder specialists.</detailed_description>
