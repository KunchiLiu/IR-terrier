	<criteria>Have type 2 diabetes (based on the World Health Organization's [WHO] diagnostic criteria) Have been treated with basal insulin glargine once daily with or without metformin for at least 3 months prior to screening Doses of once daily insulin glargine and metformin (if taken) must be stable during the 3month period prior to screening. Doses of metformin are considered stable if all prescribed doses during this period are in the range between the minimum required dose (≥1500 mg/day) and the maximum approved dose per the locallyapproved label Have an HbA1c value ≥7.0% and ≤10.5% as assessed by the central laboratory at screening Require further insulin glargine dose increase at week 3 per the treattotarget (TTT) algorithm based on the SMPG data collected during the prior week Have stable weight (±5%) ≥3 months prior to screening Have body mass index (BMI) ≤45 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) at screening Are able and willing to administer once weekly randomized therapy Are females of childbearing potential who must: Test negative for pregnancy at screening, based on a serum pregnancy test Agree to use a reliable method of birth control Not be breastfeeding Have been treated with ANY other antihyperglycemia regimen, other than basal insulin glargine once daily with or without metformin, within the 3 months prior to screening or between screening and week 3 Have a history of ≥1 episode of ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar state/coma Have a history of hypoglycemia unawareness within the 6 months prior to screening Have been treated with drugs that promote weight loss within the 3 months prior to screening or between screening and week 3 Are receiving chronic (&gt;14 days) systemic glucocorticoid therapy or have received such therapy within the 4 weeks prior to screening or between screening and week 3 Have had any of the following cardiovascular conditions within the 2 months prior to screening: acute myocardial infarction (MI), New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or Class IV heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident (stroke) Have a known clinically significant gastric emptying abnormality or have undergone gastric bypass surgery or restrictive bariatric surgery Have acute or chronic hepatitis, signs and symptoms of any other liver disease, or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range, as determined by the central laboratory Have a history of chronic pancreatitis or acute idiopathic pancreatitis, or were diagnosed with any type of acute pancreatitis within the 3 months prior to screening Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 milliliters/minute/1.73 square meter (mL/min/m^2), calculated by the Chronic Kidney DiseaseEpidemiology (CKDEPI) equation, as determined by the central laboratory; for participants on metformin, have renal disease or renal dysfunction (for example, a serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/deciliter [dL] [male] or ≥1.4 mg/dL [female] or eGFR [CKDEPI] &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2) Have evidence of a significant, uncontrolled endocrine abnormality Have any self or family history of type 2A or type 2B multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 2A or 2B) in the absence of known Ccell hyperplasia Have any self or family history of medullary Ccell hyperplasia, focal hyperplasia, or carcinoma (including sporadic, familial, or part of MEN 2A or 2B syndrome) Have serum calcitonin ≥20 picograms/mL, as determined by the central laboratory Have evidence of a significant, active autoimmune abnormality Have any other condition not listed in this section that is a contraindication for use of insulin glargine, or, for participants using metformin, have a condition that is a contraindication for the use of metformin and would require metformin discontinuation per label Have a history of transplanted organ Have a history of active or untreated malignancy, or are in remission from a clinically significant malignancy during the 5 years prior to screening Have a history of any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may preclude the participants from following and completing the protocol Have any hematologic condition that may interfere with HbA1c measurement (eg, hemolytic anemias, sicklecell disease)</criteria>
