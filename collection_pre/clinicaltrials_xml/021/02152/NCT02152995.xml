	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well trametinib works in increasing tumoral iodine incorporation in patients with thyroid cancer that has come back or spread to another place in the body. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may help make treatment with iodine I-131 more effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib in Increasing Tumoral Iodine Incorporation in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing radioiodine (RAI) activity by determining the proportion of patients alive at 6 months without disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1) criteria following treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort A) II. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the objective response rate (ORR) at 6 months following treatment with radioiodine (RAI) in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort A) III. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib therapy with increased tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified by iodine iodine-124 (I-124) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) lesional dosimetry. (Cohort B) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib therapy with increased tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified with I-124 PET/CT lesional dosimetry. (Cohort A) II. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of trametinib with or without RAI. (Cohort A) III. To evaluate changes in thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with RAI. (Cohort A) IV. To explore potential correlations between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort A) V. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the ORR at 6 months following treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort B) VI. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the proportion of patients alive at 6 months without disease progression by RECIST v 1.1 criteria following treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort B) VII. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of trametinib with or without RAI. (Cohort B) VIII. To evaluate changes in thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with RAI. (Cohort B) IX. To explore potential correlations between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort B) X. Preliminary evaluation of best objective response (BOR) rate for patients treated with trametinib alone. (Cohort C) XI. Preliminary evaluation of the proportion of patients following treatment with trametinib alive at 6 months without disease progression by RECIST v 1.1 criteria. (Cohort C) XII. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of trametinib. (Cohort C) XIII. To evaluate changes in thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with trametinib. (Cohort C) XIV. To explore potential correlations between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort C) XV. To explore the impact of continued trametinib upon RAI avidity and efficacy. (Cohort C) OUTLINE: Patients undergo iodine I-124 PET/CT on day 5 of week 1. Beginning day 6, patients receive trametinib orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo second iodine I-124 PET/CT on week 5. If I-124 PET/CT shows enough iodine absorption, patients may receive iodine I-131 PO and continue receiving trametinib for another 2 days. If I-124 shows that the thyroid is not absorbing iodine, patients may continue trametinib at the doctor's discretion and do not receive iodine I-131. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

tumors in previously irradiated fields may be considered measureable if there is evidence of tumor progression after radiation treatment RAIrefractory disease on structural imaging, defined as any one of the following: A metastatic lesion that is not radioiodineavid on a diagnostic radioiodine scan performed up to 2 years prior to enrollment in the current study, or A radioiodineavid metastatic lesion which remained stable in size or progressed despite radioiodine treatment 6 months or more prior to entry in the study; there are no size limitations for the index lesion used to satisfy this entry criterion The presence of at least one fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesion No recent treatment for thyroid cancer as defined as: No prior RAI therapy is allowed &lt; 6 months prior to initiation of therapy on this protocol; a diagnostic study using &lt; 10 millicurie (mCi) of RAI is not considered RAI therapy No external beam radiation therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy on this protocol; (previous treatment with radiation for any indication is allowed if the investigator judges that the previous radiation does not significantly compromise patient safety on this protocol) No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed &lt; 4 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy on this protocol Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Able to swallow and retain orallyadministered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels All prior treatmentrelated toxicities must be Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0) grade =&lt;

men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of trametinib administration Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients must agree to undergo two separate biopsies of a malignant lesion; biopsies do not need to be done if one of the following apply: If either the site investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the patient (if the only tumor accessible for biopsy is also the only lesion that can be used for RECIST v1.1 response evaluation, then the patient may be exempt from biopsy after discussion with the MSK principal investigator) The goal will be to have a minimum of 6 patients from Cohort A and 3 patients from Cohort B attempt to have one or both of these research biopsies done (for a total of 9 patients total); accrual may be limited only to subjects for whom tumor is accessible for biopsy and attempt at biopsy is considered safe if continued enrollment of those who are not candidates for biopsy make it impossible to reach the accrual goals for research biopsies described above (e.g., if 19 [of 25] patients are accrued to Cohort A without any biopsies having been obtained within the cohort, then all further subjects who are registered to that cohort must qualify for attempted research biopsy in order to be enrolled into the study [i.e., subjects who would have been excluded from having biopsies done due to the above reasons would be excluded from participating in the study; these conditions also apply to Cohort B]) Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required; patients with less archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with the MSK principal investigator) COHORT A: Confirmation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory that one of the patient's thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastasis) has an neuroblastoma RAS viral (vras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) or Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS) mutation at G12, G13, or Q61;
