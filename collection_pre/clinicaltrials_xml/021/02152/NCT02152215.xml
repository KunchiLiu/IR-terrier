	<brief_title>Ridge Preservation Comparing a Polylactic Acid Membrane vs. an Acellular Dermal Matrix Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The control subjects will receive a bone graft in the extraction socket, plus an additional bone graft on the outside socket wall covered by a bioabsorbable membrane made of polylactic acid and a citric acid ester. The test subjects will receive same type and technique of bone graft with a the acellular dermal matrix membrane to cover the bone graft. The membrane the patients receive will be randomly assigned using a coin toss: heads will be assigned to the test group while tails will be assigned for controls. The objective is to determine if at 4 months the width and height of the jaw bone and also the soft tissue thickness where the tooth was extracted has increased, decreased or remained the same. Also the amount of patients own newly formed bone will be determined by microscopic examination of a core of jaw bone that will be obtained from the site of implant placement immediately before the implant is placed (the implant is not considered part of the study).</detailed_description>
