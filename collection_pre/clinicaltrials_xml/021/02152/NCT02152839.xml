	<brief_summary>Maintenance of body's skeletal muscle is key to a healthy older age. However, as we age we lose on average 1-2% of our muscle each year. In order to slow this loss we need to understand fully the mechanisms regulating muscle mass with ageing. In this project we aim to determine these mechanisms using a new novel technique of 'heavy' water ingestion, which will allow us to measure multiple aspects of skeletal muscle mass control during normal everyday activities in young and old individuals over a period of 6 weeks. We will also determine the influence of resistance exercise training during this period in offsetting declines in muscle with ageing using this method</brief_summary>
