	<brief_summary>Respiratory insufficiencies during sleep can lead to reductions in the level of oxygen in the blood during the night, which has been shown to contribute to a range of morbidities. The purpose of this study is to assess the possibility that a nasal high flow therapy device may be able to treat respiratory insufficiencies, by stabilizing breathing and preventing reduction in blood oxygen. Heart failure patients will be screened at a heart failure clinic, and will be asked to undergo an overnight sleep study to determine is they exhibit respiratory insufficiencies during sleep. This sleep study may be completed in the sleep laboratory (attended polysomnography, PSG) or in-home (in-home polygraphy, PG). If they are diagnosed with respiratory insufficiencies, they will be asked to attend further overnight studies to see if treatment with nasal high flow therapy can be used to stabilize breathing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men and Women aged ≥ 18 years Heart Failure from ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy for ≥ 6 months Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤45% by echocardiography performed within 3 months of the screening visit, or if not within 3 months, a justification provided by the cardiologist for why a repeat echocardiography is not required, for example, because the subject's condition has remained stable since their echocardiography). All echocardiography must be within a maximum of 1 year of the screening visit.
