	<brief_summary>Intense acute pain is a common reason for Emergency admittance and its management is one of the major public health goals. In the recommendations formalized experts, it is recommended to use a protocol titration with morphine bolus of 2 mg (for patients less than 60 kg) or 3 mg (for patients over 60 kg) repeated every 5 minutes with a target of the Visual Analog Scale less than or equal to 30. Despite these specific recommendations and a broad awareness of the teams, management of pain remains to be improved, the major difficulty of morphine titration at the emergency department being the availability of paramedical personnel to perform revaluations and reinjection. Thus, effective analgesia would be obtained in 50% of cases to 30 minutes. The investigators want to study the self-controlled morphine titration by the patient by a mechanical device for single use (efficacy/safety).</brief_summary>
