	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial to compare three currently available management strategies for women with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location (PPUL), which makes them at-risk for ectopic pregnancy. We will recruit hemodynamically stable women with a confirmed PPUL to be randomized to one of three strategies: 1) Uterine evacuation followed by methotrexate (MTX) for some (those that have evidence of a non visualized ectopic pregnancy) 2) Empiric treatment with MTX for all 3) Expectant management. Randomization will be 1:1:1 into these three arms. After randomization, they will be followed and treated clinically as is indicated by the progression of their condition. Primary outcome measures: uneventful decline of hCG to 5 IU/mL.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female with a persisting pregnancy of unknown location: A pregnancy of unknown location is defined as a pregnancy in a woman with a positive pregnancy test but no definitive signs of pregnancy in the uterus or adnexa on ultrasound imaging. A definitive sign of gestation includes ultrasound visualization of a gestational sac with a yolk sac (with or without an embryo) in the uterus or in the adnexa. Ultrasound must be performed within 7 days prior to randomization. Persistence of hCG is defined as at least 2 serial hCG values (over 214 days), showing &lt; 15% rise per day, or &lt; 50% fall between the first and last value. Patient is hemodynamically stable, hemoglobin &gt;10 mg/dL Greater than or 18 years of age Hemodynamically unstable in need of acute treatment Most recent hCG &gt; 5000 mIU/mL Patient obtaining care in relation to a recently completed pregnancy (delivery, spontaneous or elective abortion) Diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease Subject unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures Presence of clinical contraindications for treatment with MTX Prior medical or surgical management of this gestation Subject unwilling to accept a blood transfusion</criteria>
