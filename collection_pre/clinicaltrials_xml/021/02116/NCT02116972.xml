	<brief_summary>This study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging, single dose design. The study will be conducted in male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Approximately 300 patients with OA of the knee will be randomized to one of three treatment groups (1:1:1) and treated with a single intra-articular (IA) injection of: - 20 mg FX006, - 40 mg FX006, or - normal saline. Each patient will be evaluated for a total of 24 weeks following a single IA injection. Following screening, safety and efficacy will be evaluated at 6 out-patient visits (Days 1 [Baseline], Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24).</brief_summary>
