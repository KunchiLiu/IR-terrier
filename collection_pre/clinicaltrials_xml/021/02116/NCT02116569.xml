	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Daratumumab in Japanese participants with relapsed (the return of a medical problem) or refractory (not responding to treatment) multiple myeloma (cancer of plasma cells in bone marrow, characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Daratumumab in Japanese Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label (all participants and study personnel will know the identity of the study treatments) and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study in Japanese participants. The study will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase consists of 2 parts: intense dosing regimen and less intense dosing regimen. Follow-up phase will be until 8 weeks after last dose administration/death/lost to follow up/consent withdrawal for study participation or study end, whichever occurs first. The primary endpoints will be Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) and overall Adverse Events (AEs) profiling. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
