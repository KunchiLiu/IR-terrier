	<brief_summary>This research is being done to investigate if a new technique to biopsy the pancreas will lead to a larger amount tissue material that can be analyzed. Investigators have called the technique the "corkscrew" technique and believe it will allow obtaining a larger biopsy sample during the endoscopic ultrasound examination. The corkscrew technique uses a clockwise rotational movement to drive the needle into the pancreatic mass (like a wine bottle opener twists and buries itself into a cork). It is believed that this will lead to a better biopsy sample than the usual way and therefore result in a higher chance of a diagnosis.</brief_summary>
