	<brief_summary>Presently, the gold standard for testing diet acid intake is a urine collection done for many hours, usually 24 hours, which must be analyzed in a research lab for "net acid excretion". So, getting information about diet acid intake is difficult. Many people have suggested doing a much simpler test, which is checking the pH of the urine when you wake up. But, no one has studied if this simpler method is a valid method for estimating the 24 hour net acid excretion. Diet acid load may be important in many diseases associated with aging, such as loss of bone and muscle, and the development of kidney disease.</brief_summary>
