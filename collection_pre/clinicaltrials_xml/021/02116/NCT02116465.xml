	<brief_summary>The study is carried-out to describe and compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa after oral single-dose administration of 100 mg levodopa plus 25 mg carbidopa by means two fixed combination products (test: Isicom® 100/25 mg; reference: Nacom® 100/25 mg). Additionally, to describe and compare the safety and tolerability of the two investigational treatments administered to healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study With Levodopa-carbidopa Fixed-dose Products in Healthy Subjects After Oral Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Isicom® 100/25 mg and Sinemet® (Trade name in Germany: Nacom®) 100/25 mg are authorised fixed-combination products containing 100 mg levodopa plus 25 mg carbidopa. These two formulations were tested for bioequivalence in 1997 (DESITIN trial № LCD-010/K); based on the regulatory provisions in place at that time (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), the two formulations could be accepted to be bioequivalent. The present study is proposed to be conducted in order to verify and confirm the bioequivalence of Isicom® 100/25 mg (test formulation) and Nacom® 100/25 mg (reference formulation) in agreement with the pertinent regulatory guidance that came in place 2010 (CHMP Guideline On The Investigation Of Bioequivalence - CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev. 1/ Corr - Jan.2010).</detailed_description>
