	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether analgesia guided by pupillary reflex during laparoscopic surgery is effective in opioid sparing (intraoperative remifentanil and postoperative morphine).This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study performed in two centers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pupillary Reflex Measurement to Guide Intraoperative Analgesia During Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For now, intraoperative analgesia remains hard to assess in the absence of reliable and validated analgesia monitor. The analysis of pupillary reflex is a new tool to assess analgesia during the intraoperative and postoperative period. During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation that produce pneumoperitoneum may induce hemodynamics events such as tachycardia or hypertension. These events may be misleading or confusing. Actually, these events are mainly considered as insufficient analgesia. Thus, anesthesiologists deepen analgesia and/or anesthesia by increasing concentration of anesthetics or opioids. These inappropriate actions may induce hypotension and/or bradycardia especially in elderly patients. On the contrary, insufficient analgesia may exist in hypovolemic patients or in patients with neuromuscular blocking agents.</detailed_description>
