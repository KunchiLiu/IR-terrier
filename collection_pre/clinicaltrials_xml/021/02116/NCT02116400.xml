	<brief_title>Neuropsychological Characterization of Patients With Bipolar Disorder and a History of Suicide Attempt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: A. Evaluate other aspects of cognitive functioning (using the Tower of London, the Probabilistic Reversal-learning task, the Rey Complex Figure, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test) in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, depending on the presence or absence of a history of suicide attempt; B. Explore performance on neuropsychological tests depending on the type of therapy administered (lithium salts or valproate monotherapy or in combination with other mood stabilizers); C. Explore a possible relationship between circulating levels of lithium or sodium divalproex results and different neuropsychological tests; D. Establishment of a biobank for this population with leftover blood samples following serum lithium or divalproex testing.</detailed_description>
