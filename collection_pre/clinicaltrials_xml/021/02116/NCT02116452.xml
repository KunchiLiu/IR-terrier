	<brief_summary>The study objective is to evaluate whether a specific prebiotic (GOS/PDX) may have an effect in preventing atopic dermatitis, food allergy, intestinal and/or respiratory infections in infants at risk of atopy. In infants with dermatitis, the hypothesis will be tested that prebiotics reduce the severity of the disease.</brief_summary>
