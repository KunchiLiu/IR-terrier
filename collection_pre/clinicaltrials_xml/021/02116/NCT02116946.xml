	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for treatment of patellar tendinopathy in adults 18-50 years of age. Subjects will be randomly assigned to three parallel treatment groups: 1. Leukocyte-rich PRP injection + exercise 2. Leukocyte-poor PRP injection + exercise 3. Saline injection + exercise (control) Primary endpoints are (1) the number (rate) and severity of adverse events as reported by both patients and study physicians during the first 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, (2) patient-rated tolerability of treatment; (3) the change in function (VISA score) and treatment success (global improvement scale) over six months of a post-injection exercise protocol.</brief_summary>
