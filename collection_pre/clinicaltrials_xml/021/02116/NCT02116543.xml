	<criteria>Subject is HCV antibody positive Subject is treatment naïve, with no history of exposure (single or multiple dose) to interferon, ribavirin or direct acting antivirals. Subject has had a liver biopsy within 3 years or Fibroscan evaluation within 6 months prior to Screening that clearly excludes cirrhosis. If not available prior to Screening, the absence of cirrhosis must be confirmed prior to subject enrollment using either Fibroscan or Fibrosure®. Subject is negative for hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subject has prior histological evidence of cirrhosis or current clinical evidence of cirrhosis in the opinion of the investigator. Subject has a history or evidence of nonhepatitis C chronic liver disease. Subject has an estimated creatinine clearance of &lt;80 ml/min if 1860 years of age, inclusive; or &lt;70 ml/min if &gt;60 years of age, calculated using the CockcroftGault equation.</criteria>
