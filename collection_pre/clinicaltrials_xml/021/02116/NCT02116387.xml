	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate in patients with chronic low back pain (lasting for more than 3 months and not postoperative) the effect of an instrumental rehabilitation using the I-Moove ® device compared to a conventional physiotherapy rehabilitation for ambulatory postural stability (mean and standard deviation of excursions from the center of gravity) without visual control, 6 weeks after the start of the rehabilitation protocol. We focus on the relative variation between the values obtained on day 0 versus 6 weeks, via measures performed on a force platform. The results will be stratified into 3 age groups (18-39 years, 40-60 years and over 60 years).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate and compare the two physical therapy techniques at 6 weeks and 6 months after the start of the rehabilitation protocol in terms of: A - improving postural stability and visual control on an unstable surface (with and without visual control) B - improving levels of abdominal strength (Ito test) and erector spinae (Sørensen test) C - the impact of back pain on daily life using questionnaires (Dallas, Québec, FABQ and Tampa questionnaires/scores) D - Improvement of pain (Visual Analog Scale),</detailed_description>
