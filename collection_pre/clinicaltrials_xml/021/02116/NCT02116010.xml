	<brief_title>Evaluation of Phage Therapy for the Treatment of Escherichia Coli and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Wound Infections in Burned Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PHAGOBURN is a Phase I/II clinical trial randomized, multicentric, open label, standard of care (Silver Sulfadiazine) controlled aiming at assessing tolerance and efficacy of local bacteriophage treatment of wound infections due to E. coli or P. aeruginosa in burned patients using Pherecydes Pharma anti-Escherichia coli and anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage cocktails GMP produced. This project is a European Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) project funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development. This project is involving 7 clinical sites in EU.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Man or woman Adult Informed consent obtained from patient or next of kin Inhospital patient treated for burn wounds in a burn unit Burn wound (grafted or not) or graft harvesting area, presenting local signs of infection defined by SFETB criteria: A local or locoregional inflammatory reaction; And/or an adverse and unexpected local evolution; And/or regarding burn wounds: presence of pus, fast spontaneous debridement and separation, occurrence of blackish spots (necrosis or haemorrhage), unexplained conversion from a superficial lesion to a deep one (&gt; 48th hour); And/or regarding graft donor sites: presence of pus, unexplained delay in epidermisation, bedsore; And/or regarding graft recipient sites: presence of pus, lysis of grafts, necrosis of fat located under the graft.
