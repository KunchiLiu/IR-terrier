	<brief_summary>Acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) is a serious condition and one of the most frequent causes of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure. The current standard therapy (corticosteroids) is theme of debate and unsatisfactory in many patients (year mortality: 30%). One of the main causes of death is bacterial infections, which affect 40-50% of patients at 90 days. Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin (a nonabsorbable antibiotic) reduces endotoxemia, improves liver function and reduces the complications of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hypothesis/Objective: To assess whether oral decontamination with rifaximin prevents the development of infections associated with AAH and analyze its consequences.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Rifaximin in Patients With Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Open multicenter comparative study. A cohort (n = 66) will receive rifaximin (1200 mg / d) for 90 days. Results will be compared with those of a cohort of AAH prospectively included in an observational study. Both groups with a uniform treatment protocol (which includes the administration of corticosteroids and standardized treatment for complications of liver failure). Patients will be monitorized until hospital discharge and a follow-up visit at 7, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days will be performed. Endpoints: 1. Primary endpoint: Bacterial infections after 90 days. 2. Secondary endpoints: : 2.1. Liver function tests 2.2. Levels of endotoxemia 2.3. Complications of liver cirrhosis. 2.4. Survival</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients â‰¥18 and &lt;70 years of age. Active alcohol abuse and excessive alcohol consumption prior to admission defined as &gt; 50 g per day for men and&gt; 40 g per day for women. Jaundice (Bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dl) for no more than 3 months. Clinical suspicion of Alcoholic Hepatitis with a modified Maddrey's Discriminant Function &gt; 32 points. Hypersensitivity to Rifaximin Advanced Chronic or Terminal illness. Advanced Chronic illness will be defined as: all conditions evolved into a clinical stage to limit the patient's functional status (eg, heart failure NYHA&gt; II, COPD PCO2&gt; 50 mmHg or PO2 &lt;60 mmHg, stroke or other disabling neurological disease, disabling or uncontrolled oncological conditions, etc ...). Terminal illness will be defined as any clinical conditions with a survival expectancy less than 3 months Hepatocellular carcinoma (previously diagnosed) beyond Milan's criteria. Complete portal vein thrombosis (previously diagnosed). Autoimmune liver disease. Hepatitis B and C and HIV infection (antiHCV, surface HBV antigen and antiHIV positive). Pregnancy or nursing. Use of Rifaximin during the previous 2 months. Treatment with Pentoxifylline. Lack of informed consent. Removal criteria: Lack of histological confirmation of Alcoholic Hepatitis during the first 7 days after inclusion. Because there are no nondiagnostic tools to diagnose alcoholic hepatitis, histological confirmation is required in all patients (preferably through a transjugular biopsy): alcoholic hepatitis will be diagnosed on the presence of the following histologic features: Hepatocellular damage (eg, hepatocyte ballooning and presence of MalloryDenk bodies). Inflammatory infiltrate (predominantly polymorphonuclear cells). Pericellular or sinusoidal fibrosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan's criteria diagnosed during the first 7 days after inclusion. Complete portal vein thrombosis diagnosed during the first 7 days after inclusion. Protocol violation. Severe adverse event directly related with Rifaximin.</criteria>
