	<brief_summary>The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) reaches more than 50% in chronic heart failure patients (CHF). The main consequence is an increase risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. A treatment by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or adaptative servo-ventilation (ASV) reduces this risk. Nevertheless, 75% of severe SDB cases remains undiagnosed and untreated especially due to cost and time delay for polysomnography examination which is the gold standard for SDB diagnosis. Indeed, alternative methods are developed. Some methods, based on nocturnal ECG analysis showed promising results but they are not validated and adapted for cardiac population. Thus, the goal of present study is to test the accuracy of ECG derived respiration signal to screen SDB in a CHF population.</brief_summary>
