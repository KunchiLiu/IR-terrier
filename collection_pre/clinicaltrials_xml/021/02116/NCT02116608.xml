	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about the different ways used to treat tracheostomy granulomas. Investigators want to see which standard of care method (steroid application, silver nitrate, or betadine) is more successful in treating tracheostomy granulomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Tracheostomy Granulomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon joining the study patients will be assigned to one of the three treatment groups (steroid application, silver nitrate, and betadine). These three treatments are standard of care and patients would have been treated with one of them anyway. Patients will be followed for an observation period of six weeks with follow-up appointments, per standard of care, every two weeks (+/- 3 days) in order for a physician to evaluate if the treatment method is working. If during a follow-up visit, the physician determines the treatment method is not working, the follow-up period will end and participation in the study will be complete. In addition, if a patient is given a different form of treatment during the observation period, such as in the emergency department or through their primary care physician, the follow-up period will end and participation in the study will be complete.</detailed_description>
