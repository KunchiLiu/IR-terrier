	<brief_summary>The main objective of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of copeptin testing in association with troponin HS testing during pre-hospital care (ambulance care) in the treatment of patients whose pattern of use is the occurrence chest pain suggestive of ACS but not ST+.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to: A. Evaluate the diagnostic value of determination of copeptin testing in pre-hospital care in another diagnosis; B. Assess the prognostic value of copeptin assay on vital prognosis at day 28; C. Evaluate the kinetics of copeptin and troponin HS between initial ambulance care and arrival at the emergency department; D. Evaluate the potential impact of copeptin testing on pre-hospital patient care; E. Assess the economic impact of pre-hospital copeptin testing in terms of hospital stays and optimizing ambulance movements.</detailed_description>
