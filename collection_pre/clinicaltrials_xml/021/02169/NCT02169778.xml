	<brief_summary>Obesity has become a global epidemic with huge public health implications. Although clinical significant weight loss can be achieved by a combination of diet and behavioral modification, strong metabolic adaptations, with increased appetite and suppressed energy expenditure, are activated, which compromise weight loss maintenance and increase the risk of relapse. The aim of this project is to compare the effects of intermittent versus continuous energy restriction on the compensatory responses previously described using two low calory diets, with a similar macronutrient distribution. More specifically, this study will analyze, in the short-term, if an intermittent energy restricted diet is associated with less appetite and low reduction in energy expenditure when compared with a continuous energy restricted diet. This project can bring large practical benefits concerning the design of weight loss programs to minimize weight relapse.</brief_summary>
