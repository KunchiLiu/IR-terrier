	<brief_summary>Previous studies in animals and humans has shown that brief periods of reduced blood flow to one organ or tissue in the body can help protect other tissues from subsequent injury caused by reduced blood flow such as a stroke. This phenomenon is known as remote ischemic preconditioning and may help protect brain cells after a stroke. The investigators are studying a specific stroke type called subcortical stroke that is very common and has a high rate of recurrent stroke and cognition problems despite intensive prevention measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Preconditioning Over Time To Empower Cerebral Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will enroll 60 patients. All patients will receive best standard medical therapy for 2 years. In addition, the investigators will randomly assign 40 patients to undergo daily active remote ischemic preconditioning for 1 year, and 20 patients to 1 year of standard medical therapy followed by 1 year of daily active remote ischemic preconditioning. Patient structured interviews will be performed to assess if the treatment is well tolerated and easy for stroke patients to use. Magnetic resonance (MR) pictures of the brain will be used to determine if the active treatment stops the progression of brain injury. Cognitive tests and wireless sensor technology measures will used to learn what happens to the patient's brain and body during the active treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>I. Clinical 1. Clinical lacunar stroke syndrome within the past 6 months 2. Absence of signs or symptoms of cortical dysfunction 3. No proximal large vessel atherosclerosis, intracranial atherosclerosis or cerebellar stroke. 4. No major cardioembolic source requiring anticoagulation or other specific therapy II. Imaging 1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) presence of a small subcortical ischemic, any 1 or more of: 1. Diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) lesion &lt; 2.0cm in size at largest dimension and corresponding to the clinical syndrome. 2. Well delineated focal hyperintensity &lt;2.0 cm in size at largest dimension (including rostrocaudal extent) on FLAIR or T2 and clearly corresponding to the clinical syndrome. If other focal hyperintensities are present, the case will be discussed with the principal investigator prior to randomization 3. Multiple (at least 2) hypointense lesions of size 0.31.5 cm at largest dimension (including rostrocaudal extent) only in the cerebral hemispheres on FLAIR or T1 in patients whose qualifying event is clinically hemispheric 4. Well delinated hypointense lesion &lt;1.5 cm in size at the largest dimension (including rostrocaudal extent) on FLAIR or T1 corresponding to the clinical syndrome. MRI must be done at least 1 months after the qualifying stroke 2. Absence of cortical stroke and large (&gt; 1.5cm) subcortical stroke, recent or remote 3. White matter hyperintensity score of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) on the European Scale of AgeRelated White Matter Change 4. Absence of cerebral amyloid antipathy (CAA) as per Boston Criteria. 1. Disabling stroke (Rankin Scale â‰¥4) 2. Previous intracranial hemorrhage (excluding traumatic) or hemorrhagic stroke 3. Age under 40 years 4. High risk of bleeding (e.g. recurrent GI or GU bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, etc.) 5. Anticipated requirement for long term use of anticoagulants (e.g. recurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) 6. Prior cortical or retinal stroke (diagnosed either clinically or by neuroimaging), or other prior cortical or retinal transient ischemic attack (TIA) 7. Prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy 8. Impaired renal function: estimated GFR &lt;40 9. Intolerance or contraindications to aspirin or clopidogrel (including thrombocytopenia, prolonged INR) 10. Mini Mental Status Exam score &lt; 24 (adjusted for age and education) 11. Medical contraindication to MRI 12. Pregnancy or women of childbearing age who are not following an effective method of contraception 13. Preexisting neurologic, psychiatric, or advanced systemic disease that would confound the neurological or functional outcome evaluations 14. SBP &lt;90 or &gt; 200 15. Known history of limb vascular disease, limb vascular bypass surgery, or limb deep venous thrombosis 16. Prisoners 17. Homeless individuals 18. Patient unable to give informed consent and no available legally authorized representative to provide informed consent 19. Patient unlikely to be compliant with therapy/ unwilling to return for follow up visits 20. Concurrent participation in another study with investigational drug or device treatment 21. Other likely specific cause of stroke (e.g. dissection, vasculitis, prothrombotic diathesis, drug abuse)</criteria>
