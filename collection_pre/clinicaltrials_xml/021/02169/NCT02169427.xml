	<brief_title>An Open-label Study in Healthy Male Subjects to Assess the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion of [14C]-Labelled BIA 9-1067 and Metabolites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single-centre, open-label ADME study in 6 healthy male subjects. Subjects received a single dose of 100 mg OPC, containing 3.39 MBq of [14C] OPC as oral capsules. The study consisted of an eligibility screening period within 3 weeks prior to drug administration, admission on Day -1, a treatment period involving drug administration on Day 1 followed by matrix collections for PK purposes and safety evaluations up to Day 11, discharge on Day 11, six 24-hour hospitalizations on Days 14/15, 21/22 (+/ 1 day), 28/29 (+/- 1 day), 42/43 (+/- 2 days), 56/57 (+/- 2 days) and 77/78 (+/ 3 days) for PK sample collections, and a follow up visit performed at least 14 days after discharge from the last 24-hour hospitalization or at early discontinuation.</detailed_description>
