	<brief_summary>Sensorimotor (also know as mu) rhythm based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a tool for controlling electronic devices using only brain signals. Often, the computer software that analyzes mu-rhythm brain signals constantly adapts to the individual user's brain signals when the training target location is known. The investigators want the BCIs to be more universal, and not depend on knowing the target location. Therefore, the investigators will test the effect removing adaptation has on accuracy of using a mu-rhythm BCI.</brief_summary>
