	<brief_summary>Back injuries are the most common reason people seeking for effective treatment. One of the most common treatments in sports medicine for muscular injuries is therapeutic ultrasound, which is designed to heat the injured tissue and increase the flow of blood to promote healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Non-Invasive Guidance for Therapeutic Ultrasound Treatment of Lower Back Muscle Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers at Beckman Laser institute, using a technology developed at University of California, Irvine. The device call Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy, this device developed with harmless light that can measures and detect the change of blood flow, oxygen level, temperature and muscle tissue in lower back during therapeutic ultrasound therapy treatment. The researchers can provide information in real-time tissue change before, during, and after treatments that can determine the effectiveness of the treatment and speed up recovery time.</detailed_description>
