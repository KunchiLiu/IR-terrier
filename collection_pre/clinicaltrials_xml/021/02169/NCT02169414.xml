	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of BIA 9 1067 (5 mg, 15 mg and 50 mg) in steady-state conditions on the levodopa pharmacokinetics of a single dose of immediate-release levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg and of a single dose of immediate-release levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Three Multiple-dose Regimens of BIA 9 1067 at Steady-state on the Levodopa Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-centre, randomized, double-blind, gender-balanced, placebo-controlled study in 4 groups of 18 healthy subjects each. This study consisted of a once-daily administration of BIA 9 1067 (5 mg, 15 mg or 50 mg) or placebo for 18 days. Twelve (12) hours after the BIA 9 1067 dose, a single-dose of levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg was administered on Day 11 and a single-dose of levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg was administered on Day 18.</detailed_description>
