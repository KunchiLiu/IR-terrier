	<brief_summary>Severe necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI), including necrotizing fasciitis, is a life threatening infection that spreads quickly to cutis, sub-cutis, fasciae and muscles. Approximately 40% of all patients with infections caused by S. Pyogenes develop a streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome. In these cases the mortality rates exceed 40% in spite of adequate treatment with antimicrobials. Due to the rapid progress, the extensive damage on soft tissues and high risk of death, the microbes are called "flesh-eating bacteria". The present study is a spin-off of the larger EU funded INFECT study, looking at the experiences of patient and family to understand the impact on every day life. The present prospective mixed methods study has the potential to provide important knowledge regarding the occurrence of early signs and symptoms of NSTI, quality of life 6 and 24 months after diagnosis, and how the care and treatment can be optimized and organized in a person/patient and family centered way. The study also aims at validate the SF 36 questionnaire for this group of patients.</brief_summary>
