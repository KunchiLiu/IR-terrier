	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Short-Course Glucocorticoids and Rituximab for Treatment of ANCA-Associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this pilot study is to examine whether an 8 week course of glucocorticoids, in combination with rituximab, is effective in inducing and maintaining disease remission for up to 6 months in a subset of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) who have a more favorable prognosis. This pilot study will enroll 20 patients with active AAV. Close patient follow-up will insure that any patients who require courses of glucocorticoids longer than two months will receive longer therapy, if appropriate for their well-being.</detailed_description>
