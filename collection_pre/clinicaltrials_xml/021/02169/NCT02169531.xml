	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a long-term metabolic disorder that is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Our hypotheses is that liver would be the primary organ responsible for the metabolic disorder because of some unknown defects, where sugar would not be efficiently converted to glycogen and fat, leading to hyperglycemia. The constant hyperglycemia would keep pressure on beta-cells in the pancreas to eventually exhaust their ability to produce and secret sufficient amount of insulin, exacerbating the disease. The Immunotherapy would enhance the liver functions and correct the abnormal sugar metabolism. In addition, the ex vivo activated cells produce and secret growth factors which would help endothelial cells of blood vessels to reproduce and grow, resulting in reduced arteriosclerosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ex Vivo Immunotherapy for Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to recruit 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who suffer hyperglycemia with or without medication. The patients will come to our hospitals for the treatment. A small amount of peripheral blood will be drawn and processed and cultured in our laboratory. The cultured cells (autologous) will be infused intravenously back to patients. Levels of plasma hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic parameters before and after the therapy will be compared. The therapy is planned to take four weeks for each patient.</detailed_description>
