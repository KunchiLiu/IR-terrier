Male subjects must be surgically sterile or commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control Have a body mass index â‰¤35 kg/m2 Be able to understand the study procedures, comply with all study procedures, and agree to participate in the study program. Have a known allergy to dexmedetomidine or any excipient DEXIN/placebo or to any peri or postoperative medications used in this study. Have a clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory tests value. Have history of or positive test results for HIV, or hepatitis B or C. Have a history or clinical manifestations of significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or other condition that would preclude participation in the study. Have a history of migraine or frequent headaches, seizures, or are currently taking anticonvulsants. Have another painful physical condition that may confound the assessments of post operative pain. Have a history of syncope or other syncopal attacks. Have evidence of a clinically significant 12 lead ECG abnormality. Have a history of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks &gt; 4 units of alcohol per day; 8 oz. beer, 3 oz. wine, 1 oz. spirits) or prescription/illicit drug abuse..

Have a resting heart rate of &lt;50 beats per minutes or systolic blood pressure &lt;100mmHg. Have been receiving or have received chronic opioid therapy defined as greater than 15 morphine equivalents units per day for greater than 3 out of 7 days per week over a onemonth period within 12 months. Use concurrent therapy that could interfere with the evaluation of efficacy or safety, such as any drugs which in the investigator's opinion may exert significant analgesic properties or act synergistically with DEXIN. Unable to discontinue medications, that have not been at a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to the scheduled bunionectomy procedure, within 5 half lives of the specific prior medication (or, if half life is not known, within 48 hours) before dosing. Have utilized any intranasal medications within the preceding 10 days. Have signs or a history of significant rhinitis or rhinorrhea (constant or chronic), nasal polyps, mucosal lesions of the nostril, postnasal drip of any etiology (constant or chronic), nasal ulcers, septal perforation or deviation, any nasal surgery, anosmia, nasal piercings, or frequent nosebleeds or other nasal pathology, that is sufficient to interfere with IN drug delivery. Have had an upper respiratory tract infection within 14 days of screening. Have utilized corticosteroids, either systemically, inhalational either intranasally or oral, or by intraarticular injection, within 14 days prior to the study. Have received any investigational product within 30 days before dosing with study medication. Have previously received DEXIN in clinical trials, or had bunionectomy in the last 3 months.</criteria>
