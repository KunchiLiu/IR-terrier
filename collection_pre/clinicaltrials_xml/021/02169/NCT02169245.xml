	<brief_summary>The objectives of the research are to assess the effects of increased protein and fiber intake at breakfast on neural activation in brain regions associated with appetitive drive and reward-driven eating, measures of subjective appetite, and ingestive behavior in overweight adults. Additional outcomes of interest include the effects of the breakfast intervention on blood sugar and cholesterol profiles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objectives of the research are to assess the effects of increased protein and fiber intake at breakfast on neural activation in brain regions associated with appetitive drive and reward-driven eating, measures of subjective appetite, and ingestive behavior in overweight adults. Additional outcomes of interest include the effects of the breakfast intervention on 24-hour glucose profile as well as fasting and postprandial glycemic and lipemic regulation. The investigators will test the effects of consuming breakfasts with normal protein/normal fiber (NPNF), normal protein/high fiber (NPHF), high protein/normal fiber (HPNF), and high protein/high fiber (HPHF) for two weeks in a randomized cross-over study.</detailed_description>
