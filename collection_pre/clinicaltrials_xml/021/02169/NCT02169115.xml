	<brief_summary>Urticaria is a very frequent skin condition characterized by transient wheal and flare type skin reactions associated with severe pruritus. In Europe alone, more than 5 million patients are thought to suffer from persisting urticaria symptoms, which either occur spontaneously, i.e. in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), or as a result of environmental physical stimuli such as friction, pressure, UV irradiation or cold (physical urticaria). Urticaria factitia (also known as dermographic urticaria and symptomatic dermographism) is characterized by whealing and itching following a minor stroking pressure, rubbing or scratching of the skin. The majority of patients with urticaria factitia benefits from treatment with nonsedating antihistamines. Some patients, however, do not achieve adequate symptom control even with updosing of antihistamines and may suffer from substantial quality of life impairment . Since even very minor stroking of the skin can lead to the development of wheals and severe itching, these patients are for example limited in their choice of clothing and are impaired in their social interaction and partnership. In all patients with a history of wheals after stroking of the skin, a provocation test should be performed. This can be done by stroking of the skin lightly with a smooth blunt object (e.g. the tip of a closed ball point pen or a wooden spatula) or a purpose-built instrument, known as a dermographometer. For the diagnosis of symptomatic dermographism, the smooth blunt object should be held perpendicular to the skin and should be used to apply a light stroking pressure to the skin of the upper back or volar forearm. The reaction is considered positive in patients who show a weal response and report pruritus at the site of provocation. Patients with a positive test reaction should be evaluated for individual pressure thresholds. For this purpose a provocation device (FricTest) has been developed that allows for reproducible and standardized threshold testing. Threshold testing enables physicians to assess disease severity and treatment response more precisely.</brief_summary>
