	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to measure the uptake, distribution, and clearance of 11C-MK-3168 by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan and to model the tissue specific kinetics of 11C-MK-3168 with the appropriate input function in human brain in Part A; to measure blocking of retention of 11C-MK-3168 at the estimated time to maximum plasma concentration after dosing (tmax) following each single oral doses of JNJ-42165279 and model the exposure/enzyme interaction of JNJ-42165279 in Part B; to measure the saturation of enzyme inhibition in the brain at steady state plasma concentrations of JNJ-42165279 (on Day 8) after 7 once-daily doses of JNJ-42165279 by conducting PET studies with 11C-MK-3168 at trough plasma concentrations on Day 2 in Part C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Regional Brain Kinetics of the Positron Emission Tomography Ligand 11C-MK-3168 and the Blocking of the Retention of the Ligand in the Human Brain by JNJ-42165279</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (both [participants and investigator] know what treatment participants will receive) study. This study consists of 3 consecutive parts: A, B, and C. Each part will consist of a screening phase (between 21 to 2 days prior to the study medication), a treatment phase (Part A: 1 day; Part B: 8 days; Part C: 8 days), and the end-of-study/ follow-up visit (within 5 to 7 days after last PET scan). In the treatment phase of the Part A, participants will undergo a baseline PET/computed tomography scan (after administration of 11C-MK-3168 on Day 1); In Part B, participants will undergo a baseline PET scan, followed by 2 post-treatment PET scans after 2 single doses of JNJ-42165279 on Days 1 and 8; in Part C, participants will undergo a baseline PET scan, followed by 2 post-treatment PET scans after 24 hours postdose of JNJ-42165279 on Days 1 and 7. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing, physical examination (including weight and tympanic temperature [temperature measure in an ear]), and neurological examination. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be approximately 4 weeks for Part A and approximately 5 weeks for Parts B and C.</detailed_description>
