	<brief_summary>People who are recently infected with HCV have a great chance of being cured of the infection when they are treated with a combination of two drugs within the first 6 months of being infected. This study is being done to see if a combination of two new drugs in one pill can replace the old drugs to provide a safer, more effective, and better tolerated treatment for new HCV infection. The names of the new drugs are ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF), and they will replace pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN, a drug given as a weekly injection under the skin). The fixed-dose combination of LDV and SOF (LDV/SOF) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study started with participants in Group 1 receiving SOF in combination with RBV, a drug also approved by the FDA, for 12 weeks. There were a total of 17 participants in Group 1 and all completed treatment. All participants were monitored for safety and viral response while on treatment. After completing treatment, all participants were evaluated for a treatment response after the end of treatment. If the treatment response in Group 1 was high enough, the study design allowed for the possibility to decrease the length of therapy for Group 2 to 8 weeks, using the same treatment. However, this did not occur. Combined with the fact that a new and more effective treatment for chronic HCV has been approved since the study started, Group 2 will now receive 8 weeks of LDV/SOF instead of 12 or 8 weeks of SOF with RBV.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. [NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a FDAapproved kit, which is required for all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry or HCV reinfection as described below: 1. Acute HCV infection will be defined as meeting one of the following criteria and exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis: New (&lt;24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR &gt;250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR &gt;500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA excluding those with any prior positive antiHCV. OR Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative antiHCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months. 2. Acute HCV reinfection will be defined by documentation of clearance of prior infection (as evidenced by positive antiHCV Ab) either spontaneously or after treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis: New (&lt;24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR &gt;250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR &gt;500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months. HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable &gt;12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute HCV and still within the &lt;24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection is defined as date of first elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurs less than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant will require a preentry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection have passed. It is optimal for this preentry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who enter screening but who have an undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;LLOQ TND) at the preentry visit (when required) will have exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the entry criteria.] Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m2 Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities as determined by the investigator. Willing and able to provide written informed consent. Men and women age ≥ 18 years. All participants must agree not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). [NOTE: Female candidates who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible. A male candidate who has a pregnant female partner is not eligible for the study.] When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while receiving protocolspecified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the medications. Such methods include: Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide Intrauterine device (IUD) Tubal ligation Hormonebased contraceptive (except those containing drospirenone) [NOTE: Providers and participants should be advised that not all contraceptive choices listed above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of HIV acquisition. Study participants who are sexually active with HIV1 negative or unknown HIV1 serostatus partners should be advised that they need to consider effective strategies for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants should discuss contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider.] Participants who are not of reproductive potential (women who have been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who have documented azoospermia or undergone vasectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
