	<brief_title>Trial of S-1 Maintenance Therapy in Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, multi-center, controlled, randomized, parallel-group phase II trial in patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer having received induction chemotherapy. Patients will be registered before the initiation of first-line chemotherapy regimen. This 12-week induction therapy will consist of one of the following regimens: FLO/mod. FOLFOX-6, Cisplatin/S-1, FLOT or EOX/EOF (see interventions for specification of regimens). Regarding dose adjustments, Investigators should refer to Section 6.3 and to the summary of product characteristics of the chemotherapeutical agents. Patients having finished the preplanned induction therapy without tumor progression (i.e. with complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria Version 1.1) at week 12, being able to swallow capsules and having Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-1 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Arm A or B. In Arm A patients will continue with S-1 de-escalation phase starting at week 13 until disease progression, toxicities requiring discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, pregnancy, death or lost to follow up whichever occurs first. In patients with drug-related severe toxicity S-1 dose will be adjusted or study treatment will be terminated. In Arm B patients will continue to receive the same polychemotherapy as during induction therapy until tumor progression, toxicities requiring discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, pregnancy, death or loss to follow up whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Signed written informed consent incl. participation in translational research 2. Male or female patient 18 years or older 3. Histologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or the esophagogastric junction (Her2/neu negative or with unknown Her2/neu status) 4. Measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 criteria 5. Adjuvant/neoadjuvant or perioperative chemotherapy or (chemo)radiotherapy must have been finished at least 6 months before study entry 6. No previous systemic treatment (i.e.chemotherapy) for metastatic disease 7. ECOG Performance Score 01 (Karnofsky Performance status &gt;= 80%) 8. Ability for oral intake of the study drug, patients with tumorrelated problems with oral intake might be registered if the symptom is expected to be improved during induction therapy (e.g. due to a tumor stenosis) 9. Female patient of childbearing potential (i.e. did not undergo surgical sterilization hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy and is not postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months) with a negative pregnancy test 10. Hematology and biochemistry laboratory results within the limits normally expected for the patient population, defined by the following: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/μl Platelet count ≥ 100000/μl Leukocyte count &gt; 3000/μl Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or 5.59 mmol/l, previous transfusions (&gt;3 days) of erythrocytes are allowed Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), in patients with known Meulengracht syndrome ≤ 3x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3x ULN in absence of liver metastases, or ≤ 5x ULN in presence of liver metastases Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3x ULN in absence of liver metastases, or ≤ 5x ULN in presence of liver metastases Creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min according to CockcroftGault formula 1. Previous major surgery within the last 28 days before the start of the induction treatment. The implantation of a central venous access (e.g. porta cath system) is allowed. 2. History of other malignant tumors within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma or curatively excised cervical carcinoma in situ 3. Known brain metastases 4. Concurrent radiotherapy involving target lesions used for this study. Concurrent palliative radiation for nontarget lesions is allowed if other target lesions are available outside the involved field; previous radiotherapy including target lesions must have been finished at least 28 days before start of induction treatment. 5. Previous systemic treatment (i.e. chemotherapy) for metastatic disease 6. Known active Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or documented HIV infection 7. Serious concomitant disease or medical condition that by judgment of the Investigator renders the patient at high risk of treatment complications 8. Clinically relevant coronary artery disease (NYHA functional angina classification III/IV), congestive heart failure (NYHA III/IV), clinically relevant cardiomyopathy, history of myocardial infarction in the last 3 months, or high risk of uncontrolled arrhythmia 9. Female patient pregnant or breast feeding 10. Female patient of childbearing potential (i.e. did not undergo surgical sterilization hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy and is not postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months) not willing to use an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the end of treatment. Male patient not willing to use an adequate method of contraception to avoid conception throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the end of treatment in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. 11. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or participation in another clinical trial with any investigational drug within 60 days prior to start of induction 12. Chronic diarrhea or short bowel syndrome 13. Known hypersensitivity to S1, other fluoropyrimidines or platinum compounds. Contraindication to receive S1 as per current Summary of Product Characteristics. Known Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency 14. Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy 15.
