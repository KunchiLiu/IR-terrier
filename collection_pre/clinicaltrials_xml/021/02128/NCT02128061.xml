	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of R2-miniCHOP (Sub-cutaneous Rituximab-miniCHOP + lenalidomide) and R-miniCHOP (Sub-cutaneous Rituximab-miniCHOP) in patients aged 80 years old or more with not previously treated cluster of differentiation antigen 20 positive (CD20+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as measured by the overall survival (OS).The SENIOR trial will evaluate the tolerance and efficacy of the combination of the R2-miniCHOP regimen and compare this experimental arm to the standard R-miniCHOP regimen.The statistical plan is based on the hypothesis of an increase by 15% of the 2y-OS in favor of the experimental arm, as compared to the reference arm (R-miniCHOP).</brief_summary>
