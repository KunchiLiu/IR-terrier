	<brief_summary>The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KRX-0502, administered without food, in treating iron deficiency anemia in subjects with stage 3 to 5 non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of KRX-0502 (Ferric Citrate, Administered Without Food, in Treating Iron-deficiency Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous clinical trials have tested KRX-0502 administered with food, in dialysis-dependent and NDD-CKD patients. This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KRX-0502 in treating iron deficiency anemia in anemic, stage III to V NDD-CKD patients in a new dosing regimen (without food).</detailed_description>
