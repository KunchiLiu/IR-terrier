	<brief_title>Liposomal Bupivacaine (Exparel) for Postoperative Pain Control for Open and Laparoscopic Abdominal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When a person has surgery, there are a few different standard care options for pain relief. Anesthetic (numbing) drugs can be used to cause a loss of feeling in or around a wound but the effect of the numbing medication can be undone.Pain relieving drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioid (narcotic) medications can also be taken by mouth or through a vein in your arm (intravenous IV.) However, both NSAIDs &amp; Opioid drugs can produce negative side effects such as serious difficulty breathing, stopping breathing altogether, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, itching, and constipation. Bupivacaine is one of the commonly used longer-acting numbing medicines (anesthetics). The effect of Bupivacaine or other anesthetics is limited to usually no more than 12 hours when injected around the area of the incision during surgery. Liposomal Bupivacaine (Exparel) could provide good, continuous and longer pain relief than current therapies/treatments commonly used. This can possibly improve patient satisfaction and time to normal activities such as walking.</detailed_description>
