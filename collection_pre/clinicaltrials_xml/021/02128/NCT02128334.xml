	<brief_summary>Eligard is a 6-month depot injection formulation that combines the active ingredient leuprorelin acetate (LA) with a biodegradable polymer matrix (AtrigelÂ® delivery system). The 6-month (45 mg) formulation was approved for the Russian market in 2009. It has been shown to reduce testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and to be well tolerated in several clinical trials. However, clinical trials are limited by strict patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. Therefore, the current non-interventional study aimed at investigating whether the efficacy and tolerability of the 6-month LA depot formulation could also be confirmed in a broad and heterogeneous patient population encountered in daily clinical practice in the Russian Federation. This study will evaluate total serum PSA and testosterone levels, Quality of Life (QoL) of patients, demographic patient data, diagnosis and diagnostic findings in patients. It will provide analysis in different subgroups of patients depending on previous hormonal treatment and anamnesis of disease.</brief_summary>
