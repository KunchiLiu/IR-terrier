	<brief_title>Effects of Folfirinox and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single center, trial to assess the effects of FOLIRINOX chemotherapy with SBRT on locally advanced, non-resectable pancreatic cancer. Patients will either undergo a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis or have strong clinical suspicion of a new cancer or recurrence based on the recommendations of a multi-disciplinary GI oncology team. FOLFIRINOX with be delivered prior to SBRT for 4 cycles. Restaging imaging will occur prior to SBRT delivery. SBRT will be delivered using standard stereotactic techniques to a dose of 3200cGy at 650cGy per fraction delivered over 2 weeks. Additional adjuvant chemotherapy with be delivered at the physician's discretion. Patients will be reassessed both clinically and radiographically at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months post-treatment. Quality of life analysis will occur at 3 month intervals after treatment. Blood will be drawn for exploratory biomarker analysis at strategic timepoints during treatment and followup. Following the initial imaging time points, standard surveillance will be employed with clinical assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years post-treatment.</detailed_description>
