	<brief_summary>RADIATION PROTECT is a randomized, controlled trial of patients undergoing coronary angiography or PCI with or without a pelvic lead shield. Interventional cardiologists who will perform the procedure will wear a radiation protection cap in all procedures. It is hypothesized that routine use of the pelvic lead shield and radiation protection cap during these procedures will reduce the amount of radiation in which the interventional cardiologists get exposed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RADIATION PROTECTion With a Pelvic Lead Shield and a Radiation Protection Cap for Operators Performing Coronary Angiography or Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred for coronary angiography or PCI will be randomized to undergo their procedure with or without the pelvic lead shield and the operator will wear a radiation protection cap. Clinical efficacy will be assessed based on the total radiation dose that the interventional cardiologist got exposed to as well as a secondary outcome measuring the total radiation exposure dose per minute.</detailed_description>
