	<brief_title>Effect of Cenicriviroc on HIV Neurocognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-associated neurocognitive disease (HAND), particularly in its milder form, is estimated to occur in greater than 30% of HIV infected individuals in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy. As even mild disease leads to functional consequences with decreased ability to live independently, HAND is of substantial public health concern. HIV-induced immune activation/inflammation of monocytes (MO) may be primarily responsible for the development of HAND. Cenicriviroc is a combined CCR5 and CCR2 chemokine co-receptor antagonist. The investigators hypothesize that dual CCR5 and CCR2 blockade with the use of CVC will lead to measurable reductions in MO activation and lead to cognitive improvement by decreasing HIV infection of MO and by interrupting the trafficking of such MO into the central nervous system. The investigators propose a single arm, 24-week trial of CVC in 24 subjects with HIV-1 infection suppressed on ART (plasma HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml) for 1 year or more with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.</detailed_description>

Age 18 to 70 years Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent Mild to moderate cognitive impairment with global neuropsychological (NP) test (NPZglobal) score of &lt; 0.5 or a neurocognitive abnormality (&lt;0.5) in at least one cognitive domain known to be typically affected by HIV OR unimpaired On antiretroviral (ARV) therapy consisting of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, atazanavir with/or without ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, dolutegravir, raltegravir or efavirenz.
