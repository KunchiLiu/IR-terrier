	<brief_summary>The miRNA plays an important regulation role in gene expression, and also closely related to bone metabolism. Previous research found that postmenopausal osteoporosis with kidney Yin deficiency syndrome (POP) is associated with CLCF1 gene. This project proposed by bioinformatics prediction CLCF1 targeted regulation of miRNAs, and use the 3 'UTR dual luciferase report system for target validation, aimed at the miRNA levels to explore postmenopausal osteoporosis molecular mechanism with kidney Yin deficiency syndrome.</brief_summary>
