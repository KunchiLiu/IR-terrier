	<brief_summary>Increased periodic repolarization dynamics (PRD) indicate increased risk of death in cardiac patients. This study thoughts to prospectively validate the prognostic value of PRD in post-infarction patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Value of Periodic Repolarization Dynamics in Post-Infarction Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodic repolarization dynamics (PRD) reflect periodic changes of repolarization instability located in the low-frequency spectral range. Level of PRD can be assessed using a high resolution surface ECG recorded in the 12-leads of Frank leads configuration during resting conditions. Increased levels of PRD have been associated with sympathetic overactivity and increased risk of mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction and patients undergoing a clinically indicated exercise test.</detailed_description>
