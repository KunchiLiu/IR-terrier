	<detailed_description>Women in the criminal just system are 4-5 times more likely to have cervical cancer than non-incarcerated women. Little is known about how to close this gap. The few investigators that have studied cervical cancer risk and disease among women in jails and prisons have found that while many women get screened for cervical cancer, less than half get follow-up care. The investigator's pilot research suggests the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about both cervical cancer and broader reproductive health issues. This study is testing a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) to see if it improves incarcerated women's reproductive health literacy.</detailed_description>
