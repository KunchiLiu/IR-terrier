	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis is that patients with HFREF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) will demonstrate a markedly expanded intravascular volume which will correlate with elevated right heart hemodynamics and increased venous capacitance parameters, whereas patients with HFPEF(heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) will demonstrate euvolemia to mild volume expansion and a lack of correlation with hemodynamic and venous compliance parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Volume and Hemodynamic Analysis in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the heart, blood vessels and blood volume interact in patients with heart failure and how measuring blood volume and vein capacity may help us develop better ways of treating and managing heart failure patients. This study will use two tests to measure blood volume and test the capacity of your veins and arteries in your limbs. The blood volume test (also called a plasma volume test or a red cell mass test) is a standard clinical nuclear lab procedure used to measure the volume (amount) of blood in the body. The test also measures the volume of plasma and of red cells in the blood. The other test is called a venous plethysmography, which is a non-invasive test to measure how well your veins and arteries in your forearm and calf work. Venous plethysmography measures the changes in the dimensions of your limbs by the use of strain gauges placed on the skin.</detailed_description>
