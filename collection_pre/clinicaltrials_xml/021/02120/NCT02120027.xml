	<brief_title>52-Week Efficacy and Safety Study of Ibodutant in Women With Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhea (IBS-D)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ibodutant 10 mg, given once daily for 24 weeks in comparison with placebo in female IBS-D patients. Randomisation to ibodutant and placebo will be 1:1. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of weekly response for abdominal pain intensity and stool consistency over 24 weeks of treatment in at least 50% of the weeks of treatment. The clinical phase of the study comprises up to 2 weeks of screening for patient's eligibility, a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free) for IBS severity assessment, a first 24-week double-blind treatment period, a second 28-week re-randomised double-blind treatment period and a 2-week safety follow-up, resulting in a maximum 58-week overall duration of the study for each patient. Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in a telephone-based electronic diary from run-in until end of treatment.</detailed_description>
