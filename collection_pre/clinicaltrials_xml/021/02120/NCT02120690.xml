	<brief_summary>To the investigators knowledge there are no studies of Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) for fibromyalgia. TNS may modify overlapping mood and fibromyalgia pain regulation circuitry. The investigators hypothesized that patients with fibromyalgia might experience a clinically significant reduction in daily pain if investigators were to administer TNS in a manner similar to experimental antidepressant protocols.</brief_summary>
