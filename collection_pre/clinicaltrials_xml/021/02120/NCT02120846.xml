	<brief_summary>Forty patients will be assigned to either a training group (12 wk unilateral knee extension flywheel resistance exercise; 4 sets of 7 reps 2 days/week) or a control group. Patients will maintain daily routines and any prescribed rehabilitation program. Established methods to assess muscle and cognitive function will be employed before and after the intervention. This project will disclose whether an exercise paradigm, known to improve muscle function and increase muscle volume in healthy populations, will induce similar adaptations in chronic stroke patients. More importantly, this study will elucidate if any impairment in cognitive function caused by stroke, can be reversed with this particular resistance exercise regimen. The information gained from this project will have significant implications and aid in advancing rehabilitation programs and exercise prescriptions for men and women suffering from stroke. The overall objective of this research is to promote independence and hence quality of life in these patients.</brief_summary>
