	<brief_title>Efficacy Study on Silver-coated ETT Cleaned With a Novel Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have suggested that biofilm formation inside the ETT plays a pivotal role in VAP development and drug-resistance induction. Silver-coated ETT have proven effective in delaying but not in preventing ETT colonization and biofilm formation, due to a barrier effect of biofilm and accumulated debris. Advanced ETT cleaning devices are able to remove debris and biofilm and reduce the total ETT microbial load to a certain extent. The Investigators hypothesize that the routine use of endOclear in patients intubated with a silver-coated ETT will reduce ETT microbial colonization. The Investigators therefore want to assess the reduction of ETT microbial colonization in patients intubated with a silver-coated ETT and cleaned with endOclear compared to the current standard of care of silver-coated ETT (blind suctioning). They plan to achieve this result by analyzing the tubes of each enrolled patient after it has been removed, either because the patient does not need it anymore due to his/her better clinical conditions, or because there is a need of tracheostomy or because he/she dies. Specifically they will analyze how the endOclear cleaning maneuver affects microbial colonization in the inner layer of the ETT and how this can determine distal airway inoculation and, ultimately, VAP development. Specific AIM #1: Investigators will test the hypothesis that routine use of endOclear in patients intubated with a silver-coated ETT will reduce ETT microbial colonization. Specific AIM #2: Investigators will test the hypothesis that keeping ETTs free from microbial colonization will prevent septic inoculation of distal airways Specific AIM #3: Investigators will test the hypothesis that prevention of ETT biofilm development will reduce drug resistance rates found in ETT and distal airways isolates The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial on 40 patients intubated with silver-coated ETT and randomized to receive standard ETT cleaning vs cleaning with the endOclear device.</detailed_description>
