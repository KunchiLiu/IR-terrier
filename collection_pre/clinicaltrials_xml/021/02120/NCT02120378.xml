	<brief_summary>Due to the discrepancy between the Egyptian and the conventional definition of miscarriage or live birth, there seemed to be a need for a study that ends up with reaching a definition for the mentioned terms. live birth is known to be for fetus born after 20 weeks or of weight more than 500 grams, while in Egypt, this is not applicable. basically the neonate has a chance of survival if the weight is more than 1000 grams or of gestational age more than 26 weeks.</brief_summary>
