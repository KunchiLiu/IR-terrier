	<brief_summary>This study evaluates two strength training protocols (one in peripheral muscles and one in inspiratory muscles) in the improvement of skeletal muscle mass and function in institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia. Participants will be assigned randomly in a control or one of both experimental groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventive Physiotherapy Intervention in Elderly People With Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life and death (Goodpaster et al, 2006; Delmonico et al, 2007). The contributing factors are those related to aging process, non-optimal diet, bed rest or sedentary lifestyle, chronic diseases and certain drug treatments. Most of these factors are present in the older population with comorbidity, frequently institutionalized to receive a professional long-term care. Since the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010) recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength and/or physical performance) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, interventions should be focused in both criteria. The aim of this study is to prevent loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia. To this purpose, the investigators study undertakes two physiotherapy interventions to preventing/treating Sarcopenia, namely, maintenance of muscle mass and improvement of strength in peripheral and respiratory muscles. Both interventions are common in the following features: supervision, duration, frequency and intensity of the training program. The primary outcomes are those related to muscle mass and strength. Secondary outcomes will be related to muscle function (muscle endurance and/or physical performance), costs and health status (number of falls and fractures, exacerbations of chronic diseases, hospitalizations and deaths during the year after concluding the physiotherapy interventions).</detailed_description>
