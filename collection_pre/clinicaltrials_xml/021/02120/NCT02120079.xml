	<brief_summary>Current steroid therapy in dry eye disease (DED) is comprised of a 2 week duration of pulse therapy, administered twice daily (to avoid adverse effects associated with long-term steroid use). This time frame is often too short to meaningfully resolve the inflammation associated with DED. DED often occurs when there is a decrease in the eye's tear production or if there is an increase in the evaporation of the tear film (a thin layer of tears that keep the eye moist). Eye irritation and inflammation (swelling) is often associated with DED because the surface of the eye is unable to maintain a normal level of moisture. This research study is looking to see if in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) imaging can be used to confirm clinical findings (which are noted by the doctor during an eye exam) and measure the immune response to the inflammation in the subject's cornea (the front part of the eyeball). IVCM is a non-invasive imaging technique that images the cornea at a cellular level with 800x magnification, using a scanning laser. The laser is used to map the cornea, and will not damage or harm the subject's eye. Studies have shown that IVCM can be used to study cells and nerves within the cornea, providing a better understanding of how the cornea reacts to irritants. IVCM has recently been used by the investigator to assess the extent of eye inflammation in cases of dry eye patients. Additionally, this study is trying to determine the effectiveness of two eye-drops, Lotemax and artificial tears, in treating the inflammation associated with DED by measuring changes in immune cells with IVCM imaging. The subject will be treated with either Lotemax (loteprednol) or artificial tears (a lubricating eye drop with no medication). Lotemax is an FDA-approved steroid eye-drop that is often used to treat inflammation associated with DED. Artificial tears are approved by the FDA for treatment of dryness associated with DED. Thus, this study is designed to determine the effects of the administration of a topical steroid, Lotemax, over a treatment period of 6 weeks, using novel methods of detecting efficacy. In order to achieve the aforementioned goal, subjects will be prospectively randomized to one of two treatment arms - Lotemax or artificial tear. Both groups will follow the same study schedule.</brief_summary>
