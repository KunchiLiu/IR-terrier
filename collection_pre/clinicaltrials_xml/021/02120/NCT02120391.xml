	<brief_title>Improving Knowledge of Medication in Ulcerative Colitis With an Iphone Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition that requires maintenance medication to maintain clinical remission. During clinical remission patient can be free of symptoms for long periods of time. Inflammatory bowel disease patients have been shown to have adherence rates around 40-60%. Non-adherence in patients in clinical remission is high with rates around 60%. Non adherence in patients in clinical remission can have significant impact because it can lead to higher rates of clinical flares and increased health care cost. This will be a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate if patients randomized to an iPphone application vs. control can increase the adherence of their maintenance medication. The trial will last three months and we hope to enroll 99 patients. The primary outcome will be adherence measured by the medication possession ratio. The secondary objective will be to evaluate if a validated adherence questionnaire can predict adherence in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Having an intervention that can increase adherence can provide better care for patients. Also having a validated survey tool can accurately identify non-adherence in inflammatory bowel disease patient would be a valuable tool for patient care.</detailed_description>
