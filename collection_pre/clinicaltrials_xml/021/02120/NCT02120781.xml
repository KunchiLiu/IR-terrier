	<brief_title>Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Azficel-T for the Treatment of Vocal Fold Scarring and Age-Related Dysphonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty subjects with dysphonia caused by vocal fold scarring or age-related dysphonia will be randomized for treatment with autologous cultured fibroblasts (azficel-T, n=14) or placebo (saline, n=6). Subjects will receive treatment to the vocal fold(s) in the lamina propria compartment. Subjects with both unilateral and bilateral vocal fold scarring will be treated in this study. Only one vocal fold will be treated at each treatment session alternating to the opposite vocal fold (if applicable) at the next treatment. Subjects are to receive a total of three treatments with study drug (azficel-T or placebo) if one vocal fold is to be treated and up to a total of six treatments with study drug (azficel-T or placebo) if two vocal folds are to be treated at approximately 2-week intervals. Follow-up examinations will be performed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months after the final treatment. If there are any evident safety issues, follow-up treatments will be delayed or withheld. In the Blinded Phase of the study, subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy for 4 months after the final treatment. After all subjects have completed the 4-month follow-up visit, the study will be unblinded and subjects will continue to be followed for safety for 12 months after the final treatment. Efficacy assessments will be made through the 12-month follow-up visit in order to document any duration of effect. All AEs that have an onset date from biopsy through the 4-month follow-up visit will be recorded.</detailed_description>
