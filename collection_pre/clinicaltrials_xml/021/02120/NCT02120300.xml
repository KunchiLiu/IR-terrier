	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in participants with genotypes 1 and 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ribavirin (RBV) in participants with genotypes 2 and 3 HCV infection. Participants with an inherited bleeding disorder and chronic HCV infection (either monoinfected or HIV-1/HCV coinfected) will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
