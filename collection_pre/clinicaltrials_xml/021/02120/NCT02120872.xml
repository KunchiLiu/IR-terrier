	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of autologous Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) or PRF and Simvastatin (SMV) with open flap debridement (OFD) in the treatment of three wall intrabony defects in comparison to OFD alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Rich Fibrin Combined With Simvastatin for Treatment of Intrabony Defect in Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>90 systemically healthy subjects were divided randomly into three groups (30 subjects in each group, per subject one site). Control group consisted of the sites treated with OFD and test groups sites were treated with OFD with autologous PRF or PRF with SMV. Site-specific plaque index (PI), sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL) and intrabony defect (IBD) depth reduction was measured at baseline and 9 month after surgery.</detailed_description>
