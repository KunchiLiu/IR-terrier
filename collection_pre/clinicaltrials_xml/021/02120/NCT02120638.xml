	<brief_summary>Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is difficult to treat and raises a great challenge to TB control program. That pyrazinamide can shorten the course of treatment and facilitate bacilli clearance has been proved recently. In 2011, WHO recommended to use pyrazinamide throughout the course of treatment for MDR-TB. However, pyrazinamide susceptibility testing has not been widely used in clinic. And the conventional testing is time-consuming and unreliable. In contrast, the detection of pncA and rpsA mutations with molecular methods can provide rapid results of pyrazinamide susceptibility. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the introduce the molecular testing of pyrazinamide susceptibility in optimizing the MDR-TB treatment regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization of MDR-TB Treatment Regimen Based on the Molecular Drug Susceptibility Results of Pyrazinamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, open labeled, prospective cohort study to evaluate the molecular testing of pyrazinamide susceptibility in optimizing the MDR-TB treatment regimen. Approximately 100 participants will be given the molecular detection of pncA and rpsA mutations and divide into to the pyrazinamide sensitive comparator group and the pyrazinamide resistant group based on the susceptibility results. For the pyrazinamide sensitive group, the regimen contains six months of chemotherapy with pyrazinamide, amikacin, levofloxacin, plus prothionamide, followed by six months of pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, plus prothionamide. For the pyrazinamide resistant group, the regimen contains six months of chemotherapy with isoniazid, amikacin, levofloxacin, plus prothionamide, followed by eighteen months of isoniazid, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, plus prothionamide. The participants will be followed up to 24 months after the start of the treatment. The primary outcome is the sputum culture conversion and the adverse events. Safety evaluations that will be performed are the routine lab tests, blood glucose, hearing , vital signs, ECG, reporting of adverse events, physical examinations and X-rays.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are diagnosed with active tuberculosis Patients who are smear positive and sputum culture positive for tuberculosis History of active tuberculosis less than 3 years With less than 2 times of previous antituberculous therapy The patients should be voluntarily entering the study and willing to sign up the consent form after full knowledge of the risks, schedule, drug features of this study. MDRTB is defined as resistance to the following two drugs: Isoniazid and Rifampicin. Extensively drugresistant(XDRTB) is defined as resistance to any flouroquinolones and any one of the three secondline antituberculous injections (capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin) The study enrolled MDRTB subjects and excluded XDRTB subjects. If MDRTB subjects is also resistant to flouroquinolones or capreomycin( kanamycin, amikacin), the subjects is included in the study as preXDR TB patients. Known allergy or intolerance to the drugs in this study Liver damage (Hepatic encephalopathy; ascites; prothrombin time prolonged 2 seconds compared with normal controls; blood bilirubin 3 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range) Platelets &lt;150x109 / L, WBC &lt; 3x109 / L. Abnormal ECG (Male patients with prolonged QT interval exceeding 430ms, Female patients with prolonged QT interval exceeding 450ms) Serum creatinine 1.5 times higher than upper limit Fasting bloodglucose higher than 8.0 mmol/L Patients who are on medication that effect the results of the drugs in this study Karnofsky score&lt;50% (see appendix) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding HIV positive Participating in other clinical trials in the past three months Patients with mental illness and severe neurosis Patients who have poor compliances Any special circumstances in which the research physicians believe that is not suitable for this study.</criteria>
