	<brief_title>Mindfulness in Mood Dysregulated Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a manualized psychotherapeutic intervention that is a combination of mindfulness techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy. MBCT-C, which is mindfulness based cognitive based therapy for children, involves weekly group sessions, home practice, and the core curriculum of formal mindfulness practices (e.g. body scan, sitting, movement and walking meditations). Group sessions will involve guided meditation practices, instructor-led discussion of experiences and psychoeducation. By fopstering the ability to pay close attention to thoughts, emotions and body sensations, participants learn to make better choices to deal with stress, anxiety, depression, pain and other challenges. This can allow them to more effectively use the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. Twelve children aged 10-17 with mood dysregulation and a bipolar parent will be in the study for 12 weeks. There will be two groups receiving intervention: one group recruited from the community and one group recruited from a known high-risk cohort.</detailed_description>
