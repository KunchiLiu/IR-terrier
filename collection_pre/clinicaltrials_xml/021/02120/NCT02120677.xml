	<brief_title>Topical Itraconazole in the Treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer in Caucasians worldwide. Although rarely metastatic, it can be locally destructive causing disfigurement and pain. Current therapies include surgical removal, local destruction, radiotherapy and others. Advances in understanding the molecular basis behind BCCs indicate that mutations in the hedgehog signaling pathway can lead to the development of many sporadically occurring BCCs. An oral drug that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway has been shown to be effective in treating patients with metastatic and inoperable BCCs. There is evidence that itraconazole, a commonly prescribed antifungal medication may also affect this pathway. It is not known whether itraconazole ointment applied topically can affect the growth of BCCs.</detailed_description>
