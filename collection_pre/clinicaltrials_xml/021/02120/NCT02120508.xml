	<brief_summary>The substantial efficacy and the possible mechanism of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improving language recovery remained unclear. It is hypothesized that the rTMS was associated with increased synaptic connection and neural regeneration which can be evaluated via functional neuroimage and neurofiber imaging analysis. The effect of rTMS intervention was monitored by clinical testing and neuroimaging study.</brief_summary>
