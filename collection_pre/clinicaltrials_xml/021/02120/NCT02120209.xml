	<brief_title>Prediction of Falls in Older Inpatients Hospitalized at Angers University Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falling is a common event within hospitals, with a rate calculated between 2.9-13 per 1,000 bed-days . Falls lead to prolonged length of hospital stays (LHS). The first step of an efficient and cost-effectiveness strategy of fall prevention is the screening of individuals at higher risk of falls. Recently, a brief geriatric assessment (BGA) composed of a few number of items has demonstrated to successfully predict the risk of prolonged LHS (5). We hypothesized that the use of the BGA items would make it possible to predict the occurrence of falls among older inpatients.</detailed_description>
