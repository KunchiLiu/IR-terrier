	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy Imiquimod Cream, 2.5% in Subjects With Actinic Keratoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aldara速 (imiquimod) Cream, 5% was the first imiquimod product approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma and external genital and perianal warts. The FDA approved regimen for the treatment of AK is application of 250 mg of cream twice a week for 16 weeks to a 25-cm2 area. In 2011, a lower strength imiquimod cream, Zyclara (imiquimod) Cream, 2.5% was approved by the FDA. When used for the treatment of AK, Zyclara is applied for a shorter duration and in an expanded treatment area (e.g., face or scalp) in comparison to Aldara速. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Marketed by Medicis, Zyclara速 (imiquimod) cream 2.5% is a safe and effective topical therapy for the treatment of actinic keratosis of the face and scalp. Actavis has developed a generic formulation of imiquimod 2.5% cream and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this formulation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is a male or female, 18 years of age or older. Subject has provided written informed consent. Subject is willing and able to apply the test article as directed, comply with study instructions and commit to all followup visits for the duration of the study. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of actinic keratoses (AK) with at least five (5) and no more than twenty (20) clinically typical, visible or palpable AK lesions, each at least 4 mm in diameter, in an area greater than 25 cm2 on the face (excluding ears) or balding scalp, but not both. Subject is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition that might impair evaluation of AK lesions or which, in the investigator's opinion, exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation. Females must be postmenopausal1, surgically sterile2 or use an effective method of birth control3,4 with a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT)5 at the Baseline Visit. Subject is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the study. Subject has hyperkeratotic, hypertrophic or atypical AKs (e.g., AK &gt; 1 cm2 in size) in the treatment area. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study. Subject plans to be exposed to artificial tanning devices or excessive sunlight during the trial. Subject is immunosuppressed (e.g., HIV, systemic malignancy, graft vs. host disease, etc.). Subject has experienced an unsuccessful outcome from previous imiquimod therapy (an unsuccessful outcome is defined as after a reasonable therapeutic trial with no compliance issues and the topical drug did not work). Subject has used an investigational drug or investigational device within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has had dermatologic procedures or surgeries such as: laser resurfacing, PUVA (Psoralen + ultraviolet A) therapy, UVB therapy, chemical peels or dermabrasion on the face or balding scalp within six (6) months prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has had cryodestruction or chemodestruction, curettage, photodynamic therapy, surgical excision or other treatments for actinic keratosis on the designated treatment area (face or scalp) within one month prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has used oral corticosteroid therapy, interferon, cytotoxic drugs, immunomodulators, immunosuppressive therapies or retinoids within one month prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has used topical medications; corticosteroids, alpha hydroxyl acids (e.g., glycolic acid, lactic acid etc. &gt;5%), beta hydroxy acid (salicylic acid &gt;2%), urea &gt;5%, 5fluorouracil, diclofenac, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate or prescription retinoids (e.g., tazarotene, adapalene, tretinoin) to the face or balding scalp within one month prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has used topical creams, lotions or gels of any kind to the selected treatment area within one day prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has lesions suspicious for skin cancer (skin cancer not ruled out by biopsy) or untreated skin cancers within the selected treatment area (face or scalp). Subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test articles (see Section 6.1). Subject has any skin pathology or condition (e.g., facial/scalp psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne, rosacea, etc.) that, in the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the evaluation of the test article, worsen due to the treatment or requires the use of interfering topical, systemic or surgical therapy. Subject has any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe or precludes the subject's ability to fully participate in this research study. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
