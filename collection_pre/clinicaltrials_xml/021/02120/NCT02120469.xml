	<brief_summary>This phase I/IB trial studies the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate and everolimus in treating patients with breast cancer that does not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or large amounts of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (triple-negative) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Eribulin mesylate and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate and Everolimus in Treating Patients With Triple-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus and eribulin (eribulin mesylate), and determine the recommended Phase IB dose (RP2D) of the drug combination in patients with resistant metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the event-free survival (EFS) rate for patients with resistant metastatic TNBC at the RP2D of everolimus and eribulin to determine if the drug combination is worthy of further study. (Phase IB) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine response rate in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) II. To determine overall survival (OS) in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) III. To determine toxicity in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) IV. To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) for everolimus and eribulin in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) V. To collect blood, skin punch biopsies, and tumor biopsies before and after treatment from all patients and perform proteomic analysis to determine the level of inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway in tumor cells versus non-therapeutic targets. (Phase IB) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus. Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
