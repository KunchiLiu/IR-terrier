	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Myocarditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with clinical suspicion of myocarditis biventricular endomyocardial biopsy is performed for definite diagnosis. In addition, patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla within 24 hours. The imaging protocol of both scan include assessment of myocardial edema respectively edema ratio; myocardial hyperemia respectively global relative enhancement (gRE); myocardial fibrosis/necrosis respectively myocardial LE and T1 and T2 mapping sentences. Diagnostic performance of different imaging protocols as compared to the findings of endomyocardial biopsies is calculated. The protocol also includes a follow-up MR can at 3 months.</detailed_description>
