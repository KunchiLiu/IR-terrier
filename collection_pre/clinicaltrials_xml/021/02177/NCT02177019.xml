	<brief_summary>The research project is a component of a mentored research career enhancement award. The purpose of the award is to help the PI and his collaborators prepare for future research grant opportunities through the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The research project is a feasibility study with the following specific aims; 1) to assess outcomes associated with a personalized health plan for frequent headaches; 2) to identify measurable outcomes that are meaningful to patients with frequent headaches; and 3) to create a patient stakeholder group to inform patient-centered outcomes research for frequent headaches. Specific Aim #1 will be achieved by recruiting and enrolling 40 established patients at the Duke Family Medicine Center who have frequent headaches. The intervention consists of 3 study visits with the PI, 2 clinical consultations with subjects' established primary care provider at the Duke Pickens Family Medicine Center, and participation in 2 focus groups. Personalized health plans might consist of a combination of medical management, lifestyle changes, nutrition counseling, or other therapeutic modalities as appropriate. Data analysis will be descriptive; no formal hypotheses will be tested.</brief_summary>
