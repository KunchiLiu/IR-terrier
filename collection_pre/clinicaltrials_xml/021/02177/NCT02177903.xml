	<brief_summary>The application of active warming to patients whether awake or under general anesthesia has been proven safe in numerous studies and it is common practice to use warmers. The warmers are commonly used with both the supplied blankets and also with hospital blankets. Subjects receiving standard care will not benefit from this study. Subjects in the investigational group may benefit in several ways: - Increased comfort in the pre-operative period by being warmer - Decreased incidence of mild hypothermia - Possible decreased incidence of transfusion with less bleeding - Possible decreased pain and discomfort in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) - Possible shorter stay in the PACU and overall Length of Stay (LOS) - Possible decreased risk for surgical site infection</brief_summary>
