	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the long-term (12-week) bronchodilator efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / salbutamol combination administered by the Respimat® 40 mcg / 200 mcg (one inhalation q.i.d.) to COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (two inhalations q.i.d.), ipratropium bromide Respimat® (one inhalation q.i.d.) and Placebo formulations of each in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). An additional objective was to show the superiority of Combivent Respimat as compared to ipratropium bromide (40 mcg) Respimat. Steady state pharmacokinetics over one dosing interval following four weeks of therapy were also characterized.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and the following spirometric criteria: Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2: Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤65% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤70% of FVC Male or female patients 40 years of age or older Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten packyears. A packyear is defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol Patients must be able to be trained in the proper use of an MDI (metered dose inhaler) and the Respimat® inhaler All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the patient is excluded All patients with a SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) &gt;80 IU/L, SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) &gt;80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL or creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition Patients who have a total blood eosinophil count ≥600/mm3 Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy Patients with a history of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the last 5 years Patients with a history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a history of a thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion criterion No. 1 Patients with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse Patients with known active tuberculosis Patients with an upper or lower respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma Patients with current significant psychiatric disorders Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than one hour per day and in the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium Patients who are being treated with antihistamines for any excluded allergic conditions Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than 6 weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day Patients who initiated use of an inhaled steroid or changed doses less than 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period Patients who are being treated with betablocker medications, MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Beta blocker eye medications (e.g., Betoptic) for treatment of nonnarrow angle glaucoma are allowed Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs or any component of the ipratropium bromide/salbutamol Respimat® solution (including BAC (Benzalkonium chloride) and EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)) or the ipratropium bromide/salbutamol MDI components Previous participation in this study Patients who are currently participating in another study</criteria>
