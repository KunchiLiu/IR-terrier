	<brief_summary>This study will assess whether a movement detecting wristwatch can accurately detect seizures and seizure characteristics and record them into an online epilepsy diary. The patients may manually record a description into the online epilepsy diary of the symptoms they experienced before, during or after the seizure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Biosensor for Tracking Seizures: Linking a Wrist Accelerometer to an Online Epilepsy Diary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typically, health care providers receive inaccurate patient self- reports. This pilot trial will document the feasibility of accurately recording and logging seizures into a cloud-based diary, under circumstances of controlled video-EEG monitoring to serve as a comparison "gold standard." More explicitly, we are testing the efficacy of the wristwatch in capturing movement parameters correlated with seizure activity and whether these parameters can be accurately uploaded into an online epilepsy diary. In the future, biosensor data could be valuable to more precisely obtain seizure data for clinical decision making as well as use in clinical trials.</detailed_description>
