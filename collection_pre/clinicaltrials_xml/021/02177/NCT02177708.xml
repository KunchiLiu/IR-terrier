	<brief_summary>There is increasing evidence that the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is tightly associated with low-grade cerebral edema. Uptake of ammonia in astrocytes leads to osmotic swelling caused by glutamine formation. Previous studies were performed in covert HE patients or used indirect methods. Methods: The investigators wish to describes quantitative measurement of localized water content using MRI water mapping in a cohort of patients with cirrhosis during an episode of overt HE type C and again after recovery. Furthermore patients with cirrhosis and no history of HE and healthy subjects will be investigated as controls.</brief_summary>
