	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out the effects (good and bad) of using newer technologies that allow very precise delivery of radiation. These newer technologies are Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Lymph Node Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy and Hypofractionated Prostate (SIB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the treating physicians will deliver a high dose of radiation to pelvic lymph nodes of 56 Gy (Gy/Gray = measure of amount of radiation) and at the same time give a boost (additional) radiation to the prostate itself (to 70 Gy). The study will evaluate the response of the cancer and side effects of radiation to pelvic lymph nodes and to the prostate. It is hoped that these newer technologies will: 1. allow a higher daily dose of radiation to the tumor and pelvic nodes 2. avoid nearby normal tissue and organs like the rectum and bladder 3. prevent the cancer from spreading or coming back</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed, adenocarcinoma of the prostate T12N0M0 with risk of pelvic lymph nodes involvement &gt;25% by Roach formula [(2/3xPSA) + (Gleason Score 6)x10], or any T34N0M0 Karnofsky Performance Scale &gt; 70 (Appendix II). Prostate tumor biopsy grading by Gleason score classification is mandatory prior to registration (Appendix V). No prior pelvic or prostate radiation or chemotherapy for any reason; induction hormonal therapy prior to registration is acceptable. Patients must sign a studyspecific consent form prior to registration. No evidence of distant metastases (Bone scanning) Clinical or pathological evidence of distant metastases (M1).
