	<brief_summary>Breast lesions are a common condition, diagnosed by imaging and palpation. In order to reduce the number of biopsies performed to the definitive diagnosis of a breast lesion, an imaging method with a high degree of accuracy is needed. Ultrasound imaging with microbubbles contrast media allows the diagnosis of vascularization of the lesion, according to timing. Our hypothesis is that a highly vascularized lesion that enhances in an early timing is most likely to represent a malignant lesion and thus, deserves biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. Females over 18 years age, with a focal lesion in breast will be suitable to perform this examination.</brief_summary>
