	<brief_summary>Study to demonstrate that a fixed dose combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg (FDC 80/12.5) is superior to telmisartan 80 mg (Telm 80) alone in patients who failed to respond adequately to Telm 80 monotherapy in lowering seated trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after eight weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
