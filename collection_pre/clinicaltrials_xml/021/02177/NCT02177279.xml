	<brief_summary>There is a lot of evidence to suggest that eating a diet rich in cereals such as wheat bran are beneficial in protecting us from diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. It is still not clear exactly why this happens, but it is likely that the compounds which enter our bodies when we eat such products are responsible. In this study we plan to find out what these compounds are and where they are found. The investigators will do this by asking volunteers to eat a wheat-bran meal and then measuring the compounds that appear in blood, urine and stool samples over the next twenty-four hours. Once the investigators know how much and which compounds are present, we can then find out possible reasons why they are protective, for example by looking to see whether they are anti-inflammatory. We also plan to look at whether if having a diet which contains either a lot of wheat-bran products or very low amounts of these foods effects how they are absorbed by the body. HYPOTHESIS: Wheat bran from ready-to-eat cereal has unique phytochemical profiles which are metabolized to compounds responsible for high cellular bioactivity imparting important health benefits.</brief_summary>
