	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis is that the use of a DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) clinical decision support system for individual patient management will enable considerable time savings compared to standard care. This hypothesis was formulated from pilot studies that showed dramatic decreases in DBS programming time compared to standard care for clinicians who used an iPad-based decision support system (99% time savings from over 4 hours to 2 minutes. Study group Parkinson's patients with DBS Systems</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In most cases these subjects have failed to maintain adequate control of their symptoms on medications alone. The Diagnosis of PD (Parkinson's Disease) and the decision to have DBS qualifies a subject for enrollment. Subjects would be selected because they will require DBS programming. The investigators will prospectively enroll 20 PD DBS patients at the Froedtert Movement Disorders Center (surgical targets: subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal segment of globus pallidus (GPi). Post-operative care, patients will be randomized 1/1 to standard care or using the clinical decision support system. The DBS RN will use ImageVis3D Mobile app on the iPad to program the DBS system, this software does not interact with Froedtert imaging systems. The study team uses identified images provided by the Froedtert PACS system, de identifies them, adds a study code. The images are loaded into the software system and used to identify the leads locations. The Patients will be assessed for 6 months starting with the initial DBS programming session. Importantly, the investigators do not anticipate that the clinical decision support tool will provide the final DBS settings, nor do we anticipate that this approach will obviate the need for motor exams. The clinical decision support system will help nurses choose good initial settings and then explore around those initial settings. The investigators will measure the time spent on DBS programming for patients in each group. The investigators will capture programming session duration, number of programming sessions and total time spent on DBS programming. The investigators will compare total time spent programming for the standard care versus the intervention group.</detailed_description>
