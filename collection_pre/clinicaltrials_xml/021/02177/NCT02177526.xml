	<brief_summary>Management of prostatic carcinoma varies according to stage of disease. Trans-rectal ultrasound guided biopsy is known to underestimate the degree of tumor due to undersampling and random non-targeted technique. Methods to improve pre-operative tumor localization and grading, including multi-parametric (MP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active area of research but requires further validation. High grade tumors can undergo comedo-type necrosis with malignant calcifications which only occurs in Gleason pattern 5 tumors and which we hypothesize can be reliably detected using computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI. Detection of malignant calcification within tumor foci will improve the accuracy of localization and grading in prostatic carcinoma.</brief_summary>
