	<criteria>Known or suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumor such as carcinoid; neuroendocrine tumor; neuroblastoma; pheochromocytoma. Supporting evidence may include MRI, CT, biochemical markers, and or pathology report. Age &gt; 18. Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent). Not pregnant. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for all female subjects with childbearing potential. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it Hepatic enzymes 5 times greater than the upper limits of normal, serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL (270 uM/L) Patients exceeding the weight limitations of the scanner or are not able to enter the bore of the PET/CT scanner due to BMI Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis, etc.) Inability to complete the needed investigational and standardofcare imaging examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.) Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance Recognized concurrent active infection Previous systemic or radiation treatment for another cancer of any type within the last 2 months Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing, or known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments.</criteria>
