	<brief_summary>The Lung Transplant Team at Tampa General Hospital has identified a need to improve both the quality and quantity of the education that is provided to patients listed for lung transplantation. We propose to change the method and timing of our transplant patient education. The objective of this prospective data collection will be to collect and analyze pre and post test scores of patients when patient education is provided via compact disc as compared to individualized teaching.</brief_summary>
