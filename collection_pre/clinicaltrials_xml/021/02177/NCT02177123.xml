	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect additional safety and effectiveness data on the InnFocus MicroShunt (MIDI Arrow) in subjects suffering from primary open angle glaucoma who are inadequately controlled on maximum tolerated medical therapy with intraocular pressure ≥ 18 mm Hg and ≤ 35 mm Hg and/or where glaucoma progression warrants surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject has mild to moderate primary open glaucoma where the intraocular pressure is not adequately controlled on maximum tolerated medical therapy and has intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 18mmHg and less than or equal to 35mmHg while on glaucoma medications and/or where glaucoma progression warrants surgery. 2. Primary open angle glaucoma diagnosis based on glaucomatous optic nerve damage as evidenced by any of the following optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer structural abnormalities documented on slit lamp stereo biomicroscopy or in stereo disc photos: 1. Diffuse thinning, focal narrowing, or notching of the optic disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles. 2. Localized abnormalities of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, especially at the inferior or superior poles. 3. Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural tissue. 4. Disc rim or peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer hemorrhages. 1. Active iris neovascularization, active proliferative retinopathy or other ophthalmic disease that could confound study results. 2. Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. 3. Epithelial or fibrous downgrowth. 4. Secondary glaucoma such as posttrauma, pseudoexfoliative, etc. 5. Chronic ocular inflammatory disease. 6. Prior argon laser, selective laser, or micropulse trabeculoplasty within 90 days of enrollment. 7. Inability to obtain accurate IOP measurement throughout the study. For example: a history of corneal surgery, corneal opacities or disease/pathology (Active corneal infection or Fuchs dystrophy are examples.). 8. Severe anterior or posterior blepharitis. 9. Previous incisional ophthalmic surgery, excluding uncomplicated clear corneal phacoemulsification (cataract) surgery at least 6 months prior to enrollment. 10. Prior laser peripheral iridotomy. 11. Fellow eye with poorer than 20/200 bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) 12. Angle closure glaucoma or narrow anatomical chamber angle as identified by gonioscopy and classified as Shaffer Grade 0 or 1. 13. Previous cyclodestructive procedure. 14. Use of oral hypotensive glaucoma medications for treatment of the fellow eye.</criteria>
