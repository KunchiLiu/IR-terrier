	<brief_summary>This retrospective study will investigate clinician behavior in diagnosing patients with possible obstructive coronary artery disease who received a CORUS® CAD result compared to patients who did not have the test performed (matched control patients). The data collected will be from primary care practices and will also assess one to two year health outcomes (MACE, procedure complications). Furthermore, in these real world practice settings, the study will investigate the economic impact of CORUS® CAD usage at each practice using practice specific data, when available.</brief_summary>
