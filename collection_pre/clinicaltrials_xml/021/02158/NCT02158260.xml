	<brief_title>A New Method To Reduce Gastric Missing Areas in Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background:Capsule endoscopy is widely used to observe small intestine.While it may miss important areas in stomachï¼Œespecially in fundus.So far,physicians have no methods to observe stomach without no-missing areas by capsule endoscopy. Objective:To explore a new method to reduce the areas missed by CE. Methods:Subjects were prospectively enrolled.Every subjects will undergo 2 capsule endoscopies and 1 gastroscope.First capsule endoscopy,every subject have a better gastric preparation before swallowing CE and change position during the procedure.Second capsule endoscopy,every subject have a conventional CE. And then, every subject have a gastroscope. Measurements:The primary measurements included safety, gastric preparation, visualization of gastric mucosa and rate of lesion detection.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects don't have swallowing difficulties, motility disorders, or a medical history that included abdominal surgery or obvious gastrointestinal strictures are included. Subjects with swallowing difficulty, motility disorders, diabetes, lifethreatening conditions, mental disorders, or patients that could be pregnant, have a cardiac pacemaker, electrical implant, or any other condition that would preclude compliance with the study requirements and/or device instructions are excluded from the study.</criteria>
