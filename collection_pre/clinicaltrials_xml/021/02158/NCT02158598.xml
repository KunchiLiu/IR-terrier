	<brief_summary>This is a 6-month cross-over trial of vitamin D supplementation in 38 healthy men and women aged 18 years and older. The primary aim is to compare the change in serum 25(OH)D concentration following vitamin D supplementation with chewable tablets versus pills. Secondary aims are to evaluate satisfaction and adherence to the vitamin D chewable tablet supplement. Questionnaires on physical activity, sunlight exposure and dairy product consumption will be administered to adjust for confounding factors. A questionnaire will be administered to assess satisfaction and pill count to evaluate adherence to treatment. This research intends to test the hypothesis that the vitamin D chewable tablet supplement is as effective as a traditional vitamin D pill supplement to increase serum 25(OH)D concentrations.</brief_summary>
