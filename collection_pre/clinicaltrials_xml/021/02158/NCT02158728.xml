	<brief_title>Supraventricular Tachycardia Collection Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the SVT Collect study is to collect supraventricular tachycardia episode data for developing and testing new sensing and detection algorithms for a future subcutaneous ICD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects aged 18 or above, or of legal age to give consent specific to the national law of the countries in which the trial is being conducted Subjects indicated for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)/cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRTD) implant or ICD/CRTD changeout, OR subjects indicated for an ICD/CRTD that are undergoing ablation or electrophysiology (EP) study (including Noninvasive EP Study [NIPS]) Subjects are willing to provide Informed Consent Subjects who are ventricular pacing dependent Subjects with a preexisting dual/triple chamber pacemaker or ICD who have a history of atrioventricular (AV) block with atrial pacing &lt; 120 beats per minute (BPM) while awake. Subjects who are unable to tolerate elevated ventricular rates (â‰¥170BPM) Any condition which precludes the subject's ability to comply with the study requirements Enrollment in a concurrent study (without prior study management approval) that may confound the results of this study Subjects who are legally incompetent Subjects meet exclusion criteria required by local laws and regulations (e.g. age, breast feeding, etc).</criteria>
