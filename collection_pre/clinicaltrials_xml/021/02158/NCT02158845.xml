	<brief_summary>The hemostatic and inflammatory systems may activate each other. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 10% of women. The objective of this study is to compare the hemostatic effects of two treatments widely prescribed to women with endometriosis: the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) leuprolide acetate. Hypothesis: H0: There is no alteration in hemostatic system with the use of GnRHa or LNG-IUS H1: There is alteration in hemostatic system with the use of GnRHa or LNG-IUS</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Materials and Methods: In this randomized open-label controlled trial, 44 women with endometriosis will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 22 women will be assigned to use LNG-IUS and 22 to use GnRHa. The assessed variables will be D-dimers, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, coagulation factors (F) II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI, antithrombin (AT), protein C, free protein S, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), α2-antiplasmin, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and prothrombin fragment 1+2. All variables will be assessed before treatment and six months after treatment onset.</detailed_description>
