	<brief_summary>Different capsulorhexis size results in different capsular outcome when treating pediatric cataract, and there should be an appropriate capsulorhexis size for the best capsular outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capsulorhexis Size and Capsular Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous studies have reported that ideal anterior capsulorhexis size is 4.5-5.0 mm with the capsulorhexis edges covering IOL optic surface because it can inhibit the proliferation and migration of remnant lens epithelial cells (LEC). But there are no reports investigating the relationship between the capsulorhexis size and the capsular outcome after pediatric cataract surgery. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to prospective evaluate the capsular outcomes of three controlled groups receiving different anterior capsulorhexis sizes (3.0-3.9, 4.0-5.0, 5.1-6.0 mm in diameter).</detailed_description>
