	<brief_title>Efficacy and Toxicity Study of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients Who Have Relapsed After Exposure to Lenalidomide and Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myeloma patients who relapse after prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide have survival of less than 1 year. Recently, a randomized study of Pomalidomide and dexamethasone conducted in compared with placebo and dexamethasone showed that pomalidomide can improve survival of this group of patients. Pomalidomide is a new immunomodulatory drug which has been shown to be active in myeloma patients who relapse after bortezomib and lenalidomide. A recent phase III study comparing pomalidomide plus dexamethasone with placebo plus high dose dexamethasone in patients with prior exposure to bortezomib and lenalidomide, showed that the use of pomalidomide significantly improve the overall survival of these patients. However, this study did not include Asian patients. Therefore the efficacy and toxicity of pomalidomide remains to be described in Asian patients</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Multiple myeloma, diagnosed according to standard criteria, with relapsing and refractory disease at study entry 2. Patients must have evaluable multiple myeloma with at least one of the following (within 21 days of starting treatment) 1. Serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5g/dL, or 2. In subjects without detectable serum Mprotein, Urine Mprotein ≥ 200mg/24 hour, or serum free light chai (sFLC) &gt; 100mg/L (involved light chain) and an abnormal kappa/Lambda ratio 3. Can receive up to 6 lines of prior treatment. (Induction therapy followed by stem cell transplantation and consolidation/maintenance therapy will be considered as one line of treatment) 4. Must have failed lenalidomide (based on 1 of the following criteria: a) Refractory to lenalidomide; or b) no better than stable disease after 3 cycles of lenalidomide) and relapsed from previous treatment with bortezomib. Refractoriness is defined as disease progression on treatment or progression within 6 months after the last dose of a given therapy. Relapse is defined according to the criteria of IMWG 5. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age or &gt; country's legal age for adult consent 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2 7. Patients must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria with 21 days of starting treatment: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3 and platelet ≥ 50,000/mm3 (≥ 30,000/mm3 if myeloma involvement in the bone marrow is &gt;50%) 2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN. 3. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 45mL/min or creatinine &lt; 3mg/dL. 8. Female patients who: 1. Are naturally postmenopausal for at least 2 year before enrolment 2. Are surgically sterile 3. If they are of childbearing potential**, agree to adhere to the pomalidomide pregnancy prevention risk management program in Appendix 8 : All women of childbearing potential must agree to have two negative pregnancy test within 1014 days and 24hrs before commencing pomalidomide and use two reliable methods of contraception simultaneously or practice complete abstinence from any heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days after study treatment discontinuation. The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one additional effective method to prevent pregnancy, not plan on conceiving children during or within 6 months following pomalidomide. (See Appendix 8 Pregnancy Prevention and Risk Management Program) 9. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e. status postvasectomy), who: 1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, OR 2. Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse, AND 3. Must also adhere to the guidelines of the pomalidomide pregnancy prevention and risk management program 10. Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local and institutional guidelines A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is defined as a sexually mature woman who: 1 has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2, has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (I.E, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 1.1. Exclusion Criteria 1. Female patients who are lactating or pregnant 2. Multiple Myeloma of IgM subtype 3.
