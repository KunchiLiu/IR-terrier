	<brief_summary>The use of the Percutaneous Isolated Limb Procedure (PILP) which enables the use of existing antibiotic therapies in a more targeted and concentrated fashion in patients with diabetes who have a significant lower limb infection and it is deemed that IV antibiotics are needed in order to salvage the limb or life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Technology That Permits Focal Dose of Antibiotics to be Delivered to Lower Limb(s) of Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the PILP procedure, the circulation of the limb is isolated separately from the general circulatory system thereby enabling the delivery of antibiotics only to the limb. Limb isolation is achieved by creating an "artificial" circuit where catheters are inserted into the major artery and vein of the lower limb.</detailed_description>
