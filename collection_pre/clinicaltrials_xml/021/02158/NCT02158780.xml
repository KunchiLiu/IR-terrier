	<brief_summary>Undescended Testis is the most common congenital abnormality of the genitalia in boys and it is commonly managed by surgical intervention. Evidence in the medical literature to support the superiority of either scrotal or inguinal (standard) orchidopexy is lacking. To determine which technique is superior, this study focuses on the degree of post-operative pain after surgery. Therefore, the objective of this randomized control trial is to determine if scrotal orchidopexy reduces postoperative pain in children diagnosed with undescended testis when compared to standard inguinal orchidopexy.</brief_summary>
