	<brief_summary>The planned minimal risk study is a blinded study on consecutive transfusable platelet products. The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of platelet components sampled prior to transfusion. The primary patient transfusion outcome in this study is the 1-hour corrected count increment (1 hr CCI), which is a widely accepted clinical outcome measure. Platelet products will be sampled for ThromboLUX testing before being sent from the blood bank to the treatment center. After receipt at the treatment center, the platelet products will be used as per regular clinical practice, and the outcome data from each patient will be collected. At the end of the study, TLX Scores will be compared to the transfusion outcomes to determine if a low TLX Score is associated with a poor transfusion outcome. During the course of the study, the TLX Score will not be known to the clinicians, or utilized in any way to decide if the platelet product should be transfused.</brief_summary>
