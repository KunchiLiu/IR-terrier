	<brief_summary>Objectives: The primary objective is to test whether right prefrontal cortex low frequency 1 Hz rTMS versus right prefrontal high frequency 10 Hz rTMS provides a significantly greater improvement in function as measured by IPF score and PTSD symptoms as measured with CAPS score. The secondary objectives include: one, testing which treatment provides a significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by change in QIDS score; two, testing whether depression impacts effectiveness of 1 Hz versus 10 Hz rTMS for PTSD symptoms; and three, testing which treatment is better tolerated as measured by participant drop out and side effect profiles. Research Design: Randomized single-blind (raters) prospective clinical trial testing the effectiveness 1 Hz rTMS versus 10 Hz rTMS in veterans with PTSD. Methodology: Veterans 18 to 50 years of age suffering from PTSD with and without depressive symptoms will be recruited from the community as well as from the mental health clinics at the James A. Haley Veterans Administration Hospital. Plan to enroll 50 in order to have an evaluable sample of approximately 20 in each group. Participants will be consented and undergo screening for safety and appropriateness to be in the trial. Those deemed eligible will be evaluated with clinical measures of function, PTSD, depression, pain, and neurobehavioral symptoms. Participants will be randomized in equal proportion (stratified by significant depression defined as MADRS greater than 19) to one of two active treatments: right prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS versus right prefrontal 10 Hz rTMS. Participants will undergo assessment for safety prior to each treatment. The treatments will be performed 5 days a week for 6 weeks with a 3-week taper consisting of 3 days per week, 2 days per week, and 1 day per week. Clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline, after every five treatments, at the end of the treatment, and at 1 and 3 months post treatment. CAPS and IPF scores will be used to determine if there is a significant difference between 1 Hz and 10 Hz right prefrontal rTMS for PTSD symptoms and function respectively. The QIDS scores will be used to test for a significant difference in change in depressive symptoms for both the participants with significant depressive symptoms and the entire group. The number of dropouts (related specifically to side effects and all cause) will be used along with side effect profiles to test for differences in tolerability of the two treatments.</brief_summary>
