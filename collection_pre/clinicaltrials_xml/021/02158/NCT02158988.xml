	<brief_summary>Patients with histological proven gastric cancer (including cancer of the esophagogastric junction (AEG)) and synchronous peritoneal carcinomatosis, who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, can be recruited in this study. There are two treatment groups (A and B). The chemotherapy applied intravenously is the same in both groups and is approved for the treatment of gastric cancer. Patients with negative or unknown HER-2 status will be administered Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine (EOX). Patients with positive HER-2 status will be treated with Cisplatin, Capecitabine and Trastuzumab (CCT). The chemotherapy is followed by surgical cytoreduction in both groups. Patients randomized into group B will be treated with an intraperitoneal (in the abdominal cavity) chemoperfusion with Mitomycin C and Cisplatin . Patients in both groups receive 3 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy within 4-12 weeks after the surgical procedure and are followed up for 30 months. If progress of the tumor is detected the patient will no longer be treated according to the study therapy. Patients of group B may get a HIPEC intervention without surgical cytoreduction if contraindication to the drugs applied can be excluded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) With/Without HIPEC in Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the trial is to compare the treatment of patients with peritoneal metastasized gastric cancer including carcinoma of the AEG (Adenocarcinoma of the oesophago-gastric-junction) without evidence of other distant metastases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cytoreduction with intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) and postoperative chemotherapy (Group B) and patients treated with cytoreduction alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy (Group A). Hypothesis of the trial is that surgical cytoreduction with intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (Group B) is superior to cytoreduction alone (Group A) in terms of overall survival. The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter and parallel group study.</detailed_description>
