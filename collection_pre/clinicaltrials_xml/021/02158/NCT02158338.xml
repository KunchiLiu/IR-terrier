	<brief_summary>Six studies have preceded this project. Three studies suggested that there is a significant connection between pediatric asthma and disruptions in maternal-infant bonding (Feinberg, 1988; Schwartz, 1988; Pennington, 1991). Three studies suggested that children with asthma benefit from a type of therapy that improves bonding with their mothers (Madrid, Ames, Skolek, &amp; Brown, 2000; Madrid, Ames, Horner, Brown, &amp; Navarrette, 2004; Madrid, Pennington, Brown &amp; Wolfe, 2011). This study proposes to study in a more thorough fashion the question of the incidence of bonding disruptions with between mothers and their children with asthma. This time there will be a larger sample, and more stringent criteria will used in assigning children to the asthma cohort. Through questions answered by mothers whose children have been said to have asthma, we will be able to decide if the children's respiratory conditions are likely to be attributable to asthma or more likely reflective of another respiratory condition such as vocal cord dysfunction or anxiety related hyperventilation (Anbar, 2014).</brief_summary>
