	<brief_title>A Prospective Observational Study to Assess Insulin Delivery With PaQ® in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single center, post-market observational study to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient reported outcomes of insulin delivery with PaQ® in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin therapy with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control. The patient's participation in the study is comprised of three phases: screening/baseline evaluation, transition to PaQ use and optimization, and PaQ treatment period. The use of these phases will allow an orderly transition to PaQ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret the final data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Is at least 18 years of age Has a clinical diagnosis of T2DM, as determined by clinical history and medication usage Has an A1C ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 11.0%; Is treated with basalbolus insulin therapy (at least 2 injections per day) with or without OADs, and/or glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) agonist for at least 3 months and has not had a change (addition or discontinuation of existing drug or change in dose) in their OADs for the last 8 weeks Determined by the investigator that insulin requirements to achieve glycemic targets can be met by the insulin capacity of the PaQ device If on concomitant metformin, has serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL (male) or &lt;1.4 mg/dL (female) If female, and of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and must be using adequate means of contraception as determined by the Investigator Is clinically euthyroid as judged by the Investigator Is able to understand and sign the required study documents and comply with the clinical investigational plan (CIP) requirements Is deemed capable by the Investigator to perform the requirements of the CIP, including use of PaQ, frequent selfmonitoring of blood glucose Is poorly compliant with the currently prescribed diabetes regimen, as determined by the Investigator Is poorly compliant with prescribed selfmonitoring of blood glucose, as determined by the Investigator Is currently taking or has taken sulfonylureas within the last 2 months Has a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 Has experienced recurrent severe hypoglycemia (&gt; 2 episodes) requiring assistance during the past 6 months Has existing dermal irritation/inflammation over the abdominal area that may interfere with use of PaQ, as determined by the Investigator Has known clinically significant hypersensitivity to skin adhesives Is female and if of childbearing potential, is pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant Is currently being treated with or expected to require or undergo treatment with systemic steroids by oral, intravenous, or intramuscular route (inhaled with low systemic exposure is permitted) Currently abuses drugs or alcohol or has a history of abuse that in the Investigator's opinion would cause the individual to be noncompliant Has received any investigational drug within 1 month Has donated blood within 30 days Has any significant medical condition (including current or past history of cardiovascular disease), laboratory findings, or medical history that in the Investigator's opinion may affect successful completion of the study and/or personal wellbeing Is an immediate family member (spouse, parent, child, or sibling) of personnel directly affiliated with the study at the investigative site, or is personally directly affiliated with the study at the investigative site</criteria>
