	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare different blood cells of the immune response in patients with Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia and healthy subjects. Evaluate the impact of treatments, notably corticoids, on blood cells of the immune response. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the course of this disease could lead to new treatments. 12 patients with Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia will be compared with 12 controls matched for sex and age. Controls will provide blood samples only once. The will have no particular follow-up. Patients will provide blood samples at the time of diagnosis then 3 months after the start of treatment. If a new treatment needs to be started before the end of the 3-month period, a new blood sample will be taken.</brief_summary>
