	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab or ipilimumab works as first-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by binding to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Ipilimumab blocks a substance called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) on the surface of T cells and may help the immune system kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab is more effective than ipilimumab in treating melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Bevacizumab or Ipilimumab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess whether the combination nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) and bevacizumab (AB) prolongs progression-free status relative to ipilimumab as a treatment in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the hazard of death among those randomized to AB then ipilimumab relative to those randomized to ipilimumab then AB as first line treatment in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma. II. To assess whether tumor response rate (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 1.1) differs with respect to 1st treatment course. III. To estimate whether the tumor response rate differs with respect to 2nd treatment course for those who progressed during their first treatment course. IV. To further examine the safety profile of each of these regimens. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of nab-paclitaxel when combined with bevacizumab therapy. II. To examine pharmacodynamic changes of blood-derived parameters (biomarkers) of angiogenesis and immunity as a function of therapy. III. To examine whether changes in serum biomarkers are also seen in the tumor. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm B within 2-4 weeks. ARM B: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm A within 2-4 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
