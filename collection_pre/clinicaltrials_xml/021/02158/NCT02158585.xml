	<criteria>Male and female participants aged 18 years or older Diagnosed with unilateral definite Ménière's disease according to the AAOHNS 1995 criteria, confirmed by an ENT Active vertigo: at least two Ménière's vertigo attacks (defined as lasting 20 minutes or longer and associated with tinnitus, ear fullness, or low frequency hearing loss and nausea/vomiting) every four weeks during the eightweek qualification period and at least two more Ménière's vertigo attacks during the leadin phase prior to randomization Documented unilateral lower frequency hearing loss defined as the fourtone average (arithmetic mean rounded to the nearest whole number) of the puretone thresholds at 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 kilohertz (kHz) more than or equal to 25 decibels (dB) of the worse audiogram during the six months before screening Have tried diuretics for at least one month and discontinued treatment due to continued vertigo attacks All other coexisting medical or psychiatric conditions are stable, and no greater than moderate severity Willing to avoid pregnancy during the entirety of the study (abstinence or two forms of acceptable birth control, such as condoms and oral contraceptives) Bilateral Ménière's disease Current or past history of migraine Any other neurootologic disease or major vestibular abnormality found during screening that could confound the evaluation of Ménière's symptoms Previous intolerance or sensitivity to lamotrigine On any prohibited medication within four weeks prior to the study History of tympanostomy tubes with evidence of perforation or lack of closure IT gentamicin injections or endolymphatic sac surgery within the last year History of or current immunodeficiency disease, nephrolithiasis, hypertension, cardiac disease, arrhythmia, hypercholesterolemia, hemiplegic/basilar migraine, stroke, diabetes, vascular disease or kidney disease Family history of unexplained deafness Pregnant or breastfeeding Current diseases or conditions that may be associated with an altered perception of processing stimuli Current severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator prohibits participation Previously used the investigational drug Current nonvertiginous dizziness (orthostatic or panic disorder) unless it could be clearly differentiated from Ménière's attacks by the participant</criteria>
