	<brief_summary>Retention of the gastric tube after esophagectomy is a clinically important problem, and there is a need of a simple method to evaluate emptying rate from the gastric tube after esophagectomy. Scintigraphy is the golden standard of measuring emptying rate from the gastric tube. In non-operated patients, paracetamol clearance technique have been widely used for measuring gastric emptying rate. There is no validation however if paracetamol clearance technique can be used for measuring emptying rate of the gastric tube. The investigators aim of this pilot- study is to validate paracetamol clearance technique to scintigraphy for measuring emptying rate from the gastric tube and to evaluate if there is a correlation between symptoms of retention and quality of life with the emptying rate.</brief_summary>
