	<brief_title>Urine Drug Levels Related to Source of Water for Irrigation for Vegetable Crops Among Healthy Israeli Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 healthy volunteers will undergo a food frequency questionnaire and ask to undergo a daily food diary.They will also be asked about drug exposure. At baseline they will provide a urine and hair sample to determine presence of pharmaceuticals. They will then undergo a crossover trial wih one week exposure to vegetables grown in recycled waste water or fresh water, with a three day wash out period. Participants will be asked to ingest a minimal amount of lettuce, carrots, peppers, tomatoes and lettuce during the study period. During this period questionnaires will continue and urine samples will be collected every three days. The first compound to be tested will be carbamazepine, as it is stable in water. It is important to note that vegetables provided to the participants are available in regular grocery stores. Participants will be asked to drink bottled water throughout the study period . A sample of their home drinking water will also be tested for Carbamazepine as will a sample of the vegetables they consume.</detailed_description>
