	<brief_summary>For acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing cardiac catheterization after stenting, we will give dual antiplatelet drugs (dual antiplatelet agents) therapy, the choice of the basis of medical criteria (clinical guidelines) routine as aspirin + clopidogrel or aspirin + ticagrelor, according to medical guidelines currently no other disposal alternative proposal (unless adverse drug tolerance or bleeding can not be administered); idea of this experiment for acute coronary syndrome or conventional cardiac catheterization after stenting, platelet miRNA expression (miR-96 , miR-200b, miR-495, miR-107) after cardiac catheterization and interventional treatment of clopidogrel or ticagrelor acceptance of platelet reactivity (PRU) correlation values (given clopidogrel or ticagrelor determined by the clinician, the patient follow-up experiment to track only and observation), aims to explore under different platelet reactivity (hyper-reactive or hypo-reactive), their differences in miRNA performance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 under DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy) of stable angina patients for elective stent implantation. 2. DAPT 24 hours after treatment PRU (platelet activity units) values. (Drug unresponsive patients was defined as PRU&gt; 235). 1.Not suitable for the treatment of patients with DAPT. (Active peptic ulceration or bleeding) 2 patients of aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, cilostazol medication intolerance. 3 contraindications for aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, cilostazol drug usage (such as heart failure patients not suitable for use cilostazol).</criteria>
