	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Distending Media Infusion by Manual Syringe Method for Hysteroscopic Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to minimize the amount of distending media infused during hysteroscopic procedures, investigators used manual syringe method for delivering of distending media during hysteroscopic procedures from June 2010 to November 2013 in our institute. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of manual syringe-infusion method in hysteroscopic procedures. The medical records of all women who received hysteroscopic procedures by manual fluid-infusion method or convention pump fluid infusion method between June 2010 and November 2013 will be reviewed. In order to reveal the superiority/inferiority of clinical outcome of women receiving manual fluid infusion method, perioperative outcomes will be compared.</detailed_description>
