	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate before surgery works in treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back after a period of time during which the tumor could not be detected. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To achieve an intratumoral lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) concentration of at least 1.5 uM in at least 70% of patients 3 hours after the last dose of pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A) II. To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of pulsatile lapatinib (at pulsatile maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation (using Mesoscale Discovery enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] assay for total and phospho-EGFR). (Group A and Reference Group) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety profile of pulsatile lapatinib in pre-operative patients with EGFR amplified recurrent high-grade glioma. (Group A and Reference Group) II. To evaluate acute and late toxicities associated with pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) III. To determine the effect of lapatinib on tumor cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67 [KI-67] staining). (Group A compared to Reference Group) IV. To determine the ex-vivo sensitivity of tumor sphere cultures to lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) V. To assess tumor objective response rate (ORR). (Group A and Reference Group) VI. To estimate overall survival (OS). (Group A and Reference Group) VII. To estimate progression-free survival. (Group A and Reference Group) OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. GROUP A: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -2 to 0. Within 3-5 hours after last dose of lapatinib ditosylate, patients undergo surgical resection of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. REFERENCE GROUP: Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at 30 days, every 2 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
