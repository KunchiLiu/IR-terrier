	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well blinatumomab works compared with standard combination chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether standard combination chemotherapy is more effective than blinatumomab in treating relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare disease free survival (DFS) of high-risk (HR) and intermediate-risk (IR) relapse B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients who are randomized following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR randomization). II. To compare the DFS of low risk (LR) relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab (LR randomization). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival (OS) of HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR randomization). II. To compare OS of LR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab (LR randomization). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) &gt;= 0.01% at the end of block 2 and block 3 for HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients in HR/IR randomization. II. To estimate, for treatment failure (TF) patients not previously receiving blinatumomab, the hematologic complete remission rate (CR), rate of MRD &lt; 0.01%, and proportion able to proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in CR after treatment with blinatumomab. III. To assess the feasibility and safety of rapid taper of immune suppression for the subset of HSCT patients with MRD &gt;= 0.01% pre- and/or post-HSCT with no acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). IV. To evaluate blinatumomab pharmacokinetics (PK) and explore exposure-response relationships for measures of safety and effectiveness. OUTLINE: All patients receive Block 1 over 4 weeks.
