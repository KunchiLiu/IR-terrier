	<brief_summary>Cellceutix Corporation has created a new chemical entity for the treatment of psoriasis, termed Prurisol™, which is an ester of abacavir. This first-in-human study of Prurisol (abacavir acetate) is being performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerance of a single oral doses of Prurisol administered to healthy volunteers and the bioequivalence to abacavir sulfate (Ziagen). This study will be followed by a 505(b)(2) Phase 2 trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence and Pharmacokinetic Study of Prurisol™ and Abacavir Sulfate in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prurisol™, abacavir acetate, is an ester of abacavir. Prurisol is believed to act as an immune response modifier in certain conditions, including psoriasis. Abacavir is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Ziagen, abacavir sulfate, was developed and marketed as a treatment for HIV-1 infection for over a decade. Ziagen inhibits viral DNA synthesis. Consequently, Prurisol is under consideration as a possible new therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The nonclinical efficacy of Prurisol has been demonstrated in the human psoriatic skin xenograft model in irradiated severe combined immune deficient mice. Histologic as well as visual observations confirmed a treatment benefit of Prurisol in this animal model. Interleukin-20 (IL-20) is a recently discovered cytokine displaying increased levels in psoriatic lesions, and levels of IL-20 have been shown to decrease with anti-psoriasis treatment and correlate with clinical improvement. IL-20 has been suggested as a specific target in psoriasis treatment. In comparison to vehicle-treated animals, the mice transplanted with human psoriatic tissue and treated with Prurisol had significant reductions in plasma IL-20 levels which were greater than those seen with methotrexate treatment. The expression of PRINS (psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress) was significantly lower with twice daily Prurisol treatment compared to control. This study is designed as an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, single-dose intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) study conducted in healthy volunteers. In addition, a lead-in dosing period will allow the evaluation of the PK of abacavir from 3 escalating single doses of Prurisol (50mg, 100mg, 200mg). Completion of each dosing cohort will be followed by a 24-hour safety evaluation period before moving to a higher dose. Adverse Events, vital signs, physical examination, and safety laboratory tests (clinical chemistry and hematology) from each dosed cohort will be reviewed prior to any dose escalation for next cohort. For each subject completing the first part, there will be a 5 to 21 day washout period before the next dose of study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 350mg Prurisol or 300mg of Ziagen in the second dosing period. After a 5 to 21 day washout period, subjects will receive the alternate treatment in the third dosing period. Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained over a 24 hour period for each dose. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by ascertainment of adverse events, results of clinical laboratory testing and physical examination.</detailed_description>
