	<brief_summary>This trial evaluates surgeon-modified fenestrated-branched stent-grafts (sm-FBSG) for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) that are custom-made intra-operatively with no waiting period by a qualified vascular surgeon. In addition, it aims to examine the alternative sm-FBSG for patients with restricted access to centers performing clinical trials with commercially available devices and those patients with aortic emergencies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MOSTEGRA TRIAL:MO-(Dified) STE-(nt) GRA(-ft): Surgeon-modified Fenestrated-branched Stent-grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complex aortic aneurysms are those involving the renal and visceral arteries, and open repair of these aneurysms requires more extensive dissection, aortic clamping above the renal or mesenteric arteries, and possible reconstruction of aortic branches. Recovery time tends to be longer, including more hospital days, than for endovascular repair, and there is a greater potential for complications. Many high-risk patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAA), including thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), and significant co-morbidities will be denied elective open surgery because of heightened risks associated with open repair of complex aneurysms, and therefore, the potential benefit of an endovascular option increases as well. Endovascular aneurysm repair has been shown to be an effective alternative in treating uncomplicated infrarenal and thoracic aneurysms in both the elective and urgent setting, yet there is limited experience with this technology in complex conditions. Fenestrated grafts have been developed as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with complex aortic aneurysms who are unfit for traditional open surgery. Surgeon-modified fenestrated-branch stent grafts (sm-FBSG) with branches for the visceral vessels are custom-made by a qualified vascular surgeon for patients with complex aortic conditions. It is expected that they will minimize surgical risks and promote quicker recovery, and they could represent a therapeutic option for high-risk patients unfit for open surgery.</detailed_description>
