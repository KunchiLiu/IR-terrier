	<detailed_description>This study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of Elantan SR 60 mg compared to Imdur SR 60 mg in sixty healthy Korean male subjects. Thirty subjects will be participating in a fasted state and other thirty subjects will be in a fed state. Elantan SR 60 mg and Imdur 60 mg are two formulations of Isosorbide 5-mononitrate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>An Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved written informed consent is signed and dated by the subject Subject is considered reliable and capable of adhering to the protocol (eg, able to understand and complete the schedule of study assessment), visit schedule or medication intake according to the judgment of the investigator Subject is healthy Korean male, 1955 years of age Subject is of normal body weight as determined by a body mass index between 18.5 kg/m^2 and 24.9 kg/m^2 Sitting blood pressure within the following range: SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure), 90139 mmHg; DBP (Diastolic Blood Pressure ), 5089 mmHg Subject has no abnormal symptom in a physical examination without congenital or chronic disease Subject has previously participated in this study or subject has previously been assigned to treatment in a study of the medication under investigation in this study Subject has participated in another study of an investigational medication (or a medical device) within the last 90 days or is currently participating in another study of an investigational medication (or a medical device) Subject has a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within the last 6 months Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to participate in this study Subject has a known hypersensitivity to nitrate or to any components of the investigational medicinal product or reference drugs as stated in this protocol Subject has the history or present condition of cardiovascular diseases, like acute circulatory failure (shock, vascular collapse), very low BP, acute myocardial infarction with low filling pressures, arrhythmia, left heart failure with low filling pressures, hypotension, acute attacks of angina, constrictive pericarditis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, cardiac tamponade, aortic valve and/or mitral valve stenosis Subject has the history or present condition of severe anemia, head trauma, cerebral haemorrhage, hematopenia, severe cerebrovascular insufficiency, glaucoma, gastrointestinal disorder, neurological abnormalities, hepatic disorder, renal, pulmonary or metabolic diseases Subject use a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil) Symptomatic or asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension at screening defined as a 20 mmHg or more decrease in systolic pressure, or 10 mmHg or more decrease in diastolic pressure after 1 and 3 minutes standing with the arm relaxed at the side (time zero begins after the subject is upright). 5 minutes of supine rest is used as baseline Subject has the family or personal history of abnormal bleeding Subject had clinically relevant out of range values for hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. However, in agreement with the sponsor, the Investigator may include a subject having values outside the accepted range if, in his/her opinion, these values are of no clinical significance and justification is given Subject had any clinically relevant abnormality in physical examination Subject has made a blood donation or had a comparable blood loss (&gt;400ml) within the last 3 months prior to the first day of dosing Any clinical conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the subject unsuitable for the study Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption due to the presence of lactose Subjects who have taken drug products that are enzyme inducers, such as barbiturates, or inhibitors; or who drank excessive alcohol within one month prior to the initiation of the BE (Bioequivalence) study Subjects who have taken drug products that could influence the results of the BE study within 10 days before the initiation of the BE study</criteria>
