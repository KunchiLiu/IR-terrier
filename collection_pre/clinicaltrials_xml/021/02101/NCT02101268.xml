	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the efficacy of momelotinib (MMB) versus best available therapy (BAT) in anemic or thrombocytopenic adults with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), or post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-PV/ET MF) who were treated with ruxolitinib as measured by splenic response rate at Week 24 (SRR24). Participants will be randomized to receive either MMB or BAT for 24 weeks during the randomized treatment phase, after which they will be eligible to receive MMB in an extended treatment phase for up to an additional 168 weeks. After discontinuation of study medication, assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of enrollment.</brief_summary>
