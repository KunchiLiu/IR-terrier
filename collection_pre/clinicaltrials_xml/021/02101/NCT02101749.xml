	<detailed_description>The consent form will be reviewed and signed by the participant prior to any study-related procedures. Potential study participants will be assessed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening procedures, which include taking medical history, vital signs, random blood for dextrostix and vaccination will be performed on day 1. A total of 220 participants will be randomized into 2 study arms, of which each group of 110 vaccinees will receive either seasonal intradermal influenza vaccine [group A] or seasonal intramuscular influenza vaccine [group B]. The randomization route of vaccination will be kept in concealed envelope at the study site. It will be open after subject signed informed consent form and all inclusion exclusion criteria met for enrollment. Groups A and B will receive the vaccine at day 1. Clinical activities for groups A and B during each visit (total of 5 visits). Blood will be drawn and assayed (for baseline assessment) using HAI (hemagglutination inhibition assay) to the three influenza strains.</detailed_description>
