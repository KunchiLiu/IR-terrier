	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 work compared to gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of time. Gemcitabine hydrochloride may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain instructions for the proper development and functioning of cells), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. The protein WEE1 may help to repair the damaged tumor cells, so the tumor continues to grow. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may block the WEE1 protein activity and may increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine hydrochloride by preventing the WEE1 protein from repairing damaged tumor cells without causing harm to normal cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may be an effective treatment for recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With or Without WEE1 Inhibitor MK-1775 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer receiving gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in combination with AZD 1775 (MK-1775 [WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775]) compared to subjects receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. II. To evaluate the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) cancer antigen (CA)125 response rate of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. III. To evaluate the overall survival of patients (max 1-year [yr] follow-up) receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. V. To evaluate tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations (presence of mutation and type of mutation) as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or progression-free survival [PFS] prolongation) to AZD 1775 (MK-1775) and gemcitabine treatment. VI. To evaluate p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or PFS prolongation) to AZD 1775 (MK-1775) and gemcitabine treatment. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate patient reported outcomes using Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). II. To evaluate the concordance of TP53 mutations in the tumor specimen and TP53 mutations determined by tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (Tam-Seq) in circulating tumor DNA. III. To correlate the levels circulating DNA TP53 mutations by Tam-Seq with response. IV. Validation of phosphorylated-cyclin-dependent cycle 2 (pCDC2) and gamma-H2A histone family, member X (H2AX) in skin and tumor tissue as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy. V. To correlate changes in pCDC2 and gamma-H2AX with survival outcomes and response rate. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and gemcitabine hydrochloride as patients in Arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma; all histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer are eligible, but only patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer will be considered for the statistical analysis; nonhigh grade serous cancers will be allowed in an exploratory cohort Patients must be platinumresistant (platinumfree interval &lt; 6 months) or have platinumrefractory disease as per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup Committee (GCIC) criteria; disease progression has to be radiologic or clinical; biomarker progression with CA125 after a platinum based regimen would not be sufficient evidence of disease progression; the patients must have had radiological progression to that regimen Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;
