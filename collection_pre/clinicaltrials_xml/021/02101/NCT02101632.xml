	<brief_summary>Topical application of BV ointment in patients with Research Diagnostic Criteria/Temporomandibular Disorder 1a and 1b (RDC/TMD) in experimental group, compared to placebo (vaseline) in control group.Application was repeated 3 times a day, during 14 days. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure masseter rest tonus and maximal voluntary contraction tonus. Pain intensity was also analysed in VAS scale. Effectiveness of BV was compared with placebo in masseter myofascial pain in patients with TMD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myorelaxant Effect of Bee Venom(BV) Topical Skin Application in Patients With RDC/TMD Ia and Ib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study was evaluation of myorelaxant action of bee venom(BV) ointment, comparing to placebo.Parallel group, randomized double blinded trial was performed, including 79 patients with painful RDC/TMD 1a and 1b. Muscle tension was measured twice (TON1 and TON2) in rest muscle tonus (RMT) and maximal muscle contraction (MMC) on both sides right and left, with Easy Train Myo EMG (Version 3.1). Pain intensity was also analysed in VAS scale</detailed_description>
