	<brief_summary>To assess whether the DIABELOOP algorithm provides better glycemic control than the usual algorithm of T1D patients on pump therapy: - at meals, with CHO roughly assessed by the patient. - during and after physical activity sessions qualified as moderate by the patient. Primary endpoint : time within the glycemic reference range. The study will be conduct with 15 patients at the following investigation centers : Corbeil Hospital, CHU of Grenoble, and CHU of Montpellier.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 15 patients will have 2 visits during 24 hours (day and night), once with their usual algorithm and once with the Diabeloop system.</detailed_description>
