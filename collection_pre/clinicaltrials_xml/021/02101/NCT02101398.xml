	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Transcranial Stimulations in Aphasic Subject Within a Year of Their Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TDCS have shown a positive effect on clinical outcome in naming treatment in aphasic subjects however some aspects as the positioning of the electrodes on the head are still unclear. That is why we compare the effects of four different positionings of the electrodes (two anterior over Broca's area and its homologue and two posterior over Wernicke's area and its homologue) to a sham stimulation in order to observe if a more important effect of one or another positioning could be found.</detailed_description>
