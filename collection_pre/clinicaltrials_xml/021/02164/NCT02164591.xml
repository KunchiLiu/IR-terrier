	<brief_title>Escalating Temporary Gastric Electrical Stimulation (GES) for Severe Gastroparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will look to determine the clinical benefit placing temporary gastric electrical stimulation, the ability to predict the clinical response to surgical implantation of GES, and the feasibility and patient tolerability of endoscopic placement of temporary Gastric Electrical Stimulator (t-GES),</detailed_description>
