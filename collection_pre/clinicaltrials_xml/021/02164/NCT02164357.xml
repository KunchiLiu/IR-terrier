	<brief_summary>This study will compare two ways of treatment for acute ischemic stroke: an endovascular treatment (EVT), defined as intraarterial thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy as a first choice treatment versus intravenous thrombolytic therapy (IVT) only or followed by EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a main brain artery occlusion within 4.5 hours after onset. Patients treated with IVT only or with IVT followed by EVT will be analyzed separately.</brief_summary>
