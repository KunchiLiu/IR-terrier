	<brief_summary>The quality of colon cancer surgery is highly debated these years since the mortality of the disease is not declining markedly. Surgery is the main treatment of colon cancer and during surgery it is very important for the surgeon to remove the tumour and all potential ways of tumour spread. As colon cancer first of all spreads to the nearby lymph nodes lying along the tumour feeding artery the surgeon aims to cut the vessel as central as possible. This means that all of the tumour feeding artery should have been removed after surgery. In this study the investigators want to measure the length of the tumour feeding artery after surgery as a quality control of the surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the artery will be shorter than 5 mm. The investigators wish to CT scan all patients two days after colon cancer surgery and afterwards measure then length of the artery on the images. This study will not inflict with the normal routine for patient information and treatment.</brief_summary>
