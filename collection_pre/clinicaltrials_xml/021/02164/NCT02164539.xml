	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-response of 4 doses of umeclidinium bromide in combination with fluticasone furoate compared with fluticasone furoate monotherapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease participants with an asthmatic component. The fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide treatments will also be compared to the once-daily inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist combination fluticasone furoate/vilanterol.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older COPD with evidence of an asthmatic component as demonstrated by spirometry, reversibility and current therapy at screening as follows: Postbronchodilator morning (AM) FEV1 &gt;=50% and &lt;=80% of the predicted normal value at Visit 1 Pre and postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7. Demonstrated reversibility by &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL increase in FEV1 following albuterol at Visit 1. A need for regular controller therapy (i.e., inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with a long‐acting beta‐agonist or leukotriene modifier, etc.) for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Outpatient subjects who are smokers or nonsmokers. History of lifethreatening respiratory event within the last 5 years. Unresolved respiratory infection Recent Severe COPD or Asthma Exacerbation Risk factors for pneumonia Hospitalization for pneumonia within 3 months Concurrent respiratory disease other than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Other uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study. Viral hepatitis or HIV Current or chronic history of liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities Drug or milk protein allergy Administration of prescription or overthecounter medication that would significantly affect the course of COPD or asthma, or interact with study drug Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within 12 months prior to screening. Use of longterm oxygen therapy (LTOT) Requirement for nebulized therapy Participation in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 weeks Unstable or lifethreatening cardiac disease Abnormal and clinically significant 12Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding Diseases preventing the use of anticholinergics</criteria>
