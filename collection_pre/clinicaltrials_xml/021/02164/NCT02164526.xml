	<brief_summary>Left heart disease is the main cause of pulmonary hypertension. With the advent of the aging society, chronic heart failure has become a global public health problem. Therefore the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension due to the left heart disease is increasing. However, there is no research on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension due to the left heart disease in China. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to describe real-world outcome of Chinese patients with pulmonary hypertension due to the left heart disease and identify factors that may predict outcome. Our study will profile the demographics, clinical course, treatments, and outcomes of pulmonary hypertension due to the left heart disease in China.</brief_summary>
