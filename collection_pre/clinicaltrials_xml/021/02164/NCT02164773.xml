	<brief_title>Addition of Magnesium Sulfate to Caudal to Prevent Postoperative Emergence Agitation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergency agitation is considered one of the postoperative complication after sevoflurane anesthesia.In the enrollment of this study,children undergoing lower abdominal surgery will be enrolled in one of two groups.BM group, receive caudal magnesium sulfate 50 mg beside the conventional bupivacaine in the caudal space in ,B group, addition of 1 ml of normal saline0.9% to bupivacine .Monitoring of the postoperative emergence agitation by different emergence agitation scores with monitoring of sedation score.Detection of expected postoperative complications as nausea and vomiting.</detailed_description>
