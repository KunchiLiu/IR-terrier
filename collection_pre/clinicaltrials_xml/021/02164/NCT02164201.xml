	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study designed to collect clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of BioFoam used as a surgical adjunct to anastomotic hemostasis following cardiovascular surgery. The overall objective of this clinical study is to collect clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of BioFoam used as a surgical adjunct to anastomotic hemostasis following cardiovascular surgery. This study is intended as a post-market surveillance (follow-up) study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is undergoing an elective cardiac or cardiovascular procedure; Subject is willing and able to give prior written informed consent for investigation participation; and Subject is &gt; 18 years of age. Intraoperative inclusion criteria include: • Subject that requires the use of an adjunctive surgical hemostatic agent to the repair site to control generalized oozing following standard repair procedures (such as sutures and staples). • Subject with known hypersensitivity to albumin, bovine products, or glutaraldehyde; Subject with active infection (either systemic or in the repair region); Subject whose pathology or underlying disease state makes them an unacceptable candidate for a clinical investigation in the opinion of the Investigator; Subject diagnosed with a coagulation disorder; Subject with abnormal calcium metabolism (e.g., chronic renal failure, hyperparathyroidism); Subject whose life expectancy is less than that required for the prescribed followup duration; Subject who is pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant during the followup period, or actively breastfeeding; or Subject who is immunocompromised. Intraoperative exclusion criteria include: • Any major intraoperative bleeding incidences (i.e., American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support Class II, III, or IV Hemorrhage).</criteria>
