	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at two different types of surgeries regularly used for treating cancer that has spread to and weakened the thigh bone (femur). Because it is not known which of these surgeries is best, the investigators will compare the results of the two procedures. They are looking to see if differences exist (after surgery) in function, quality of life, pain control, and possible complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial to Assess Patient Quality of Life and Function After Alternative Surgeries for Pathologic Fractures of the Femur</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Fractures, Spontaneous</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Surgeon's estimated survival â‰¥ 1 month Patients presenting for orthopaedic evaluation with a painful impending pathologic femur fracture or displaced pathologic femur fracture in the intertrochanteric, pertrochanteric, or subtrochanteric region of the proximal femur. The anatomic region of interest is defined by a line drawn from the base of the femoral neck to 5 cm below the base of the lesser trochanter or 2 diaphyseal shaft widths, whichever is greater. Patients with an impending fracture who have had bevacizumab are eligible provided there will be a 3week window between their last infusion and surgery. Diagnosis of widespread visceral and/or osseous metastatic disease based on clinical and radiographic evidence. (Patients may continue on study if surgery shows a nonmalignant process.) All cancer diagnoses, except lymphoma, will be eligible Estimated survival &lt;1 month A large soft tissue mass or other disease involving an area outside of the defined pertrochanteric anatomic region described above. (Patients excluded based on intraoperative findings will be replaced on the study.) Prior surgical treatment of the area (i.e., revision cases). A biopsy does not constitute prior surgical treatment. Radiographic evidence of an intramedullary occlusion by blastic metastases that would necessitate an alternative method of treatment, such as a plate/screw construct. Diagnosis of lymphoma Age &lt; 18 years Patients with advanced hip arthritis on radiographic imaging Previous randomization for a contralateral procedure as part of this study</criteria>
