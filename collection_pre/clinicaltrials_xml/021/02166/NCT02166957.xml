	<brief_summary>Complete esophageal obstructions leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses but never for disruption with loss of tissue and SES. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective observationnal study about patients referred for complete esophageal disruption and classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (&gt; 5cm), after caustic ingestion or due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal; 2/ Short disruption (&lt; 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy. All the procedures are performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, using CO2 and under X-rays guidance. We report the characteristeristics of the procedures, the efficacy, the time before discharge and refeeding, the complications, and the follow-up, especially the number of dilatation sessions for each group. The hypothesis is that anterograde retrograde endoscopic technique is safe and effective for the management of esophageal disruptions in patients for which the surgical treatment confers a high risk of morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
