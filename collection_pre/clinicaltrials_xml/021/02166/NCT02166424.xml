	<brief_title>The Synchronized Trial on Expectant Mothers With Depressive Symptoms by Omega-3 PUFAs (SYNCHRO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maternal depression can have a significant harmful influence on both mothers and children. Considering the possibility of adverse effects of antidepressants and previous meta-analyses showing the positive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation in reducing depressive symptoms, omega-3 PUFAs may provide a safe strategy. The investigators evaluate efficacy and safety of omega-3 PUFAs for pregnant women with depressive symptoms.</detailed_description>
