	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate whether do-it-yourself devices for self-measuring health parameters by subjects can be used for obtaining useful data in scientific studies. Besides, the study aims to evaluate if increased awareness of own health status by self-monitoring health parameters also serves as motivational instrument for changing health behaviour.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Potential of Do-it-yourself Devices for Obtaining Personal Health Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During this three month study subjects will self-monitor multiple parameters of health with do-it-yourself devices. Subjects are supplied with devices for measuring physical activity, food intake, body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose level and blood cholesterol level. These devices have to be used with varying frequencies, ranging from continuously to only a baseline- and endpoint measure. Subjects will have to upload data resulting from these self-measures to an encoded account on an online portal. At any time during the study, subjects can log-on to this portal, to gain insight in their own health parameters. Only encoded subject data can be exported from this portal for data analysis.</detailed_description>
