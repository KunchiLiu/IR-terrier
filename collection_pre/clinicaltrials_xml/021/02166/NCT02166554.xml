	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety Study of a New Cross-linked Hyaluronan Hydrogel in the Reduction of Postsurgical Peritoneal Adhesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postsurgical adhesions are a common medical complication of gynecologic and pelvic surgeries, and are frequently associated with chronic or recurrent pelvic pain, intestinal obstruction and infertility. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the new crosslinked hyaluronan hydrogel versus the standard of care for the reduction of postoperative adhesions in subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. Subjects were scheduled to return at 9 weeks after the initial surgical procedure. At that time, a second-look laparoscopy was performed for postsurgical adhesion assessment. Adhesions were graded using a modified American Fertility Society (mAFS) scoring system.</detailed_description>
