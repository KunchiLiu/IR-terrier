	<detailed_description>This survey was designed to investigate the treatment status of hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome-related risk factors treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets (Blopress Tablets), as well as to assess relationships between risk factors (example, visceral fat accumulation) and the incidence of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events in an exploratory manner. For adults, 4-8 mg of candesartan cilexetil is typically administered orally once daily. The dose is increased up to 12 mg, as necessary. For patients with complications of renal damage, however, administration of candesartan cilexetil should be started at 2 mg once daily, and, as necessary, the dose increased up to 8 mg.</detailed_description>
