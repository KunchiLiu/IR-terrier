	<brief_summary>Self expandable stent (SEMS) constitutes the main palliative treatment in advanced esophageal cancer. The palliative effect of SEMS is immediate when it comes to relief of dysphagia. The duration of this effect is however questionable. The design of SEMS can be of importance since the device can dislodge and as a consequence of that dysphagia recur. The hypothesis has therefore been formulated that a partially covered SEMS is associated with less tendency to dislocate as compared to those SEMS, recently developed, which are covered through their entire length.</brief_summary>
