	<brief_summary>1. Target disease : Patients with combined dyslipidemia with adequately controlled LDL-C but inadequately controlled triglyceride level by atorvastatin monotherapy 2. Study objective : The objective of this study is to demonstrate that Pravafenix Cap. is clinically superior to atorvastatin by evaluating a percent change in Non-HDL-C in each group after 8 weeks treatment with atorvastatin or Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) in patients with adequately controlled LDL-C but inadequately controlled triglyceride level by atorvastatin monotherapy in a multicenter, randomized, double blind setting. 3. Phase and design : A multicenter, double blind, randomized, active controlled, parallel-design, Phase 3 study 4. Duration of study : 12 months from the IRB approval date 5. Duration of administration : 4-week single blind run-in period plus 8-week double blind treatment period</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pravafenix Cap to Verify the Superiority Than Atorvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pravastatin/Fenofibrate Complex in Patients With Combined Dyslipidemia With Adequately Controlled LDL-C But Inadequately Controlled Triglyceride Level by Atorvastatin Monotherapy. After administrating the atorvastatin or Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) for 8 weeks, evaluate the variation of the Non-HDL-C for each arm. Ultimatly verificaite the Pravafenix Cap. (pravastatin sodium/fenofibrate) have better effects than atorvastatin.</detailed_description>
