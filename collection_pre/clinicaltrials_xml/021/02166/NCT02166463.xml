	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies brentuximab vedotin and combination chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. Combinations of biological substances in brentuximab vedotin may be able to carry cancer-killing substances directly to Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without brentuximab vedotin in treating Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the event free survival (EFS) of a novel regimen incorporating brentuximab vedotin (Bv; Adcetris) in the chemotherapy backbone of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (doxorubicin hydrochloride), vincristine (vincristine sulfate), etoposide, prednisone and cyclophosphamide (Bv-AVEPC) in newly diagnosed high-risk classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) compared to those treated with Adriamycin, bleomycin sulfate, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide (ABVE-PC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether children/adolescents with high-risk cHL treated with Bv-AVEPC have a higher rate of early response (determined by fludeoxyglucose F 18 [FDG]-positron emission tomography [PET]) and a reduction in protocol directed radiation therapy (RT) compared to those treated with ABVE-PC. II. To compare the rate of neuropathy (&gt;= grade 3) among patients treated on the Bv-AVEPC (experimental arm) to patients treated on the ABVE-PC (standard arm). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To validate and compare the Childhood Hodgkin International Prognostic Score (CHIPS) to conventional Ann Arbor Stage (Stages II B with bulk, III B, IV A or B) in predicting outcome in high-risk childhood cHL. II. To determine the incidence of preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) and testis-specific antigens in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- cHL tumors and the incidence of EBV antigens (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 [EBNA1], Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 [LMP1], large multifunctional peptidase 2 [LMP2]) in EBV+ cHL tumors, with the goal of developing strategies to integrate cellular therapy into treatment for newly diagnosed high-risk cHL. (Biology) III. To incorporate qualitative visual FDG-PET into response-directed treatment algorithms and explore quantitative FDG-PET and computed tomography (CT) definitions of tumor burden and response for incorporation into next generation pediatric cHL risk-stratification schemes. (Imaging) IV. To evaluate the reduction in normal tissue irradiation associated with the current treatment approach compared to the volume of historic involved field radiation therapy (IFRT) fields. (Radiation Therapy) V. To evaluate EFS and patterns of relapse following protocol-specified RT utilization and treatment volumes. (Radiation Therapy) VI. To characterize the extent of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), as reported by patients and parent proxies, through serial administration of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX). (Patient Reported Outcomes [PRO] of Peripheral Neuropathy and Health-Related Quality of Life) VII. To describe the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) consequences of peripheral neuropathy over time by correlating total neuropathy scale scores with the individual items with the Child Health Ratings Inventories (CHRIs)-Global scale (e.g., physical health, pain, emotional functioning). (PRO of Peripheral Neuropathy and Health-Related Quality of Life) VIII. To perform a cross validation of the FACT-GOG-NTX with the Total Neuropathy Score-Pediatric Vincristine (TNS-PV) to determine the performance of both measures with the use of brentuximab vedotin in a limited institutional approach in children and adolescents with cHL. (PRO of Peripheral Neuropathy and Health-Related Quality of Life) IX. To assess the resource use and cost implications of Bv in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) for newly diagnosed high-risk cHL in children and adolescents. (Economic) OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (ABVE-PC): Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin sulfate IV over 10 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 8, vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 2. ARM II (Bv-AVEPC): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive doxorubicin hydrochloride, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide as in Arm I and vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 8. In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 months.</detailed_description>
