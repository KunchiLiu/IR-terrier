	<detailed_description>40 normal weight and 40 overweight kindergarden and elementary school children will participate in this study. Anthropometric measurements: weight, height, BMI and BMI percentiles will be measured and calculated for each participant. The participants will take part in two non-exercise activities at the 'sport and health center for children and adolescence'. At the end of each activity, a lunch buffet that contains all food ingredients will be served. During one meeting the children will be handed a regular plate and at the second meeting they will be handed a specially designed plate (with marking of the recommended meal composition and portion). The amount and composition of food on the plates will be assessed by weighing and photography before and after eating and analysed to report macronutrient consumption by a dietitian. The meetings for normal weight children will be separated from the overweight children.</detailed_description>
