	<brief_summary>In assisted reproductive technology (ART) semen needs to be processed. Commonly used methods rely on physical properties of the spermatozoa, such as the swim-up methods and density gradient centrifugation. It is now known that current processing of spermatozoa does not prevent the admixture of spermatozoa with damaged genetic material. The latter have a negative impact on the outcome of ART. The investigators developed a new method for the processing of spermatozoa with intact genetic material based on flow cytometry and sorting (FACS) and on staining using a deye, YoPro. The investigators aim at examining the effect of this novel method of sperm sorting on the outcome of ART.</brief_summary>
