	<brief_summary>The objectives of this registry are to 1. Collect clinical data on Boston Scientific's ImageReady MR Conditional Pacing Systems involving the INGEVITY lead based on observations / events 2. Gather data on actual number of MRI scans performed in the patient cohort implanted with an ImageReady system including information about scanned body parts. 3. Collect physician feedback on lead handling with the INGEVITY lead in a real-life, market-released standard of care environment using devices on intended purpose and which are authorized to bear the CE (Communauté Européenne) marking / are approved for use in the applicable area of participating centers.
