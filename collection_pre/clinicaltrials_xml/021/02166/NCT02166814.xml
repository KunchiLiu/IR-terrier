	<criteria>1. Patients who voluntarily signed informed consent for participating in this clinical trial 2. Male and female between 20 and 75 years old 3. Patients must have been confirmed essential hypertension and dyslipidemia at Screening visit (Visit1) 4. Patients who meet the following criteria of fasting LDLC and blood pressure at Baseline visit (Visit3) assessment after undergoing the therapeutic lifestyle change. Low risk group: the case that does not have any other risk factor apart from hypertension / LDLC (mg/dL): ≥160, ≤250, Mean SiSBP(mmHg): ≥140, &lt;180 Moderate risk group: the case that has more than or equal to one risk factor apart from hypertension and has the 10year risk of less than 10% / LDLC (mg/dL): ≥160, ≤250, Mean SiSBP(mmHg): ≥140, &lt;180 Moderate high risk group: the case that has more than or equal to one risk factor apart from hypertension and has the 10year risk between 10% and 20% / LDLC (mg/dL): ≥130, ≤250, Mean SiSBP(mmHg): ≥140, &lt;180 High risk group: the case of CHD (Coronary heart disease) or CHD risk equivalents Risk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension (BP≥140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication), low HDL cholesterol (&lt;40mg/dL), family history of premature CHD(CHD in male firstdegree relative &lt;55 years of age; CHD in female firstdegree relative &lt; 65 years of age), and age (men≥45 years; women ≥55 years). in case of HDLC ≥60mg/dL, reduce 1 from the total number of risk factors. Electronic 10 year risk calculators are available at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol CHD includes history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery procedures (angioplasty or bypass surgery), or evidence of clinically significant myocardial ischemia. CHD risk equivalents include atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and carotid artery disease [transient ischemic attacks or stroke of carotid origin or &gt;50% obstruction of a carotid artery]), diabetes and 2+ risk factors with 10 year risk of over 20% 5. Subject must be able to understand the trial procedures and be willing to cooperate and complete the trial. 1. Severe hypertension patients with mean siSBP ≥ 180mmHg and/or SiDBP ≥110mmHg at the assessment of Screening visit (Visit1) and/or Baseline visit (Visit3). Or patients with postural hypotension with manifestation. 2. Patients with the mean SiSBP from 3 times of measurement of over 20mmHg. 3. Secondary hypertension patients, but not limited to the following disease (example: renovascular disease, adrenal medullary and cortical hyperfunctions, coarctation of the aorta, hyperaldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, etc) 4. Secondary dyslipidemia: nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemia, obstructive hepatopathy or Cushing's syndrome. 5. Patients with fasting TG ≥ 400mg/dL at PreBaseline visit (Visit2) assessment 6. History of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis or/and CK ≥ 2 times upper normal limit. 7. Use of lipid modifying drug within 4 weeks prior to PreBaseline visit (Visit2) and/or antihypertensive drug within 2 weeks prior to PreBaseline visit(Visit2) 8. Clinically significant renal function abnormality in the laboratory results at PreBaseline visit (i.e. serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 times upper normal limit), liver function abnormality (ALT, AST ≥ 2 times upper normal limit), severe fatty liver disease that requires medication. 9. Clinically significant hypokalemia(less than 3.5 mmol/L) or hyperkalemia (exceeded 5.5 mmol/L) measured at PreBaseline visit (Visit2) 10. Subjects with following surgical and internal disease that may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs and have conditions which include the following (but are not limited to): history of major gastrointestinal surgeries including gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy or bowel resection, gastrointestinal bypass graft and stabling; current active gastritis, ulcer, gastrointestinal and rectal bleeding, presence of active inflammatory bowel syndrome or biliary obstruction with the past 12 months. 11. Subjects with depletion of body fluid or sodium ion not able to correct 12. Subjects with sever insulindependent Diabetes Mellitus(DM) or Chronic DM (HbA1c &gt; 9% at PreBaseline visit, dosage of an oral hypoglycemic agent was modified within 12 weeks prior to screening visit , or currently use of active insulin treatment) or with hypothyroidism not able to correct.( TSH ≥ 1.5 times upper normal limit) 13. Subjects with severe heart disease (Heart failure New York Heart Association(NYHA) class 3 and 4), or history of any of the followings within the past 6 months; ischemic heart disease (e.g. angina pectoris, myocardial infarction), peripheral vascular disease, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft. 14. Subjects with clinically significant ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or any other clinical significant arrhythmia conditions at discretion of investigator 15. Subjects with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe obstructive coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically significant aortic valve stenosis, or mitral valve stenosis. 16. Subjects with severe cerebrovascular disorder (e.g. stroke, cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage within the past 6 months) 17. Subjects with chronic inflammatory disease requiring an chronic antiinflammatory therapy, past or current medical history with wasting disease, autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) or connective tissue disease. 18. Subjects with known moderate or malignant retinosis (e.g. retinal hemorrhage, visual disturbance or retinal microaneurysm in the past 6 months) 19. Subjects with hepatitis B (including positive test for HBsAg), hepatitis Cpositive 20. Subjects with history or evidence of abusing drugs or alcohol within the past 2 years. 21.
