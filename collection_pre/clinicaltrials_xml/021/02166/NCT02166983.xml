	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies cognitive enhancement program in improving cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. A cognitive enhancement program may help improve cognitive function in breast cancer survivors and may help doctors plan better treatment for cognitive decline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Enhancement Program in Improving Cognitive Function in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To improve cognition of women who have had breast cancer and exhibit cognitive decline through a cognitive enhancement program. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I (Cognitive Enhancement Program): Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM IA (Lumosity): Participants complete Lumosity cognitive exercises. Lumosity cognitive exercises are online video game-based activities that are designed to practice various cognitive skills including processing speed, attention, memory and executive function. Participants complete cognitive exercises at least 20 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Participants also complete relaxation exercises (guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and/or autogenics) at least 10 minutes a day for 6 weeks and compensatory strategies (the use of external devices such as a notebook, day planner, or smartphone for cuing, reminding, and organizing; the use of memory strategies such as repetition, paraphrasing, and active listening; and the use of executive strategies such as self-talk for planning and attention orientation) as much as possible. ARM IB (Active Journaling): Participants complete Active Journal cognitive exercises. Active Journaling requires participants to keep a written diary or journal where she discusses what her thoughts and feelings about various events with a focus on describing the meaning of the activities and experiences, particularly new things that were learned. Active Journaling is a method of practicing various cognitive skills including communication, organization, memory and executive function. Participants complete cognitive exercises at least 20 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Participants also complete relaxation exercises and compensatory strategies as in Arm IA. ARM II (Lumosity only): Participants complete Lumosity cognitive exercises as in Arm IA.</detailed_description>
