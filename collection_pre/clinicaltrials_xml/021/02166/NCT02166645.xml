	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient positioning (prone and supine positioning) contributes to the success of extubation in the immediate postextubation period of preterm infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Preterm Infants Who Are Placed on Their Back or Stomach in the Immediate Postextubation Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is double-blinded randomized controlled trial, whose aim is to compare the proportion of successful extubation of preterm infants immediately after the extubation. Methods: Participants will be recruited from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and they will be divided into two groups (supine and prone) and positioned in their respective groups after extubation. A clinical evaluation form and a parameters collection form (respiratory rate, heart rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen, fraction of inspired oxygen and temperature) will be used and filled before extubation and 48 hours after by the professional staff of the NICU. It will be considered a successful extubation all participants who staying extubated for 48 hours after extubation.</detailed_description>
