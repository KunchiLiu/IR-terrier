	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability of Carbavance Compared to Piperacillin/Tazobactam in Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTIs), Including Acute Pyelonephritis (AP), in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the current era of increased resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenem antimicrobial agents are frequently the antibiotics of "last defense" for the most resistant pathogens in serious infections, including those found in cUTIs. The recent dissemination of serine carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae in many hospitals worldwide now poses a considerable threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents. Rempex is developing Carbavance (meropenem/vaborbactam) administered as a fixed combination by intravenous (IV) infusion, to treat serious Gram-negative infections, such as cUTIs, including those infections caused by bacteria resistant to currently available carbapenems.</detailed_description>

Expectation, in the judgment of the Investigator, that any indwelling urinary catheter or instrumentation (including nephrostomy tubes and/or indwelling stents) will be removed or replaced (if removal is not clinically acceptable) before or as soon as possible, but not longer than 12 hours, after randomization. 7. Expectation, in the judgment of the Investigator, that the participant will survive with effective antibiotic therapy and appropriate supportive care for the anticipated duration of the study. 8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before randomization and be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception between randomization and for 7 days after the completion of the study. A highly effective method of contraception includes 2 of the following: hormonal implants/patch, injectable hormones, oral hormonal contraceptives, prior bilateral oophorectomy, prior hysterectomy, prior bilateral tubal ligation, intrauterine device, approved cervical ring, condom, true abstinence (if approved by the Investigator), or a vasectomized partner. 9. Willingness to comply with all the study procedures, whether in the hospital or after discharge, for the duration of the study. 1. Presence of any of the following conditions: 1.
