	<brief_summary>Noninvasive pulse pressure variation for the guidance of perioperative fluid therapy is compared with the gold standard of invasive measurements. Cardiac output is derived by the PICCO monitor. Hypothesis: Noninvasive CNAP PPV predicts fluid responsiveness. A grey zone for the prediction of fluid responsiveness will be defined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy of CNAP PPV Under General Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accuracy of PPV measured by two devices,PICCO and CNAP, is compared with the manually calculated PPV from the arterial line waveform. Established tests like passive leg raising and end-expiratory occlusion are used for prediction of fluid responsiveness. Intraoperative events like volume challenge are monitored.</detailed_description>
