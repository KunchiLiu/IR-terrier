	<brief_title>18F-FDOPA PET/CT or PET/MRI in Measuring Tumors in Patients With Newly-Diagnosed or Recurrent Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial compares fluorine F-18 fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-fluorodopa or 18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring tumors in patients with glioma that is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has returned). 18F-FDOPA is a radioactive drug that binds to tumor cells and is captured in images by PET. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI are used with PET to describe information regarding the function, location, and size of the tumor. PET/CT or PET/MRI may be more accurate than standard MRI in helping doctors find and measure brain tumors.</detailed_description>
