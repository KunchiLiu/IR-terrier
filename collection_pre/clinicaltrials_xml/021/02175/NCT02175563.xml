	<brief_summary>According to the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines for patient to a depth of approximately 5-6 cm on a firm and flat surface when possible. However, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performers may need to continue the chest Resuscitation 2010, CPR performers should compress the sternum of a compression in an oblique direction, such as in elevators. For a pregnant patient in cardiac arrest, the 2010 ERC Guidelines recommend that the performer place the patient in a left-lateral tilt of 15 - 30Â° using a firm wedge to support the pelvis and thorax because the pregnant uterus can compress the inferior vena cava. We hypothesized Smartphone based chest compression feedback app would improves quality of CPR in an angulated surface.</brief_summary>
