	<brief_title>Open-Label Extension Assessing Long Term Safety and Efficacy of IONIS-TTR Rx in Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a rare, hereditary disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. TTR is made by the liver and secreted into the blood. TTR mutations cause it to misfold and deposit in multiple organs causing FAP. IONIS-TTR Rx is an antisense drug that is designed to decrease the amount of mutant and normal TTR made by the liver. It is predicted that decreasing the amount of TTR protein will result in a decrease in the formation of TTR deposits, and thus slow or stop disease progression. This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of extended dosing with IONIS-TTR Rx in patients with Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy.</detailed_description>
