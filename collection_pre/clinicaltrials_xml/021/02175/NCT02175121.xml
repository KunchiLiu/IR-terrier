	<criteria>Male subjects and nonchildbearing potential female subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years old. Body Mass Index of 18.0 to 45.4 kg/m2; and a total body weight of &gt;50 kg HbA1c value at the screening visit meeting once of the following criteria: Currently taking acceptable oral antiglycemic drug therapy within 6.5 to 9.5% Not currently taking any oral antiglycemic drug therapy within 7 to 10.5% Fasting plasma glucose concentrations&lt;270mg/dL at the screening and runin visit, confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary. Subjects must be willing and able to perform selftests of blood glucose at least 4 times per day, and maintain a diary for the duration of participation in the study; and therefore, subjects must be literate. History of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary forms of diabetes One or more selfreported hypoglycemic episodes of sever intensity within 3 months of screening; or 2 or more selfreported hypoglycemic episodes of severe intensity within the previous 6 months. History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, New York Heart Association Functional Class IIIV heart failure, or transient ischemic attach within 6 months of screening. History or evidence of diabetic complications with significant end organ damage, such as Proliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema; Diabetic neuropathy complicated by neuropathic ulcers; Screening seated systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg after at least a 5 minute seated rest. If the blood pressure exceeds this limit, the blood pressure may be repeated 2 more times following approximately 2 minutes of rest between measurements and the median of the 3 values should be used to determine subject eligibility; Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; or male subjects capable of conceiving children who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product.</criteria>
