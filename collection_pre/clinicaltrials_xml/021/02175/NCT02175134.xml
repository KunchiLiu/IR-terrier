	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) is still challenging, and largely dependent on invasive procedures such as laparoscopy. A recently developed RD-1 gene-based assay for diagnosing TBP shows has given promising results. The investigators thus created a 2-step algorithm using the Blood/Ascites ELISPOT assays and adenosine deaminase (ADA) in ascites for differentiation of TBP from other diagnoses (Blood ELISPOT ≥6 spots or ADA ≥ 21 U/L' as a rule-out test and 'Ascites/Blood ratio ≥3' as a rule-in test). This study is the randomized controlled trial on whether this 2-step algorithm-based approach can reduce the laparoscopic biopsy for the diagnosis of TBP in patients with suspected TBP.</brief_summary>
