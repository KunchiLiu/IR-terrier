	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to pilot-phase test the effectiveness of the microclinic social induction model and its effects on behavioral and metabolic outcomes in different levels of social and familial relationships in Qatar. The investigators novel microclinic model is based on the principle that both healthy and unhealthy behaviors spread through preexisting social networks. A microclinic is a small group of approximately 2-8 friends or family members who are taught to modify their own behaviors as well as the behaviors of those around them, with a particular focus on the four "M's": Meals, Movement, Monitoring, and Medication. More than social support groups or peer-to-peer interventions, the microclinic model is unique in its focus on the long-term propagation of healthy behaviors throughout a participant's entire social network. Qatar is uniquely positioned (with its central geographic location in the Gulf region and its leadership in science and education) to spearhead a regional intervention focused on managing and preventing diabetes in the Gulf region.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microclinic Social Induction Pilot Intervention for Diabetes and Obesity Management in Qatar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study, "Microclinic Social Induction Intervention for Diabetes and Obesity Management in Qatar," is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of a 7-week condensed intervention to evaluate the efficacy of the microclinic social induction model on propagating lifestyle changes and in improving glycemic and metabolic control in Doha, Qatar. The microclinic social induction model leverages different levels of social and familial relationships to positively influence behaviors relating to diabetes and other metabolic conditions through small treatment units called 'microclinic groups,' consisting of 2-8 peers and family members of the same social network. The intervention model brings microclinic groups to a larger classroom network (~25 people/class) where each class shares access to a culturally salient diabetes educational curriculum and group support to promote health behavior changes such as improvement in diet, exercise, medication adherence, and blood pressure management to then influence better glycemic and metabolic control.</detailed_description>
