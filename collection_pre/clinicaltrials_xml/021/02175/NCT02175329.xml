	<brief_summary>60 bridge frameworks are CAD/CAM manufactured from zirconia-ceramic; 30 bridges are veneered with CAD/CAM fabricated lithium disilicate ceramic, 30 bridges are manually layered. The goal is to compare clinical survival , biological or technical behaviour of the restorations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation on Zirconia-ceramic Three-unit Bridges With CAD-on Veneering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized prospective controlled clinical study with three-unit posterior bridges made of zirconia-ceramic to compare veneering with manually layering or CAD/CAM fabricated lithium disilicate ceramic veneers. The hypothesis is that there is no difference in clinical survival of the restorations and no difference in biological or technical behaviour.</detailed_description>
