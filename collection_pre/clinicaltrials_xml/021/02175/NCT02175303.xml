	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety and efficacy using decidual stromal cell therapy for toxicity and inflammation, with special focus on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation patients. The hypothesis to be tested is that the cells are safe to infuse and that they have an anti-inflammatory and healing effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Using Placenta Derived Decidual Stromal Cells for Toxicity and Inflammation With Special Focus to the Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with toxicity, inflammation or hemorrhages will receive decidual stromal cells at approximately 1x10^6 cells/kg at one or more occasions at weekly intervals dependent on clinical response.</detailed_description>
