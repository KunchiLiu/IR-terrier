	<detailed_description>- Extended in vivo half-life of HL2351 is also anticipated to provide improved therapeutic efficacy based on sustained maintenance of an effective concentration. - A safety concern may be addressed by utilizing IL-1Ra that is being used after getting approval by the EMA and the US FDA and known to be relatively safe, and the Fc fusion technology that has been already applied to various therapeutic agents.</detailed_description>
