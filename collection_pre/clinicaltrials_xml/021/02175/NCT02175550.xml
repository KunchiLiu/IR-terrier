	<brief_summary>A new Nobel Biocare implant, NobelReplace Conical Connection (NR CC) has been developed. The implant is a two piece design to allow both one- and two- stage surgical procedures. The entire implant surface has a porous titanium oxide of approximately 10µm thick (TiUnite) to promote and maintain primary stability, which later on leads to secondary stability. NR CC implants are used as the foundation for anchoring tooth replacements in either jaw. Restorations range from replacing one single tooth to an entire arch of bridgework. The implants are also intended as retentive elements for overdenture applications. The present study is designed to evaluate, after the insertion of the NR CC, the marginal bone levels and bone remodelling at the implant sites over various time points up to 5 years. Parameters as soft tissue index, pink aesthetic score (PES) and bleeding on probing (BoP) are as well evaluated together with implant success and survival rate. Using the OHIP-14 questionnaire patients satisfaction is assessed. The results of this clinical investigation will demonstrate clinical safety and reliability of the NR CC using different treatment options.</brief_summary>
