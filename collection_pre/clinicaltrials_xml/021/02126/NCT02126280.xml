	<brief_summary>The study of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression profiles in human monocytes to identify new effective biomarkers that have the best diagnostic potential in asymptomatic atherosclerosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monocyte Activation in Preclinical Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is the first step in creating a method for assessing an individual activity of macrophages. The problems addressed in the project are socially significant because of the high incidence of life-threatening diseases and their effects in the population. The method of evaluation of monocyte-macrophages activity in human blood will be based on the analysis of expression of cytokines and chemokines - markers of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity of macrophages. The most informative panel of cytokines and chemokines obtained during the project can be further used to create effective diagnostic tests.</detailed_description>
