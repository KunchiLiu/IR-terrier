	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, non-randomized, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study to evaluate the mass balance, metabolite profiles, and rates and routes of elimination of [14C]-AZD3293 and derived metabolites following administration as a single 100-mg (containing approximately 150 µCi) oral dose (as an oral solution)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I, Open-Label, Single-Center Study to Assess the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of [14C]-AZD3293</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label, non-randomized,absorption, metabolism, and excretion study to evaluate the mass balance, metabolite profiles, and rates and routes of elimination of [14C]-AZD3293 and derived metabolites following administration as a single 100-mg (containing approximately 150 µCi) oral dose (as an oral solution) following at least an 8-hour fast from food (not including water). Seven healthy male subjects will be enrolled in the study at a single study site to complete a minimum of 6 subjects. The study will consist of 2 visits.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy male subjects between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture; 2) Body weight between 50 to 100 kg, inclusive; 3) Within BMI range 19 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive; 4) In good health, as determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history, physical examination with neurological examination, 12lead ECG, and vital signs as judged by the Investigator; Participation in any prior study of AZD3293 or previous enrollment in the present study; 2) Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic, dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, GI, neurological, or psychiatric disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study; 3) History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator;</criteria>
