	<brief_summary>Striae distensae is a common skin condition that rarely causes significant medical problems. However, it often results in a considerable amount of distress to those with the condition. Various modalities of treatments have been used for striae distensae but few have led to satisfactory results. More recently, newer techniques such as pulsed dye laser and radiofrequency devices have been used with modest results. There is still, however, paucity of data using light therapy for the treatment of this condition. Blue light therapy using the Multiclear device has been used successfully in the treatment of acne. In contrast, there is little data to suggest its use in the management of striae distensae. We aim to study the effects of blue light on the treatment of striae distensae and whether this can be used safely to manage this condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiclear Treatment for Striae Distensae - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive twice weekly blue light treatment with the Multiclear device. The first treatment dose will be 75mJ/cm2 ( Minimum Effective Dose;MED) for all patients. If no erythema develops, the subsequent treatment dose can be increased by 0.5 MED. If mild to moderate erythema develops, the same dose (i.e. 1 MED) will be used.If severe erythema/ blisters develop, treatment will be stopped and the patient wil be invited one week later and treatment will be offered at 50% of the last dose. During the first consultation, patients will be assessed for the presence of striae distensae (SD). Duration and previous treatments of SD will be recorded. The width of the widest striae and the length of the longest straie will be measured at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. Photographs will be taken at baseline and post treatment. These will be evaluated by dermatologists who will be blinded (i.e. details of which photographs are pre or post treatment will not be given). Subjective scores will be used (Very good to excellent; &gt;75%, Good; 51-75%, Moderate; 26-50%, Minimal to no improvement; &lt;25%) Participants will also be given a feedback form to rate any improvements noted and any side effects experienced.</detailed_description>
