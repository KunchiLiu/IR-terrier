	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of auranofin and sirolimus when given together in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunosuppressive therapy, such as auranofin and sirolimus, may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. Sirolimus may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving auranofin and sirolimus may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auranofin and Sirolimus in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of auranofin plus sirolimus (Cohort I). II. To determine the confirmed response rate of auranofin plus sirolimus (Cohort II). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the adverse event and toxicity profiles associated with this treatment combination. II. To evaluate response, time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this treatment combination. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate tumor biomarkers of protein kinase C (PKC) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activity as predictors of clinical outcome (i.e. response, PFS, OS) for patients receiving auranofin/sirolimus therapy. II. To evaluate the use of surrogate biomarkers of PKC and mTOR inhibition in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) as predictors of clinical outcome (i.e. response, PFS, OS) for patients receiving auranofin/sirolimus therapy. OUTLINE: This is a cohort I, dose-escalation study followed by a cohort II study. Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) once daily (QD) and sirolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

note: during the active monitoring phase of a study (i.e., active treatment and observation), participants must be willing to return to the consenting institution for followup Life expectancy &gt;= 84 days (3 months) Willing to provide tissue and blood samples for correlative research purposes; note: the goals of this study include assessment of the biologic effects on surrogate markers of the agent(s) being tested and are, therefore, contingent upon availability of the biologic specimens Negative serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only Known standard therapy for the patient's disease that is potentially curative or definitely capable of extending life expectancy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Any of the following prior therapies: Chemotherapy =&lt;

5 years prior to registration; EXCEPTIONS: nonmelanotic skin cancer or carcinomainsitu of the cervix; NOTE: if there is a history or prior malignancy, patient must not be receiving other cytotoxic or molecularly targeted therapeutics treatment for their cancer; patients receiving certain hormonal manipulations as part of their treatment may be allowed to continue at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) (e.g. luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone [LHRH] analogs for prostate cancer); concurrent endocrine therapy for breast cancer will not be permitted History of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias =&lt;
