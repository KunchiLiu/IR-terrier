	<brief_summary>CD36, a protein that facilitates tissue uptake of fat, as a common link between blood fat concentrations and metabolic disease states such as diabetes mellitus. Genetic variants in the CD36 gene are more common in African Americans compared to Whites and it may confer protection against metabolic diseases by altering the amount of fat in the blood. The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of fat in the blood and to assess endothelial dysfunction among carriers versus non-carriers of the coding SNP, rs3211938 of the CD36 gene after a high fat meal challenge</brief_summary>
