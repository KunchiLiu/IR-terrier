	<brief_title>Evaluation of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (DTMS) With the H-ADD Coil as an Aid to Smoking Cessation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi center, randomized, double blind study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device as an aid to smoking cessation. Treatment will be administered over a 6 week period and follow-up assessments will be conducted at 4 months. The clinical study design includes multiple measurements of safety and effectiveness parameters. The design is meant to demonstrate that the device shows superiority compared to sham treatment over six treatment weeks, at the 4 months follow up.</detailed_description>
