	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial (RCT) pilot study as two main objectives: - determine the overall feasibility of a behavioral intervention for managing fatigue among older adults with HIV infection. - to estimate effect sizes for group differences at 1, 2, and 3 months on five dimensions of fatigue. The investigators hypothesize that adherence, satisfaction, and attrition will be similar for the active intervention group and the attention control group. The investigators also hypothesize that all five dimensions will improve in the intervention group compared to controls over time, and that Cohen's d (Standard Deviation units) will be greater than 0.5 SD units for all five fatigue dimensions at all three post-intervention time points.</brief_summary>
