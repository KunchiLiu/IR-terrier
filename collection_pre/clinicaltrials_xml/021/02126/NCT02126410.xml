	<brief_summary>1. BACKGROUNDS: Currently, elderly people comprise more than 10% of the total Taiwanese population. However, within the context of self-reported sleep duration and health risks, research into the association between sleep duration and body composition changes in older people is limited. It is important to gain an understanding of such an association of older people to estimate the public health burden. 2. OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between self-reported sleep duration and sarcopenia as well as obesity in community-dwelling older adults. 3. HYPOTHESIS: Self-reported sleep duration is associated with prevalence of sarcopenia and obesity in community-dwelling older adults. 4. DESIGN: A cross-sectional investigation. 5. SETTING: Communities in Zhongzheng district, Taipei. 6. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and forty-eight community-dwelling adults (224 men and 264 women) aged 65 years and older. 7. MEASUREMENTS: The investigators evaluated self-reported sleep duration by deriving from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and 7-d recall physical activity diary. Skeletal muscle mass was estimated by the predicted equation from a bioelectrical impedance analysis measurement. The Groningen Activity Restriction Scale and the Chinese Geriatric Depression Screening Scale were used to evaluate physical disability and depression, respectively.</brief_summary>
