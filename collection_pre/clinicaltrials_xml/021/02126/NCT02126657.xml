	<brief_summary>Our study involves the evaluation of a high potency chemical peel in its efficacy and safety profile for the treatment of acne scars. This chemical peel regime is a high potency peel of 70% glycolic acid combined with vitamin C that is purported to provide a good balance between yielding results and patient safety. We aim to evaluate its efficacy and safety profile of a single application. The study design is based on a single group that compares pre- vs post-intervention. 10 patients with atrophic acne scars of skin type I-IV will be recruited. Potential benefits include improvement of post acne scars with a short downtime and risks include post peel hyper pigmentation and scarring. We believe that this treatment will be highly beneficial to patients with post acne scarring. This chemical peel regime has good efficacy and safety profile for the treatment of acne scars.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary endpoints: 1. ECCA (échelle d'évaluation clinique des cicatrices d'acné) grading scale for quantitative grading of acne scars. Two blinded evaluators compare and rate the photograph using ECCA score. 2. Patient Assessment Based on 1 to 10 point scale; 1- nil acne scars and 10- severe acne scar Secondary endpoints: 1. Postacne hyperpigmentation index (PAHPI) -Each of these 3 variables --size, intensity, and number of lesions is weighted and the summation of the weighted variables gives the total PAHPI score, ranging 6 to 22. 2. Safety Assessment (This is an ordinal scale) i. Score of redness ii. Score of swelling iii. Score of oozing/crusting iv. Post peel hyperpigmentation v. Post peel scarring vi. Assessment based on patient and doctor global assessment (global assessment from 1 - 10)</detailed_description>
