	<brief_summary>Our study involves the evaluation of a high potency peel in its efficacy for skin rejuvenation in the treatment of photoaging. This chemical peel regime is a high potency peel 70% glycolic acid combined with vitamin C that is purported to provide a good balance between yielding results and patient safety. AIM We aim to qualitatively evaluate its efficacy and safety profile. Our hypothesis is that a single peel of 70% glycolic acid combined with vitamin C will result in improvement of the features of photoaging with few side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of a Single 70% Glycolic Acid Peel With Vitamin C for the Treatment of Photoaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Assessment of photoaging to compare using photography A and E - for static analysis. For each element from ii to xi, a rating of nil (0), mild (l), moderate (2), and severe (3) for each category was made by the same evaluating physician. i. Physician VAS scale - assessment of wrinkles prepeel, post peel (Score 1 -10). ii.Fine peri-orbital wrinkles (less than 1 mm in width or depth) (FPW); iii.Course peri-orbital wrinkles (greater than 1 mm in width and depth) (CPW); iv.Upper lip wrinkles (ULW); v.Lower lip wrinkles (LLW); vi.Melasma defined as blotchy, brown, epidermal macules with indistinct margins; vii.Solar lentigines defined as dark brown macules with distinct margins measuring from 3 to 10 mm; viii.Solar keratoses defined as diffuse erythema with keratotic adherent scaling; ix.Guttate hypomelanosis defined as localized macules of absent melanin measuring from 3 to 10 mm in diameter; x.Poikiloderma defined as a symmetrical reddish-brown pigmentation of the neck, typically sparing the sub-mental area; The totaling of the scores of the above parameters will form a prepeel score. This will be compared against the patient's score post peel - we expect to find an improvement. 2. Safety profile assessment - redness, swelling, oozing, hyperpigmentation, scarring - each of the 5 parameters will be scored from 0 -3, none, mild, moderate, severe - this will serve as a safety assessment.</detailed_description>
