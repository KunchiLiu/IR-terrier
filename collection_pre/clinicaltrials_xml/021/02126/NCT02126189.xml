	<brief_summary>This study is designed to refine the aetiological causes of cancers of the head and neck and investigate the ways in which human papillomavirus and life-style factors cause head and neck cancers. This study will determine if these factors affect the treatment of cancer. All patients attending the Head and Neck Clinic at the Princess Alexandra Hospital is invited to complete a risk factor questionnaire and give consent for their clinical data and tissue samples to be available for future research activities. The risk factor questionnaire is based on existing validated instruments developed by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Cancer Control Group, and will collect standardised information relating to demographics and causal factors (tobacco and alcohol intake), risk modifiers (dentition, asprin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), height, weight, physical activity, diet quality etc) and behaviours (oral sex etc)</brief_summary>
