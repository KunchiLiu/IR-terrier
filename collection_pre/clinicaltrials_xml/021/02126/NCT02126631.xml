	<brief_summary>This study is intended to compare the new Carnation Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System, a patch monitoring system, with the Holter monitoring system. Holters represent the current standard for continuous recording of the ECG over extended periods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sternal ECG Patch Comparison Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to simplify the system of recording ECGs. Carnation Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System is a small patch system that can be worn during most activities include showering. Each patient will be his or her own control, and will wear the CAM and Holter systems simultaneously for 24 hours. Both systems will then be sent out for analysis.</detailed_description>
