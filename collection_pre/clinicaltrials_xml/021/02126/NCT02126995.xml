	<brief_summary>This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of MG01CI (low dose and high dose once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a 1:1 ratio of 60 adolescent and adult subjects with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Following Screening, subjects will be randomized to MG01CI or matching placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and the 6 week Double-blind Treatment Period will begin on Day 1. The first 4 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-optimization period, All subjects will start with two daily tablets: low dose metadoxine or matching blinded placebo. At weekly visits/phone assessments, the investigator will evaluate the dose based upon the investigator's assessment of safety and tolerability. If the subject demonstrates safety or tolerability concerns with the low dose after 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, then the subject will be discontinued. If there are no concerns about safety and tolerability after 2 weeks of treatment, then the dose will be increased to high dose or placebo. If at the high dose there are concerns about safety and tolerability, then the dose will be either kept the same or reduced to low dose for the remainder of the treatment period. There will be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early termination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 6-week, Study of MG01CI Low Dose and High Dose Compared With Placebo in Adults and Adolescents With Fragile X Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of MG01CI (low and high doses of metadoxine once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a 1:1 ratio of 60 adolescent and adult subjects with FXS. Following Screening, subjects will be randomized to MG01CI or matching placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and the 6 week Double-blind Treatment Period will begin on Day 1. The first 4 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-optimization period, during which the subject's dose of MG01CI or placebo will be optimized. Investigators and subjects will be blinded with regard to whether the subject is taking active drug or placebo. Subjects will be blinded to anticipated dose (low vs high dose), while Investigators will not be blinded to anticipated dose, low dose vs high dose. Every two weeks subjects will receive 2-week supply treatment. A phone follow-up assessment of safety and tolerability will occur during titration after 1 and 3 weeks of treatment; if the investigator has any significant concerns regarding safety and tolerability, the subject will be assessed at the site at an unscheduled visit. All subjects will be assessed at the site after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment. All subjects will start with either low dose or matching blinded placebo (2 tablets daily). At weekly visits/phone assessments, the investigator will evaluate the dose based upon the investigator's assessment of safety and tolerability. If the subject demonstrates safety or tolerability concerns with the low dose after 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, then the subject will be discontinued. If there are no concerns about safety and tolerability after 2 weeks of treatment, then the dose will be increased to 2 tablets of either high dose of active treatment or placebo. If at high dose there are concerns about safety and tolerability, then the dose will be either kept the same or reduced to low dose for the remainder of the treatment period. The last 2 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-maintenance period. During the dose-maintenance period, the subject will maintain his or her optimal dose as determined at the end of the dose-optimization period. A phone follow-up assessment of safety and tolerability will occur after 5 weeks of treatment (after 1 week of dose maintenance). If the investigator has any significant concerns regarding safety and tolerability, the subject will be assessed at the site at an unscheduled visit. The subject will be assessed at the site after 6 weeks of treatment (after 2 weeks of dose maintenance). There will be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early termination.</detailed_description>

Subject has Fragile X Syndrome with a molecular genetic confirmation of the full Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) mutation (≥200 CGG repetitions). 3. Subject has a score of 12 or greater on the inattentive subscale of the ADHD RS IV (as rated by the investigator in a clinical interview of the parent/legal authorized guardian/consistent caregiver). 4. Current treatment with no more than 3 prescribed psychotropic medications. Anti epileptic medications are permitted and are not counted as psychotropic medications if they are used for treatment of seizures. Antiepileptics for other indications, such as the treatment of mood disorders, count towards the limit of permitted medications. 1. Permitted concomitant psychotropic medications (except antiepileptic medications and stimulants; see 4b and 4d) must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between Screening and the commencement of study medication. 2. Antiepileptic medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between Screening and the commencement of study medication. 3. Subjects with a history of seizure disorder who are currently receiving treatment with antiepileptics must have been seizurefree for 3 months preceding Screening, or must be seizurefree for 3 years if not currently receiving antiepileptics. 4. Stimulant medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between Screening and the end of the treatment period (Week 6/early termination), unless the subject is washing out; see Exclusion Criterion 4. 5. Behavioral treatments (excluding psychotherapy; see exclusion criteria) must be stable for 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between Screening and the commencement of study medication. 6. Subject has a parent, legal authorized guardian or consistent caregiver who interacts with the subject for at least 10 hours per week and is able to provide weekly rating forms of the subject's behavior. 7.

While stimulants will not be excluded from the trial, the subject and the parent/legal authorized guardian may decide to stop stimulant medication prior to the study upon discussion with the investigator at the Screening visit. If stimulant medication is stopped at screening, a twoweek washout is required. A subject that decides to washout from stimulants will be excluded from the trial if a stimulant is administered after the Screening visit or during the course of the trial. 5. Subject is planning to commence psychotherapy or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) during the period of the study or had begun psychotherapy or CBT within 6 weeks prior to Screening. 1. A subject who started psychotherapy or CBT for the first time within 6 weeks prior to Screening is excluded. 2.
