	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease in reproductive women. It is characterized by anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Most patients with PCOS have metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and glucose abnormalities. Almost 60-80ï¹ªPCOS patients are obesity which exacerbates IR and hyperandrogenism. Obese PCOS patients tend to be overeating suggests that impaired appetite regulation might be contribute to the pathophysiology of PCOS. Our study is trying to observe difference of incretin between PCOS and normal control to figure out whether change of incretin is involved in the pathophysiology of PCOS.</brief_summary>
