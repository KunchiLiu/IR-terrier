	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess neck and low back pain using Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) in order to develop an algorithm to aid primary care providers (PCPs) in the diagnosis of neck/back pain. Secondary goals include the refinement of EIM technology and associated software of ease-of-use and interpretation by PCPs and staff.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Radiculopathy Subjects: Age 2180 years old History consistent with radiculopathy based on clinical, radiologic, and standard electrophysiological criteria, as determined by spine expert (Dr. John Keel) Age under 21 or over 80 History of a generalized neuromuscular condition, except for mild polyneuropathy or common mononeuropathies (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow) History of moderatetosevere ongoing medical conditions producing generalized disability, such as advanced cardiac or renal disease Metal spine implants of any type 2. Musculoskeletal Back Pain Subjects: Age 21 to 80 years old Low back or neck pain without evidence to suggest neuropathic component; i.e., without radiation of pain, sensory loss or weakness Age under 21 or over 80 History of sciatica or cervical radiculopathy History of a generalized neuromuscular condition, except for mild polyneuropathy or common mononeuropathies (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow) History of moderatetosevere ongoing medical conditions producing generalized disability, such as advanced cardiac or renal disease Metal spine implants of any type 3. Undiagnosed Lower Back or Neck Pain Subjects: Age 21 to 80 years old Major complaint of lower back or neck pain Age under 21 or over 80 Recent (&lt;6 month) history of similar symptoms that has been evaluated History of a generalized neuromuscular condition, except for mild polyneuropathy or common mononeuropathies (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow) History of moderatetosevere ongoing medical conditions producing generalized disability, such as advanced cardiac or renal disease Metal spine implants of any type</criteria>
