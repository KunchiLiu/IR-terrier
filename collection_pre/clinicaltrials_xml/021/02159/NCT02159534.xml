	<brief_summary>Background : Brain vulnerability is particularly marked in preterm neonates and has long-term consequences. Unlike lesions affecting other organs, those that affect the brain can currently not 'be repaired' by producing new cells. However, exeprience-driven brain plasticity allows the brain to reorganise its connections to compensate (at least partially) the effects of an injury. Purpose : To evaluate the influence of NOBEPPI sensorimotor stimulation on cognitive, motor and language development at 18 months of corrected age in children born &lt;32 weeks' gestation or with birth weight &lt;1500 g.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm and very low birth weight infants are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, including cerebral palsy, sensory impairment and intellectual disability. Several early intervention approaches have been designed in the hope of optimising neurological development in this context. These programmes show high variety in the type of intervention, frequency of sessions and total duration of the intervention, as well as the duration of follow-up. Depending on studies, there is an inconstant benefit on cognitive and behavioural development in the first 2 years and preschool age. According to the most recent studies, it seems important that the intervention takes into account parental mental health, focuses on parent-child interactions and lasts sufficiently long. This prospective randomized-controlled clinical study has been designed to evaluate the effects of an additional parent-administed programme to the usual care in this developmental risk population,. The intervention is carried out at home by parents coached by physiotherapist from term-age to 6 months of corrected age. The monitoring and evaluation period for all infants participating in the study ends at 18 months of corrected age and includes clinical, neurodevelopmental, parental stress and neurophysiological assessments.</detailed_description>
