	<brief_title>Sepsis Trial of Early Physical Therapy Outside the ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who are admitted to the hospitalist service at the University of Michigan Hospital will be screened for the presence of severe sepsis. Those who are deemed eligible and provide consent will be enrolled. Study patients will receive additional physical therapy according to a protocol developed for this study in addition to the usual care recommended by their regular treating physician. Additional treatments will be individualized based on enrolled patients' baseline physical function and progress and may include standing, stretching, transferring, and walking - either with assistance or independently. Treating therapists have been trained in the use of the protocol and individualization to maintain the highest standard of patient safety. Patients will be contacted 30 days after discharge to answer questions about their health and ability to perform routine tasks at home.</detailed_description>
