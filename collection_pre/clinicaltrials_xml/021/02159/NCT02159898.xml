	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single blinded, randomized study of EndoMAXX EVT Fully Covered Esophageal Stent with Valve for the treatment of malignant strictures of the lower esophagus. The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement of dysphagia due to esophageal stricture with EndoMAXX EVT Fully Covered Esophageal Stent with Valve (investigational device) compared to the EndoMAXX Fully Covered Esophageal Stent (reference device).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient is 18 years of age or older 2. Patient (or legal representative) is able to understand and provide signed informed consent 3. Patient has a malignant stricture of the distal esophagus or gastric cardia requiring stent placement across the gastroesophageal junction. 1.

Patient has previously undergone esophageal stenting or esophagectomy 5. Female patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or premenopausal and not using an effective method of contraception 6. Patient's esophageal tumor length exceeds that which can be treated with a single stent (maximum lesion length 9.5cm) 7. Removal of stent is scheduled to occur within six months 8. Patient has trouble swallowing or experiences regurgitation for reasons which are not related to his/her esophageal cancer 9. Any other factor identified by the Investigator that would disqualify the prospective patient from participation in the study including but not limited to coagulative disorders and anesthetic risk.</criteria>
