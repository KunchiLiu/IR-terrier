	<brief_summary>Since 1963 Hereditary AngioEdema (HAE) is considered an autosomal dominant disorder (Donaldson and Evans), characterized by a quantitative and/or qualitative deficit of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), which affects approximately 1:50.000 individuals in the general population. From this period the link between HAE and psychiatry was interrupted, however genetic issues could not comprehensively explain the clinical evolution of the disease. Clinical studies show an evident gap between genotype and phenotype of HAE. For this still controversial question, we have designed this cross-sectional study in order to establish the relationship between HAE clinical manifestations and neurobiological/psychopatological parameters.</brief_summary>
