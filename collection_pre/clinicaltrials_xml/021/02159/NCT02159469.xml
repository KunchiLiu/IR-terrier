	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Testosterone Replacement Efficacy and Safety in Adult Men Diagnosed With Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate if testosterone enanthate administered subcutaneously once each week by an auto injector to men with low testosterone can raise their levels into the normal range. The study will investigate the ability to adjust testosterone enanthate dose levels using single point blood concentrations. Safety and tolerability of testosterone administration will be evaluated along with the patient's ability to use the auto injector and follow the instructions for auto injector use. Patient satisfaction with sexual functioning will also be assessed during this 52 week study.</detailed_description>
