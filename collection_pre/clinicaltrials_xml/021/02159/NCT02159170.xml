	<brief_summary>Intraepidermal injection of nerve growth factor results in a non-inflammatory hyperalgesia for thermal and mechanical stimuli. This hyperalgesia is similar to the pathological ailments of patients with neuropathic pain. The mechanisms of the cognitive modulation of pain and hyperalgesia are not yet understood in this group of patients. The investigators plan to use NGF injection as a model of non-inflammatory neuropathic pain in healthy subjects to investigate the underlying neuronal mechanisms of this hyperalgesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging and resting state network analysis.</brief_summary>
