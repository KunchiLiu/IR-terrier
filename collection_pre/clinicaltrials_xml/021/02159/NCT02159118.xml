	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare use of a powered bone marrow aspiration and biopsy device (OnControl) to use of a standard manual bone marrow aspiration and biopsy device to obtain bone marrow biopsy specimens in children. The hypothesis is that use of the powered device will improve the quantity and quality of bone marrow biopsy specimens when compared to the manual device.</brief_summary>
