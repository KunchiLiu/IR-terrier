	<brief_summary>Sepsis is a common inflammatory response to infection characterized by hypovolemia and vasodilation for which early administration of intravenous fluids has been suggested to improve outcomes. The ideal fluid balance following initial resuscitation is unclear. Septic patients treated in the intensive care unit commonly receive significant volumes of intravenous fluids with resultant positive fluid balance for up to a week after their initial resuscitation. Observational studies have associated fluid receipt and positive fluid balance in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with increased mortality but are inherently limited by indication bias. In order to determine the optimal approach to fluid management following resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, a randomized controlled trial is needed. The primary hypothesis of this study is that, compared to usual care, a conservative approach to fluid management after resuscitation in patients with sepsis and cardiopulmonary dysfunction will increase intensive care unit free days.</brief_summary>
