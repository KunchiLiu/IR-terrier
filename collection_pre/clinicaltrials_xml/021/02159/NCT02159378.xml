	<brief_summary>The prevalence of gestational diabetes is estimated at between 2 and 6%, but can be much higher in specific populations. The specific treatment of gestational diabetes (diet, control weight gain, self monitoring glucose , insulin therapy) reduces complications severe perinatal, fetal macrosomia, and preeclampsia compared with abstention therapy, without additional risk of caesarean section. Several early studies have shown that the determination of fructosamine is a very bad way of diagnosis for Gestational Diabetes. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the determination of serum fructosamine and put under insulin in case of Gestational Diabetes. The purpose of this study is to determine if serum fructosamines rate can be a predictive marker of the starting insulin at the patients suffering from Gestational Diabetes</brief_summary>
