	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to compare the overall response rate (inclusive of complete response, partial response and hematologic improvement) per IWG 2006 criteria in patients with higher risk MDS treated with azacitidine with or without deferasirox achieved over the course of one year. Hematologic improvement must be maintained for at least 8 weeks.</brief_summary>

History of HIV positive test result (ELISA or Western blot) Presence of a surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drug Patients with an active malignancy (currently or within the past two years) with the exception of basal cell skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ or completely resected colonic polyps carcinoma in situ. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to enrollment. History of noncompliance to medical regimens or patients who are considered potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to azacitidine, mannitol, or deferasirox. Calculated creatinine clearance &lt;40mL/min Serum creatinine greater than 1.5x ULN at screening Urine protein/creatinine ratio&gt; 1 AST or ALT greater than 3x ULN at screening Direct Bilirubin greater than 1.5x ULN at screening. Patients who received treatment with systemic investigational drug within the past 4 weeks or topical investigational drug within the past 7 days or are planning to receive other investigational drugs while participating in the study Patients participating in another therapeutic clinical trial Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 3 months after stopping AZA and should not father a child in this period.</criteria>
