	<brief_summary>Some medications are known to cause kidney damage because the person is allergic to the medication while others cause direct damage to the kidney because they are toxic at certain concentrations. Risk factors for developing kidney damage have been identified for some medications but not for all. Patients who are exposed to these important medications and develop problems with their kidneys may have some genetic risk. The purpose of this study is to determine the genetic risk factors for drug induced kidney injury. A better understanding of the role of genetics for the development of kidney injury from medications will allow us to better select medications, improve effectiveness of treatment and minimize harm.</brief_summary>
