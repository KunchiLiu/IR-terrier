	<brief_title>Posture and Mobility Measurements of the Upper Quadrant in Asymptomatic Subjects by Means of a Smartphone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One purpose of this study is to measure the magnitude of the thoracic kyphosis, thoracic spine extension, and side-to-side differences in scapular protraction and elbow extension range of motion during the median nerve neurodynamic test through a smartphone (iPhone 4, app Compass, iOS 7.1.1), and to assess the intrarater agreement parameters. Another purpose is to assess associations between thoracic kyphosis, thoracic spine extension, scapular protraction and the resting length of the pectoralis minor muscle through smartphone, photographs and tape measurements.</detailed_description>
