	<brief_summary>This study will compare the functional performance of voluntary opening (VO) and voluntary closing (VC) body powered prostheses. We hypothesize that the ability to sense cable tension and produce progressively higher pinch from shoulder force will result in advantages for the VC terminal device (TRS, Grip 3) in terms of proprioception and overall function. The specific aims of this clinical trial are to: 1. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in reduced compensatory motion during activity. 2. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved function in activities of daily living.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the performance of the prehensors, subjects will complete a randomized A-B crossover study with a subjective follow-up. Two subject categories will be evaluated: 1.) healthy non-amputees, and 2.) unilateral transradial amputee subjects who currently use, or are interested in using a body-powered prosthesis. We anticipate data collection data with 10 non-amputee subject, and 8 amputee subjects.</detailed_description>
