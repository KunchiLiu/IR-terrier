	<brief_summary>In order to assess circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, we will conduct a 10-year follow-up study comparing 32 exposed (women with a history of pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia) and 32 unexposed (women with a history of uncomplicated pregnancy). Participants will be recruited from a well-characterised cohort, previously assembled during their pregnancies, at the Department of Obstetrics at Randers Regional Hospital in 2001-2004. Blood and urine samples, collected during their pregnancies, are stored in a biobank, thus rendering the possibility of longitudinal assessment.</brief_summary>
