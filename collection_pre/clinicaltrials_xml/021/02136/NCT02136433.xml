	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of training using novel tablet applications for hand function, compared to traditional hand exercises. In addition, we aim to examine brain plasticity following treatment with the new tablet applications. We hypothesize that training with a tablet would prove to be more effective than traditional exercises. We expect to observe neuroplastic changes in the brain in patients who practiced finger movements using the tablet.</brief_summary>
