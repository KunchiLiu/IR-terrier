	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to examine the implementation and effectiveness of an intervention, delivered in a health care setting, to decrease home firearm access by youth. The investigators hypothesize that: 1. parents who receive means restriction education provided by their primary care provider will be more likely to report, at the one month and one year follow-up, that they are storing their guns locked compared to parents who do not receive means restriction counseling. 2. parents who receive a free gun locking device(s) will be more likely to report, at the one month and one year follow-up, that they are storing their guns locked compared to parents who receive means restriction counseling alone; 3. parents whose adolescents are assessed at high risk for violence (&gt; 5 on the Violence Injury Protection and Risk Screen (VIPRS)) or depression (&gt;9 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)) will be more likely to report storing their gun(s) locked at the one month follow-up compared to parents whose children are assessed as low risk, regardless of whether they receive the counseling alone or counseling plus free locking devices and 4) youth whose parents receive a free gun locking device(s) will be more likely to report less access to guns, at one year follow-up, compared to parents who receive means restriction counseling alone.</brief_summary>
