	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer patients group, to evaluate the relation of HER2 overexpression with prognosis, and to analyze the proportion of herceptin applied to patients in clinical field. Furthermore, the investigators are going to reevaluate the clinical benefit of Herceptin for survival prolongation compared to chemotherapy only.</brief_summary>
