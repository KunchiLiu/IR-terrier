	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that there will be a low incidence of glenoid loosening with a total shoulder arthroplasty using an anchor peg glenoid and autologous bone grafting. In addition, we suggest that the absence of radiolucent lines will correlate with excellent shoulder function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Shoulder Replacement Outcomes With Autologous Bone Graft as Fixator for Glenoid Anchor Peg.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be five year follow-up of glenoid anchor peg component fixation utilizing autologous bone graft in total shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the use of autologous bone graft around the anchor peg glenoid prosthesis correlates with better shoulder function. Subjects having had this surgery who are five years or more out from surgery will have computed tomography and three plain radiographs to monitor for bony apposition, radiolucent lines and component loosening. These testings are not a study intervention and are for monitoring purposes.</detailed_description>
