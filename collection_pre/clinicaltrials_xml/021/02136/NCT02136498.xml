	<detailed_description>Investigators will develop and pilot test a prototype of the MyMAP intervention.The intervention is designed to help smokers better manage issues known to reduce treatment adherence (withdrawal symptoms, medication side-effects, low motivation, and inadequate behavioral skills for medication adherence) and to facilitate greater communication between patients and providers so clinicians can provide appropriate oversight of medication use, intervene when medically necessary, and address patient concerns that may otherwise lead to non-adherence or early treatment termination.</detailed_description>
