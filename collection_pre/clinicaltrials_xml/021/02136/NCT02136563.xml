	<brief_summary>This is an observational clinical research on patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on hemodialysis and receiving darbepoetin alfa to treat diagnosed renal anemia; the major objective is to explore novel erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) response index in association with deterioration of renal function as well as occurrence of cardiovascular disease events.</brief_summary>
