	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized approach/avoidance training (AAT) procedure in a sample of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD). The training procedure is designed to modify automatic approach responses for positive social stimuli. Previous research has shown that a single administration of approach-positive AAT influences social behavior in the laboratory. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of a four-session AAT procedure on measures of positive social-emotional functioning. The investigators hypothesize that individuals assigned to the approach-positive AAT condition will demonstrate larger increases in positive affect and improvements in social relationship functioning from pre- to post-assessment compared to those assigned to the control condition.</brief_summary>
