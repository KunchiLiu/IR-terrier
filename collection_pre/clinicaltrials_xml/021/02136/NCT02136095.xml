	<brief_summary>Intraoperative fluorescent cholangiography (IFC) with concomitant fluorescent angiography is a recently developed method for non-invasive visualisation of the relevant anatomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The objective of this study was to assess the time required by routine-use of IFC and to evaluate success-rate of the procedures. Methods Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and operated by the same surgeon were consecutively enrolled. A standardized protocol with IFC including concomitant angiography was performed during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intra-operative time-registration and exposure of predefined anatomical structures were recorded.</brief_summary>
