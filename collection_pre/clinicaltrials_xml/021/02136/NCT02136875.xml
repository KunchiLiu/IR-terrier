	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether early treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with a combination therapy, Salmeterol + Fluticasone Propionate (SFP - Advair) will reduce the use of prednisone, known as the conventional treatment. Primary objective: To determine whether early treatment with combination therapy (SFP) can reduce the use of prednisone (the conventional treatment) in the event of an AECOPD. Secondary objectives: - To evaluate the feasibility of this treatment approach and to provide pilot data (needed for a larger multi-centre clinical trial; - To evaluate the feasibility and need of assessment during and after exacerbation onset, health-related quality of life and physical activity; - To evaluate the safety of this approach; this is in terms of the delay in starting prednisone and an unfavourable outcome (ER visits and/or hospitalization).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strategy for Early Treatment of Exacerbations in COPD: Standing Prescriptions of Advair With a Written Action Plan in the Event of an Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are of major importance since they are associated with adverse effects on morbidity, health status, and costs. Conventional treatment includes the use of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids (OCS). However, OCS is associated with significant side effects. This is of considerable importance since exacerbation occurs on average 2 to 4 times per year in COPD patients. Alternative treatment such as high dose inhaled corticosteroids has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of AECOPD. Recently, studies have clearly demonstrated the effect of combination therapy (SFP) on key inflammatory cells and a marked enhance anti-inflammatory effect when compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone. Inhaled corticosteroids have a high level of topical anti-inflammatory activity and a low level of systemic. Additionally, combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists (SFP) appears to produce significant anti-inflammatory effects in COPD airways that are not seen when inhaled or oral steroids are used alone. This could offer a potential for an alternative treatment to oral corticosteroids in AECOPD. RATIONALE None of the inhaled treatments is likely to be adopted and to replace the use of OCS for the treatment of AECOPD unless it is used promptly at the onset of symptom worsening. Early treatment has been shown to have clinical importance in accelerating symptom recovery and reducing hospital admission. Recently, the investigators have demonstrated that the early treatment of AECOPD can be achieved by the implementation of a written action plan as part of a self-management education. The use of action plans helps COPD patients recognize symptom changes, implement self-care and self-initiate a customized prescription (antibiotics &amp; oral steroids) in the event of an exacerbation. Self-management education programs with a written action plan that includes standing prescriptions with combination therapy (SFP) in the event of an exacerbation may be promising in reducing the use of prednisone in AECOPD, the conventional treatment.</detailed_description>
