	<criteria>Adults 3085 years of age. Diagnosis of either POAG or OHT in both eyes. Not receiving medication for IOP, or able to stop such medication for a washout period and the duration of the study without significant risk of adverse consequences related to glaucomatous disease. Elevated IOP (≥ 24 and ≤ 33 mm Hg at 8 AM and ≥ 21 and ≤ 33 mm Hg at 10 AM on Screening Two visit and Baseline visit in one or both eyes off treatment [after a washout phase in those subjects who were receiving ocular hypotensive therapy]). Ophthalmic exclusion criteria: Uncontrolled intraocular hypertension defined as &gt; 33 mm Hg in either eye at either of the screening/baseline visits (after a washout phase in those subjects who were currently receiving ocular hypotensive therapy). Receiving more than one medication for IOP in either eye at time of screening. Abnormal central corneal thickness. BCVA worse than 20/200 (logMAR 1.0) in either eye Significant visual field loss. Acute angleclosure glaucoma or appositional or very narrow anterior chamber angle in either eye.</criteria>
