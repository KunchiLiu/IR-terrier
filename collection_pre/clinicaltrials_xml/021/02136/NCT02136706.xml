	<brief_summary>Encouraged by the recent data published ,the investigators think that a waiting time of 10 minutes is feasible while preserving diagnostic accuracy and would like to assess the feasibility and diagnostic efficacy of W10 compared with W30 imaging in a pilot study. By combining W10 imaging with half-time acquisition, the time of the technetium-99m myocardial perfusion imaging procedure could be shortened by at least 50%, lasting only 40 minutes for W10 (10-minute waiting) imaging compared with 90 minutes for W30 imaging (30-minute waiting). The investigators hypothesize that (1) W10 MPI is clinically feasible and tolerable by the patients, that (2) W10 MPI provides high image quality and that (3) W10 MPI provides diagnostic accuracy comparable to W30 MPI.</brief_summary>
