	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an exercise class with a cognitive (or brain) training component was more effective than a usual combined aerobic and resistance exercise class for older adults with cognitive complaints (such as concerns about changes in memory or thinking skills). It is hypothesized that the group randomized to the exercise class that includes additional brain training will have greater improvements in brain health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body and Brain Exercise for Older Adults With Memory Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints (CCs) may be at increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Cognitive decline in older adults, particularly reduced memory and executive function is associated with functional decline, institutionalization, and increased health care costs. Similarly, cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with cognitive and functional impairment in aging. Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve vascular function and blood flow in the brain's prefrontal cortex. In turn, resistance training can produce functional changes within distinct cortical regions during the encoding and recall of association tasks and has been shown to increase circulating neural growth factors (i.e., a proposed mechanism by which cognition may be preserved or improved in old age). Recent evidence also suggests that cognitive training may improve the cognitive performance of older adults. Therefore, we will investigate the impact of a combined exercise program (multi-modality exercise; M2) compared to a combined exercise program with a cognitive component (multi-modality, mind-motor exercise; M4) on cognition, cognitive-motor, mobility, neural functioning and vascular outcomes in older adults with cognitive complaints. Community-based exercise programs for older adults provide widespread access, are relatively inexpensive, and provide opportunities for social interaction. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the M2 and M4 exercise programs on brain health. This study will also examine the effects of the different exercise programs on cardiovascular risk factors and mobility. In a subset of participants, cognitive-motor and neural functioning outcomes will be examined.</detailed_description>
