	<brief_summary>This is an observational study to assess the health behavior of Physicians from medical practices in Germany. Physicians will be asked by a questionnaire (self-report) on health behavior, self-diagnostics and self-medication in case of sickness. We will send the questionnaire to 1000 General Practitioners and to 300 medical specialists in Germany. We expect a response rate of 25-30 %. After electronically data-entry we will run a descriptive analysis for primary outcome. Results may provide a better understanding of the Physicians health behavior.</brief_summary>
