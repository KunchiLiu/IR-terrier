	<brief_title>Effects of a Polyherbal Supplement on the Signs and Symptoms of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled. The study includes a 19-day treatment period and a minimum 7-day washout period in which no test product is administered. Subjects will then crossover to a second 19-day treatment period to complete the study. Subjects receive test product (polyherbal capsule or placebo capsule) daily during the treatment periods. Two exercise test sessions followed up to 5 days will occur during the study using a modified seated arm-curl bench. Muscle strength is assessed on each day of the 5-day exercise test period. Safety is assessed during the study by collecting adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data (serum hematology and chemistry), and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, temperature).</detailed_description>
