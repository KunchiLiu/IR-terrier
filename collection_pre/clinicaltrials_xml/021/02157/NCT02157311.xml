	<brief_summary>Evaluate after 48 weeks, the capacity of a weekly strategy of 4 consecutive days on treatment followed by 3 days off treatment, in HIV-1 treated patients with undetectable viral load for at least 12 months and continuous antiretroviral regimen unchanged for at least 4 months, to maintain a therapeutic success defined by the absence of virological failure (2 consecutive viral loads &gt; 50 cp/mL) and the absence of interruption of therapeutic strategy (interruption or change of the " 4 days on / 3 days off " strategy for a time longer than 30 consecutive days).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>4 Consecutive Days on Treatment Followed by 3 Days Off Treatment, in HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Open-label, multicentric, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled trial to evaluate at 48 weeks, the capacity of a weekly strategy of 4 consecutive days on treatment followed by 3 days off treatment, in HIV-1 treated patients with undetectable viral load for at least 12 months and continuous antiretroviral regimen unchanged for at least 4 months, to maintain a therapeutic success defined by the absence of virological failure (2 consecutive viral loads &gt; 50 cp/mL) and the absence of interruption of therapeutic strategy (interruption or change of the " 4 days on / 3 days off " strategy for a time longer than 30 consecutive days). Allocation: Non-randomized Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study Primary Purpose: Treatment Enrollment: 100 patients</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• HIV1 documented infection Age 18 years or older HIV1 viral load always ≤ 50 cp/mL for at least 12 months (with a minimum of 3 measures in the last 12 months, including screening) CD4+ lymphocytes count &gt; 250/mm3, for at least 6 months Treatment with a stable regimen for at least 4 months prior to screening, containing 2 nucleoside/nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) combined with, either 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or 1 ritonavirboosted protease inhibitor (PI/r). The list of accepted antiretroviral drugs is limited to : 1. NRTI : tenofovir, emtricitabine, abacavir, lamivudine 2. PI/r : lopinavir/r, darunavir/r or atazanavir/r 3. NNRTI : efavirenz, rilpivirine or etravirine. Exclusive antiretroviral 3 drugtherapy (no 4 drugtherapy) A least one genotypic resistance test available (reverse transcriptase and/or protease amino acid sequence, according to ongoing antiretroviral drugs) ; on each genotypic resistance test(s) available in medical history, susceptibility to every ongoing antiretroviral drugs must be demonstrated Clearance of the creatinine &gt; 60 mL/min (MDRD) ASAT and ALAT &lt; 3 ULN Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl Platelets count &gt; 100 000/mm3 Negative pregnancy test for potential childbearing women and mechanical contraception for sexual intercourses Patient living in France and affiliated to a social security system Written informed consent • HIV2 infection HBV infection (positive HBs antigen) or isolated positive HBc antibody HCV infection requiring specific treatment during the 51 weeks of the trial At least one known resistance to one of ongoing antiretroviral drugs Exclusive antiretroviral 3 drugtherapy (no 4 drugtherapy) No genotypic resistance test available Ongoing either interferon, interleukin treatment, or every immuno / chemotherapy Progressive opportunistic infection, ongoing treatment for opportunistic infection or tuberculosis Patient with irregular followup or with treatment adherence problems Any condition (alcohol, drug abuse…) compromising treatment adherence, treatment safety, and/or study adherence Progressive neurological disorders (meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis…) related to HIV infection or not Medical history of severe neuropsychiatric disorder, with insufficient treatment efficacy Subject under legal guardianship or incapacitation</criteria>
