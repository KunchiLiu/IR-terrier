	<brief_summary>This is a randomised control trial comparing two different prosthetic designs used in total knee arthroplasty. Participants were randomised to receive either of the two prostheses and then were followed up of a period of 7 years, looking at pain, range of motion and impact on quality of life. The literature and joint registry of Australia shows that one of the prosthesis may be inferior to the other. Our research team hypothesised that this was not the case and that previous elicited differences were related to other factors.</brief_summary>
