	<brief_summary>As a tertiary hospital the Traumatology department at the Kantonsspital Aarau looks after about 500 fracture patients hospitalized with an age over 50 years a year. First, we were interested in the effective rate of osteoporotic fractures in this cohort. As to this objective we offered subsequent diagnostics in suspected patients. 2012 we introduced a diagnostic pathway for every patient over 50 years of age with a fracture, including dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a questionnaire about risk factors concerning osteoporosis and risk of fracture, the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and a laboratory workup focusing on this topic. Considering all these information we sent a detailed therapy-plan to the responsible General practitioner. The main goal of this study is to verify the persistence and compliance of the osteoporosis therapy 12-15 months after fracture and to clarify any obstacles potentially impeding therapy (prejudice, adverse events, contraindication overlooked, financial problems etc.). The investigators use a postal questionnaire provided to the patient and the general practitioner. Data collection is undertaken by a study nurse, in addition phoning for missing data by phone-call. With the aim to ameliorate the implementation of treatment, patients and general practitioners will be provided with the specifically tailored information found to be missing.</brief_summary>
