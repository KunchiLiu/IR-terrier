	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury(AKI) is a common and severe complication after the cardiac surgery. Postoperative AKI increases the in-hospital stay, intensive care unit(ICU) stay and postoperative mortality. Aortic surgery is the most risky surgery that causes the postoperative AKI, and the incidence of AKI after aortic surgery is about 50%. Statin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors and is used primarily to lower the level of plasma cholesterol. Apart from the antilipid effect, statin has pleiotropic effects include anti-inflammation, decrease of oxidative stress, recovery of endothelial cell injury and stabilization of thrombus. The pathology of AKI after aortic surgery include not only hypoperfusion of renal blood flow but also thromboembolism, inflammatory reaction after use of cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) and oxidative stress. Therefore, the incidence of AKI after aortic surgery can be expected to decrease after the perioperative use of statin because of the pleiotropic effects of it. The aim of this study is to examine the association between preoperative statin treatment and the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury(AKI) in patients undergoing aortic surgery</brief_summary>
