	<brief_summary>Epistaxis are present in over 90 % of patients with Rendu - Osler . They involve no significant difference 2 sexes. They often appear in childhood and adolescence and are present in three-quarters of patients at the age of 20 years. These epistaxis increasing in frequency and volume to the age of 60 in 2/3 of patients. Epistaxis are spontaneous , repetitive and recurring . They are highly variable in duration, intensity and frequency of occurrence . Some patients may have more than 40 monthly episodes with mean duration of 5 minutes of bleeding and chronic anemia and can sometimes acute anemia with transfusions need to be source. These epistaxis stigmatize patients and inevitably affect their quality of life and social skills . The various proposed ( cauterization , intra- mucosal injections, laser selective h√©mostatses , embolization or surgical dermoplasties ) allow for some short-term remissions . Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic use in the treatment of colorectal cancers . It is also used in ophthalmology intravitreal to reduce vascular proliferation in glaucoma retinopathy and certain corneal neovascularization. In 2009, Prithviraj reported the use of bevacizumab injection to treat pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in a patient with Rendu - Osler . The result is doubly interesting including a saving action on epistaxis which decrease in frequency and duration. This communication prompted the authors to focus more on this medication. The product has been used in local submucosal injection intranasal laser was coupled with satisfactory results objectified by a decrease in the number of epistaxis , reducing blood transfusions and improved social lives. The use of local instillation bevacuzimab represents a way forward for the treatment of these epistaxis.</brief_summary>
