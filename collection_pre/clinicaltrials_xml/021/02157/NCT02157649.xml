	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are (a) to determine if drug levels from a single dose of an extended-release Codeine/Guaifenesin tablet are similar to an immediate-release tablet given every four hours containing lower doses considered safe for over-the-counter use; (b) to evaluate if food affects the drug levels of this extended-release Codeine/Guaifenesin tablet after a single administration; and (c) to assess the safety and tolerability of the Codeine/Guaifenesin extended-release and immediate release tablet formulations.</brief_summary>
