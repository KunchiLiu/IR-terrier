	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1. To define whether stimulation of ATGL and suppression of G0/G1 switch gene occur in the initial phases of diabetic ketoacidosis and thus can be identified as the primary mechanisms behind this life threatening condition. 2. Make a human model for studying ketoacidosis. The investigators plan to reduce in their regular insulin over night. In the morning we administer endotoxin, which together with a relative lack of insulin will initiate ketogenesis - a state of ketoacidosis. On another occasion strict glycemic control is imposed by means of intravenous insulin. The testing is done two separate days with at least 3 weeks in between and patients are admitted to hospital the evening before the day of testing. The investigators use isotopic tracers to determine metabolic fluxes and analyse fat (ATGL, G0/G1 switch gene) and muscle biopsies.</brief_summary>
