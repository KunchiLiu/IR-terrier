Current soft contact lens wearer who regularly sleeps in lenses (1 or more nights per week); Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, disease, or abnormality that contraindicates contact lens wear within 6 months prior to enrollment; Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated including any use of topical ocular medications that would require instillation during contact lens wear; History of herpetic keratitis; History of corneal or refractive surgery or irregular cornea; A pathologically dry eye that precludes contact lens wear; Monocular (only one eye with functional vision); Monovision correction; History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the test articles or associated materials; Concurrent participation in a contact lens or contact lens care product clinical trial or within the previous 30 days; Eye injury or ocular or intraocular surgery within 6 months prior to enrollment; Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude safe administration of the study lenses or affect the results of this study; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
