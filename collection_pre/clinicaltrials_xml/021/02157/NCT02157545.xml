	<brief_summary>Pyridostigmine is a medication that is used in certain heart rate and blood pressure conditions. This medication, as a side effect, is known to also cause changes in the junction between a nerve and muscle. The changes caused at the nerve muscle junction by pyridostigmine could alter the effect of muscle relaxants (a medication used during surgery and anesthesia). The investigators are conducting this study to see whether patients taking pyridostigmine are more or less sensitive to rocuronium (a muscle relaxing medication used during surgery).</brief_summary>
