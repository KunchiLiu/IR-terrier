	<brief_summary>Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have increased rates of hepatic steatosis compared to weight similar women with regular menses. It is unclear if this is related to high testosterone or insulin resistance. We will assess hepatic glucose release, rates of lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis in the fasted and postprandial state to determine if alterations in the processes contribute to hepatic steatosis. Subjects will be overweight, sedentary girls with or without PCOS who are not receiving medical therapy for insulin resistance, or PCOS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatic glucose release will be assessed with a stable isotope glycerol tracer, lipolysis with a glycerol tracer, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis with an acetate tracer. Data will be collected fasting and after a glucose challenge. The degree of hepatic steatosis and abdominal fat partitioning will be assessed with an MRI, and total body composition with a DEXA.</detailed_description>
