	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), has on the quality of life of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). SVF contains components with "regenerative" properties, including stem cells that may be capable of ameliorating specific disease conditions. This study is designed to evaluate quality of life changes in individuals with MS for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.</brief_summary>
