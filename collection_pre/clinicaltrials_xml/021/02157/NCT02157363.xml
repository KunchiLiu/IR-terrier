	<brief_summary>Open thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (TAE) is the standard curative treatment modality for resectable esophageal cancer. TAE can be achieved by positioning the patient in the supine position for the abdominal part and in a left-lateral decubitus (LLD) position for the thoracic part, or by performing both parts in a left-screwed supine position (LSS). Aim of the present study is to compare peri- and postoperative outcome variables after TAE for esophageal cancer in the two positions. POETRI is designed as a single-center, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms including patients with resectable esophageal cancer and type I cancers of the esophagogastric junction (AEG I). Exclusion criteria are inability to tolerate surgery or both types of positioning, inability to perform an intrathoracic anastomosis, non-malignant pathologies. The primary endpoint is operating time. Secondary endpoints are morbidity, lymph node yield, pulmonary function, pain control and wound healing assessed during a follow-up of 3 months. POETRI is a single-center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate different positioning and thoracic access during radical open thoracoabdominal esophagectomy for patients with resectable esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
