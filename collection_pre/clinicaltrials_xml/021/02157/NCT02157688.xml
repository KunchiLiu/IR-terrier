	<brief_summary>The folliculitis decalvans (FD) is an orphan disease , common in consultation specialized on scalp. This disease is currently not curable, responsible for significant for patients. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) appears to play a role, never previously studied, and the study will attempt to clarify it. Controversies in the literature on the pathophysiological hypotheses can be summed up as follows : FD is it an infectious folliculitis where SA (almost always found on the lesions plays a direct role possibly aided by a lack of local immune protection , or is it a pustular inflammatory unknown cause where the SA has no direct role but is a cofactor or a simple germ superinfection. Our study has plans to bring new evidence to help decide between these two opposite but not mutually exclusive concepts .</brief_summary>
