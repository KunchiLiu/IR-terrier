	<brief_title>Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis of Intravenous Esomeprazole in Chinese Seriously Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress related upper Gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings are important events associated with morbidity and mortality among seriously ill patients. Data from the literature suggest that stress ulcer prevention with effective acid suppressive treatment can reduce bleeding events and is thus an important therapy in high-risk patients. Esomeprazole has the potential to reduce gastric acidity for prolonged periods of time adequate for both preventing mucosal damage and facilitating coagulation. This study is to reveal whether intravenous (iv) esomeprazole is effective in preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding and if it is tolerated by Chinese seriously ill patients.</detailed_description>
