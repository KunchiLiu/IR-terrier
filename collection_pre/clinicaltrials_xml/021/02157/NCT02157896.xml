	<brief_summary>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Endostatin (ES) participate angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) also play a crucial role in neovascularization and tissue repair after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The investigators sought to compare the expression of VEGF and ES in serum and the circulating EPCs in patients after AIS with that of healthy control subjects. The investigators obtained peripheral blood and serum samples from study subjects. EPCs in blood samples from AIS patients and healthy controls were quantified by flow cytometry 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days after AIS. VEGF and ES were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at the same time points. The relation between them and the relation of them to prognosis of such patients with acute ischemic stroke were assessed.</brief_summary>
