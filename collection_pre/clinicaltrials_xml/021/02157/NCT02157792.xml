	<criteria>Disease status Parts A and B: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, or for whom regimens containing gemcitabine, cisplatin, and/or etoposide might be considered, and with measurable disease according to RECIST criteria Part C1: For Prescreening: Advanced (metastatic or locallyadvanced unresectable and not eligible for definitive treatment, e.g., surgery/radiotherapy), histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Available historical tumor specimen at the time of prescreening or willing to provide a tumor biopsy (core) if the biopsy may be considered as part of standard clinical practice for the patient Received or did not tolerate standard approved targeted therapy, if appropriate for tumor genotype For Screening: Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria Part C2: Advanced (locallyadvanced incurable or metastatic) histologically confirmed estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. Adequate available historical tumor specimen or willing to provide a tumor biopsy (core) if the biopsy may be considered as part of standard clinical practice for the patient Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria Part C3: Advanced (locallyadvanced incurable or metastatic) histologically confirmed SCLC that is platinumresistant, defined as disease progression during initial treatment with a platinumbased regimen or progression within 90 days of completion of platinum therapy. Subjects with platinumresistant disease may receive a secondline nonplatinumbased chemotherapy and subsequently be enrolled to this study. Subjects who received and are resistant to a secondline platinumbased chemotherapy may also be enrolled into the study. Adequate available historical tumor specimen or willing to provide a tumor biopsy (core) if the biopsy may be considered as part of standard clinical practice for the patient Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria WHO performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of ≥12 week Hematological and biochemical indices within protocol specified ranges at screening. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy during the previous 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and MitomycinC, and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products) or less than 4 drug halflives, whichever greater, before first dose of study drug. Parts A and B: Greater than 6 cycles of prior treatment with cisplatin and/or carboplatin. (a) History of prior dose reductions or dose interruptions while receiving cisplatin or carboplatin due to toxicity from the platinum or intolerance to either agent. Subjects with a known history of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 4 neutropenia while receiving prior therapy. Part C1: Any cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond 1 line of platinumbased chemotherapy. One additional line of nonplatinum based therapy in the advanced setting 1. Prescreening Only*: Subjects may currently be receiving platinumbased chemotherapy in the advanced setting, or have completed 1 line of platinumbased chemotherapy and are currently receiving a secondline nonplatinumbased therapy or maintenance therapy 2. There is no restriction on prior immunotherapy or targeted therapy unless combined together with a cytotoxic agent Any prior gemcitabine for the treatment of NSCLC in any setting within 6 months Subjects who are known to be TP53 wildtype, unless they are determined to have ATM loss of expression during screening or prescreening or until all the planned subjects with TP53 mutation are enrolled as determined by the medical monitor Subjects with unknown TP53 mutational status will be enrolled until the group of approximately 10 subjects without TP53 mutation or until all the planned subjects with TP53 mutation are enrolled as determined by the medical monitor Part C2: Any prior platinum therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant within 6 months of screening Relapse within 3 months of completion of prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy Any prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting with the exception of either a taxane or an anthracycline in the firstline metastatic setting (a) There is no restriction on prior immunotherapy or targeted therapy in the metastatic setting unless combined together with a cytotoxic agent Subjects with known BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations, either determined and documented prior to Screening, or determined during Screening. Subjects with unknown BRCA1/BRCA2 status may be enrolled at discretion of the sponsor Subjects who are documented to be nonbasaloid subtype using molecular profiling assay (e.g. PAM50 assay) prior to Screening Subjects with unknown BRCA1/BRCA2 or basaloid subtype status will be enrolled until the number of enrolled subjects is approximately 40. If approximately 40 subjects have been enrolled and a minimum of 30 subjects who are basaloid positive and BRCA1/BRCA2 germline wildtype have not been enrolled, the basaloid subtype and BRCA status assay will be required at Screening to exclude subjects who are basaloid negative or have BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations. Part C3: Prior platinumsensitive subjects, unless they progress on or within 90 days of completion of platinumbased regimen There is no restriction on prior immunotherapy or targeted therapy in the metastatic setting unless combined together with a cytotoxic agent During prior carboplatin therapy, requirement for dose reduction below AUC 5 mg.min/mL or discontinuation of carboplatin for toxicity or lack of tolerability. Unresolved toxicity of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2 or greater from previous anticancer therapy or radiotherapy History of spinal cord compression or brain metastases, unless asymptomatic, treated, stable, and not requiring treatment with steroids for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug. Any history of leptomeningeal metastases. Female subjects who are already pregnant or lactating, or plan to become pregnant within 6 months of the last dose of study drug are excluded. Female subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to contraception guidelines Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must agree to adhere to contraception guidelines. Men with pregnant or lactating partners or partners who plan to become pregnant during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study drug are excluded Serious cardiac or other comorbid disease, as specified in the protocol Prior bone marrow transplant or extensive radiotherapy to greater than 15% of bone marrow Part C: Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated conebiopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Major surgery ≤2 weeks before starting study drug, or incomplete recovery from a prior major surgical procedure.</criteria>
