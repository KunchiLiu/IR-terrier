	<brief_summary>The Wisconsin Center for the Neuroscience and Psychophysiology of Meditation will be a highly focused center dedicated to novel and cutting edge research on the mechanisms by which meditation works. The core set of hypotheses for this Center focus on the mechanisms of two common meditation practices: Mindfulness Meditation (MM) and Loving-Kindness/Compassion Meditation (LKM-CO), both taught in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). The investigators will study both Long-Term Meditators (LTMs) as well as meditation-naïve participants (MNPs). The latter group will be randomly assigned to MBSR, a rigorously matched comparison intervention called the Health Enhancement Program (HEP; MacCoon et al., 2012), or to a Wait List (WL) control group. This will give us a comprehensive view of changes that are produced by meditation practices per se, changes generically associated with interventions designed to promote well-being, and changes that might be effects of repeating testing protocols across multiple occasions. In addition, the inclusion of both novice and experienced meditators provides a wide range of practice experience that will provide critical information on dose-related effects, information that is lacking in the research literature today. Each of the projects is focused on examining the brain mechanisms and peripheral biological correlates of meditation. Project 1 (Davidson) will examine the impact of the explicit use of mindfulness and loving-kindness/compassion strategies on emotion regulation, specifically neural, biobehavioral and hormonal indices of reactivity to and recovery from pictures of human suffering and flourishing. Project 2 (Busse) will investigate the brain to periphery pathways through which psychological factors contribute to the expression of asthma symptoms. In addition, it will examine the efficacy of meditation training in reducing the inflammatory response to an allergen in asthmatic individuals by reducing the reactivity of emotion-related neural circuitry. Project 3 (Tononi) will examine whether the previously reported increase in gamma oscillations during Non-REM (NREM) sleep in meditators is associated with changes in sleep mentation (Ferrarelli et al. 2013). In addition, project 3 will examine relations between meditation-induced changes in brain activity during sleep and brain activity and cognitive function during wakefulness.</brief_summary>

Diagnosed eating disorder or anxiety disorder unless it was more than 1 year ago. (May be included with the PIs discretion). Excluded based upon the screening visit Some ongoing medical problems will be excluded based on team judgments about whether they will affect a participant's ability to participate in the study procedures or will affect one or more outcome measures. Unable to distinguish colors used in Stroop task Use of oral corticosteroids Inability or unwillingness to withhold medication as detailed below, before each set of laboratory assessments: Leukotriene Inhibitors 2 days Zyrtec 5 days Allegra/Claritin 4 days Antihistamines 2 days Nasal Steroids 24h Albuterol 6 h Inhaled corticosteroids 12 h Use of &gt;1000 mcg Fluticasone or equivalent ICS per day.

Current meditation practice. Judgment: Participants will be included or excluded at the PIs discretion due to wide variation in responses (e.g. 2 people answer yes, one practices mindfulness 2x/week for 2 years (exclude), the other attends regular religious services (include)). Significant daily practice with other mindbody techniques Daily Yoga or Tai Chi Practice exclude Other daily practice judgment. Inclusion Criteria MNPNA: Able to provide valid informed consent to participate by signing/dating a consent form.

Takes less than 30 minutes to fall asleep on average. Gets a good night of sleep regularly. Goes to bed before 12 a.m., able to sleep between 11 p.m. &amp; 6 a.m. and sleeps &gt;= 6 hours. (May be included at sleep doctor's discretion. In some cases, participants may not comply with these criteria but may be entirely safe to participate in the study. For example, a participant may indicate they do not get a good night of sleep due to a situational issue such as a waking baby or a pet as opposed to a chronic issue like insomnia. In these cases, there is no safety issue in having the participant included in the study) Participants assigned to HEP must have physician signature (on the Physician Authorization Form PAF) indicating it is safe for them to participate in our interventions as some participant characteristics, such as a family history of coronary or atherosclerotic disease, represent risk factors that together may make the HEP intervention inadvisable; The process is consistent for ANY person who wishes to participate in any sort of physical activity class at the UW Health Research Park Clinic.
