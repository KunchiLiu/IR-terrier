	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of a Patient Activation Tool in Pediatric Appendicitis (Antibiotics Alone vs. Appendectomy)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to to determine if a patient activation tool (PAT) can improve decision making and patient centered outcomes in pediatric patients with appendicitis and their caregivers. Hypothesis: A PAT that activates patient-caregiver dyads will improve decision making and patient centered outcomes without compromising medical outcomes in children with appendicitis. Specifically,the investigators expect the PAT to improve decision self-efficacy and healthcare satisfaction without increasing disability days. Methods/Outcomes: The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial comparing a PAT to standard surgical consultation in patient-caregiver dyads choosing between either antibiotics alone or appendectomy for early appendicitis. The investigators will identify differences in various components of decision making and patient centered outcomes including caregiver decision self-efficacy, preparedness for decision making, decisional conflict, decision regret, caregiver activation, caregiver and child satisfaction with care and health related quality of life (HRQOL), and caregiver and child knowledge. The investigators will also characterize the effects of a PAT on medical outcomes from appendicitis in patients receiving the PAT compared to those receiving standard surgical consultation alone. The investigators will determine differences in disability days, length of stay, readmission rates, and medical complications related to treatment choice (e.g. infection, recurrence).</detailed_description>
