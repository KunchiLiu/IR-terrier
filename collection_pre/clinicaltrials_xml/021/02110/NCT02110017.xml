	<brief_summary>An impairment in social cognition in schizophrenia could account for the severe professional and social difficulties among patients. Social cognition is the way the social world is understood, perceived and interpreted. It includes all the process than enable oneself to interact with another person, namely emotion perception and processing, theory of mind (ToM), social perception, social knowledge and attributional style. Since these process are interconnected, social cognition should be investigated through ecological tasks which activate all of them together. Developing a social cognition ecological task, then testing the reproducibility of the functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) BOLD signal is the main objective of this study. The secondary objective is to seek a functional deficit among the neural network of social cognition in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy subjects. Forty healthy subjects, aged from 18 to 60 years old, who have given a written consent, will be included. The social cognition paradigm will be developed and the fMRI activations will be compared to those of a visual cartoon based task, known to turn on the neural network of ToM. BOLD signal variations at a high statistical correction ratio (p&lt;0.05) will be explored and compared to the signal of a second fMRI, made on the same 20 healthy subjects one month later, to test reproducibility (% of identical activated voxels during the 2 fMRI, p&lt;0.05). Twenty matched patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV-R), aged from 18 to 60 will be included to test the secondary objective. We make the hypothesis of a fMRI functional alteration in the cerebral network involved in social cognition, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex, among patients compared with healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
