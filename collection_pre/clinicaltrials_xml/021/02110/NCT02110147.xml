	<brief_summary>This protocol has two parts - the Main Study which is 42 days in length and the Treatment Extension Study which allows the patients who complete the Main Study to continue receiving treatment with uridine triacetate. The purpose of this study is to replace oral administration of uridine with oral administration of uridine triacetate in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria who have received (or would reasonably be expected to receive) clinical benefit from treatment with exogenous uridine. It is also to document the continued clinical benefit of exogenous uridine when patients are switched from oral administration of uridine to oral administration of uridine triacetate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study of Uridine Triacetate in Pediatric Patients With Hereditary Orotic Aciduria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data to be collected during the Main Study include demographic, baseline disease information and medical history including all prior disease-directed therapy. In addition, vital signs, laboratory values and adverse events information will be collected and recorded. Urine samples will be obtained and measured for orotic acid and orotidine levels. Systemic levels of uridine will be evaluated from plasma samples collected at set timepoints. Upon successful completion of the Main Study and entry into the Treatment Extension of the study, physical exams and vital signs will be performed every six (6) months. Additionally, plasma samples to measure systemic levels of uridine and urine samples to measure levels of orotic acid and orotidine will be collected every (6) six months.</detailed_description>
