	<criteria>1. Subjects who signed informed consent. 2. Male subjects ≥18 and ≤79 years of age; female subjects ≥18 and ≤79 years of age of nonchildbearing potential 3. Weight within a BMI range of 19.035.0 kg/m2. 4. CLCr according to Cockcroft Gault equation of: 5080 mL/min (mild renal impairment) 30 &lt;50 mL/min (moderate renal impairment) &lt;30 mL/min (severe renal impairment) subjects receiving dialysis for ≥3 months before dosing (ESRD) &gt;80 mL/min (normal renal function) 1. Unwilling or unable to give informed consent. 2. As a result of the medical screening process, the study physician considers the subject unfit for the study. 3. Demonstrating excess in xanthine consumption (more than 5 cups of coffee or equivalent per day). 4. Subjects who smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day. 5. Subjects who consume more than 28 units (males) or more than 21 units (females) of alcohol per week. 6. Any history of hypersensitivity to the IMP. 7. For subjects with renal impairment: No clinically significant change in disease status within at least 1 month prior to study entry, as determined by the investigator. 8. The subject had donated a unit of blood (450 mL) within the 3 months before dosing, or intends to donate in the month after the last scheduled visit. 9. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug or device within the last month. 10. Subjects with clinically significant telemetric ECG abnormalities on Day 1 11. Significant allergies requiring intranasal or systemic corticosteroids during any time of the year or history of any anaphylactic reaction. 12. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. 13. Acute Hepatitis B or C infection. 14. The subject has tested positive for drugs of abuse at screening. 15. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 4 weeks prior to dosing (excluded are those drugs the renally impaired subject is currently taking for treatment of the renal or concomitant disease). 16. Immunocompromised patients (patients after solid organ or bone marrow transplant; patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment). 17. Subjects with known or suspected Pseudomonas infection or colonization (e.g. patients with cystic fibrosis). 18. Subjects with significant liver function abnormalities 19. Subjects with acute myocardial infection or unstable angina pectoris</criteria>
