	<brief_title>The Effect of Neurodynamic Mobilization Exercise on Lower Limb Pain in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by generalized joints inflammation. With increasing investigation on the pathology, the treatment focus on the conditions shifted from a musculoskeletal point of view to a systemic approach. The awareness of holistic treatment was also increased. Latest studies have found out the neurogenic inflammatory mechanism played an important role in the inflammatory process of RA, the pathological changes of neural tissues in RA were also noted. This clinical trial is the first study to apply neurodynamic mobilization, a nervous system specific therapeutic exercise, on patients with RA. Objective of the study is to find out the effect of neurodynamic mobilization for joint inflammation in patients with RA. Population Adults who are diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Intervention Neurodynamic Exercise Comparison Standard conservative physiotherapy protocol Outcome Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Scale (RAPS) C-reactive protein (CRP) test</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria was considered as patients with rheumatoid arthritis; presence of inflammatory condition on the joints on upper and / or lower limbs; Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Scale (RAPS) at least 10 points during activities of daily living; and adults (&gt; 18 years of age) in either gender. The exclusion criteria are: acute joint pain, physiotherapy or joint injections in the previous 3 months; change in corticosteroids in the previous month; and change in diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs in the previous 3 months; subjects with poor balance or significant pain which neurodynamic mobilization is unable to perform.</criteria>
