	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational anticancer drug DCR-MYC. DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC. MYC oncogene activation is important to the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. In this study the Sponsor proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study of DCR-MYC in Patients With Solid Tumors, Multiple Myeloma, or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this first-in human study, DCR-MYC will be administered by 2 hour intravenous (IV) infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients with either solid tumor malignancies, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma that have not responded to previous treatment. The highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated. There will be 2 expansion cohorts at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or highest safe dose identified for further study which may be lower): - Biopsy Cohort: 6 patients, tumor biopsies to be performed pre-dosing and Cycle 2/Day 11; same assessments as dose escalation cohorts - PNET Cohort: Up to 20 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; same assessments as dose escalation cohorts, however fewer PD (cytokine) assessments and no PK assessments</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients, &gt; 18 years of age at the time of obtaining informed consent. 2. Patients with a documented solid tumor malignancy that is locally advanced or metastatic; patients with documented multiple myeloma or nonHodgkin's lymphoma. 3. Patients with a malignancy that is either refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available. 4. Patients with a malignancy that is currently not amenable to surgical intervention due to either medical contraindications or nonresectability of the tumor. 5. Dose escalation portion of study: Patients with measurable or nonmeasurable disease according to standard response criteria . 6. MTD Biopsy Cohort ONLY: Patients with measurable disease with primary or metastatic tumor site(s) considered safely accessible for biopsy; patients must consent to undergo 2 tumor biopsies. 7. MTD PNET Cohort ONLY: Patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic), histologicallyconfirmed low or intermediate grade PNET according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 classification. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., gastrinoma, VIPoma) in whom a pancreatic or peripancreatic primary is strongly suspected are also eligible. Patients must also have: A Ki67 proliferation index &lt; 20% Demonstrated radiological evidence of disease progression during or following the last treatment regimen (based on CT, MRI, or Octreoscan®) Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 (determined by CT or MRI). Any lesions which have been subjected to percutaneous therapies or radiotherapy should not be considered measureable, unless the lesion has clearly progressed (per RECIST v1.1) since the procedure. Received &lt; 2 prior systemic treatments for PNET, at least one of which must have been an FDAapproved targeted therapy for PNET (i.e., sunitinib [Sutent®] or everolimus [Afinitor®]). Treatment with a somatostatin analog (SSA) will not be considered as a systemic treatment for the purposes of eligibility. 8. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and an anticipated life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. 9. Patients, both male and female, who are either not of childbearing potential or who agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug. 10. Patients with the ability to understand and give written informed consent for participation in this trial, including all evaluations and procedures as specified by this protocol. Exclusion CriteriaPatients: 1. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), and fertile men with a WOCBPpartner not using and not willing to use a medically effective method of contraception. 2. Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases not controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy, or patients with symptoms suggesting CNS involvement for which treatment is required. 3. Patients with leukemia (any form) or myelodysplastic syndromes. 4. MTD PNET Cohort ONLY: Patients with poorly differentiated, high grade (grade 3) neuroendocrine carcinoma, as well as patients with adenocarcinoid, goblet cell carcinoid, or small cell carcinoma, or PNET patients with a Ki67 proliferation index &gt; 20 %. 5. Patients with any of the following hematologic abnormalities at baseline: Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500 per mm3 Platelet count &lt; 100,000 per mm3 6. Patients with any of the following serum chemistry abnormalities at baseline: Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × the ULN for the institution AST or ALT &gt; 3 × the ULN for the institution (&gt; 5 × if due to hepatic involvement by tumor) Creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN for the institution 7. Patients with any of the following coagulation parameter abnormalities at baseline: PT (INR) &gt; 1.5 × ULN for the institution PTT &gt; 1.5 × ULN for the institution 8.
