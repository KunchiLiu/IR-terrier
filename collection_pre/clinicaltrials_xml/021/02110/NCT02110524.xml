	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess safety and the inhibition of restenosis of the CVI Paclitaxel-coated PTA Balloon Catheter in the treatment of de-novo occluded/stenotic or reoccluded/restenotic superficial femoral (SFA) or popliteal arteries. The primary endpoint for this analysis is late lumen loss at six (6) months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with symptomatic leg ischemia, requiring treatment of SFA or popliteal (P1 segment) artery De novo or restenotic lesion(s) &gt;70% within the SFA and popliteal arteries in a single limb which are ≥3 cm and ≤15 cm in cumulative total length (by visual estimation). Target vessel reference diameter ≥3 mm and ≤7 mm (by visual estimation). Rutherford classification of 2, 3 or 4 Lesion length is &lt;3 cm or &gt;15 cm or there is no normal proximal arterial segment in which duplex ultrasound velocity ratios can be measured. Outflow arteries (distal popliteal, anterior or posterior tibial or peroneal arteries) with significant lesions (≥ 50% stenosis) may not be treated during the same procedure. Treatment of the contralateral limb during the same procedure or within 30 days of the study procedure.</criteria>
