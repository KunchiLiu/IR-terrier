	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Parameters for Patients Receiving Proton Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major purpose of this study is to analyze side effects experienced and self-reported by prostate cancer patients undergoing proton radiation therapy at IUHPTC. With the information collected, the investigators will establish pre-existing conditions before proton treatment and measure side effects after treatments that are not related to the pre-existing conditions. Also, to compare long-term side effects for patients who are treated with hormone suppression therapy along with their proton therapy to those patients who do not get treated with hormone suppression therapy. This information will help doctors better understand the side effects experienced and may help provide valuable information for future patients making decisions regarding their treatment options. Finally, to develop a database of information regarding the treatment and outcomes for patients with prostate cancer in order to improve care of patients with this type of cancer.</detailed_description>
