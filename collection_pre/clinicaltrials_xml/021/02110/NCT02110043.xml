	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate whether a combination of intensive training of visual-spatial abilities (LOCATO task) with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) leads to an improvement in learning and memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to examine the underlying neuronal mechanism.</brief_summary>
