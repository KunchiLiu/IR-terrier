	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of FDG PET/CT in evaluating response of bone dominant breast cancer to therapy. Eligible patients with bone dominant ER+ breast cancer will undergo baseline FDG PET/CT for evaluation of their disease, after the start of therapy they will undergo an FDG PET/CT scan at 4 weeks and again at 12 weeks. PET/CT results will be compared to clinical measures of response, time to progression and overall survival.</brief_summary>
