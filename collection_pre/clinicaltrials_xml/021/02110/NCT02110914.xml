The investigators hypothesize that a health coaching intervention will empower young adults with CF to manage their lives with CF and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The main aim of the study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a Motivational Interviewing inspired coaching-intervention.</brief_summary>
