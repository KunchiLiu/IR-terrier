	<brief_summary>This study is assessing quality of life in children with a physical disability who participate in the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital Sports Program (HSP), where children with physical disabilities are able to participate in more organized sports and active programs with the use of adaptive equipment. This study would assess a child's self reported and parent perceived quality of life before and after child participation in HSP for the winter season. The investigators aim to determine the level of child and parent happiness and satisfaction in specific quality of life aspects including: physical activities and health, feelings, moods, self perception, home life, friends, school, learning and bullying. The investigators believe that children with any physical disability will have a more satisfactory reported quality of life after participating in HSP for one or many years.</brief_summary>
