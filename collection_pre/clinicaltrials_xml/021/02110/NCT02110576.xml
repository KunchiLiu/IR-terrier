	<brief_summary>CLSI guidelines shall be followed to gather data from a minimum of one hundred and twenty normal donors to create reference intervals for various Haemonetics reagents. Venous blood from a minimum of 146 reference subjects shall be tested. Blood from 160 donors will be drawn at the study site to account for aberrant or outlying data excluded for technical or other reasons.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procedure For The Reference Range Study For Absolute MA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of an examination of how LY30 is calculated, the investigators would like to explore the differences between Maximum Amplitude (MA) and LY30 calculated in the traditional small deviation method and by an absolute MA method. The maximum amplitude (MA) for a sample is determined in real-time using one of two MA-identifying algorithms: Small Deviation MA (the default algorithm) or Absolute MA. Both algorithms are available in commercially available software. Both algorithms find an MA for a sample; however, the difference between the two algorithms is the "acceptance criteria" which each use for identifying the MA. As compared to Small Deviation MA, the Absolute MA has a larger and more stringent rules set. A study will be run to establish reference intervals following the guidelines set out in CLSI document C28-A3c. This guideline calls for a reference interval to be constructed from at least 120 donors. To meet the guidance outlined in the CLSI guideline, we will collect a minimum of 146 donors.</detailed_description>
