	<brief_summary>Background: no randomized controlled trial has tried to compare treatment outcomes between the IPS.emmax endocrowns and the IPS.emmax conventional crowns . Objective: to investigate the clinical performance of the IPS.emmax endocrowns and the IPS.emmax conventional crowns Design and setting: Parallel-groups randomized controlled trial on patients with one or more intensive damaged molars requiring crowning and being treated at the University of Damascus, Dental School in Damascus, Syria .All molars will be examined at the baseline assessment using a modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Participants: Incoming patients to the Fixed Prosthetic and Endodontic Departments will be examined to find any excessively damaged molars requiring crowning. Forty patients will be recruited according to specific inclusion criteria. Randomization will be performed using computer-generated tables; allocation will be concealed using sequentially numbered opaque and sealed envelopes.The included 40 patients will be analyzed (age range between 20-60 years). They will be randomly distributed into two groups with 20 patients in each group (1:1 allocation ratio). Intervention: Excessively damaged and endodontically treated molars will be restored with IPS.emmax endocrowns or IPS.emmax crowns supported with composite core. Main outcome measure: marginal adaptation and anatomic form will be investigated clinically and by apical radiographs at the baseline assessment using the modified (USPHS) at six assessment times during an 18-month observation period. Assessor blinding will be employed.</brief_summary>
