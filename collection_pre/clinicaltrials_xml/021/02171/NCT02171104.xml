	<brief_summary>This single-institution, phase II study is designed to test the ability to achieve donor hematopoietic engraftment while maintaining low rates of transplant-related mortality (TRM) using busulfan- and fludarabine-based conditioning regimens with busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for patients with various inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) and severe osteopetrosis (OP).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>0 through 55 years of age Adequate graft available Adequate organ function Eligible Diseases: 1. Mucopolysaccharidosis Disorders ("IMD"): 1. MPS IH (Hurler syndrome) 2. MPS II (Hunter syndrome) if the patient has no or minimal evidence of symptomatic neurologic disease but is expected to have a neurologic phenotype 3. MPS VI (MaroteauxLamy syndrome) 4. MPS VII (Sly syndrome) 2. Glycoprotein Metabolic Disorders ("IMD"): 1. Alpha mannosidosis 2. Fucosidosis 3. Aspartylglucosaminuria 3. Sphingolipidoses and Recessive Leukodystrophies ("IMD"): 1. Globoid cell leukodystrophy 2. Metachromatic leukodystrophy 3. NiemannPick B patients (sphingomyelin deficiency) 4. NiemannPick C subtype 2 4. Peroxisomal Disorders ("IMD"): 1. Adrenoleukodystrophy with cerebral involvement 2. Zellweger syndrome 3. Neonatal Adrenoleukodystrophy 4. Infantile Refsum disease 5. AcylCoAOxidase Deficiency 6. DBifunctional enzyme deficiency 7. Multifunctional enzyme deficiency 8. AlphamethylacylCoA Racmase Deficiency (AMACRD) 9. Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestingal Encephalopathy (MNGIE) 5. Severe Osteopetrosis (OP) 6. Hereditary Leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS; CSF1R mutation) 7. Other Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMD): Patients will also be considered who have other lifethreatening, rare lysosomal, peroxisomal or other similar inherited disorders characterized by white matter disease or other neurologic manifestations for which there is rationale that transplantation would be of benefit, such as certain patients with Wolman's disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, Icell disease, TaySachs disease, Sandhoff disease or others. Any patient who in the judgment of the University of Minnesota Inherited Metabolic and Storage Disease Group has disease that is not likely to benefit from allogeneic HSCT, based on its nature, severity or state of progression Prior myeloablative chemotherapy exposure within 4 months of the start of conditioning on this protocol Uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infections including HIV Pregnancy</criteria>
