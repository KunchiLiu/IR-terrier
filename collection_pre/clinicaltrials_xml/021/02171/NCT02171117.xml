	<brief_summary>Patients enrolled from each center according to confirmed criteria specified in cooperative scheme are randomly assigned to standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy with microtransplantation （MST-group）or without (CT-group).Compare the remission rate and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival(OS) rate of the two groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Microtransplantation to Treat Elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Microtransplantation, which combines chemotherapy with adoptive infusion of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized HLA-mismatched peripheral blood stem cells (GPBSC). Data from more than 70 elderly AML patients who received microtransplantation in Beijing showed that the remission rate and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) reach 75-82% and 32-39% respectively, and microchimerisms (donor cells&lt;1%) were detected without GVHD. The results have been clinically validated in several other centers in China, United States and Australia. Based on these facts, to further validate the therapeutic efficacy, we propose a phase III clinical trial in which the de novo AML patients ≥60 years old are randomly assigned to receive standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy with or without microtransplantation.</detailed_description>
