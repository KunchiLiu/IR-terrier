	<brief_summary>Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) scans are performed routinely to look at the vessels in the body as an alternative to directly injecting contrast into the vessels and taking pictures. Different types of intravenous (into the vein, IV) contrast are available to fill the vessels and make them easier to see. The purpose of the study is to determine the best type of contrast for this scan.</brief_summary>
