	<brief_summary>This is a single-centre study over 36 months for the inclusion of 30 patients. The selection and inclusion of patients will take place according to the criterion of Medical Termination of Pregnancy at 4 different gestational ages (8-12 weeks of gestation (WG)), 13-16 WG, 17-23 WG and 25-35 WG. The tissue analysed will principally be the gonads, other somatic tissue will also be systematically harvested in parallel (liver and psoas muscle) for control purposes. The gonads will be subjected to molecular biology analyses destined to quantify the expression of transposons and their inhibitors.</brief_summary>
