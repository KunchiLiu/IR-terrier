	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency catheter ablation is highly effective in the treatment of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. In order to decrease the recurrence rate after catheter ablation, the investigators propose to apply 'virtual' ablation on patient-specific atria by simulating 3D atrial computer model. The investigators will test with five different set of ablation methods and find successful methods for a specific patient. Then, this result will be compared to empirical catheter ablation result by randomly controlled trial.</brief_summary>
