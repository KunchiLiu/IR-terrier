	<brief_summary>Background: Intraoperative wound infiltration with local anaesthetic is commonly used. Apart from the obvious immediate action it has been supported that a possible down regulation of pain receptors may lead to longer effects. Our aim was to compare the use of local anaesthetic versus placebo in order to assess if indeed there is a late beneficial effect. Materials and methods: We will conduct a RCT involving 400 consecutive general surgery patients randomized in 2 groups: Group A= placebo, Group B= wound infiltration with ropivacaine 10%. We will record the preoperative and postoperative pain for the 1st week as well as the type and quantity of the analgesia used during the study period. Hypothesis : patients who receive intraoperatively wound infiltration with local anaesthetic have lower pain during the 1st postoperative week and require less pain killers .</brief_summary>
