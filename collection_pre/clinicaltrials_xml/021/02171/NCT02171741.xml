	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Trial of BIBW 2992 Administration in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Docetaxel</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female patients with confirmed diagnosis of advanced, nonresectable and / or metastatic solid tumors, of types historically known to express EGFR and/or HER2, who are amenable to docetaxel, preferably patients with breast, prostate, or nonsmall cell lung cancer. Patients must have failed prior standard therapies associated with clinical benefits, including survival benefits, if such therapies are available. If docetaxel administration is standard therapy associated with clinical benefits, patients are eligible Age 18 years or older Life expectancy of at least three (3) months Written informed consent that is consistent with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0 or 1 Patients must have resolution from prior chemo, hormone, immuno, or radiotherapy related toxicities to CTC Grade &lt;= 1or baseline for individual patient Patients must be recovered from previous surgery Active infectious disease Gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with the absorption of the study drug or chronic diarrhea Serious illness or concomitant nononcological disease considered by the investigator to be incompatible with the protocol Patients with untreated or symptomatic brain metastases. Patients with treated, asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible if there has been no change in brain disease status for at least eight weeks, no history of cerebral edema or bleeding in the past eight weeks and no requirement for steroids or antiepileptic therapy Cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction ≥ CTC Grade 1 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500 / mm3 Platelet count less than 100 000 / mm3 Bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate amino transferase (AST) and / or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 x ULN Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg / dl (&gt; 132 μmol / L, SI (Système Internationale) unit equivalent) Women and men who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception Pregnancy or breastfeeding Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs, or chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone therapy (excluding Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists, or other hormones taken for breast cancer, or bisphosphonates) or participation in another clinical study within the past four weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with this study Treatment with an EGFR or HER2 inhibiting drug within the past four weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with this study (8 weeks for trastuzumab) Patients unable to comply with the protocol Active alcohol or drug abuse Hypersensitivity to docetaxel or any component or other drug formulated with polysorbate 80 The patient may be eligible for retreatment after the previous course is finished. The patient will not be eligible if any of the following conditions are met: If patients' latest Xray, CT or MRI reveals progressive disease, or if clinical assessment reveals signs of disease progression Cardiac left ventricular function CTC Grade ≥ 2 at any time during the previous course Patients fulfilling any of the Exclusion Criteria listed before as determined before treatment Day 1 of any new course Patient not recovered from any doselimiting toxicity (DLT) 14 days after onset. Recovery is defined as a return to baseline level or CTC Grade 1, whichever is higher</criteria>
