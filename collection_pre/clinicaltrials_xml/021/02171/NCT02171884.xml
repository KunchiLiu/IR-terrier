	<brief_summary>For this project, 4 groups of 38 infants have been created so as to evaluate the impact of Assisted-Reproduction Technology (ART) and more particularly the two procedures classically used in ART: the freezing/thawing of embryos and prolonged embryo culture (five days of culture in appropriate in vitro conditions to allow development of the embryo) in contrast with shorter culture of only two days. Participation consists in accepting samples to be taken at the birth of the infant: 1. from the umbilical cord. 2. from the placenta.</brief_summary>
