	<brief_summary>Open-label, two-way crossover design with a quinidine sulfate run-in period followed by a randomised sequence of dabigatran etexilate plus quinidine sulfate or dabigatran etexilate alone to evaluate the safety of co-administration of dabigatran etexilate and quinidine. and the pharmacokinetic interaction between quinidine and dabigatran etexilate.</brief_summary>
