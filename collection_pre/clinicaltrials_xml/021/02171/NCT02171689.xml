	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992 MA2 after a single oral dose of [14C]-radiolabelled BIBW 2992 MA2 in healthy male volunteers. Metabolites in human plasma and excretions were measured, the structures of the metabolites analysed and compared with metabolites in animals. In addition, the mass-balance of excretion, the protein binding of [14C]-radioactivity, the plasma concentrations of BIBW 2992 MA2, and the [14C]-radioactivity in blood cells, plasma, urine and faeces were measured. The safety and tolerability of BIBW 2992 were also investigated.</brief_summary>
