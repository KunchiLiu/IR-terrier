	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify the appropriate dose of irinotecan by dose escalation(dose climbing) test. The study would provide rationale for regimen decision in a future phase III clinical trial, in which irinotecan combined with cisplatin(IP) will be selected as therapeutic drugs.</brief_summary>
