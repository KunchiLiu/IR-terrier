	<brief_summary>The objective was to demonstrate the bioequivalence of capsules made from 2 different drug product batches. The reference batch was representative of the current commercial drug product and of the pivotal Phase III batches. The test batch was the drug product batch intended for future commercial use.</brief_summary>
