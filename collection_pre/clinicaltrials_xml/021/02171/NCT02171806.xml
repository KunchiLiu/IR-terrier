Age ≥21 and ≤50 years BMI ≥18.5 and &lt;30 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG measurements) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the drug or its excipients) as judged clinically relevant by the investigator Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to randomisation Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to randomisation Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to randomisation Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day) Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days as judged by the investigator Alcohol abuse (more than 60 g alcohol a day) Drug abuse Blood donation (more than 100 mL blood within 4 weeks prior to randomisation or during the trial) Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class side effect profile of ß2mimetics: Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity Hyperthyrosis Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment Clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia Paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute). For female subjects: Pregnancy Positive pregnancy test No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraception, sterilisation, IUD (intrauterine device). Females who are not surgically sterile will be asked to additionally use barrier contraception methods (e.g. condoms) prior to administration of study medication, during the study and at least 2 months after release from the study.
