	<brief_summary>Quadricipital electrical stimulation added to respiratory rehabilitation in COPD patients. Quadricipital electrical stimulation (ES) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients has been demonstrated to improve both dyspnea and physical status. The aim of our study is to demonstrate that ES added to respiratory rehabilitation program induces a greater improvement on exercise tolerance in such patients. Design : 160 patients with severe COPD will be randomly assigned to 2 groups : either rehabilitation program (group 1), either ES and rehabilitation program (group 2). In both groups, rehabilitation program comprises endurance training, 18 - 24 sessions (6 - 8 weeks), health education, global muscular strengthening. In group 2, bilateral quadricipital electrical stimulation 30 min sessions is added 5 days / week. Subjects : COPD patients with FEV1 &lt; 50% pred, FEV1/VC &lt; 70%, and TLC &gt; 80%, with dyspnea, in stable conditions, and 18 &gt; BMI &lt; 35 kg/m² . Intervention : 6 min walking distance, incremental exercise test data (aerobic capacity, work rate, ventilatory threshold), physical activity with activity monitor, health related quality of life will be determined before and after training. Abbreviations : FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 sec; VC = vital capacity; TLC = total lung capacity; BMI = body mass index.</brief_summary>
