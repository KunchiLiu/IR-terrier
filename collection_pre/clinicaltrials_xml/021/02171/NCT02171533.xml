Planned surgeries within four weeks following the endof study examination 18. The subject is not able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions, protocolstated restrictions and dietary regimen of study centre For male subjects: 19. Male subjects who do not agree to minimise the risk of female partners becoming pregnant from the first dosing day until 3 months after the completion of the post study medical. Acceptable methods of contraception comprises barrier contraception and a medically accepted contraceptive method for the female partner (intrauterine device with spermicide, hormonal contraceptive since at least two month) For female subjects: 20.
