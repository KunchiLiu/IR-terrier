	<brief_summary>In the care of the chronic pain in pain's department, pain consultation or Evaluation and Treatment of the Pain Center (CETD), the patients are often in a situation of physical and psychic suffering which requires a multidisciplinary follow-up. So, 19 percent of the chronic painful patients lost their employment, are "disintegrated" because of their pain, this being able to provocate a loss of their financial autonomy. A large number of painful patients thus find themselves in situations of social vulnerability even of precariousness often denied and difficult to detect by the caring team. Precarity is define as " the lack of one or several securities, in particular the employment, allowing the people and the families to assume their professional, family or social obligations, and to enjoy their fundamental rights." To allow a earlier identification of the populations in deprivation situation, the questionnaire EPICES (Evaluation of the Precariousness and the Disparities of health for the Centers of Examination of Health (CES)) was administered to more than 7000 people. The individual score, indicator of the precariousness and the disparities of health, is calculated after answer to 11 questions and was calculated on about 200 000 French people. Among numerous indicators, it appears that the consumption of psychotropics or a negative perception of the health are socioeconomic indicators, mode of life and health which are prevailing according to the quintiles of the score EPICES. This national study, on the French CETD aims is: 1 - to study prevalence of the social vulnerability even of the precariousness thanks to adapted questionnaires of which the questionnaire EPICES, 2 - to identify predictive social-economic factors which generate and amplify this circumstance, 3 - to identify the patients for whom a situation of precariousness and social vulnerability is proved true, justifying the earlier orientation towards the social worker of the Center so allowing a "global" care of the patient during the second visit</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Pain and Social Vulnerability: Prevalence and Predictive Factors of the Social Vulnerability in Evaluation and Treatment of the Pain Center (CETD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This national study is the first study on the chronic pain and the social vulnerability, as well at the level national as international because at this day there is no international publication dealing with this problem which begins to emerge in the structures setting in charge of the patients suffering of chronic pain. A recent article (Denk and al, on 2014) underlines the importance to look for the predictive factors of the chronic pain. This epidemiological study of prevalence of the social vulnerability even of the precariousness as well as predictive factors of this circumstance will allow to identify the patients with risk in a earlier way and to refer them as soon as possible for a support in the social domain. In a completely empirical way we notice important obstacles of psychosocial and societal order during the therapeutic care of the patients. This study will allow to bring important information on a troop about one thousand patients distributed on the French CETD.</detailed_description>
