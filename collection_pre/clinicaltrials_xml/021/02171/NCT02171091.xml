	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine how cell changes during endotracheal intubation and artificial lung ventilation affect lung inflammation. Patients will undergo placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) as standard of care. Tracheal (windpipe) lavage will be obtained each day for up to 72 hours. Lung samples or fiberoptic (lung) samples will be collected at the same time intervals when possible and if they are done as standard of care. Blood samples will be obtained simultaneous with the collection of the trachael (windpipe) specimens.</brief_summary>
