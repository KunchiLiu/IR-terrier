	<brief_summary>In the aftermath of natural disasters, e.g., flood disasters, there is a great need for humanitarian assistance in the domain of psychological support. This is particularly true in post-conflict settings because people have suffered severely from multiple traumatic events and situations during their lives. The Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is a short-term, culturally sensitive treatment approach that aims to reduce Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The investigators want to provide evidence, that NET is an effective and efficient module to assist people in the aftermath of natural disasters using the example of the recent flood disaster in Burundi. In addition the investigators aim to explore, how traumatic incidences and maltreatment during childhood may influence treatment outcomes.</brief_summary>
