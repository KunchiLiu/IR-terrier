	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy using decidual stromal cell therapy for graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The hypothesis to be tested is that the cells are safe to infuse and that they have a positive clinical effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Using Placenta Derived Decidual Stromal Cells for Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with GVHD grade 2-4, will receive decidual stromal cells at approximately 1x10^6 cells/kg at one or more occasions at weekly intervals dependent on clinical response.</detailed_description>
