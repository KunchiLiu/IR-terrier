	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective clinical trial will be to evaluate the efficacy of an FDA approved and marketed universal dental adhesive formulation in adult noncarious cervical lesions using self-etch and selective etch approaches. The hypothesis is that using a selective enamel etch with this universal adhesive will enhance the restoration margin performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of a Universal Adhesive in Noncarious Cervical Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective clinical trial will be to evaluate the efficacy of a newly formulated universal dental adhesive formulation in adult noncarious cervical lesions using self-etch and selective etch approaches. Thirty-three patients with at least two non-carious cervical lesions will receive one restoration utilizing the self-etch universal adhesive with no separate enamel etching and another restoration utilizing the universal adhesive and a a selective etch protocol in which in which enamel is etched with 37% phosphoric acid. After a screening/baseline visit at which the restorative procedures listed above will conducted, the patient will be seen at recall visits after approximately 6, 12 and 24 months to observe sensitivity, retention, marginal discoloration and marginal adaptation.</detailed_description>
