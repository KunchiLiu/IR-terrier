	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Laparoscopic staging may help doctors plan more effective treatment for gastric cancer, yet the efficiency have not been fully investigated in Chinese people. PURPOSE: Study the effectiveness of laparoscopic staging in patients with pre-diagnosed as locally advanced gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Staging for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer in Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of laparoscopic staging of patients with pre-diagnosed as locally advanced gastric cancer. II. Assess the adverse effects associated with this technique. OUTLINE: Surgery. Laparoscopy with cytologic examination. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 450 patients will be accrued over approximately 2 years.</detailed_description>
