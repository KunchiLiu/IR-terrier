	<brief_summary>Controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of manual therapy techniques for the management of impingement syndrome. However, no adequately powered clinical trials have examined the effects of mobilization-with-movement. The purpose of the current study was to perform a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of real MWM to a group receiving a sham intervention on shoulder pain at different moments and active shoulder range of motion in an adequately powered sample of patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.</brief_summary>
