	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a chronic dose of a tryptophan-rich protein drink (lumiVida™) can improve cognitive function, emotional processing and sleep in middle-aged women. In addition, also genetic predictors of susceptibility to an increase of Trp levels will be investigated. lumiVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. The investigators do not claim that this supplement is meant to treat any ailment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment conditions are either placebo or lumiVida™ (N=30 per group) 0.5 g twice a day (total 1 g/ day). The first testing took place on the screening day (baseline). Subsequently, participants were supplied with supplements for 19 days intervention (sachets which had to be dissolved in 200-ml water). After 19 days, participants were tested again (same tests as on the baseline day). An additional facet was the completion of a 'sleep diary', which asks questions about sleep quality and latency, and bed-time mood, as well as allowing recording of timing of supplement taking.</detailed_description>
