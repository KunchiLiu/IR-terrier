	<brief_summary>The objectives were to collect information on vital status and pulmonary medication use at the predicted exit date for patients who participated in two one-year trials and withdrew prematurely. The primary objective was to ascertain the vital status (dead or alive) of these patients in the time interval between the patients' withdrawal from the trial and their predicted exit date (i.e: 48 weeks from first intake of randomised treatment + 30 days). The secondary objective was to collect information on classes of pulmonary medication and some other specified pulmonary interventions used by these prematurely discontinued patients at the time of their predicted exit date (i.e 48 weeks from the first intake of randomised treatment + 30 days) or at date of death (if this occurred during the time interval of interest, i.e 48 weeks from the first intake of randomised treatment + 30 days).</brief_summary>
