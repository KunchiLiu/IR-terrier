	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, phase 3 extension study will investigate the safety and efficacy of rVIII‑SingleChain for prophylaxis and on‑demand treatment of bleeding episodes in at least 200 previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe congenital hemophilia A and previous exposure to FVIII products who achieve at least 100 exposure days (EDs) to rVIII-SingleChain in this study, as well as in at least 50 previously untreated patients (PUPs) with no previous exposure to any FVIII product who achieve at least 50 EDs to rVIII-SingleChain in this study. A substudy (open to both PTPs and PUPs) will investigate the use of rVIII-SingleChain in surgery.</brief_summary>
