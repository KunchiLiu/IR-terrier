	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy using placenta derived decidual stromal cell therapy for hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. It is hypothesized that the decidual stromal cell therapy is safe to infuse and that they have a positive clinical effect.</brief_summary>
