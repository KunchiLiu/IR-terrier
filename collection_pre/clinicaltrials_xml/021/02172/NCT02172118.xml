A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator put the patient at risk because of participation in the study may influence the results of the study may influence the patient's ability to participate in the study is not in a stable condition Diabetic or hypertensive patients can be entered in this trial if the disease is not significant according to these criteria. Relevant gastrointestinal tract surgery (except appendectomy, herniotomy) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy, seizures) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections (e.g. including Hepatitis B and C and HIV) History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergies) that are deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial, excluded are those drugs, the patient is currently taking for treatment of the renal or concomitant disease Subjects with a change of their chronic medication less than 4 weeks prior to dosing Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within one month after previous single dose administration or two months after previous multiple dose administration prior to administration or during the trial Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day) Inability to refrain from smoking when confined to the study site on trial days Alcohol abuse (more than 40 g/day in males, more than 20 g/day in females) Drug abuse, in the investigator's judgement upon review of the patient's history and urine screening for abused substances Veins unsuited for iv puncture on either arm (e.g. veins which are difficult to locate, access or puncture, veins with a tendency to rupture during or after puncture) Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) Excessive physical activities (within 48 hours prior to trial or during the trial) Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities (except for renal function tests or deviations of clinical laboratory values that are related to renal impairment) Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL indicating severe renal anemia (use of erythropoetin is allowed to maintain hematocrit) Inability to comply with dietary regimen of study centre Subjects not able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 or &gt; 180 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 or &gt; 110 mm Hg, pulse rate &lt; 50 or &gt; 100 1/min Exclusion criteria specific for this study due to the known class side effect profile of ß2 mimetics (healthy or renally impaired subjects): Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity Hyperthyrosis Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment Clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia For female subjects (healthy or renally impaired): Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant within 2 months of study completion Positive pregnancy test No adequate contraception in women of childbearing potential (adequate contraception: e.g. sterilisation, intrauterine device or oral contraception not containing ethinyl estradiol or ethinyl estradiol with an additional barrier method) for at least 3 months prior to participation in the study Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole trial period Lactation period</criteria>
