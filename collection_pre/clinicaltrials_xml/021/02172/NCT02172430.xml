	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the long-term safety of Ba 79 BR (tiotropium) powder inhalation in patients with COPD using oxitropium bromide (Tersigan) as a comparator. Secondarily, the long-term efficacy of Ba 679 BR is also investigated</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patients with COPD (chronic bronchitis, emphysema) whose symptoms are stable and who satisfy the following criteria 1. Patients with FEV1.0 of &lt;=70% of predicted normal and FEV1.0/FVC of &lt;=70% in the screening test (The FEV1.0 value should also be &lt;=70% of predicted normal on the starting day of administration (visit 2).) 2. Patients with a smoking history (&lt;number of cigarettes smoked a day x number of smoking years&gt; is &gt;=200.) 3. Male or female patients aged &gt;=40 years old 1. Patients complicated with bronchial asthma, making the assessment of drug efficacy against COPD difficult 2. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at a dose in excess of the equivalent 10 mg/day of prednisolon 3. Patients with glaucoma 4. Patients with symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy 5. Patients with hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs or powder inhalants 6. Patients with serious complication who are judged by the investigator to be inappropriate as the subjects of study 7. Patients demonstrating clinically problematic abnormal laboratory test values (general blood test, biochemical test, urinalysis). Those showing Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (GOT) and Glutamic PyruvicTransaminase (GPT) twice the upper limit of the normal range, bilirubin 1.25 times or creatinine 1.25 times of the upper limit of normal range are excluded. 8. Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or heart failure (i.e. within 3 months before the screening test) 9. Patients with arrhythmia requiring the treatment with drugs 10. Patients for whom the concomitant use of betablocker cannot be prohibited. 11. Patients who began treatment with an ACE inhibitor within 1 month before the screening test 12. Patients with tuberculosis (currently active) or with definite sequela of tuberculosis 13. Patients with a recent history of carcinoma (excluding basal cell carcinoma) (i.e. within the past 5 years) 14. Patients with a history of cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis 15. Patients with recent onset of upper airway infection (i.e. within 1 month before the screening test) 16. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or within period six times of halflives of that drug (whichever is longer) before the screening test. 17. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, or those breast feeding 18. Other than above, those who are judged by the investigator to be inappropriate as the subjects of study</criteria>
