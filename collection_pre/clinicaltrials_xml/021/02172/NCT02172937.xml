	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy using decidual stromal cell therapy for graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The hypothesis to be tested is that the cells are safe to infuse and that they have a positive clinical effect.</brief_summary>
