Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the local legislation 1. Any finding of the medical examination including ((blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance 2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease 3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 4. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) 5. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders 6.

History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) 9. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial 10. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial 12. Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day) 13.

Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 19. Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of trial site 20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g. repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms); 21. A history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g. heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome); Exclusion criteria specific for this study: 22.
