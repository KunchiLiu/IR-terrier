	<brief_summary>Study to assess the efficacy of telmisartan 40-80 mg once daily compared with losartan 50-100 mg once daily in hypertensive patients evaluated by change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval, at the end of the 12 weeks period of monotherapy treatment (ABPM - ambulatory blood pressure measurement). Secondary objectives: Changes from baseline in BP at the end of the monotherapy period of treatment and at the end of the study, evaluated by sphygmomanometric blood pressure measurement and ABPM Safety: Incidence of adverse events (AE's); withdrawal due to adverse events; laboratory parameters</brief_summary>
