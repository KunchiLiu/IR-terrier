	<brief_title>The Effect of BIA 2-093 on the Steady-state Pharmacokinetics of Digoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single centre, multiple-dose, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. The study consisted of two 8-day treatment periods separated by a washout of 10 or more days. During each of the treatment periods the volunteers received either a daily oral dose of BIA 2-093 1200 mg once-daily (od) or matching placebo, concomitantly with a dose of digoxin (days 1 and 2: loading dose of 0.5 mg/day; days 3 to 8: 0.25 mg/day).</detailed_description>
