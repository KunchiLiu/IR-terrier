	<brief_summary>The concept of Fast-trak or Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS) represents a new approach to the management of patients undergoing major surgery that re-examine traditional practices, replacing them if necessary with the best evidence based practices, creating a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery. In Colorectal Cancer Surgery , as well as in a number of other procedures it has been shown to reduce Hospitalization by more than 30% without increasing the rate complications or readmissions. However information on the results of Fast-track protocols when applied to Gynecological patients is sparse, being especially notorious the lack of data regarding the efficacy of Fast-track in the management of Advanced Gynecological cancer. Hypothesis: the application of a Fast-Track protocol in the management of patients with advanced Ovarian Cancer( Stage III, IV and relapses) may improve the postoperatory recovery of these patients allowing for an early discharge and significant cost reduction, when compared with de usual management, without increasing the number readmission or surgery related complications.</brief_summary>
