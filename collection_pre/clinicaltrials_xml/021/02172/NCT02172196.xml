	<brief_summary>The objective was to investigate whether there was a drug-drug interaction between BI 10773 and sitagliptin when co-administered as multiple oral doses. Therefore, the relative bioavailabilities of BI 10773 and sitagliptin were determined when both drugs were given in combination compared with BI 10773 or sitagliptin given alone.</brief_summary>
