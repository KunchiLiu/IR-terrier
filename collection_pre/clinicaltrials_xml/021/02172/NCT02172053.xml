	<brief_summary>Studies show that exercise resistance in workplace can reduce the symptoms of induced labor, however, the effectiveness of such programs depends on the characteristics of the training fatigue. Thus, it is expected that this study the intervention group with training heavy using progressive resistance exercise protocol will be better in reducing fatigue when compare with light training group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Exercise to Improve Fatigue in Workplace (REW)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: This study is randomized clinical trial with double-blinded. The aim is evaluate the effectiveness the training heavy with resistance exercise program in the muscle fatigue control. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial by cluster, in which workers who participate in the intervention group will perform resistance exercise protocols; and workers in the comparative group held only stretching exercises and light resistance training with elastic bands. Expected results: strong evidence that fatigue reducing after ten weeks in workers and improve in others outcomes. Not found in literature studies in occupational evaluating this aspect of training.</detailed_description>
