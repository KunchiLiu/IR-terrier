	<criteria>for healthy subjects and COPD patients: Males or females 40 years of age or older. Subjects/Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHalerTM Subjects/Patients must be able to perform all studyrelated tests including acceptable pulmonary function tests, and must be able to maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol. All subjects/patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial in accordance with ICHGCP and the local legislation, i.e., the COPD patients must give written informed consent prior to prestudy washout of their usual pulmonary medications. for healthy subjects: Normal spirometry as evidenced by a baseline FEV1 ≥ 80 % of predicted normal value for age, height and sex, and FEV1 ≥ 70% of FVC Lifelong nonsmokers or exsmokers with a nonsmoking period of at least five years and a maximum of five packyears. for COPD patients: All patients must have a diagnosis of relatively stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and must fulfil the spirometric criteria of the respective subgroup: Mild COPD: 50% ≤ FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted normal; FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%. Moderate COPD: 35% ≤ FEV1 &lt; 50% of predicted normal; FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%. Severe COPD: FEV1 &lt; 35% of predicted normal; FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%. for healthy subjects and COPD patients: Subjects or patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will be excluded. All subjects/patients with serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L, serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL or creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL will be excluded regardless of clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will not be conducted in these subjects/patients. Subjects/Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction. Subjects/Patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy or who have been hospitalised for heart failure within the past three years. Subjects/Patients with known active tuberculosis. Subjects/Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Subjects/Patients with a history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis. Subjects/Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with any upper respiratory infection in the past six weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the runin period Subjects/Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other components of the inhalation capsule delivery system Subjects/Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Subjects/Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma. Subjects/Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600 mm3. A repeat eosinophil count will not be conducted in these subjects/patients. Subjects/Patients with a history of and/or active significant alcohol or drug abuse. Subjects/Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (whichever is shorter) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1). In addition, for female subjects/patients: Pregnancy. Positive pregnancy test. No adequate contraception, e.g. oral contraceptives, sterilisation, intra uterine device (IUD). Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period. Lactation period. for healthy subjects: Subjects with any significant disease will be excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study. Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial (within one week prior to administration or during the trial). for COPD patients: Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study. COPD patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than one hour per day and in the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme or who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation programme in the six week prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) Patients who are being treated with oral beta adrenergics or longacting beta adrenergics such as salmeterol and formoterol. Patients who are being treated with beta blockers. Patients who are being treated with antileukotrienes. Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium. Patients who are being treated with antihistamines (H1receptor antagonists). Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than four weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisolone per day or 20 mg every other day. Patients who are being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Patients with no adequate washout period of those medications specified in Section 4.2.2 of the study protocol.</criteria>
