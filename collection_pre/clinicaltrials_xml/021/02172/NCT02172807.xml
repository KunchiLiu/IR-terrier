	<criteria>Diagnosis of COPD (chronic bronchitis, and emphysema) with stable symptoms: Screening FEV1.0 ≤70% of predicted normal vale and screening FEV1.0/FVC ≤70% (the baseline FEV1.0 should also be ≤70% of predicted normal value on the initial day of administration) Smoking history ≥ 10 packyears (a peakyear is 20 cigarettes per day for one year or equivalent) Male or female patients 40 years of age or older History of bronchial asthma History of an atopic disease such as allergic rhinitis Total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/µL Patient treated with antiallergic drugs or antihistamine drugs Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e. less than one month on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisolone per day Patients using inhaled steroid, oral β2 stimulant, theophylline preparation, expectorant or macrolide antibiotic at unstable doses (i.e. less than one month on a stable dose) Patients using an ACE inhibitor at unstable doses (i.e. less than one month on a stable dose) Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other components of the inhalation capsule delivery system Patients with significant diseases who in the opinion of the investigator were not eligible for the study Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory test values (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis). Patients with serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (SGPT) twice the upper limit of the normal range, bilirubin 150% or creatinine 125% of the upper limit of the normal range were excluded Patients with a recent history (i.e. within the 3 months prior to the screening visit) of myocardial infarction or heart failure Patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy Patients who were treated with Patients who were treated with βblockersblockers Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy Patients with known active tuberculosis or with obvious sequela of tuberculosis Patients with a history of cancer within the last 5 years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma were allowed Patients with a history of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis Patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the past one month prior to the screening visit or during the baseline period Patients who had taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (whichever is greater) prior to the screening visit Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential Other than the above, patients who in the opinion of the investigator were not eligible for the study</criteria>
