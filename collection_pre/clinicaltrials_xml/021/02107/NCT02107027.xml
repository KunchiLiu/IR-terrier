	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare two type of ablation catheters for pulmonary veins isolation (PVI) in subjects with atrial fibrillation. Currently, two technologies of irrigated ablation catheters are available for PVI. One of the two, the "conventional" catheter is widely used for atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment but has not been specifically created for pulmonary veins isolation, therefore, point by point encircling lesions are cumbersome and time consuming. The second is a new ablation catheter with a circular shape provided with 10 irrigated electrodes designed to create encircling lesions, necessary to obtain pulmonary veins isolation, could allow an easier and faster isolation compared to the conventional way. These two types of catheters have never been compared for atrial fibrillation. If one of the two catheters appears to be more efficient or causes fewer complications, the use of this catheter could be favored to conduct AF ablation.</brief_summary>
