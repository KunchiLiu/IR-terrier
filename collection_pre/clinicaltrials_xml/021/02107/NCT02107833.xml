Subjects will receive once daily oral administrations of OPRX-106 for 5 consecutive days. Subjects will remain at the clinical center for 24 hours after the first administration (Day 1) of OPRX-106 including PK sampling and then return to the site daily for additional administrations and study procedures.</brief_summary>
