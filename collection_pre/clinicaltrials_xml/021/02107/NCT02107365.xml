	<brief_summary>Success rates, after retreatment with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin bitherapy, in patients infected with HCV (hepatitis C virus) genotype 4 and non-responders to a first standard treatment, are disappointing. The association of Asunaprevir and Daclatasvir in combination with the standard-of-care bitherapy has been shown to increase the efficacy of the treatment in non-responders genotype 1-infected patients. Given the absence of current solutions and urgent therapeutic needs for HCV genotype 4-infected patients previously treated with pegylated Interferon/Ribavirin, this pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a quadritherapy associating Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir, pegylated Interferon alpha-2a and Ribavirin, in this very difficult to treat population. 60 subjects will be enrolled. The primary endpoint will be the rate of sustained virological response (SVR), defined by an undetectable HCV RNA, at Week 36 (12 weeks after the end of a 24 weeks quadritherapy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy With Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir, Ribavirin and Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2a in HCV Genotype 4-infected Patients Who Have Failed to a Previous Therapy With Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin (ANRS HC32 QUATTRO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population studied presents the maximum of factors of non-response to the retreatment of hepatitis C: non-response to well followed prior treatment with pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin, infection with HCV genotype 4, and the presence of cirrhosis (in less than 50% of the included patients) that could diminish the chances of SVR to a standard bitherapy. The likelihood of SVR with standard bitherapy in this study population is thus considered low, around 15%. The principal objective of this multicentric, national, single-arm, open-labeled, non-randomized phase II pilot study in 60 patients, is to assess the rate of SVR 12 weeks after 24 weeks of quadritherapy and to determine whether this rate is significantly greater than 20%. The proportion of patients presenting with cirrhosis (defined by a METAVIR F4 score on liver biopsy or with hepatic impulse elastometry ≥ 15 kPa) will be limited to 50% of all patients included.</detailed_description>

Patients included in a programme of substitution with methadone or buprenorphine could be included. The opinion of a consultant in addictology is recommended for patients presenting with current drug use or drug use in the past year.

A psychiatrist's opinion is compulsory in the following situations : history of psychiatric disorders requiring hospitalisation of the patient or a consultation with a specialist treatment with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics during the previous year history of psychiatric disorders during prior treatment with Interferon alpha evidence of depression episodes, a risk of suicide, bipolar disorder and/or current behavioral disorders. These patients can only be included after a psychiatric evaluation that specifically authorizes the use of Interferon.
