	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the influence of adjusting the pH of lidocaine on pain during subcutaneous injection. Each participant will receive two injections on the abdomen with different pH. After each injection, the subject will be asked to evaluate the pain on a Visual analog scale (0-100 mm). It is anticipated that the pain decreases with increasing pH. The aim of the study is to find a simple method for pain reduction that can be used in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
