	<brief_summary>This study assesses the specificity of DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA versus standard reference tests (e.g. PCR or viral culture) for dengue diagnosis in the US. DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of early stages of Dengue infection in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with Dengue infection. This test is intended to be used on sera obtained within the first 7 days of symptoms. DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA and rapid test results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing with a reference standard test. This study will use archived, leftover human serum samples that have been sequentially collected from areas non-endemic for Dengue infection. Each specimen must have been collected within the first 7 days of symptoms, and must be accompanied by clinical data demonstrating that the individual had symptoms consistent with Dengue infection. The samples will have no personally identifiable information. ELISAs and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples from each method independently.</brief_summary>
