	<criteria>Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study Age 18 ≤ x ≤ 65 years and currently employed at the baseline study visit Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) o Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is present: Current regular use of insulin for treatment of diabetes Current regular use of oral antihyperglycemia agent for the treatment of diabetes Clinical evidence of retinal thickening due to macular edema involving the center of the macula, associated with diabetic retinopathy. Central diabetic macular edema present on clinical examination or or evidence indicating disease activity on spectral domain OCT. Visual acuity score greater than or equal to 19 letters (20/400) and less than or equal to 73 letters (20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity protocol. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow OCT testing and retinal photography Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or known to be pregnant; also premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. Participation in another ocular investigation or trial simultaneously Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110) Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study (e.g. chronic alcoholism, drug abuse) Evidence of vitreoretinal interface abnormality after ocular exam or OCT that may be contributing to the macular edema An eye that, in the investigator's opinion, has no chance of improving in visual acuity following resolution of macular edema (e.g. presence of subretinal fibrosis or geographic atrophy) Presence of another ocular condition that may affect the visual acuity or macular edema during the course of the study (e.g. AMD, uveitis, IrvineGas) Evidence of active neovascularization of the iris or retina Evidence of central atrophy or fibrosis in the study eye Presence of substantial cataract, one that might decrease the vision by 3 or more lines of vision at sometime during the study. Previous use of intraocular or periocular corticosteroids in the study eye in the previous 120 days Previous treatment with antiangiogenic drugs in the study eye i.e. pegaptanib sodium, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept within 120 days prior to baseline History of vitreous surgery in the study eye History of cataract surgery within 3 months of enrollment. History of YAG capsulotomy within 2 months of enrollment. Visual acuity &lt;20/400 in the fellow eye Uncontrolled glaucoma (pressure &gt;30) despite treatment with glaucoma medications. History of cerebral vascular accident or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to Day 0.</criteria>
