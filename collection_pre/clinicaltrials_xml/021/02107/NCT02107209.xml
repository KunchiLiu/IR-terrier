	<brief_summary>The clinical utility of bronchoscopic methods for achieving lung volume reduction has been evaluated in patients with advanced emphysema because these procedures are uniformly safer than surgical volume reduction. These include one-way valves, or bronchial occlusive devices to collapse emphysematous regions of lung and bronchial fenestration with bypass stents to improve expiratory flow, wire coils implants that compress the airway and thermal vapor ablation that causes an acute injury with subsequent fibrosis and reductions in volume.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Biologic lung volume reduction (BioLVR): it is a novel endobronchial approach, which uses a Biological agents aiming to reduce lung volume by blocking off the most emphysematous areas with a rapidly polymerizing sealant. The mechanism of action involves resorption atelectasis from airway occlusion, subsequent airspace inflammation, and then remodeling. This remodeling will lead to scarring that induces contraction of lung parenchyma and functional volume reduction can be expected within 6-8 weeks. Biological lung volume reduction occurs independent of the presence or absence of collateral ventilation.</detailed_description>
