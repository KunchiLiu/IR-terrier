	<brief_summary>Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition defined as urgency with or without incontinence usually associated with frequency and nocturia. It is a common condition affecting 15-45% of adults and constitutes a significant proportion of patients attending urogynaecology clinics. OAB is known to have a significant impact on the physical, social and emotional quality of life and sexual function in women. The treatment of OAB is initially conservative with bladder training followed by pharmacotherapy. Evidence from a recent Cochrane review on treatment of OAB suggests that the efficacy of anticholinergics in treatment of OAB is enhanced when combined with BT. Women who fail to improve with these initial measures are offered Intravesical Botox or neuromodulation in the form of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) or Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS). PTNS has also been shown to more effective than pharmacotherapy with anticholinergics. In 2010 National Institute of Clinical Excellences (NICE) issued guidance stating '"PTNS for OAB demonstrates effectiveness without major safety concerns" We hypothesise that the outcome of PTNS will improve if the PTNS sessions are combined with bladder training (BT).</brief_summary>
