	<brief_summary>A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial to Determine Safety and Efficacy of Pump Assisted Lung Protection (PALP™) for Low Flow Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Removal in Conjunction with Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation Compared to Mechanical Ventilation Alone in Patients with COPD Exacerbation and Respiratory Failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PALP™-COPD Trial (Low-Flow CO2-Removal (ECCO2-R) in Exacerbated COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Study Objectives • To evaluate the clinical effect of PALP™ in reducing the time on invasive ventilation in patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary Study Objectives - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PALP™ in patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. - To determine if rates of adverse events (AEs) are reduced in patients who receive PALP™ and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone. - To determine mortality rates in patients who receive PALP™ and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone. - To determine if PALP™ will effectively reduce the number of subsequent acute decompensations requiring hospital admission for ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive).</detailed_description>

Any legally authorized document(s) that may restrict aggressive medical management such as "Do Not Resuscitate," "Do Not Intubate," etc. 6. Risk of bleeding or clotting such as: Known bleeding diathesis or abnormal clotting Recent or current use of medications known to increase risk of bleeding 7. Screening platelet count of &lt;75,000/mm3 or international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) range for their respective laboratory values 8. Any recognized contra indications to systemic anticoagulation therapy or use of heparin 9. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 10. Any form of chronic hyperventilation not related to COPD 11. Hemodynamic instability or requiring significant vasopressor support 12. Cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema as the primary reason for respiratory failure 13. High risk cardiac conditions 14. Oxygen tension in arterial blood (PaO2) &lt;50 mmHg via arterial blood gas (ABG) or any condition in which hypoxemia is a significant component of the respiratory failure 15. Any other medical cause for acute respiratory failure not directly related to a COPD exacerbation 16. Use of or treatment with an investigational drug, therapy, or device within 1 month (30 days) of baseline 17. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding 18. Patients who are immunocompromised 19. Current active malignancy or history of malignancy within the past 5 years 20. Patients in chronic dialysis 21. Patients requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS) as a bridge to transplant 22. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, would not be able to comply with the requirements of the study</criteria>
