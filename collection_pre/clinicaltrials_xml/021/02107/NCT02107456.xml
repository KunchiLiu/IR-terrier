	<brief_summary>Myofascial trigger point is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal disorders. Myofascial trigger point in upper trapezius has been reported as a symptom in patients with neck and upper thoracic pain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prolonged effect of dry needling on myofascial trigger point in upper trapezius muscle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dry Needling on Myofascial Trigger Point</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain intensity and Disability of arm, hand and shoulder (DASH) were collected at base line and at the end of treatment sessions, two weeks and three months follow up in both groups.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Presence of a palpable taut band in muscle. 2. Presence of a hypersensitive tender spot in the taut band. 3. Reproduction of the typical referred pain pattern of the MTP in response to compression. To detect active TrPs, TrP pressure tolerance was assessed using a mechanical pressure algometer. The investigator applied continuous pressure with the algometer with an approximate pressure of 2.5 kg/cm2. 4. Spontaneous presence of the typical referred pain pattern and/or patient recognition of the referred pain as familiar. 5 Pain of at least 30 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The selected MTP of the UT muscle was located in the middle of the more nearly horizontal fibers of the UT 40. had a history of fibromyalgia syndrome, whiplash injury, cervical spine surgery and fracture, cervical radiculopathy, having therapy within the past month before the study any systematic disease such as rheumatism and tuberculosis or cervical myelopathy, multiple sclerosis local infection, pregnancy taking anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) longterm steroid using</criteria>
