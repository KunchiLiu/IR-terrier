	<brief_title>Randomized Crossover Study to Test the Impact of Using a Software for Smartphones and Tablets in Treating Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis underlying this project, is that most calculations necessary for flexible intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes in children can be performed using software installed on a smartphone or tablet that nowadays is carried by most parents and children. Smartphones and tablets can easily communicate with each other and with a desktop computer via the Internet, thereby permitting the exchange of information such as blood glucose values or types of meals among family members and physicians. Finally, software collecting blood glucose values and merging values obtained on different devices easily permits reviewing these values by the patient and sending them to the physician's office, thereby avoiding consultations during which no blood glucose values are brought by the patient. We hypothesize that the Webdia software, that will be tested in this randomized crossover study, will increase treatment compliance and therefore will improve diabetes self-management. We believe, the software will facilitate the adaptation of insulin schemes by physicians and therefore will lead to improved HbA1C values. We also think that this software will improve the patient's quality of life.</detailed_description>
