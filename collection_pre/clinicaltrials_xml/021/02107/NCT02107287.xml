	<brief_summary>Considering the promising results with hypofractionated in low and intermediate risk prostate cancer, our proposal is to translate this experience to patients with high risk prostate cancer. Patients with high risk disease would receive hypofractionated RT to the prostate and to the external and internal iliac lymph nodes using IMRT plus long-term hormonal therapy. The objective of the study is to show that long term grade&gt;2 late toxicity is acceptable and similar to published data using hypofractionated technique in the prostate only.</brief_summary>
