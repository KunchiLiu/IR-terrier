Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory values that could interfere with the objectives of the study or compromise the safety of the subject. Presence or history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to) liver or kidney disease, hypertension, seizures, or any known impairment of endocrine, or other specific bodyorgan dysfunction. History of serious reaction to any medicine. Presence or history of malignant disease. Acute or chronic infectious disease, including HIV, HBV or HCV infection.

Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription medicine within the previous 3 months, or unwilling to abstain from participating in other clinical trials during the study and for 3 months after receipt of trial medication. Abnormal ECG waveform morphology at screening that would preclude accurate measurement of the QT interval duration. QTcF interval duration &gt; 430 msec, obtained as an average from the 3 ECG measurements on the triplicate screening ECGs. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73m^2MDRD] equation). Use of any prescription or OTC medications known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP enzymes (also known as CYP P450 enzymes) during the 30 days before the dose of trial medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine including vitamins or herbal remedies like St John's wort, with the exception of acetaminophen (paracetamol), during the 7 days before the dose of trial medication.
