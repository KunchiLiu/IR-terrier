	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the influence of lidocaine temperature on pain during injection of lidocaine. Each participant will receive three injections subcutaneously on the abdomen with different temperatures. After each injection, participants will be asked to evaluate the pain on a Visual analog scale (0-100 mm). It is anticipated that the pain decreases with increasing temperature. The aim of the study is to find a simple method for pain reduction that can be used in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
