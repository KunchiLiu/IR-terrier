	<brief_summary>There are two primary objectives to be addressed in this study: to assess the differential response in bioavailability and metabolic pathways between lean and obese individuals exposed to acute, short term (14 day), and long-term (10-week) consumption of polyphenol-rich fruits (berries and apple), and beverages (tea); and to determine the differential systemic and gut anti-inflammatory response between obese and lean individuals exposed to polyphenol-rich fruits (berries and apple), and beverages (tea).</brief_summary>
