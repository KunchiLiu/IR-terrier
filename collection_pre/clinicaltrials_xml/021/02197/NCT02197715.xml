	<brief_summary>This study will develop and initially evaluate Sex and Female Empowerment (SAFE), an intervention designed to increase acceptance of and adherence to contraceptive practices among opioid-agonist-maintained women of childbearing age. The intervention will be delivered in one of two formats: a face-to-face brief intervention approach or a novel computer-adaptive platform. To the extent that either version of SAFE is found to be efficacious compared with usual care, it has the potential to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and consequently decrease the need for and the costs of child protective services.</brief_summary>
