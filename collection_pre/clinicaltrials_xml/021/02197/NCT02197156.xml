	<criteria>Subject was able to read and voluntarily sign the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, written informed consent document and given the opportunity to ask questions regarding the study prior to the performance of any study specific procedures. Subject required primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery with or without hammertoe repair with no other collateral procedures allowed Subject was male or female at least 18 years of age. Subject weighed &gt; or = 100 lbs (pounds). Subject was willing and able to comply with the protocol and able to score their pain intensity. Subject was in good health as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and screening laboratory results. Subject had not developed a condition or complications as result of the bunionectomy procedure that would preclude their participation in the study. Subject was willing and able to remain at the recovery day care center for the entire 24hour Treatment period. Subject was pregnant or lactating. Subject had been on an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initiation of study drug. Subject had donated blood or blood components within one month prior to study (Checkin). Subject had a know allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids, acetaminophen, and/or ketorolac. Subject had a known history of substance or alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to Screening. Subject tested positive to drug screens (cocaine, marijuana, opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates) that could not be justified by prescription use. Subject had a condition that would contraindicate the use of opioid analgesia (e.g., pulmonary disease or paralytic ileus). Subject had received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) carbamazepine, quinidine, and/or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compounds within 1month prior to Checkin. Subject had received opioids, tranquilizers, sedatives, or hypnotics within 48 hours prior to Checkin. Subject had received corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other analgesics within 24 hours prior to Checkin.</criteria>
