	<brief_summary>The goal is to better understand the social needs of a population seeking care in a large, urban children's hospital emergency department with a large Medicaid population. Consenting English and Spanish-speaking adult caregivers will be randomized to social screening via a face -to-face interview with a trained bilingual researcher or via a self-completed tablet-based survey. We hypothesize that there will be no difference in disclosure rates between the two screening formats for items other than highly sensitive items. For highly sensitive items we hypothesize disclosure rates will be higher for the self-completed tablet-based survey.</brief_summary>
