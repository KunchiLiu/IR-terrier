	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the significance of KL-6 as a biomarker in the clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) by detecting serum KL-6 levels among patients with ILD, and comparing them to the clinical diagnostic criteria and other respiratory diseases. In addition, the study discusses the value of KL-6 levels in terms of ILD treatment effect evaluation through the detection of serum KL-6 levels before treatment and after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As a multi-center, double-blind clinical study, the trial is divided into two parts. Part 1: The purpose of this part is to evaluate the role of KL-6 as a biomarker in the clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) by detecting serum KL-6 levels among patients with ILD, and comparing them to the clinical diagnostic criteria and other respiratory diseases, including pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and healthy control group. Part 2: The purpose of this part is to study the value of KL-6 levels in terms of ILD treatment effect evaluation through the detection of serum KL-6 levels before treatment and 30-90 days after treatment. Treatment includes anti fibrosis, anti-inflammatory and other conventional therapies.</detailed_description>
