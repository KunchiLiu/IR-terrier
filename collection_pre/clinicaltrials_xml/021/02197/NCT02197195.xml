	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to understand the role chocolate milk compared to a fruit drink, with and without exercise, on glycaemic regulation and subjective appetite in children. The investigators hypothesize that chocolate milk in combination with exercise will have the greatest effect attenuating glycaemic response. Blood glucose will be measured by finger prick following drink consumption (0 min) and exercise or sitting (15 min), and at 65 minutes. Subjective appetite will be measured at 0, 20, 35, 50 and 65 minutes.</brief_summary>
