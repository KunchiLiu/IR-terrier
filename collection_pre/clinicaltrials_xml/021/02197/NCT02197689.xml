	<brief_summary>Taiwan has attracted much attention for its National Health Insurance (NHI) and healthcare system around the world with many countries in Europe and the United States using it as a benchmark. However, increasing medication costs over the past two years account for more than 25% of total expenditure, surpassing every OECD member and mounting increasing pressure on the NHI. Nevertheless, patient medication adherence is relatively low. Thus, the investigators assessed the effectiveness of a personalized medication management system for improving the medication adherence for patients, in order to save long term medication costs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial for a Personalized Medication Management Platform to Improve Medication Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design, Setting and Patients: The investigators developed a mobile personalized medication management platform (PMMP) to reduce delayed and missed medications. The investigators conducted a randomized control trial in medical centers of northern Taiwan from January 2010 to July 2012 using 1198 participants that missed or delayed their medications during past three days. They received a minimum 7-day to 14-day maximum medication prescription. Interventions: Patients were randomized into a control group which non-received any SMS reminder for medication using and an intervention group which received a SMS reminder everyday in mobile devices. Primary Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcomes were compared patient medication adherence among experimental and control groups.</detailed_description>
