	<brief_summary>The two specific aims of this study are: 1) to assess the impact of a genetic variant on iron status; 2) to assess the impact of a genetic variant on non-heme absorption among Asian women. The investigators hypothesize that the genetic variant could enhance iron status and iron absorption in Asian women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Variants and Iron Absorption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the HFE genotype of female Asian study volunteers, we collected venous blood samples and extracted DNA from these blood samples. HFE genotype was determined as CC, CT, and TT and used to assess possible differences in iron status as a function of genotype. To measure the impact of genotype on non-heme Fe absorption, a sub-group of women with the CC (n=10) or TT (n=11) genotype were invited to return for an Fe absorption study. Each volunteer consumed stable 57Fe (as ferrous sulfate). Two weeks after ingesting this tracer, a blood sample was collected from each woman and the amount of non-heme (57Fe) iron incorporated into red blood cells was measured with magnetic sector thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Possible associations between iron status and iron absorption as a function of genotypes were explored. Data from this study will provide information that aims to improve human health by better understanding the iron requirements of individuals with different genetic background.</detailed_description>
