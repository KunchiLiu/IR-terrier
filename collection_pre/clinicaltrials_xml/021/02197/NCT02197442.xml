	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Valsartan 320mg Tablets Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tablet in healthy, adult human subjects under fasting condition, with a screening period of 28 days prior to dose administration in Period-I. In each study period, twenty-four (24) blood samples, including two (02) predose blood samples, each of 02 mL were collected from each subject except for the discontinued / withdrawn subjects to analyze the pharmacokinetic profile of the test as well as the reference product. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the drug concentration vs. time profile by non-compartmental model using WinNonlin Professional Software-Version 5.3 (Pharsight Corporation, USA) for Valsartan. Statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two formulations was carried out using PROC MIXED of SAS® Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) to assess the bioequivalence of both the formulations.</detailed_description>
