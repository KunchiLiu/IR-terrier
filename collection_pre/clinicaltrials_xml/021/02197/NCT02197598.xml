	<criteria>The patient has alcohol dependence, diagnosed at screening according to DSMIVTR™ The patient has had an average alcohol consumption at, at least, a high drinking risk level (that is &gt;60 g of alcohol/day for men and &gt;40 g of alcohol/day for women) in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit and in the period between the Screening and Inclusion Visits (that is, in the Screening Period) The patient has liver impairment defined by elevated liver stiffness and elevated liver enzymes at the Screening Visit (both criteria have to be fulfilled): liver stiffness (LS) as measured by Fibroscan &gt;6 kPa, elevated transaminases (AST or ALT). Transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the reference range and γGT levels up to 10 times the upper limit of the reference range are allowed. At the discretion of the investigator, transaminase levels &gt;5 times the upper limit of the reference range and γGT &gt;10 times the upper limit of the reference range can be allowed if considered habitual for the patient, either confirmed by patient records or a repeat measurement during the Screening Period The patient has a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) &lt;0.02% at the Screening Visit. The patient provides a stable address and telephone number The patient is a man or woman, aged ≥ 18 years The patient has BMI≤30 kg/m2 The patient has any psychiatric disorder or Axis I disorder (DSMIVTR™ criteria), established as the primary diagnosis, other than alcohol dependence assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or another diagnostic interview , that in any way will interfere with the ability of the patient to take part in the study The patient has reported current use of, or has been tested positive for, drugs of abuse (opiates, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines [including ecstasy], barbiturates) The patient has severe liver impairment classified with a ChildPugh Score C The patient has one or more clinical laboratory test values outside the reference range, based on the blood and urine samples taken at the Screening Visit, that are of potential risk to the patient's safety, or the patient has: Severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and/or Hypercholesterolemia with serum cholesterol levels &gt; 300 mg/dL, (&gt;7,758 mmol/L), and/or bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL (50 μmol/L) The patient has had &lt;6 heavy drinking days (HDDs, defined by the European Medicines Agency as a day with an alcohol consumption &gt;60 g for men or &gt;40 g for women) in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit The patient has &gt;5 consecutive abstinence days in the 4 weeks preceding the Screening Visit The patient has a recent history of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (including hallucinations, seizures, or delirium tremens) Other protocoldefined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
