	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Male or female subjects 0 to less than 18 years of age at the time of informed consent / assent Previously documented objective diagnosis of VTE, followed by completed course of initial VTE treatment for at least 3 months (in case of VKA intended INR between 2 and 3) or completed study treatment (i.e. reached Visit 8) in the 1160.106 trial. Patients, who during the treatment phase of 1160.106 trial were switched from dabigatran etexilate to SOC arm for any reason, are not eligible for this study. Presence of an unresolved clinical risk factor requiring further anticoagulation for secondary VTE prevention (e.g. central venous line, underlying disease, thrombophilia, etc.) Written informed consent form (ICF) provided by the patient's parent or legal guardian and assent provided by the patient (if applicable) at the time of ICF signature according to local regulations. Further inclusion criteria apply Exclusion criteria: Conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding Renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Schwartz formula) or requirement for dialysis Active infective endocarditis Subjects with a mechanical or a biological heart valve prosthesis Hepatic disease: Active liver disease, including known active hepatitis A, B or C or Persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) &gt; 3 Ã— upper limit of normal (ULN) within 3 months of screening Pregnant or breast feeding females. Females who have reached menarche and are not using an acceptable method of birth control, or do not plan to continue using this method throughout the study and / or do not agree to adhere to pregnancy testing required by this protocol Patients in age group 0 to &lt; 2 years with gestational age at birth &lt; 37 weeks or with body weight lower than the 3rd percentile Anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 80g/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 80 x 109/L) at screening. Transfusions during the screening period are allowed, provided that a satisfactory hemoglobin or platelet level is attained prior to visit 2 Patients who have taken restricted medication prior to first dose of study medication Patients who have received an investigational drug in the past 30 days prior to screening, except patients who have completed the treatment period (up to Visit 8) in 1160.106 trial Patients who are allergic/sensitive to any component of the study medication including solvent Patients or parents/legal guardians considered unreliable to participate in the trial per investigator judgment or any condition which would present a safety hazard to the patient based on investigator judgment Further exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
