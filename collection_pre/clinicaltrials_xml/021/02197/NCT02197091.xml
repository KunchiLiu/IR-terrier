	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility of measuring discrepancies between patient and physician perceptions about the intent of therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore possible correlation between various patient satisfaction indicators and discrepant patient perceptions about their care. II. To gather exploratory data on patient characteristics that might correlate with discrepant patient perceptions about their care. OUTLINE: Patients complete questionnaires, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction (FACIT-TS-G), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Spiritual Well Being (FACIT-Sp12), the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), and the Distress Thermometer (DT). Doctors also complete a questionnaire. Patients' medical records may be reviewed, if necessary. After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
