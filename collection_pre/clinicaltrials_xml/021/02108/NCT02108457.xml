	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of specific bone marrow maps developed with18F-FLT PET/CT imaging on the ability to spare proliferating bone marrow using proton beam radiotherapy compared to IMRT. Participants will be 18 years of age or old with a history of gynecologic cancer. Subjects will undergo 3 FLT-PET scans (one before treatment, one during the course of RT, and one 2-5 weeks after initiation of RT).
