	<brief_summary>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the most common biliary malignancy and the second most common hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A majority of the CCA (50-70%) was presented in the area of the biliary duct bifurcation. Recent retrospective study included heterogeneous group of malignant diseases demonstrate that draining more than 50% of was associated with a longer median survival. However, in recent European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) biliary stenting clinical guideline and Asia-Pacific consensus recommendations for endoscopic and interventional management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA), whether we should deployment bilateral or unilateral metal stent for patients with HCCA was not clearly recommended due to the absence of randomized controlled trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Bilateral Versus Unilateral Metal Stent for Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with advanced hilar obstruction (Bismuth III and IV), PTBS had a higher success rate of cholestasis palliation and a low rate of post cholangitis when compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP). The advantage of percutaneous approach is the precise lobar selection for drainage and this approach should yield a lower rate of cholangitis. Guideline recommendation European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) biliary stenting clinical guideline and Asia-Pacific consensus recommendations the goal of palliative stenting of HCCA is drainage of adequate liver volume (50% or more), irrespective of unilateral, bilateral, or multi-segmental stenting was based on heterogeneous group of malignancy by ERCP in retrospective study.There are no randomized clinical trials compared with these two internal biliary drainage methods in HCCA using metal stent. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect and safety of bilateral versus unilateral stenting in patients with HCCA.</detailed_description>
