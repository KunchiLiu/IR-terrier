	<brief_summary>The primary aims for this research are to 1) characterize brain changes in patients with CD compared to age and gender-matched controls and 2) relate these brain changes to measures of disease activity and pain severity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain-Gut Interactions in Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain窶身ut interactions have been studied in chronic pain conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic pancreatitis. These studies suggest that alterations in the brain窶身ut axis may relate to disease severity and pain perception. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by periods of disease activity and periods of disease quiescence. Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the two major subtypes of IBD. Patients with CD typically experience abdominal pain when the disease is active; however, many also report experiencing pain in the absence of objective evidence of inflammation. Alterations in brain窶身ut interactions may explain the perception of pain in these patients. Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding brain changes in patients with IBD and CD, specifically. We are proposing a pilot study to characterize brain窶身ut interactions of disease activity and pain modulation mechanisms in patients with IBD using advanced neuroimaging tools.</detailed_description>
