	<brief_summary>This is a dose escalation study that will be conducted in healthy volunteers. Multiple cohorts of volunteers will receive ascending oral doses of AG-348 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of AG-348, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of AG-348, and the pharmacodynamic profile of AG-348 with specific biomarkers assessed in the blood.</brief_summary>

Subjects must agree not to donate blood products for duration of study participation. Subjects who have previously received AG348. Subjects with clinically relevant screening laboratory tests.
