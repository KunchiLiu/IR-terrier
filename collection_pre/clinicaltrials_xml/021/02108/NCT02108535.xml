	<brief_summary>The evidence is insufficient to determine whether the types of dressings containing silver differ as the time/proportion to complete healing of the wound and pain. We will analyze cost-effectiveness of these dressings in outpatients, considering the service provided by the National Public Health System.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Analysis of Cost-effectiveness of Silver Dressing in Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial, controlled, randomized, containing two parallel arms, the single center. Adult patients between 18 and 65 years, regardless of sex, with second degree burns treated in an outpatient setting without the need for surgical treatment will be randomized (1:1) into two groups: silver sulfadiazine 1% on healing and the base nanocrystalline silver. Primary endpoints include - time to complete epithelialization of the wound - proportions of lesions completely epithelialized over a period (15 days) Secondary outcomes include: - the number of dressing changes and the level of pain associated with your application and removal; - direct medical costs and non-medical; - need for surgery; - incidence of infection; - presence of adverse events.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults between 18 and 65 years; regardless of sex and race, second degree burns (partial thickness), ie, involving the epidermis and part of the dermis, with at least the preservation of some dermal appendages from of which the wound may possibly be epithelialized spontaneously (ARTZ; Moncrief; PRITT, 1980) that required treatment in an outpatient setting without the need for surgical debridement of devitalized tissue and skin graftsinformed in the initial clinical diagnosis. patients with diabetes, pregnant women, mentally disabled, with burns to the face or face and hands before the planting of the feet, as it was felt that there is need for specific treatment to prevent functional sequelae. Patients who have already started treatment at other institutions, those who arrived after the 5th day of the burn or unable to sign the consent form or who declined to participate.</criteria>
