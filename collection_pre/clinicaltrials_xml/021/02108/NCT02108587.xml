	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well optical coherence tomography works in staging patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas. Staging describes the severity of a person's cancer based on the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor and whether or not cancer has spread in the body. It also helps the doctor plan the appropriate treatment. Optical coherence tomography is a procedure that uses infrared light waves to give three-dimensional pictures of structures inside tissues and organs. The pictures are made by a computer linked to the light source. Optical coherence tomography may be effective in staging patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography in Staging Patients With Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test the feasibility and imaging ability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to stage upper-tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC). OUTLINE: Patients undergo optical coherence tomography over 10-15 minutes. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must have radiographic evidence of upper tract urothelial cancer by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) in order to undergo this procedure Patient who will undergo standard of care clinical staging for UTUC Patient ability to read and comprehend the informed consent document Patient who has a contraindication to endoscopy Patient who is pregnant</criteria>
