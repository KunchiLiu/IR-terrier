	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the PK, Relative Bioavailability and Safety of TG-2349 With Single Oral Dose Under Fed Condition in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TG-2349 oral solution has been investigated in a phase I/IIa study (study number: TG-2349-01) in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. The study demonstrated that TG-2349 was safe and well-tolerated when given to healthy volunteers at single oral doses up to 800 mg, and at five-consecutive daily oral doses up to 600 mg. Co-administration of TG-2349 with food resulted in a significant increase in bioavailability, and therefore concomitant food intake with dosing is recommended. To further advance the clinical development of TG-2349, a new capsule formulation was developed to replace the current TG-2349 oral solution. The objectives of this study (study number: TG-2349-02) are to evaluate the PK and relative bioavailability of TG-2349, given as a new capsule formulation and as the original formulation of oral solution, after a single oral dose of 400 mg under fed condition in healthy volunteers, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and ethnic differences of the TG-2349 capsule formulation.</detailed_description>
