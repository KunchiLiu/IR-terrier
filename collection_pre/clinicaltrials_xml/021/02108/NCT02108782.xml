	<brief_title>Dovitinib Lactate in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of dovitinib (dovitinib lactate) in patients with progressive well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (PNETs) in reference to 6-month progression free survival (PFS) historical-controlled patients and in two cohorts defined by prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-inhibitor therapy (Cohort 1 - no prior VEGF, Cohort 2 - prior VEGF). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety of dovitinib in patients with progressive well-differentiated PNETs. II. To evaluate time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival. III. To evaluate radiographic and biochemical response rates. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of dovitinib on plasma biomarkers by measuring concentrations of circulating growth factors and soluble receptors (e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], VEGF, placental growth factor [PLGF], soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) and 2, collagen IV, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23]). II. Archival tissue collected from patients prior to registration will be banked to later analyze baseline expression of potential biomarkers (e.g., bFGF, FGFR). OUTLINE: Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, and then periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>
