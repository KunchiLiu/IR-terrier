	<brief_summary>For more than 25 years, Regional Anesthesia has challenged anesthesiologists to determine whether it offers real benefits in terms of patient outcome from major surgery, compared with general anesthesia. Although it is clear that regional analgesia in association with general anesthesia substantially reduces postoperative pain, the benefits in terms of overall perioperative outcome are controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect on short and long-term postoperative outcomes of adding regional analgesia to general anaesthesia in thoridetomic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Anesthesia for Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who are divided into two treatment groups: (a) a bilateral superficial cervical plexus group (group S) and a control group (group C).We performe bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB)with 0.25-0.75% ropivacaine10 ml to group S and 10ml NaCl 0.9% to group C. All BSCPB is performed by experienced anesthesia doctor after a standardized induction of general anaesthesia.eneral anaesthesia was induced by using intravenously with midazolam,propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium is injected IV to facilitate orotracheal intubation. After a standardized induction of general anaesthesia, patients receive Regional Anesthesia at the discretion of the experienced anesthesiologist who was blinded to treatment. The patient is placed in a supine position with the head turned away from the side to be blocked, and then the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) is identified by slight head elevation. SCPB is performed with a 26-gauge needle that is inserted at the midpoint of the posterior border of the SCM muscle and the needle is advanced just past the SCM muscle.</detailed_description>
