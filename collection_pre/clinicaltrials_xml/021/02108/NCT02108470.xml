	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether by incorporating an OHRQoL measure in dental practice will improve patient-dentist communication and enhance patient's satisfaction. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare how useful a standardized OHRQoL assessment improves patient-dentist communication with regards to number of relevant OHRQoL issues addressed and percentage of most frequently items discussed between the intervention and control groups, assess the patient's active participation between the intervention and control groups and enhances patient's satisfaction between the intervention and control groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Cross-over Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Use of Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in Dental Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Oral Health Division of the Ministry of Health in Malaysia recognizes that customer centered/ patient-centered care (PCC) is of key importance in providing quality oral health care to the population. This paradigm shift in health care to 'patients' rather than 'providers' in determining health needs and service outcomes requires a more holistic approach relying on active patient involvement. This in turn has led to the development and use of patient-centred health status measures - termed 'health-related quality of life' [HRQoL] within medicine. These HRQoL have proved effective in understanding patients' health needs, ability to cope with illnesses, compliance with treatment and ultimately the overall success of care, thus ensuring PCC. In dentistry, considerable advances have been made in developing valid and reliable HRQoL for oral health [OHRQoL] . The most widely used and sophisticated measures being the Oral health Impact Profile which has been adapted for use and validated in Malaysia. The challenge now is to determine how effective such a measure is in attaining the goal of PCC for dentistry in Malaysia. Method. - Study design: This study is a randomized crossover study design. - Study Area: Selangor - Sample and Sampling method: - The Community Health Care Centers (CHCC) will be randomized into two groups: group A and B. - Group A will start with intervention (test) and follow by the standard protocol (Control) and vice versa for group B. Intervention (test): Dental consultation will be carried out by incorporating an OHQoL assessment. The OHQoL will be measured globally using Oral Health Impact Profile (S-OHIP[M]). Standard Protocol (Control): Dental consultation will be carried out in a conventional way (without OHQoL assessment). Procedure: 1. The participating dentist(s) randomized to group "A" will conduct 35 consultations incorporating the OHQoL assessments (i.e. the intervention) on a selected patients and then following a washout period of 1-month will conduct 35 consultations without OHQoL assessments (control). At those CHCC randomized to group 'B' participating dentist(s) will conduct 35 consultations without incorporating OHQoL assessments (control) and then following a washout period of 1-month will conduct 35 consultations with OHQoL assessments. 2. Patients aged 18 and older with presenting complaint of oral pain are eligible to participate in this study. Data Collection: 1. All eligible patients, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate in this study. Screening for eligibility will be done at the registration site. All patients in the intervention group will be asked to complete the S-OHIP[M] on the touch screen I-pad prior to the consultation. The program will systematically summarize the results of the questionnaire. 2. Dentists in the intervention group will perform the consultation with an addition of using the OHRQoL information as presented on the iPad screen in the consultation. Dentists in the control group, on the other hand, will perform the conventional consultation. The consultation will be audiotape. At the end of the treatment, patients will be given the satisfaction questionnaire to be completed.</detailed_description>
