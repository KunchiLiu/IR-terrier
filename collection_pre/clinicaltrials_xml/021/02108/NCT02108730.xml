	<detailed_description>In non-focal congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) the current doctrine warrants subtotal pancreatic resection in all children who do not respond to medication. However, the rate of diabetes after these extensive resections is very high. In this study investigators show that a less aggressive approach may suffice to wean many children from all medication or to get them manageable medically.</detailed_description>
