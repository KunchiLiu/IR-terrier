Patients who have received thoracic radiotherapy to lung fields ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study treatment or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapyrelated toxicities. For all other anatomic sites (including radiotherapy to thoracic vertebrae and ribs), radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting the study treatment or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapyrelated toxicities. Palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment 9. Patients who have had major surgery (e.g., intrathoracic, intraabdominal or intrapelvic) within 4 weeks prior (2 weeks for resection of brain metastases) to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure. Videoassisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can be enrolled in the study ≥1 week after the procedure. 10. Any medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, prevent the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for the study 11. Prior therapies Patients who have been treated with chemotherapy or biologic therapy or other investigational agent ≤ 1 week prior to the first dose of study treatment Unresolved toxicity greater than CTCAE grade 1 from prior anticancer therapy or radiotherapy (excluding neurotoxicity, alopecia, lymphopenia) Note: exceptions to the above are possible, on a case by case basis, following discussion and mutual agreement between investigator and Novartis (applicable to the Phase I part only). 12. Patients who have out of range laboratory values defined as Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &lt;1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9 g/dL Platelets &lt;75 x 109/L Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). For patients with Gilbert's syndrome total bilirubin &gt;3.0 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 x ULN for patients without hepatic metastasis AST and/or ALT &gt;5 x ULN for patients with hepatic metastasis Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;5 x ULN Fasting plasma glucose &gt;175 mg/dL (&gt;9.8 mmol/L) Measured or calculated creatinine clearance &lt;45 ml/min using CockcroftGault formula 13.

Participation in a prior investigational study within 1 week or within 5 halflives of the investigational product, whichever is longer, prior to first dose of study treatment Note: exceptions to the above are possible, on a case by case basis, following discussion and mutual agreement between investigator and Novartis (applicable to the Phase I part only). 16. Patients who have impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of EGF816 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or malabsorption syndrome) 17. Patients who are receiving treatment with any enzymeinducing anticonvulsant that cannot be discontinued at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment, and for the duration of the study. Patients on nonenzymeinducing anticonvulsants are eligible 18. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women 19. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study and for 3 months after stopping the study treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptomthermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male Partner: male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject. Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c): 1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. 2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 30 days before taking study treatment. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential. 20. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 3 months after stopping treatment; men should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
