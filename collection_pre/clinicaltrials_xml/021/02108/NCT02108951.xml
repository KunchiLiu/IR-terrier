	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Australian study is to assess the efficacy and safety of nilotinib 300mg twice daily in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase who are intolerant but responsive to 1st line treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. Eligible patients have been previously treated with imatinib or dasatinib for at least 3 months and are experiencing non-hematologic toxicity whilst having documented responses that meet PBS authority for 1st line treatment of CML without current MR4.5.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grou (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2. 2. Patient with diagnosis of Ph+ CMLCP associated with BCRABL quantifiable by RQPCR (IS). 3. Patient has received a minimum of 3 months of imatinib or dasatinib treatment (any dose) since initial diagnosis with a documented response. 4. Patient is eligible for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) reimbursed 1st line TKI treatment. 5. Patient has experienced nonhematological Adverse Events (AE(s)) of any grade, which persisted for at least 1 month despite supportive care or recurred at any grade at least once. Patients who, at the Investigator's discretion, require immediate discontinuation due to the severity of the adverse event are also eligible. 6. No other current or planned antileukemia therapies. 7. Adequate organ function. 8. Potassium, Magnesium and Total Calcium above Lower limit of normal. 1. Prior treatment with nilotinib. 2. Prior Accelerated Phase (AP), Blast Crisis (BC) or allogeneictransplant (unless the patient received an autologous transplant and was in Chrionic Phase (CP) prior to transplant and never in AP or BC). 3. Patient has documented Molecular Response (MR) 4.5 at the time of study entry 4. Patients with atypical BCRABL transcript not quantifiable by standard RQPCR. 5. Known impaired cardiac function. 6. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study drug. 7. Pregnant or breast feeding (lactating) women. 8. Women of childbearing potential unwilling or unable to use highly effective contraception.</criteria>
