	<brief_title>BetterBirth: A Trial of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program is a quality improvement program designed to support health workers to deliver evidence-based practices to women and newborns around the time of institutional childbirths. At the program's core is the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a 31-item list of essential practices that target the major causes of maternal and newborn mortality in low-resource settings globally. The program was developed over 3 years by a partnership of WHO and HSPH, working with a large international network of experts and stakeholders in maternal, fetal, and newborn health. Pilot testing of the program at a public-sector birth center in south India demonstrated dramatic improvements in health worker adherence to essential childbirth-related clinical care standards. The current study is a matched-pair, cluster randomized trial to measure the efficacy of the program in reducing severe maternal and newborn harm. This trial will be conducted at approximately 120 health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For measuring outcomes, inclusion criteria are all mothers admitted to a study site for childbirth and newborn babies who are to be followedup. In case a mother or baby from an enrolled site is referred out to another facility (before or after delivery) the motherbaby dyad will be included in the study and the outcome will be allocated to the referring facility For a smaller subset of birth events (approximately 4,650 deliveries total), health worker practices will be observed to measure the impact of the SCC program on delivery of essential practices, as a secondary outcome. A convenience sample of women who agree to observation and their babies cared for by the health workers around the time of childbirth at the facility during data collectors' duty hours will be included in this component of the study. Mothers who have been referred into the facility by an interfacility transfer. Mothers being managed for abortion. Mothers who refuse consent for followup</criteria>
