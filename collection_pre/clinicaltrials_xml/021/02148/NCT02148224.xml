	<brief_summary>Glycemic index concept is widely used to determine impact of a food to blood glucose. Although the previous studies showed that glycemic index did not seem to be related with subject-specific factors, currently several studies found conflicting results on the relationship of subjects' characteristics and glycemic index values. This study aims to determine whether body composition parameters, as subject-specific factor, correlate with glycemic index values.</brief_summary>
