	<brief_summary>It is the objective of this MRD trial to investigate pharmacokinetics, pharmcodynamics, safety and tolerability of rising doses BI 691751 over a treatment period of 14 days to support the further clinical development of this LTA4H-inhibitor. Special emphasis will be given to detect potential effects of BI 691751 on heart rate.</brief_summary>
