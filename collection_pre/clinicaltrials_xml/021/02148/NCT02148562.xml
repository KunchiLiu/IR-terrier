	<brief_summary>In this project proposal, the investigators will investigate the genetic alterations of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) strains circulating in Belgian patients who developed end stage liver disease. Additionally, the investigators will compare and link these data sets with three genetic factors involved in immune system response.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project proposes to identify and characterize the genetic alterations associated with intra-host evolution of HBV from a chronically infection status to an end-stage liver disease status.</detailed_description>
