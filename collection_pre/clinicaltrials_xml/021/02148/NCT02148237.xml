	<brief_title>Increase Breastfeeding Duration Among Puerto Rican Mothers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect sizes of home-based individual breastfeeding consultation alone and combined with financial incentives to increase breastfeeding (BF) duration among low-income Puerto Rican mothers. These interventions will be tested in a Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which capitalizes on the current goals of WIC and on the current practice of using incentives to support BF - factors that are likely to increase potential for sustainability and dissemination of the intervention. We will follow a three phase strategy. During the Formative Phase we will consult WIC staff, Puerto Rican postpartum mothers, and experts in BF, behavioral health incentives, and WIC populations and settings to develop intervention and research manuals. During the Implementation Phase, we will pilot the interventions and research procedures. We will randomly assign 60 Puerto Rican women who initiate BF to: Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) or TAU with financial incentives (also known as Contingency Management; (CM). A bilingual breastfeeding counselor visits participants at home for problem solving issues around breastfeeding. Participants also receiving CM will receive cash incentives if they show breastfeeding. We will conduct assessments at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months postpartum, measuring BF duration, BF exclusivity, BF self-efficacy, and infant weight gain. In the Evaluative Phase, we will examine monthly recruitment, consent, and enrollment rates, as well as attendance and retention rates for the interventions and for research participation (i.e., feasibility and acceptability).</detailed_description>
