	<brief_title>Geriatric Out of Hospital Randomized Meal Trial in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two center, randomized, single-blind, attention controlled trial of 12 weeks total duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD)-compliant meals in older adults (age &gt;= 65 years) following discharge from a hospital admission for acutely decompensated heart failure. 60 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt; vs. ≥ 50%). Study subjects will receive either pre-prepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or attention control for 4 weeks after hospital discharge. The two study sites will be Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Michigan Health System. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until the completion of the study</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>60 male and female patients aged ≥ 65 years with history of systemic hypertension and acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF; primary diagnosis for admission or secondary diagnosis after hospitalization for another reason). ADHF will be confirmed by the study physician and defined as a combination of symptoms, signs, and HFspecific medical treatments. Specifically, ADHF will require that all four of the following conditions are met: ≥1 symptom of HF (dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) has worsened from baseline ≥ 2 signs of HF (pulmonary congestion on exam and/or chest Xray, elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema or rapid weight gain, and/or increased Btype natriuretic peptide (BNP; ≥100 pg/ml) change in medical treatment specifically targeting HF (diuretics, vasodilators, and/or neurohormonal modulating agents) no other cause of the patient's symptoms and signs is apparent systolic BP &lt;100 mmHg at any time during hospitalization use of inotropic therapy, severe valvular heart disease as the primary etiology of the patient's HF syndrome uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg) or systolic BP &lt;110 on discharge serum potassium &gt;5.0 mmol/L during hospitalization or history of serum potassium &gt;6.0 mmol/L severe renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2 at discharge) severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 9 gm/dl) length of stay &lt;48 hours or &gt;14 days comorbidity with expected survival &lt; 12 months active alcohol or substance abuse history of persistent noncompliance with treatment recommendations as judged by the investigators</criteria>
