	<brief_summary>This study will be a three-arms study intending to demonstrate superiority of NexoBrid treatment over the Gel Vehicle placebo control treatment and over SOC in thermal burn subjects. The study objectives are: 1. To demonstrate the efficacy of enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid by providing complete eschar removal as compared with Gel vehicle, 2. To demonstrate the efficacy of enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid by providing earlier complete eschar removal, reduction in patients' surgical burden and its related blood loss as compared to SOC, 3. To assess the safety of NexoBrid compared to SOC, including demonstration that treatment with NexoBrid does not cause an unacceptable level of harm on wound closure outcome and long term outcomes of cosmesis and function. Physicians will define one or more Target Wounds (TWs) per subject according to TWs definition. All subjects' deep (DPT and FT) burns that comply with the specified entrance criteria are intended to receive study treatment per the randomized study arm. The randomization procedure will be initiated only after all Target wounds of a subject have been defined. Patients will be assigned to the treatment arm in a 3:3:1 ratio (NexoBrid: SOC : Gel Vehicle). Patients will be treated in the same way in all study arms (NexoBrid, SOC or Gel vehicle) except for the eschar removal stage which will be performed as per the randomization study arm. Prior to initiation of eschar removal treatment, subjects will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions . Following wound cleansing and antibacterial treatments, subjects will undergo the eschar removal process as per treatment assignment (NexoBrid, SOC or Gel Vehicle, following randomization). Subsequent to complete eschar removal, all wounds will be assessed and treated in the same manner, in accordance with post-eschar removal wound care strategy. Post eschar removal, subjects will undergo daily vital signs and pain assessments, until hospital discharge (HD) and weekly assessments of wound progress, until wound closure. Following wound closure confirmation visit, subjects will be followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post wound closure for long term outcomes evaluation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patient level 1. Males and females; ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age, 2. Thermal burns caused by fire/flame, scalds or contact, 3. Patient total burns area ≥ 3% DPT and / or FT, 4. Patient total burns area should be ≤ 15% TBSA; SPT, DPT and/or FT in depth, 5. Informed consent can be obtained within 48 hours of the burn injury, 6. Patients who are willing and able to sign a written consent form. Inclusion Criteria Wound level At least one wound (a continuous burn area which can be treated in one session; may include several anatomical areas) in a patient should meet all following criteria: 1. Wound that is ≥1% TBSA (DPT and/or FT) (not including face, perineal or genital), 2. Wound's blisters can be removed/unroofed, as judged by the investigator. Exclusion Criteria Patient level 1. Patients who are unable to follow study procedures and follow up period, 2. Modified Baux index ≥ 80, 3. Patients with burned charred fingers, 3rd degree in depth and possibly devoid of circulation, 4. Patients with abraded wound/s that cannot be treated by an enzymatic debrider application (NexoBrid) will be excluded from the study, 5. Patients with electrical, blast or chemical burns, 6. Patients with DPT and/or FT facial burn wounds from flame, flash, explosion &gt; 0.5% TBSA (scald and contact burns are allowed), 7. Patients with circumferential DPT and/or FT burns defined as Extremities at Risk (EAR) , 8. The following preenrollment dressings: a. Flammacerium, b. Silver Nitrate (AgNO3), 9. Patients with preenrolment wounds which are covered by eschar heavily saturated with iodine or by SSD pseudoeschar (e.g. pseudoeschar as a result of SSD treatment), 10. Patients with preenrollment escharotomy, 11. Patients with diagnosed infections as described in Section 11.6.3 of study protocol, 12. Any signs or history that may indicate smoke inhalation (e.g. flame burn to the upper body, flames in enclosed space, smoke and fumes on the patient and in mouth and nostrils, deep flame burns &gt;0.5 %TBSA to the face, cough, hoarseness, stridor or breathing difficulty including tachypnea possibly related to smoke inhalation, etc.), 13. Pregnant women (positive pregnancy test) or nursing mothers, 14. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c&gt;9%) in patients with known diabetes as captured in the medical history, 15. Patients with BMI greater than 34.0 kg/m2, 16. ASA greater than 2 (Appendix 13 ASA classification system) 17. Cardiopulmonary disease (MI within 6 months prior to injury, pulmonary hypertension, COPD or preexisting oxygendependent pulmonary diseases, bronchopneumonia, steroid dependent asthma or uncontrolled asthma), 18. Preexisting diseases which interfere with circulation (peripheral vascular disease, edema, lymphedema, surgery to regional lymph nodes, obesity, varicose veins), 19. Any conditions that would preclude safe participation in the study or adding further risk to the basic acute burn trauma (such as immunocompromising diseases, life threatening trauma, severe preexisting coagulation disorder, cardiovascular disorder, pulmonary disorder, liver disorder including post alcoholic abuse impaired function or neoplastic disease), 20. Chronic systemic steroid intake, 21. History of allergy and/or known sensitivity to pineapples, papaya, Bromelain or papain, 22. Current (within 12 months prior to screening) suicide attempt, 23. Mentally incapacitated adults who are incapable of giving legal consent (e.g. dementia, psychiatric patients, etc), 24. Enrollment in any investigational drug trial within 4 weeks prior to screening, 25. Current (within 12 months prior to screening) alcohol (daily consumption &gt; 3 units for males and &gt;2 units for females) or drug abuse , 26. Prisoners and incarcerated, 27. Patients who might depend on the clinical study site or investigator.</criteria>
