	<brief_summary>Many patients suffer from acute and chronic pain. The incidence of chronic pain correlates with increased age. Most of patients rely on analgesic medication to control the pain. Dipyrone is an extensively used drug in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Central and South America, largely due to its favorable analgesic and antipyretic effects in conjunction with a low incidence of gastrointestinal complications when compared to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin is the backbone of antiplatelet therapy in patients after ischemic stroke. However, it is known that there are substantial inter-individual response variabilities to antiplatelet medication. Furthermore, patients with impaired response to aspirin have a significant higher risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. The investigators have recently shown that co-medication with aspirin and dipyrone in patients with coronary artery disease lead to insufficient antiplatelet effects of aspirin. The incidence of chronic pain is very high in patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to examine, if co-medication of aspirin and dipyrone interaction also occurs in patients after ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
