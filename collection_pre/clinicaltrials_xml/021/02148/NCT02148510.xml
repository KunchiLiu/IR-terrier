	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of the study is that a bibloc-apnea splint has a comparable efficacy on respiratory measures as a monobloc-apnea splint and that the cost of treatment is the same. The goal is primarily to compare the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) after 6 weeks of treatment and the cost of treatment during one year. This randomized controlled parallel group multicenter study includes 316 subjects referred for the treatment of moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The subjects visit the clinic at 5 scheduled occasions.</brief_summary>
