	<brief_summary>The results of fastact2 show that chemotherapy plus erlotinib significantly prolonged PFS and OS of patients with NSCLC. However, outcome of the combination therapy are similar to those reported in several trials of single-agent EGFR TKIs. So which is the optimal first-line treatment for patients who harbored a sensitive EGFR mutation? The investigators need a head-to-head study to reply.</brief_summary>
