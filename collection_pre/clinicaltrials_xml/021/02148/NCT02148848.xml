	<brief_summary>Femoral neck fracture in the elderly is one indication for initiating osteoporosis treatment. Bisphosphonates remain the first line therapy; however, many orthopaedic surgeons concern regarding their effects on fracture healing process. Therefore, therapy is usually delayed for a period of time. To the best of our knowledge, there is no scientific data to support whether bisphosphonate treatment should be given immediately after the surgery or it should be delayed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Femoral neck fracture in the elderly is one indication for initiating osteoporosis treatment. Bisphosphonates remain the first line therapy; however, many orthopaedic surgeons concern regarding their effects on fracture healing process. Therefore, therapy is usually delayed for a period of time. To the best of our knowledge, there is no scientific data to support whether bisphosphonate treatment should be given immediately after the surgery or it should be delayed. This study aims to compare functional recovery between early- and late administration of bisphosphonate in patients who received hemiarthroplasty following femoral neck fractures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient diagnosed with femoral neck fracture and was treated with bipolar hemiarthroplasty Age more than 50 years old and bone mineral density (BMD) was in osteoporotic (Tscore less than 2.5) or osteopenic (Tscore between 1.0 and 2.5) ranges Patients who were treated with bipolar hemiarthroplasty for more than 2 weeks Patients with postoperative complications which affect the postoperative rehabilitation program e.g. intraoperative cracking or fracture, postoperative cardiac complication Have contraindications for bisphosphonates use e.g. renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml/min), allergy to bisphosphonates, severe esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease etc. Patients with conditions/disorders which have an affect on bone mineral density or bone metabolism e.g. renal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, glucocorticoids use etc. History of bisphosphonates use within 12 months Open fracture, multiple fracture or multiple trauma patients Pathological fracture Bilateral lower extremity fractures The preinjury functional status of the patients is nonambulatory</criteria>
