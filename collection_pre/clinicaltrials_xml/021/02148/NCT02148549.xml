	<brief_summary>FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and represents a new standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX is one of the high response rate treatment regimen , the investigators considered as a promising treatment as neoadjuvant chemotherapy . On the other hand , incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , febrile neutropenia and diarrhea were significantly higher in the FOLFIRINOX group compared with gemcitabine group. Therefore, it was decided to consider the balance of safety and efficacy as a preoperative chemotherapy, the investigators use the FIRINOX regimen by eliminating LV and bolus 5-FU, and irinotecan reduced to 150mg/m2 of 180mg/m2 from FOLFIRINOX regimen</brief_summary>

The investigators also evaluate the optimal treatment schedule of FIRINOX therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, optimal duration between surgery and chemotherapy, R0 resection rate, and resection rate for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
