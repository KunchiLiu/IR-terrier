	<brief_summary>Hypotensive Anesthesia is a type of regional anesthesia performed routinely at our hospital. This type of anesthesia reduces the average arterial pressure. Benefits include reduced bleeding and lower risk of blood clots. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous fluids administered with hypotensive anesthesia on your blood volume. With this parameter we will be able to understand how much of your blood is lost because of bleeding and how much of the drop is related to dilution. Study hypothesis: Hemodilution associated with intravenous fluid substitution during hypotensive anesthesia results in decreased postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Volume Analysis of Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients Under Hypotensive Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent technology allows the measurement of patients' total blood volume with 98% accuracy within 90 minutes or less. This is key to understanding the effect of hypotensive anesthesia on patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The drop in blood pressure enhances the dilutional effect of intravenous fluid given during the procedure. Increases in TBV could result in decreases of postoperative hemoglobin. Understanding the effect of hypotensive anesthesia on postoperative hemoglobin levels and TBV will enhance our understanding of postoperative blood management and transfusion triggers.</detailed_description>
