	<brief_summary>External Genital Warts (EGW) are the most common sexually transmitted disease associated with more than 30 types of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Cryotherapy is an effective method of EGW treatment. However, multiple sessions may be required with reported clearance rates ranging between 27-88%. Sinecatechins 15% ointment is Food and Drug Administration approved for three times daily application in immunocompetent subjects 18 years and older for the treatment of EGW and perianal warts. Treatment of EGW with cryotherapy followed by sinecatechins appears to be logical. Cryotherapy has direct cytodestructive effects with immediate short-term efficacy on treated EGW, while sinecatechins provide field therapy, treating both clinical and sub-clinical lesions. For this study, the investigators used sinecatechins 15% ointment twice daily regimen and anticipated that the synergistic effect with cryotherapy will provide better efficacy that cryotherapy alone. The investigators also anticipated that the sequential therapy with be safe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of External Genital Warts With Cryotherapy and Sinecatechins 15% Ointment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 42 subjects received standardized cryotherapy to all lesions, using two cycles of five seconds each, separated by a five second interval rest (Week 0/Baseline). One week following cryotherapy, subjects were randomized 1:1 to either additional treatment with sinecatechins 15% ointment twice daily or no additional treatment. Those subjects randomized to additional treatment received sinecatechins 15% ointment BID for up to sixteen weeks, or until complete clearance of all EGW, whichever occurred first. Additionally, subjects were advised to maintain safe sexual practices and have all recent sexual partners examined for EGW. Subjects were followed every 8 weeks for a total of 16 weeks (Table 1). EGW lesion counts were conducted at all study visits by the same qualified blinded evaluator. Additionally, at each visit local skin reactions, change in concomitant medications, and adverse events were assessed. Any subjects who received sinecatechins 15% ointment and discontinued prematurely were asked to return for an End of Study Visit. Females of childbearing potential underwent a urine pregnant test at all visits during study treatment period. Subjects that met complete responder criteria as above, were additionally followed and assessed at Visit5/Week 41 and Visit 6/Week 65 to assess for wart recurrence.</detailed_description>
