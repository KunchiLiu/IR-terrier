	<brief_summary>This study will compare two arms in a randomized clinical trial of cardiovascular risk prevention in women with a history of preeclampsia. The first arm will provide postpartum patients and their clinicians with the American Heart Association's (AHA) Class I Lifestyle Recommendations for women with a history of preeclampsia. The second arm will additionally receive access to a customized patient-informed online program with modules on how to achieve the AHA recommendations for diet, activity and weight management.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study team will work with patients via focus groups to develop a novel internet-based program to provide information and tools for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction for women who are at increased risk of CVD by virtue of their history of preeclampsia, a common complication of pregnancy. The American Heart Association has recently issued guidelines that physicians should include history of the hypertensive pregnancy disorder, preeclampsia, as a risk factor for CVD. Indeed, research demonstrates that roughly 2 out of 3 women with a history of preeclampsia will die from CVD. This study will work with patients with prior preeclampsia and with the Preeclampsia Foundation, a patient- based organization, to create an online lifestyle modification program ( accessible by computer or smart phone) for women with recent preeclampsia to reduce CVD risk. The study is a randomized controlled trial to test the program's acceptability, use, and impact on diet, postpartum weight retention, physical activity, blood pressure, and patient knowledge and self-efficacy to improve health.</detailed_description>
