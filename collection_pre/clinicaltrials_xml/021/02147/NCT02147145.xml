Specific Aim 2: To determine if EUS features of GIST, particularly maximum size, change significantly during a surveillance program. Hypothesis: EUS features of GIST, particularly maximum size, will not change significantly during a surveillance program. Specific Aim 3: To determine if EGD measures of GIST size correlate well with EUS measures of GIST size. Hypothesis: EGD measures of GIST size will correlate well with EUS measured of GIST size.</brief_summary>
