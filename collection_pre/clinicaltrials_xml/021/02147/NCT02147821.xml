	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized controlled trial will examine the efficacy of reducing the number of chest tubes used in the postoperative cardiac surgery patient. Typically used are three chest tubes - two in the mediastinum and one in the pleural space, if opened. The investigators propose that removal of the pleural tube will not impact the rates of clinically significant pleural effusions post cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomized into two groups - one receiving the standard three chest tubes (standard), and the other receiving only mediastinal drains (experimental). The primary outcome will be rates of post-operative pleural effusions as determined by defined interventions, including insertion of a chest tube, thoracentesis, or return to the operating room for primary evacuation of pleural effusion or hemothorax. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, length of mechanical ventilation, postoperative respiratory status, and presence/size of pleural effusions, as well as readmission for pleural effusion.</brief_summary>
