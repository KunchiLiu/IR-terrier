	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic renal insufficiency usually develop secondary osteoporosis or bone loss, which is called renal osteodystrophy. Most of the previous studies focused on bone metabolism of patients in late stage of chronic renal insufficiency, especially those with chronic dialysis. In this study, bone metabolism of patients in different stages of chronic renal insufficiency will be observed to reveal the mechanism of development of renal osteodystrophy and provide clues for early intervention on renal osteodystrophy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Observation on Bone Metabolism Induced by Chronic Renal Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CKD1-5, defined by glomerular filtration rate，GFR) and healthy people as control will be recruited (50/group, total 300). Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,lumbar and hip bone mineral density, bone turnover biochemical markers including serum total propeptide of type I procollagen（PINP）, bone alkaline phosphatase（BALP）, bone Gla-protein (BGP) and β-CrOSSlaps（β-CTX）, serum calcium and phosphorus and related regulators including fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), 25-hydroxyl-Vitamin D （25-OH-VitD）, parathyroid hormone（PTH） will be detected. The relationship between kidney function and bone turnover, and the rules throughout the development process of renal osteodystrophy will be analysed.The micro ribonucleotide（miRNA）array will also be performed to screen the biomarkers of renal osteodystrophy in different stage.</detailed_description>
