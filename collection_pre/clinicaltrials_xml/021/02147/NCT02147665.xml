	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study on acute effects of Hookah smoking on the sympathetic neural control of the human cardiovascular system. Hookah smoking is known to transiently increase blood pressure and heart rate while decreasing heart rate variability suggesting - but not proving - sympathetic mediation. Here the investigators will directly measure the acute effects of Hookah smoking on sympathetic nerve activity with microneurography (intraneural microelectrodes) and quantify associated regional changes in vasomotor tone.</brief_summary>
