	<brief_summary>Smoking prevalence is over 83% in methadone-maintained patients. These patients experience significant difficulty quitting, and there is evidence that a majority of methadone-maintained patients smoke most of their cigarettes in the 4 hours following methadone dosing. The objective is to provide a preliminary test of the ability of two pharmacological treatments, the nicotine nasal spray and varenicline, relative to placebos, to reduce smoking during the 4 hours following methadone dosing.</brief_summary>
