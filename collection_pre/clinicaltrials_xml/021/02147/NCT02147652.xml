	<brief_summary>Symptoms of agitation include abuse or aggressive behaviour toward self or others, appropriate behaviour performed with inappropriate frequency, or behaviours that are inappropriate according to social standards. In the later stages of dementia agitation can contribute significantly to patient distress and caregiver stress, and has been associated with poor quality of life. Previous research studies have shown some evidence that personalized music played in daily care situations reduces agitation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of personalized music therapy via headphones on agitation during hygiene care (grooming). This study will involve 60 in-patients of the Geriatric Psychiatry ward of Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. The study would take place over the span of 2 weeks and would involve listening to personalized and either non-personalized or no music during daily hygiene care (grooming). Enrolment is completely voluntary and all personal data obtained will remain confidential.</brief_summary>
