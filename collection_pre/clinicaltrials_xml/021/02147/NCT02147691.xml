	<brief_title>Finacea 15% and Brimonidine 0.33% Gel in the Treatment of Rosacea - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease with different components including inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules), erythema and telangiectasia. Brimonidine 0.33% Gel primarily affects the erythematous components of rosacea. As such, combination treatment with a standard rosacea treatment, such as Finacea 15% Gel, may provide additional relief for the inflammatory component of rosacea.</detailed_description>
