	<brief_summary>Premature infants are at high risk for variations in blood pressure and oxygenation during the first few days of life. The immaturity of the premature brain may further predispose these infants to death or the development of neurologic problems. The relationship between unstable blood pressure and oxygen levels and brain injury has not been well elucidated. This study investigates the utility of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a non-invasive oxygen-measuring device, to identify preterm infants at highest risk for brain injury or death.</brief_summary>
