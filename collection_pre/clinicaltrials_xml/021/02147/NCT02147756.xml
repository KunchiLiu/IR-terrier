	<brief_title>Histology Evaluation of the CO2RE Device Versus the RePair Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CO2RE is a fractional CO2 system that enables, precise, effective and simultaneous treatment of the skin's surface, middle, and deep dermal levels then seamlessly performing traditional CO2 resurfacing and laser excision of lesions with precision-control over the intensity, pattern, and depth of ablation. RePair is a 10,600nm fractional CO2 laser system that targets aging and sun-damaged skin with microscopic laser columns that penetrate deep into the skin to expedite the body's remodeling of collagen.</detailed_description>
