	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is: 1) To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of an SMS reminder intervention for promoting an health-related exercise programme (myPAtHS) among older Malaysian adults, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Hypothesis: Frequency and duration of the exercise programme execution will be higher for the SMS reminder condition compared to the programme only condition. The effect may be reduced from post- to follow-up measurement (24 weeks after baseline and 12 weeks after post-measurement) but all outcomes will remain significantly higher at 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
