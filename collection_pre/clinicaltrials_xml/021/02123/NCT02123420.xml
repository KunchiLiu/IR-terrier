	<brief_summary>The present study tested the hypothesis that Platform Switching (PS) and Regular Platform (RP) implants would have different outcomes in the bilateral single tooth replacements against the alternative hypothesis of no difference.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platform Switching vs Regular Platform Implants. One Year Results From a RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed as a randomised, controlled, split-mouth trial. Eighteen patients, with bilaterally missing single bicuspid or molar had one of the sites to be restored randomly assigned to be treated according to the platform-switching concept with (PS group), or with matching implant-abutment diameters, (RP group). A total of 36 implants, (18 Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy PS, 18 Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy), were bilaterally installed. All the implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 35 and 45 Ncm, in healed healthy bone and the healing abutment was connected at the same time. Both implants were delayed loaded with screw retained temporary crowns 3 months after implant insertion and with screw retained definitive crowns 2 months later. Outcome measures were implant survival, biological and prosthetic complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, soft tissue parameters (PPD and BOP). Clinical data were collected at baseline 6 and 12 months. Statistical analyses were conducted using computational program SAS (version 9.2), with 1-away ANOVA and F-test. Statistical significance was tested at the 0.05 probability level, and all values were presented as mean and standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals.</detailed_description>
