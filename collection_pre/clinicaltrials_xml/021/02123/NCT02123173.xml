	<brief_summary>Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery has been proved as an adequate alternative for management of many lung conditions such as pneumothorax , lung volume reduction, pulmonary metastasectomy, removal of lung nodules, segmentectomy and lobectomy. However, the hemodynamic changes during one lung ventilation have not been fully investigated. The goals of this study are to compare the changes of hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, pulse pressure variation, fluid responsiveness) during one lung ventilation between conventional intubated and non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) operations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Changes During One Lung Ventilation in Non-intubated Vedio-assisted Thoracoscopic Operations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) is proved safely performed as well as traditional intubated VATS. However, the differences of hemodynamic changes and fluid responsiveness during one lung ventilation(OLV) between these two groups were rarely reported. For complete lung collapse, spontaneous negative pressure respiration must be well maintained on non-intubated VATS. In comparison, positive pressure ventilation on dependent lung was applied during OLV in intubated VATS. This study planned to compared the changes of hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output) during OLV between groups. As functional hemodynamic monitoring (FloTrac system) was mostly utilized with positive pressure ventilation, the applicability of FloTrac in non- intubated VATS was also testified. In this study, we also measure the fluid responsiveness by FloTrac system with rapid infusion (within 10 minutes) of 10 mL/kg crystalloid fluid. We planned to compare the changes on cardiac output and the fluid responsiveness during OLV between these two groups.</detailed_description>
