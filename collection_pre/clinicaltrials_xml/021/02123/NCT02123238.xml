	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate the effect of non-supine positioning in the treatment of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The hypothesis is that non-supine positioning will result in a decrease in acute hypoxic events, defined as the number of apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will comprise of two stages. Stage 1 is a pilot study of 30 patients at high risk or diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea who are scheduled for routine surgery. These patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to standard of care (0 degree bed angle), 30 degree bed angle, or 60 degree bed angle. Acute hypoxic events will be analyzed pre and post-op in the randomly assigned bed position. PACU nurses will also be surveyed for patient-favored non-supine positioning (30 vs. 60 degrees). Stage 2 will be a larger, powered trial to evaluate the efficacy of just one bed angle (30 or 60 degrees) based on the Stage 1 results.</detailed_description>
