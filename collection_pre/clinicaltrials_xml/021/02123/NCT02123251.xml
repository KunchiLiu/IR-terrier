	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled trial study is to examine the extent that financial incentives when combined with diabetes evidence-based practices, improve self-management and biometric measures for adult diabetic Medicaid recipients with an HbA1c of ≥ 6.5 at enrollment. The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program. Specific Aims: 1. Evaluate whether financial incentives for completing ADA recommended tests, exams and vaccinations will improve compliance rates. 2. Evaluate whether financial incentives for health education and biometric outcomes will improve diabetes patients' self-management. 3. Evaluate the extent to which financial incentives for healthy behaviors reduce health care utilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hawaii Patient Reward And Incentives to Support Empowerment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (OECD 2013). It is also known that certain populations are at greater risk for diabetes. In Hawaii, diabetes disproportionally affects Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders as they are three times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, in 2010 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders in Hawaii were 5.7 times as likely as Caucasians living in Hawaii to die from diabetes(Office of Minority Health, 2010). In order to address the challenges that chronic diseases impose on individuals and the health care system the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is assessing the impact of incentivizing patients to increase self-care and disease management. Previous studies have demonstrated that monetary incentives have been associated with an improvement in behavioral outcomes, most notably when the incentive is received immediately following the targeted behavior (Volpp, K.G., et.al., 2008; Mitchell, M.S., et.al., 2013). Cahill et al. (2008) showed that economic incentives were tied to smoking cessation and led to a decrease in relapse within a year. Our study seeks to build on these findings and determine whether economic incentives may provide a way to improve diabetes self-management.
