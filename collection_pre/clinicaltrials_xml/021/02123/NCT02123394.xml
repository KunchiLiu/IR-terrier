	<brief_title>Efficacy of the Mckenzie Method in Patients With Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups: McKenzie method or Placebo (detuned ultrasound and short wave therapy) for 5 weeks (total of 10 sessions of 30 minutes each). The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (5 weeks) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles and the between-group differences will be calculated by constructing mixed linear models.</detailed_description>
