	<brief_summary>The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is high and POCD affect the life quality and the prognosis of patients. Geriatrics is the independent risk factor of POCD, and POCD is also correlated with many other factors such as type of surgery, the duration of anesthesia and the anesthesia drugs used et al. So, the prevention and treatment of POCD in geriatrics is important. Dexmedetomidine is found to have the effect of neuro-protection, but it is controversy whether Dexmedetomidine has the effect of neuro-protection in geriatrics, especially the prolonged surgery. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Dexmedetomidine to the cognitive function at prolonged surgery in geriatrics in geriatrics.</brief_summary>
