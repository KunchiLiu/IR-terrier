	<brief_title>Biomarkers for the Surgical Treatment of Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tears (i.e. structural failure and tissue disruption in at least one of the four muscles and tendons that form the rotator cuff) are extremely common injuries and represent the most common muscle-tendon tear in patients. Repair of rotator cuff tears is usually advocated for painful tears with functional impairment. However, high failure rates of 13-68% have been reported for surgical repair of rotator cuff tears, irrespective of the surgical technique employed. Higher rates of re-rupture are associated with larger tears, increased patient age, and increased fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles. There is no general consensus as to the causes of re-rupture; where mechanical factors, the existing techniques of suturing, and biological factors are considered as the main factors of recurrence.</detailed_description>
