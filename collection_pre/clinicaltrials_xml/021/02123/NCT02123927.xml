	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TAK-438 in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK-438 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose and to assess how TAK-438 moves throughout the body. This study will look at lab results and side effects in people who took TAK-438. This study consisted of 2 sequential studies: a single rising dose study (Steps 1 to 7) and a food-effect study (Steps 8 and 9). The study population for Steps 1 to 7 consisted of 12 participants; with 9 participants randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-438, and 3 participants to receive placebo. Participants in Steps 1 to 7 received a single dose of study drug after a 10-hour fast. The starting dose was 1 mg followed by administrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 mg. Steps 8 and 9 consisted of 12 participants in a 2-sequence, 2-period crossover design. Four participants were to receive a single dose of TAK-438 and 2 participants were to receive a single dose of placebo on Day 1, in the fasted state, and 4 participants were to receive a single dose of TAK-438 and 2 participants were to receive a single dose of placebo on Day 1 in the fed state, followed by a second single dose of TAK-438 or placebo in the alternative fed state after a 13 day minimum washout period. Participants in Steps 8 randomized to receive TAK-438 will receive 10 mg and participants in Step 9 will receive 40 mg. This single-centre trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 32 days depending on the Step assignment. Participants made 3 to 5 visits to the clinic, including one or two 8-day periods of confinement to the clinic, also depending on Step assignment. All participants made a final visit 15 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
