	<brief_summary>Use of a microfabricated silicon device to concentrate ultra trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled breath for quantitative analysis of VOCs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Micro/Nano Device for Exhaled Breath Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will use Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FT-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze concentrated VOCs. The purpose of this study is to search for disease-related markers in the breath in subjects with known or suspected lung or other cancer, or pulmonary disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For controlled (healthy) subjects we are seeking persons who do not have a known history of cancer or pulmonary disease. Both smokers and nonsmokers are invited to participate as control subjects. For experimental subjects, we are seeking persons with pulmonary disease but no known history of cancer, as identified by the investigators during routine clinic or office visits. Additionally for experimental subjects, we are seeking persons with known or suspected lung or other cancers, as identified by the investigators during routine clinic or office visits.</criteria>
