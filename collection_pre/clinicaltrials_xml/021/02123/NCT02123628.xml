	<criteria>diabetic patients treated nonsurgically (i.e. without amputation or resection of the infected bone) for an osteomyelitis of the foot complicating a neuropathic foot without ischemia of the foot defined as the absence of any pedal pulse. Patients aged of 18 years or more were included if they had type 2 diabetes and osteomyelitis of the foot (i.e.below the ankle). Patients with gangrene or who require bone resection or amputation when osteomyelitis of the foot was diagnosed</criteria>
