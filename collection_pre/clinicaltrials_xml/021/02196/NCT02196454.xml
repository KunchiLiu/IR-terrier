	<brief_title>Video to Promote HPV Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that has the potential to cause cancer. The vaccine is recommended because it prevents the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer. HPV vaccines offer the best protection to girls and boys who receive the complete, three-vaccine series and have time to develop an immune response before being exposed to HPV. However, vaccination rates are low compared to other vaccines for teens. Results from this study will help us learn why participants do or do not get the HPV vaccination and whether video-based education can help improve vaccination rates</detailed_description>
