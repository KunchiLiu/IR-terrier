	<brief_summary>Collection of real world outcomes of Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for lung cancer (lobectomy, wedge resection) using ECHELON FLEX™ Powered ENDOPATH® Staplers 45 mm and/or 60 mm (study devices) in a Korean population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Powered Surgical Stapler in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lung Resection Procedures in Korea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial assessed the use of a powered stapler for transection in VATS lung resection, where there is currently limited published clinical data. The primary study endpoint was occurrence and duration of air leak / prolonged air leak (PAL). Procedure details and perioperative outcomes associated with VATS lung resections were also evaluated.</detailed_description>
