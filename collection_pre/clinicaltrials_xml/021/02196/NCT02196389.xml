	<brief_summary>Several nasal dilators are currently commercially available, and can be applied endonasally (Airmax°, Nozovent and Nasanita°) or externally (Breath Right°). An objective comparison between these dilators has not been made so far, and would help the clinicians to advise the use of any of these dilators. From clinical experience, endonasal dilators are well supported and improve breathing better than the external dilators</brief_summary>
