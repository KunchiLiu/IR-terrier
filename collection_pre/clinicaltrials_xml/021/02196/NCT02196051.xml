	<brief_title>Basic Research Study to Examine the Relation Between Muscle Insulin Resistance and Lipid Production in the Liver.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study insulin resistant (IR), young offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes (18-46 years) and healthy, lean elderly individuals (65-90 years) will undergo 1H/13C MRS measurements of liver and muscle lipid and glycogen content before and after a high carbohydrate meal challenge. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis will be determined as the incorporation of deuterium, from deuterium labeled water (2H2O), into plasma triglycerides 5. These metabolic studies will be performed in 3 sets: Study Part 1: Resting, Study Part 2: After 1 bout of exercise and Study part 3: After 6 weeks of exercise training. Since intra-abdominal obesity has been postulated to be at the core of the metabolic derangements and directly responsible for the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with the metabolic syndrome, the investigators will also measure intra-abdominal fat content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</detailed_description>
