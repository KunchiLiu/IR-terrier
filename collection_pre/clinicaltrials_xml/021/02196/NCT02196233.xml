	<brief_summary>Trigger finger is a condition commonly treated with surgical intervention, yet no specific incision type has been associated with improved or worsened scar quality or outcome. Therefore, the investigators objective is to determine if the incision type may affect the results of operative treatment of trigger finger. Therefore, the goals of this study are as follows: Primary Objective: To directly compare incision type (transverse vs. longitudinal) for trigger finger release with scar quality and patient satisfaction via a validated scar evaluation scale. Secondary Objective: To directly compare incision type (transverse vs. longitudinal) for trigger finger release to patient outcome via a validated upper extremity outcome score.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients over the age of 18 presenting to the four attending surgeons (Don Coleman, Douglas Hutchinson, Andrew Tyser, Angela Wang) through either the University of Utah Orthopaedic Center or the Veteran Affairs Hospital will be evaluated for possible inclusion into the study Patients who fail conservative treatment and elect to proceed with open surgical release of the A1 pulley will be offered the option of being included in the study. Patients aged less than 18, previous failed surgical A1 pulley release, and patients receiving their care outside of the University of Utah Hospital system or the Veteran Affairs Hospital In addition, this study will evaluate trigger finger release; patients receiving treatment for trigger thumb will be excluded</criteria>
