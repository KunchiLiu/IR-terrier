	<brief_summary>This prescription-event monitoring study was based upon 'event' monitoring and so capable of identifying signals of events that might be associated with the use of tiotropium, which none of the participating general practitioners (GPs) suspected to be an adverse drug reaction. The methodology of this study readily permits follow up of specific events and the obtaining of additional data as appropriate.</brief_summary>
