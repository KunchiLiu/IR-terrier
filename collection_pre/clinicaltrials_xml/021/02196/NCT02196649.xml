	<brief_title>Clip Placement Following Endoscopic Mucosal Resection - Randomised Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The outlined literature suggests that colonic post EMR bleeding may be prevented by the use of prophylactic endoscopic clips. There has thus far been no prospective study to confirm this concept. The ideal way to prove the hypothesis is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluated the use of prophylactic clip placement on the EMR resection defect, for the purpose of preventing delayed bleeding in colonic wide field EMR (lesions&gt;20mm). Given the significantly increased rate of bleeding in the proximal colon, clip placement in this location may have the greatest benefit. If it is proven that such a prophylactic technique is effective and safe, it may lead to significantly decreased patient morbidity and health care resources associated with the management delayed bleeding.</detailed_description>
