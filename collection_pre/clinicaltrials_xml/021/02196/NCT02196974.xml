	<brief_summary>In patients with peripheral lung nodules, what is the additional diagnostic yield of biopsies obtained with flexible cryoprobes compared to standard techniques? For patients with peripheral nodules, we hypothesize use of the cryoprobe will allow larger samples of tissue to be obtained and therefore, will increase the diagnostic yield over conventional techniques</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Age &gt;18 years 2. Lung nodule (s) identified on CT scan 3. Clinical decision to obtain tissue biopsy of lung lesion 4. CT guided biopsy not preferred technique Previous negative CT guided biopsy Technically difficult nodule location Perceived high risk of pneumothorax or other complications 1. Lack of informed consent 2. Nodule less than 1 cm or greater than 6 cm long axis 3. Significant mediastinal adenopathy. 4. No suspected sites of disease outside the thorax amenable to biopsy 5. Evidence of endobronchial abnormality on chest CT 6. Medical contraindication to bronchoscopy 7. Patients with lesions highly suspicious for lung cancer, potentially resectable with lobar or lesser resection and without significantly increased operative risk factors will not be entered into this study prior to surgical evaluation. 8. Uncontrolled or irreversible coagulopathy platelets &lt;100 INR &gt;1.3 Use of clopidogrel in the 7 days prior to bronchoscopy 9. Confirmed or suspected pregnancy 10. Clinically unable to tolerate a pneumothorax or singlelung ventilation 11. Pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator if it is felt that ENB is needed</criteria>
