	<brief_summary>Background: High prevalence of fecal incontinence after rectal resection in patients with rectal carcinoma. Hypothesis: Anorectal manometry done before ileostomy or sigmoidostomy closure can predict fecal incontinence. Methods: Anorectal manometry before, 1 month and 6 month after closure. Anorectal endosonography before and 1 month after closure. Prediction of postoperative incontinence by the surgeon (digital sphincter examination). Visual analog scales for continence, subjective success of operation, and global well being; Wexner and Vaizey incontinence score; Parks incontinence classification; Rockwood fecal incontinence quality of life score; each before, 1 and 6 month after closure.</brief_summary>
