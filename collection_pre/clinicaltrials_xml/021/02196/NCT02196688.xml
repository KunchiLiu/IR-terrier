	<brief_title>Study of Fruquintinib in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer（CRC）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase II clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after second-line or above standard chemotherapy. After checking eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized into Fruquintinib plus BSC group (treatment group) or placebo plus BSC group (control group) in a ration of 2:1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.1). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Overall Survival (OS). Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.</detailed_description>
