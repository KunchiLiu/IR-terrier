	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To estimate the efficacy of adjuvant ipilimumab therapy in completely resected Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patients; i.e. the primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 12 months, defined as the number of patients alive and free of disease at 12 months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized. Secondary Objectives: To assess safety and additional efficacy parameters of the ipilimumab treatment in MCC, as well as to characterize potential biomarkers; secondary endpoints are: (i) adverse events according to CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), Version 4.0 criteria, that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of ipilimumab, (ii) Overall survival rate at 12 months, defined as the number of patients surviving at 12 months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy of Completely Resected Merkel Cell Carcinoma With 3 mg/kg BW Ipilimumab (Yervoy®) Versus Observation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare (incidence of 0.44 per 100,000), highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Indeed, MCC has a dramatically higher mortality rate after initial diagnosis than malignant melanoma (37 vs. 15 percent). This high mortality rate is largely due to the fact that to date there is no established adjuvant therapy for completely resected MCC, and none of the currently available therapeutic interventions is able to improve overall survival of patients suffering from metastatic disease. Consequently, new therapeutic strategies both for the adjuvant as well as the palliative setting are needed. Recently, the European Commission granted a clinical trial for metastatic MCC within the FP7 HEALTH2011.2.4.1-1 call. The present proposal aims at using this newly established network to investigate an adjuvant immune therapy for MCC. Epidemiologic data suggest that there are approximately 2500 new MCC cases per year within the EU (European Union), more than 1000 of these patients will die from their disease. MCC usually affects the elderly. The median age at diagnosis is 70 years, and there is a 5- to 10-fold increase in incidence after age 70 as compared with an age less than 60 years. Thus, with an ageing European population the impact of this deadly cancer will increase. As compared to most cancers, MCC is particularly linked to immune suppression. Indeed, 7.8% of MCC patients are profoundly immune suppressed, with a 16-fold over-representation of MCC compared with the normal incidence. Notably, the impact of immune surveillance on the course of MCC is much more pronounced than on that of melanoma: while the ratio of melanoma to MCC is 60:1 in the normal population, it is 6:1 in the immune suppressed population. Moreover, there are more than 20 reported cases of complete spontaneous regressions of confirmed MCCs, which suggest the ability of the immune system to exert a sudden immune recognition and clearance of this tumor. Notably, regressions may also be induced by cessation of immune suppression. Another line of evidence for the immunogenicity of MCC is the observation, that a strong inflammatory infiltrate, particularly CD8+ T cells, within the tumor is associated with a favorable prognosis. The immunogenicity of MCC can be explained by the recently recognized viral pathogenesis of this tumor entity. Indeed, preliminary data from our MCC research network suggest that immune dominant T-cell epitopes derived from the oncogenic virus elicit spontaneous immune responses in MCC patients. Consequently, immune modulating strategies are particularly attractive for the therapy of MCC. Ipilimumab/Yervoy® is a new therapeutic strategy targeting an immune checkpoint (CTLA-4), which has provided significant benefit in overall survival in two phase III trials in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. In the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg is currently being tested in patients of the clinical stages IIIA to IIIC (EORTC 18071; ECOG 1609). Given the well-established clinical benefit of ipilimumab in a tumor like melanoma, which is only moderately immunogenic, it is very likely that its impact in a highly immunogenic tumor like MCC will be even more impressive. Thus, an adjuvant randomized phase III trial with 3mg/kg ipilimumab in patients with completely resected MCC is warranted. The immune related adverse events of ipilimumab may be severe in cases, but they are all well manageable with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs, provided that they are detected early. Although the 10 mg/kg dose regimen has been shown to be the most efficacious in phase II trials in stage IV melanoma patients (CA 184-022, CA184-008, CA184-007), the 3 mg/kg regimen also provides clinical responses with a much lower rate of severe adverse events. Indeed, the 3 mg/kg dosage was used in one of the two positive phase III trials on in metastatic melanoma. Due to its safer toxicity profile, 3mg/kg ipilimumab is probably best suitable for an adjuvant use in patients with completely resected MCC. Almost half of the patients with completely resected MCC will relapse with loco-regional or distant metastases within the first two years after initial diagnosis of this highly immunogenic cancer. Consequently, an immune modulating therapy with ipilimumab (Yervoy®) is likely to improve the disease-free survival as well as the overall survival of MCC patients if given in an adjuvant setting.</detailed_description>
