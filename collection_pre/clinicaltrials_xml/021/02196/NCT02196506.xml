	<brief_title>Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Fixed-dose Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) as Adjunctive Therapy in the Treatment of Adults With Major Depressive Disorder With and Without Anxious Distress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction of atypical antipsychotics has created a renewed interest in adjunctive therapy for MDD, particularly for treatment-resistant MDD. Several atypical antipsychotics have been shown to enhance the response to ADT. This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole (2.0 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy to an assigned open-label ADT in depressed subjects with and without anxious distress.</detailed_description>
