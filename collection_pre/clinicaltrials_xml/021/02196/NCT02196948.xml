	<brief_summary>Therapeutic management of supraspinatus tendinopathy is conflicting. There is evidence that eccentric exercise protocols can be effective for this condition. The inclusion of other therapeutic modalities could help to the management of these patients. A new therapeutic approach, called Electrolysis Percutaneous Therapeutic (EPTE) has been clinically developed. The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of the inclusion of EPTE into a eccentric exercise protocol for the management of patients with unilateral supraspinatus tendinopathy</brief_summary>
