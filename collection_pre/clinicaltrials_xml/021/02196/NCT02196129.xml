	<brief_title>Immediate Pain Relieving Effects of Sinbaro-3 for Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients with LBP with moderate to severe pain(NRS&gt;6) were randomly allocated to 2 groups. The experimental group was treated with sinbaro-3 pharmacoacupuncture and the control group was treated with Hwangryun pharmacoacupuncture. All administrations were limited to 1 session, and comparisons of measurements were made before and after treatment. Primary outcomes were measured using the VAS scale. Post-treatment follow-up will be performed to measure primary outcomes at 30 minutes, 2hours, 4hours, and 6 hours after treatment. Before and after each measurement, the patients are asked to stand up and rotate their torso. At termination of the study, satisfaction levels of the patient's current status will also be collected.</detailed_description>
