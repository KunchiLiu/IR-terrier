	<brief_summary>Patients are being asked to participate in a research study because the patients are being treated for low back pain and the patients have decided to have an epidural steroid injection. Low back pain has a tremendous impact on the individual and society. It not only affects the individuals quality of life, it also contributes to lost productivity and increased health care costs. Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common treatment option for many forms of low back pain. They have been used for low back problems since 1952 and are still being used as a non-surgical form of treatment for low back pain. The goal of the injections is reduction of pain, increased quality of life and improved function. This study is being conducted to determine the outcomes of injections given at the "level of MRI Pathology" versus at the "level of clinical symptoms" to see if one is more effective than the other and to learn more about the characteristics of the two different injections.</brief_summary>
