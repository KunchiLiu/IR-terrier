	<brief_summary>Liver disease is one of the leading co-morbidities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in approximately 30-40% of patients with HIV infection. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of NAFLD in which increased liver fat is also accompanied by inflammation, cellular damage, and fibrosis. NAFLD is most prevalent in patients who also have increased visceral adiposity, and our group has previously shown that HIV-infected individuals with increased visceral adiposity generally have decreased growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue that increases endogenous growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is FDA-approved for the reduction of visceral fat in HIV-infected individuals. In a previous study, treatment with tesamorelin in HIV-infected individuals selected for abdominal adiposity reduced liver fat. The current study is designed to test the effect of tesamorelin on liver fat and steatohepatitis in HIV-infected individuals who have NAFLD. The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will reduce liver fat and will also ameliorate the inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular damage seen in conjunction with NASH.</brief_summary>

Individuals with mild diabetes that is wellcontrolled with diet and/or oral antidiabetic agents besides TZDs will be included. Use of oral antidiabetics must have been stable for ≥6 months prior to study entry. Known diabetic retinopathy. Known cirrhosis, or ChildPugh score ≥7, stage 4 fibrosis on biopsy, or clinical evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or exam. Chronic corticosteroid use except intermittent use of topical steroid creams and/or prior shortterm physiologic corticosteroid use in the ≤ 6 months prior to baseline visit Chronic use of methotrexate, amiodarone, or tamoxifen Known diagnosis of Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, or autoimmune hepatitis Use of GH or GHRH within the past 1 year Change in lipid lowering or antihypertensive regimen within 3 months of screening HgB &lt; 11.0 g/dL, CD4 &lt; 100 th/mm3, or HIV viral load &gt; 400 copies/mL Active malignancy For men, history of prostate cancer or evidence of prostate malignancy by PSA &gt; 5 ng/mL Severe chronic illness judged by the investigator to present a contraindication to participation History of hypopituitarism, head irradiation or any other condition known to affect the GH axis Use of physiologic testosterone (men) or estrogen or progesterone (women) unless stable use for a year or more prior to study entry Routine MRI exclusion criteria such as the presence of a pacemaker or cerebral aneurysm clip Previous weight loss surgery For women, positive pregnancy test performed in a CLIA certified laboratory using a test with a sensitivity of at least 25mIU/mL, or breastfeeding. Known hypersensitivity to tesamorelin or mannitol Unwillingness to abstain from the conception process during the study (i.e., must agree not to participate in an active attempt to become pregnant or impregnate, donate sperm, or participate in in vitro fertilization) Unwillingness to use one (for males) or two (for females) reliable methods of contraception while engaging in heterosexual intercourse during the study. Acceptable methods for women include hormonal contraception (estrogen/progesterone or progesteroneonly formulations) if stable for a year or more prior to study entry, intrauterine device, or barrier methods (condom, or diaphragm with spermicide). Acceptable methods for males include condom use. This requirement does not apply to women who have been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone surgical sterilization, or to men who have undergone surgical sterilization or have documented azoospermia.
