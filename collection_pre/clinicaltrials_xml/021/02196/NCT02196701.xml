Other biologic therapies (including any other antiTNF) within 4 weeks of the Baseline Visit; 3. Any investigational agents of chemical or biologic nature within a minimum of 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to the Baseline visit ; 4. Any other systemic drug therapies for Ps within 4 weeks of the Baseline Visit; 5.
