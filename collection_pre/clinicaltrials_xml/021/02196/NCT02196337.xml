	<brief_title>Salt Iodization: Meeting the Needs of Pregnancy, Lactation and Infancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because pregnant women, lactating women and infants are the groups most vulnerable to iodine deficiency and its irreversible consequences, programs should focus on these groups. But like other mass fortification strategies, it is uncertain whether USI can meet the increased dietary requirements of pregnant women, lactating women and infants. Objective of this study to test whether USI can meet the dietary requirements of iodine in women of reproductive age, pregnant women, lactating women and infants up to 2 years of age without causing excess iodine intake in school children and non-pregnant non-lactating women. The study hypothesis is that USI, when fortified at adequate levels and applied to all salt consumed, including both household salt and salt used for processed foods, provides adequate dietary iodine for all population groups, except for weaning infants; while not posing any risk of excessive iodine intakes in other age groups.</detailed_description>
