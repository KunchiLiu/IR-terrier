	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the wear of two different polyethylene liners (E-Poly and ArcomXL, Biomet inc.) of primary total hip arthroplasty. This study is divided into one main study and three sub-studies. - The main study investigates the wear of the liner using radiostereometric analysis (RSA) with five years follow-up. A two year follow-up analysis will be reported. - Other studies i) investigate the cup migration in respect to the pelvis between two different femoral head sizes (32- and 36-mm), ii) clinical outcome score (Harris Hip Score, SF-36, UCLA, EQ5D) will also be evaluated. An explorative study will be conducted investigating the possibility of using a bi-plane technique as RSA to detect the rigid body segment of the hip with a reduction of roentgen dose.</brief_summary>
