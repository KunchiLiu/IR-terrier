	<brief_summary>The purpose of this post-market observational study is to assess the effectiveness and patient perception of benefit of the ReVENT Sleep Apnea System in patients diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea due to primary tongue base closure. The ReVENT Sleep Apnea System is a minimally invasive surgical approach to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea. The ReVENT Sleep Apnea System consists of an implanter kit and tongue implants. The implants are permanently implanted in the tongue during a minimally invasive outpatient surgical procedure to prevent tongue base closure during sleep.</brief_summary>
