	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the consistency of 3 lots of inactivated VZV vaccine for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in healthy adults. The primary hypothesis of the study is that the 3 lots of inactivated vaccine will demonstrate similar immunogenicity at 28 days after the fourth dose.</brief_summary>
