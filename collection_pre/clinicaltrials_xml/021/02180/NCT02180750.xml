	<brief_summary>Memory Work Therapy (MWT) has been developed to improve psycho-social outcomes for children living with HIV who are orphaned. This phase 2 trial aims to determine whether attending the intervention improves outcomes compared to standard care. We aim to test the hypothesis that attendance at MWT improves psychological symptoms, self-esteem, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and self-efficacy compared to standard care.</brief_summary>
