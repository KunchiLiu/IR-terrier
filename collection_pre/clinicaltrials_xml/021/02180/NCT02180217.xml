	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male or female patients aged 1875 years Patients must have confirmed Cushing's disease that is persistent or recurrent as evidenced by: 1. mUFC&gt; 1.5 x ULN (mean of three 24hour urine samples collected within 14 days) 2. morning plasma ACTH above lower limit of normal 3. confirmation of pituitary source of excess ACTH is defined by any of the following three criteria: (1) MRI confirmation of pituitary adenoma &gt; 6 mm; OR (2) bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS) with either CRH or DDAVP stimulation for patients with a tumor &lt;/= 6mm. The criteria for a confirmatory BIPSS test are any of the following: predose central to peripheral ACTH gradient &gt; 2; postdose central to peripheral ACTH gradient &gt; 3 after either CRH or DDAVP stimulation; OR (3) histopathologic confirmation of an ACTHstaining adenoma in patients who have had prior pituitary surgery. Patients with a history of prior pituitary surgery must be at least 30 days postsurgery to be eligible for inclusion in this study. Use of other investigational durgs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives at the time of enrollment, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations, and for any other limitation of participation in an investigational trial based on local regulations. history of hypersensitivity to LCI699 or to drugs of similar chemical classes. hisotry of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metasteses. patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes, including: patients with a baseline QTcF &gt; 470ms, personal or famiily history of long QT syndrome, or concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval, hypokalemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesemia.
