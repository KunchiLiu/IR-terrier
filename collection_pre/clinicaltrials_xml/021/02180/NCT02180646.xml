	<brief_title>Impact of Breakfast Composition on Glycemic and Incretin Responses in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve habitual breakfast consumers with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were recruited for the study. They completed two, 7-day conditions in random order with a minimum of a 7-day washout period between study days. They consumed either a high protein (PRO) or high carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast for 6 days of acclimatization, and on the seventh day, they reported to the lab at 0700 hours following a ~12 hour overnight fast and underwent forearm catheterization before a baseline blood draw. The participants consumed the respective breakfast at ~0730 hours. Four hours post-breakfast, subjects consumed a standard lunch meal. Blood samples were taken continuously throughout the 8-hour test day.</detailed_description>
