	<brief_summary>Background: The increase in life expectancy and the rise in the ratio of older to younger people in the population has resulted in an increase in the number of those suffering from a decrease in cognitive ability, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methylphenidate can improve cognitive ability, mainly in memory and executive function. Working hypothesis and aims: This study examines the effect of Ritalin treatment in older people suffering from MCI. Our hypothesis is that treatment with Ritalin will improve cognitive function in those suffering from MCI, especially in the domains of attention and executive function. Methods A randomized, double-blind, case-control study. 120 patients older than 65 years of age diagnosed as suffering from MCI in the past year in geriatric assessment facilities in Beersheva. Patients will be randomized in equal groups to either the study group (Ritalin treatment) and control group (placebo). Each participant will attend the geriatric unit for four consecutive days: on the day prior to beginning the intervention participants will undergo cognitive assessment at 9:00 am. On the intervention days (days 2-4) participants will undergo cognitive assessment at 9:00 in the morning, followed by the administration (at 10:30) of different doses of Ritalin (10, 20 and 30mg) every day of intervention. Participants in the control group will receive placebo. Two hours after taking the drug or placebo participants in both groups will be assessed cognitively by means of Mindstreams and MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Expected results: Ritalin treatment will improve the cognitive function of the subjects, mainly in the domains of concentration and executive function</brief_summary>
