Diet was standardized during the day of testing. Participants reported to the lab for testing sometime between 3 - 5:30 p.m. and upon arrival a venous catheter was inserted into a forearm vein. Frequent blood sampling, indirect calorimetry measurements, and subjective well-being measurements ensued for ~5.75 h while the participants were in the lab.</detailed_description>
