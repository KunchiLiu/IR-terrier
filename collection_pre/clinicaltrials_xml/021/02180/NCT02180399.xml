	<brief_summary>Determination of capillary lactate by using "point-of-care" technique is accessible, fast and allows to quantify the circulatory and metabolic dysfunction caused by sepsis. Compared to conventional assay techniques in arterial blood, capillary assay technique may have an increased susceptibility to metabolic alterations induced by sepsis in its initial stages. This increased sensitivity is not necessarily relevant in the management of the most serious patients for whom the diagnosis is obvious, but it could be very useful in patients for whom a diagnosis of severe sepsis or shock have not yet been adopted, particularly to help better identify patients who would require intensive management and avoid the installation of these serious disorders.</brief_summary>
