	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind parallel arm randomized trial aimed to assess efficacy and safety of intravenous Tenecteplase compared to intravenous Alteplase in eligible patients who present with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke within 3 to 4.5 hours from onset.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase in Ischemic Stroke Management (TALISMAN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who present within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset and who meet the inclusion criteria for intravenous (IV) thrombolysis will receive, in a randomized, double-blind fashion, either IV Alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg per standard protocol or IV Tenecteplase at 0.25 mg/kg with saline infusion over one hour. Patients must also have no exclusion criteria for IV thrombolysis within the 3 to 4.5 hour window. The only required imaging is non-contrasted CT of the head. Patients will be monitored according to standard post-thrombolytic care. A CT of the head will be performed at 24 hours based on standard protocol or if there is any neurological change. Neurological function at 24 hours using NIHSS and at 3 months based on modified mRS and the NIHSS.</detailed_description>
