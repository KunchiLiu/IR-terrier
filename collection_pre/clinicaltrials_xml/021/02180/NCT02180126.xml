	<brief_summary>A positive Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasm Antibody (ANCA) test administered to patients with a high probability for vasculitis has high sensitivity and specificity for vasculitis. A positive ANCA test result in those patients who do not have a high probability for vasculitis requires extensive follow-up because those patients eventually present with malignancy or other inflammatory diseases. The investigators wish to investigate the correlation between the differing levels of positive ANCA tests and their relationship to vasculitis, malignancy and inflammatory diseases.</brief_summary>
