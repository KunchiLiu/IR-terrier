	<brief_summary>The presence of binge eating (BE) is a core feature of bulimic syndromes. Binge eating disorder (BED) is a new category in DSM-5 highly associated with higher body mass index (BMI). The neural mechanisms that underlie BE are of great interest in order to improve treatment interventions. Brain mechanisms underlying drug and food craving are suggested to be similar. These mechanisms demonstrated hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex and lack of regulatory influence from lateral prefrontal circuits. Several novel studies began to assess the potential benefits of brain stimulation in reducing craving and associated addictive behaviors with promising results. Previous findings testing a one-off session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in healthy women identified as strong cravers and individuals with bulimia nervosa or bulimic-type eating disorders reported reduction of food craving and BE, providing evidence to support a broader and deeper investigation of the benefits associated with rTMS. Importantly, the use of brain imaging studies contributes to the understanding of psychiatric disorders and underlying mechanisms being target by the rTMS intervention. Objectives: The primary aim is to investigate the effects of rTMS over BE frequency. Secondary aims include the evaluation of the effects of rTMS on food craving, body weight, brain activity, cognition, general psychopathology, hormonal regulation and neurobiological markers. Methods: Sixty obese females with BED will be randomized to receive 20 sessions of rTMS (n=30) or placebo (n=30) scattered 3 days/week. Expected Results: Primarily it is expected that rTMS intervention will decrease BE frequency. Consequently, body weight will be reduced. It is also expected that food craving be decreased, cognitive performance be enhanced, and neurobiological markers be improved.</brief_summary>
