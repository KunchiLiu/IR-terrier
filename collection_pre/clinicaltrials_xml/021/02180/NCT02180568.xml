	<brief_summary>The study object is to demonstrate the usefulness and safety of lipiodol localization technique for individuals undergoing ground-glass opacity (GGO) Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) resection compared to hook wire localization technique. A total of 250 participants will be enrolled in a 1:1 fashion to Lipiodol or Hook-wire groups. If the aims of this study are achieved, the use of lipiodol localization technique will be widespread their application for localization of non-palpable pulmonary lesions that are indicated for VATS resection.</brief_summary>
