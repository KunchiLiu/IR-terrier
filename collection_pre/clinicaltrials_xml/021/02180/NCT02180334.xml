	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of combined administration of mosapride as modulator of gastrointestinal motility and DPP-4 inhibitor on secretion of gut hormone such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and oral glucose tolerance. Additionally, change in lipid profile and insulin secretion will be also assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Combination of Mosapride and DPP-4 Inhibitor on Plasma Concentration of Incretin Hormones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. After screening and enrollment, participants will take 5 mg of linagliptin once a day for one week of run-in period (Day 1 to Day 7). Randomization will be done on Day 8 to assign the participants to either mosapride arm or placebo arm. If a subject is assigned to mosapride arm, mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) will be performed after taking mosapride with linagliptin. If a subject is assigned to placebo arm, he/she will take placebo instead of mosapride before MMTT. On Day 9, all subjects will be crossed over to the other arm and MMTT will proceed with medication depending on their arms. Gastric emptying time measurement with paracetamol will be done along with MMTT. Plasma incretin hormone levels in two arms will be compared.</detailed_description>
