	<brief_summary>Stress hyperglycaemia is commonly observed during hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been shown to adversely influence outcome. It has been hypothesized that, when it occurs in previously non-diabetic patients, it reflects a latent disturbance of the glucose metabolism. Assessing the incidence of this phenomenon and identifying its risk factors could support prevention, detection and early treatment of impending diabetes mellitus type 2. We will perform a glucose tolerance test approximately 6-9 months post-ICU admission to screen for disorders of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we examined characteristics that could have predicted the post-discharge disturbances: patient characteristics, parameters of disease severity and of glucose metabolism, as well as the FINDRISC (Finnish Diabetes Risc Score). We plan to enroll 400 patients.</brief_summary>
