	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of every-3-week dosing (Q3W) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced melanoma; participants may receive pembrolizumab for up to 2 years if deriving clinical benefit. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with single agent pembrolizumab will result in a clinically meaningful overall response rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Melanoma (MK-3475-041/KEYNOTE-041)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants who discontinue pembrolizumab after achieving a complete response (CR) and subsequently develop progressive disease (PD) may be eligible to enter a Second Course Phase and receive pembrolizumab again. The end of the study for each participant will occur with: 1) the marketing approval of pembrolizumab for melanoma, 2) the completion of safety follow up or 3) the time when a possibility of entry to second course of treatment is lost, whichever occurs last.</detailed_description>
