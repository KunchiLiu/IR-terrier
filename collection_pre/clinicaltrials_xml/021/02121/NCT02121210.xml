	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of Sarilumab Administered as Monotherapy in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total study duration is up to 34 weeks: Up to 4-week screening period, 24-week open-label treatment phase, 6-week post-treatment observation. After completion of the treatment phase of this study, patients are eligible to enter a long term safety study (LTS11210 - SARIL-RA-EXTEND) for continuous treatment with sarilumab (SAR153191 [REGN88]).</detailed_description>

Exclusion criteria: Patients &lt; 18 years of age. Past history of, or current, autoimmune or inflammatory systemic or localized joint disease(s) other than RA. History of juvenile idiopathic arthritis or arthritis onset prior to age 16. Severe active systemic RA, including but not limited to vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and/or Felty's syndrome. Prior treatment with any biologic antiinterleukin 6 (IL6) or IL6 receptor (IL6R) antagonist therapies. Treatment with prednisone &gt; 10 mg or equivalent per day, or change in dosage within 4 weeks prior to randomization. New treatment with or doseadjustment of ongoing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to randomization, except for the use of lowdose acetylsalicylic acid for cardiovascular diseases. Use of parenteral glucocorticoids or intraarticular glucocorticoids injection within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Prior treatment with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (tofacitinib). New treatment or doseadjustment to ongoing medication for dyslipidemia, such as statin, within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Participation in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug or therapy within 5 halflives or 60 days of first dose of study drug administration, whichever is longer. Patients with a history of malignancy other than adequatelytreated carcinoma insitu of the cervix, nonmetastatic squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, within 5 years prior to the randomization visit. Nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorders are also excluded. Patients with active tuberculosis or untreated latent tuberculosis infection. Pregnant or breast feeding women.
