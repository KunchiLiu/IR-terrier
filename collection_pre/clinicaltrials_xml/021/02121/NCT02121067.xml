	<brief_summary>This is a study of 50 postpartum women interested in having the Mirena® LNG-IUS placed for contraception. The Mirena® is an FDA approved intrauterine contraceptive device that provides contraception for 5 years with excellent effectiveness. Women enrolled in this study will only have the Mirena® placed at two-weeks postpartum (day 14-20 postpartum). The participants will be followed at 6-weeks and 6-months postpartum for study visits to evaluate for satisfaction, symptoms, expulsion, and perforation. The study will be completed at six-months postpartum, and participants will be able to keep their LNG-IUS following study completion.</brief_summary>
