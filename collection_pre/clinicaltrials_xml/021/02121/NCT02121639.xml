	<brief_summary>The aim of the ProCAID study is to determine if the addition of the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 to docetaxel and prednisolone (DP) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) in Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to a degree worthy of further investigation</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically proven mCRPC with documented metastases (measurable or evaluable disease is acceptable) now eligible for treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy 2. Disease progression since the last change in therapy defined by one or more of the following according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria (J Clin Oncol 2008;26:11481159): i. PSA progression as defined by the prostate cancer working group (2) (PCWG2) criteria (Scher et al. 2008 J Clin Oncol. 26; 1148). This must be based on a series of at least 3 readings at least 7 days apart. The 3rd reading must be &gt;= 2ng/ml. In the event where an intermediate reading is lower than a previous reading, then the patient will still be eligible (ie. the 3 readings do not need to be consecutive). The first of the three readings must have been obtained after commencing the previous systemic therapy, or, in the case of androgen receptor antagonists, after discontinuing. ii. Radiographic progression of nodal or visceral metastases as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228). See Appendix 5 iii. The appearance of two or more new bony metastases 3. Serum testosterone &lt;1.7 nmol/L (ongoing LHRH analogue or antagonist therapy is permitted to maintain a castrate state) 4. Discontinuation of prior therapies for prostate cancer ≥ 4 weeks prior to commencing study treatment (with the exception of an LHRH agonist or antagonist where required for ongoing testosterone suppression) 5. No antiandrogen withdrawal response. Withdrawal responses typically occur following combined androgen blockade (LHRH analogue/antagonist or orchidectomy combined with an antiandrogen) as initial therapy for a prolonged period, or in patients who respond to an antiandrogen as secondline therapy. Consistent with PCWG2 guidelines, investigators should evaluate such patients for withdrawal response for 6 weeks and then confirm disease progression. Investigators need not wait to assess withdrawal response in patients who did not respond, or who showed a PSA decline for ≤ 3 months, after an antiandrogen was administered as a secondline or later intervention 6. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 7. Hb ≥ 9g/dL; platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x109/L 8. Bilirubin ≤ ULN ; ALT and AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN 9. Sodium and potassium within the normal range for the site 10. Able to swallow study drugs (without crushing/opening in the case of AZD5363) 11. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months 12. Aged 18 years or over 13. Provision of written informed consent 1. Previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (patients may have received previous or ongoing bisphosphonates or denosumab). There are no restrictions on prior use of second generation hormonal therapies e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide 2. Prior malignancy with an estimated ≥ 30% chance of relapse within 2 years following curative treatment 3. Previously identified brain metastases, or spinal cord compression unless treated with full functional recovery 4. Prior radiotherapy to &gt; 30% of bone marrow 5. Administration of an investigational agent within 30 days of first dose of study medication 6. Type I or II diabetes mellitus requiring either insulin or oral hypoglycaemics for routine management. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus that is well controlled by dietary measures alone are eligible to participate. Patients found to have a fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L (≥126 mg/dL) or glycosylated haemoglobin &gt;8% (64 mmol/mol) at screening should be assessed for appropriate management according to local policy. Those in whom dietary measures alone provide good diabetic control will be eligible for inclusion 7. Malabsorption syndrome, previous gastrointestinal surgery, or other gastrointestinal condition that may affect drug absorption 8. Coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or congestive heart failure (NYHA ≥ grade 2) within the last 6 months 9. Abnormal echocardiogram (LVEF &lt;LLN) 10. Uncontrolled hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 mmHg) 11. QTc interval of &gt;480 msec at two or more time points within a 24 hour period 12. Proteinuria (3+ on dipstick analysis or &gt;500 mg/24 hours) or creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min 13. Proteinuria (either 3+ on dipstick analysis or &gt;500 mg/24 hours) or creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (assessed as per local practice e.g. by Cockcroft and Gault estimation) 14. Exposure to potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 or substrates of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's Wort) 15. Unresolved toxicity ≥ grade 2 (except alopecia) from previous cancer therapy 16. Patients with a partner of childbearing potential who are not using a highly effective method of contraception, who are unwilling to use condoms during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug 17. Known hypersensitivity to AZD5363, its excipients, or drugs in its class 18. Previous exposure to agents with the following mechanisms of action: inhibition of AKT (e.g., MK2206, GDC0068, GSK2110183, GSK2141795)any inhibitor with PI3K pharmacology (e.g., GDC0941, XL147, BKM120, PX866, BYL719, AMG319, GDC0032, INK1117, INK119) any compound with mixed PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase pharmacology (e.g., BEZ235, GDC0980, PF04691502, PF05212384, GSK2126458, XL765) or any mTOR kinase inhibitor (e.g., AZD8055, AZD2014, OSI027, INK128) Note: Do not exclude patients previously treated with a rapalogue (allosteric inhibitor of mTOR; mTORC1 complex inhibitor) including temisirolimus (Torisel; Pfizer), everolimus (Affinitor; Novartis), ridoforolimus (Ariad).</criteria>
