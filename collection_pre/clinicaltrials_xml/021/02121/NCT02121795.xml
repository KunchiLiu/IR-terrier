	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of switching from emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) fixed dose combination (FDC) to emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) FDC in HIV-1 positive participants who are virologically suppressed on regimens containing FTC/TDF. This study will consist of a 96 week double-blind treatment period. After Week 96, all participants will continue on blinded study drug treatment and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded. All participants will return for an unblinding visit and will be given the option to receive open-label F/TAF and attend visits every 12 weeks until F/TAF is commercially available, or the sponsor terminates the F/TAF clinical development program.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Currently receiving antiretroviral regimen containing FTC/TDF in combination with one third agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening. Plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay) and not experienced two consecutive HIV1 RNA above detectable levels after achieving a confirmed (two consecutive) HIV1 RNA below detectable levels on the current regimen in the past year. Plasma HIV1 RNA should be &lt; 50 copies/mL at the screening visit. Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula for creatinine clearance Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 × the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin (individuals with documented Gilbert's syndrome or with Atazanavirassociated hyperbilirubinemia may have total bilirubin up to 5 x ULN) Adequate hematologic function Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN Females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active, or practice abstinence from screening throughout the duration of the study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of the study drug. Females who have stopped menstruating for ≥ 12 months but do not have documentation of ovarian hormonal failure must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level at screening within the postmenopausal range based on the Central Laboratory reference range. Females who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing. Males must agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse or be nonheterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence from first dose throughout the study period and for 30 days following the last study drug dose. Key A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and HCV RNA detectable Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy, etc.) Individuals receiving ongoing treatment with bisphosphonate to treat bone disease (eg, osteoporosis) Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 Visit Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with any of the medications not to be used with FTC, TAF, TDF or other antiretroviral third agents. Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
