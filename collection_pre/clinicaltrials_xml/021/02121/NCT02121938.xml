	<brief_title>Dynamics of the Microbiome in the Premature Infant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study team will collect samples of blood and stool from preterm infants once a week from the first week of life until 8 weeks after delivery. Blood samples will be collected from left over blood that is being collected for clinical management. No extra blood draws will be done for research purposes only. Samples of leftover breast milk will be collected once weekly from the first week of life until 8 weeks after delivery. While the baby is in the hospital the study team will collect information about the growth and development as well as events that happen during their intensive care nursery (ICN) hospitalization. In addition, blood and stool will be collected, as well as information about the growth when the infant returns to the Duke Special Infant Care Clinic for developmental check-ups at 6 and 12 months of age. The blood will be approximately 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) and will be done at the same time that labs for clinical management are being done. A single maternal blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) and stool sample will be collected after delivery. Information will also be collected from the medical record.</detailed_description>
