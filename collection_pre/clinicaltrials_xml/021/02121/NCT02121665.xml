	<brief_summary>Periodontal disease is an infectious disease resulting in inflammation within supporting tissues of the teeth, progressive attachment loss, and bone loss. Epidemiological studies reveal that about 10% of the adult population suffer from severe periodontitis.It comprises of two distinct but interconnected etiologic components: the periodontopathic bacteria adjacent to the periodontal tissues, and the host-mediated connective tissue-destructive responses to the causative bacteria and their metabolic products. In the arena of periodontics, the probiotics pose a great potential of plaque modification, halitosis management, altering anaerobic bacteria colonization, improvement of pocket depth, and clinical attachment gain. Aim of the study is to analyze the beneficial effect of probiotic lozenges as an adjunct to Scaling and Root Planing, on clinical and biochemical parameters.</brief_summary>
