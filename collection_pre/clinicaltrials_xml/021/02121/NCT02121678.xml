	<brief_summary>Resistance and aerobic exercise has been shown to be effective for maintenance of muscle strength in patients with neuromuscular diseases. Exercise in CIDP and MMN is sparsely described. The aim of the study is to evaluate changes in muscle strength during high intensive resistance training and changes in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2-max) during high intensive aerobic training in patients with CIDP or MMN in maintenance therapy with subcutaneous immunoglobulin. The hypotheses are that muscle strength and VO2-max are significantly increased during the training sessions.</brief_summary>
