	<brief_summary>In France around 5,000 colostomies are performed after elective or emergency surgery. These colostomies could be associated with major outcomes including parastomal hernia (4 - 53%) of cases. To reduce the incidence of these outcomes, several methods have been proposed but the more pertinent consist in the use of a biological mesh during the stoma's conception. Nevertheless there is no data on the use of a biological mesh (StratticeTM) for the prevention of parastomal hernia.</brief_summary>
