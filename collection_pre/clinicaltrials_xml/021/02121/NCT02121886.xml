	<brief_title>The Parietal Peritoneum as a Substitute Graft for Venous Reconstruction in HPB Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improvements in surgical techniques, perioperative management and effective chemotherapy regimens, have increased the resectability of malignant hepatobiliary and pancreatic tumors when associated with vascular invasion. Therefore, simultaneous vascular resection is increasingly required to obtain an adequate resection margin and improve patient definite survival. Although most vascular resection associated with pancreatectomy can be reconstructed by simple venorraphy or end-to-end anastomosis, a segmental or lateral vacular graft (VG) can be necessary in 8-12 % of cases. Vascular reconstruction can be planned preoperatively if the vascular invasion is evident and an appropriate VG can be prepared. Differents sources of VG are available including autogenous veins , synthetic such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) , cryopreserved and veins from the resected liver. However the decision to perform vascular resection may be made during dissection due to vascular invasion or injury and even occasionnally taken while the mesentericoportal vein (MPV) or vena cava (VC) are occluded. In this emergency situation, an urgent and easily available graft is necessary to prevent prolonged ischemia. The difficulty of anticipating the need for these vascular resections during HPB surgery, has lead certain authors including those in our group to use either the veins from the resected liver, the umbilical vein or the parietal peritoneum (PP) for vena cava reconstruction. The aim of our study is to evaluate the safety and outcome of the parietal peritoneum as a substitute patch for venous reconstruction during HPB surgery in emergency and elective situations.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients admitted to HPB unit and schudeled for major liver or pancreatic resections with suspected venous invasion. Venous invasion is suspected on CT scan (vein narrowing or disappearance of the fat plane between the vein and the tumor) performed within 1 month of surgical resection. Informed consent will be obtained and the parietal peritoneum will be used as a substitute graft for resectionreconstruction in these patients if intraoperative exploration confirmed this venous invasion Patients who refuse to participate and patients with suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis or if intraoperative exploration confirmed the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis</criteria>
