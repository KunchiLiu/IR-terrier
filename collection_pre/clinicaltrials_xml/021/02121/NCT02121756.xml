	<brief_title>Dipyridamole for Immune Activation in HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Since HIV-infected individuals started taking anti-HIV medications, illnesses from AIDS have decreased, but other serious diseases have increased. Researchers think this may be caused by an increase in activity of the immune system that fights infection, leading to inflammation. Inflammation is a normal body reaction to any infection. However, if inflammation lasts a long time, like in HIV infection, it may lead to complications such as heart disease, cancer, liver disease, lung disease, and problems with thinking. Many HIV researchers are studying the harmful effects of this prolonged immune system activity and inflammation and possible ways to prevent these complications. - A drug called dipyridamole is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the trade name Persantine® for use with other drugs to reduce the risk of blood clots after heart valve replacement. Laboratory studies have shown that dipyridamole also lowers the level of immune system activity and inflammation measured in the blood. Objectives: - To see how dipyridamole affects blood and lung tests to measure immune system activity and inflammation and to look at the safety and tolerability of dipyridamole in people infected with HIV. This use of dipyridamole is investigational, or not approved by the FDA; however, the dose to be used in this study, 100mg four times a day, is the dose approved by the FDA. Eligibility: - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have HIV infection and are taking medications to treat it, and have a low viral load (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) for a minimum of 12 months. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam, blood test, and medical history. Women of reproductive age will also receive a pregnancy test. - Participants will take either Dipyridamole or a placebo for 12 weeks. Then they will take Dipyridamole for 12 weeks. - During the study, participants will have frequent blood and urine tests. Dipyridamole drug levels, and liver and kidney function tests will be performed. HIV viral load (the amount of virus in the blood) will also be studied. - Participants will have a final follow-up visit after an additional 4 weeks. - Four brachial artery ultrasound images will be taken. - Four pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry tests will be performed by participants enrolled under Version 2.0: after each pre-test spirometry, participants will be asked to inhale 4 puffs of albuterol, and then to repeat the spirometry for post-testing. - Participants will receive rectal swabs at screening, and four flexible sigmoidoscopies with rectal biopsies of the sigmoid colon throughout the study. These studies of the lower colon and samples of the rectum will be used to explore the effects of Dipyridamole. Participants can, however, opt out of all rectal procedures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. On ART for at least 12 months prior to study entry with a regimen that includes three or more antiretroviral medications. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL by any standard clinical assay at screening and for a minimum of 12 months prior to entry, confirmed by at least 2 measurements prior to study entry, one of which must be at least 48 weeks prior to study entry and one of which must be 61 days and 48 weeks prior to study entry. All plasma HIV1 RNA measurements in the 12 months prior to study entry must be &lt;50 copies/mL (with the exception that a single detectable measurement of ≤ 200 copies/mL is permitted if the RNA levels immediately before and after are &lt;50 copies/mL). Stable ART regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry and no plans to change ART regimen for at least 6 months following study entry. Ability and willingness to provide informed consent. In the opinion of the investigator, no medical, mental health or other condition that precludes participation. Laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to entry. Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 INR ≤ 1.5 (for rectal tissue subset only) PTT &lt;2x ULN (for rectal tissue subset only) AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN (except if hyperbilirubinemia is secondary to atazanavir). Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Hepatitis B surface antigen negative Hepatitis C antibody negative (note: subject with HCV Ab positive is eligible if Hepatitis C RNA PCR (viral load) is undetectable) For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 72 hours prior to study entry. Females of reproductive potential include women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, (i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, specifically hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy). Females of reproductive potential who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree to use one method of acceptable contraception while receiving protocolspecified treatment and for 4 weeks after stopping the treatment. These methods include condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; intrauterine device (IUD); and hormonebased contraceptive. Females not of reproductive potential (girls who have not reached menarche, women who have been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, or women who have undergone surgical sterilization, e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive. Self report is acceptable documentation of sterilization, other contraceptive methods, and menopause. Rectal Tissue Subset only: Willing to abstain from receptive anal intercourse and practices involving insertion of anything in the rectum (drug, enema, penis, or sex toy) for 72 hours prior to rectal biopsy and for 7 days postbiopsy to minimize risk of bleeding complications.

NOTE: Abnormalities of the colorectal mucosa will be assessed at the time of the enrollment flexible sigmoidoscopy. If no significant colorectal abnormalities or symptoms are present then the participant will undergo the enrollment procedures. If abnormalities are present then no biopsies will be performed and the participant will not be enrolled into the rectal tissue subset but will continue participation in the main study.
