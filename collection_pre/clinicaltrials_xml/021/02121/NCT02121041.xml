	<brief_title>Ambulatory vs Office BP Management Usual Care for Diagnosing and Managing Hypertension: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The usual strategy for detecting hypertension—repeated office blood pressure (BP) measurements—is inefficient and inaccurate. When paired with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), which takes a multitude of measurements over 24 hours, it is clear that office BP measurements may convey a falsely positive diagnosis known as white-coat hypertension. What is less well-known is that office BP measurements may also convey a falsely negative diagnosis termed masked hypertension (MH). That is, office BP may measure as normal, yet 24-hour ambulatory measurements show elevated BP. People with MH have cardiovascular risk that is similar to that of people with diagnosed hypertension, yet MH goes unrecognized, and therefore, untreated. Ultimately, identifying the best strategy for accurately detecting hypertension is vital to improving overall BP control and reducing cardiovascular events. Without a feasible ABPM strategy, MH will continue to go unrecognized and untreated. Participants enrolled in the study will be randomized to either the usual care group or the ABPM-guided group. All participants will have a baseline ABPM. ABPM will be used to make a diagnosis and determine anti-hypertensive treatment in the ABPM-guided group only. Participants in the ABPM-guided group will have a follow-up ABPM in 2 months. All participants will have a final ABPM 4 months after enrollment.</detailed_description>
