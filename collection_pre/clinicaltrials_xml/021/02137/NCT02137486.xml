	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bifurcation lesions prone to occur with the worsening of atherosclerosis. Their structural properties make angioplasty technique to increase the difficulty of implementation, but also increased the risks of the in-stent thrombosis and restenosis. Standard treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions remains controversial manner, especially when the side branch (SB) was large combined with high angulated bifurcation lesions. Complex procedures and certain types of lesions are associated with poor prognosis. There is no standard treatment for such lesions even with the development of drug-eluting stents solve partial problems. The investigators reviewed patients who received coronary intervention between 2009-2012 years and met the inclusion criteria, and then analyzed the prognostic relevance of these cases the use of different treatment modalities .</brief_summary>
