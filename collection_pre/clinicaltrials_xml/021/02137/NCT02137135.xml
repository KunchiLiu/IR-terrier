	<brief_summary>Fluctuations of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle influence pain perception. Endogenous pain is pronounced in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The investigators tested the primary hypothesis that the women having surgery during their follicular phase have more acute pain and require more opioids than those in the luteal phase, and secondarily the investigators tested that women who have surgery during their follicular phase have more incisional pain at 3 month postoperatively.</brief_summary>
