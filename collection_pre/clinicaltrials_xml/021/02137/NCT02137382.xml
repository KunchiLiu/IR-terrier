	<criteria>Signed informed consent given by the subject, or the parents, or a legally acceptable representative. If required by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), assent will be given by the subject Age ≥ 12 years Subjects who are able to swallow capsules with each meal and snacks Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) confirmed by two positive chloride sweat tests or gene analysis Diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency proven by: 1. Coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) &lt; 70% without supplementation 2. or Human fecal elastase &lt; 50 μg/g stool Currently receiving treatment with a commercially available pancreatic enzyme product and on a continuous dose of this product for more than 3 months Clinically stable condition without evidence of acute respiratory disease within 1 month of enrollment Stable body weight defined as no more than a 5% decline within 3 months of enrolment Females of childbearing potential should agree to continue using a medically acceptable method of birth control throughout the study and for 30 days immediately after the last dose of study drug. Medically acceptable methods of birth control include bilateral tubal ligation or the use of either a contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection (DepoProvera™), an intrauterine device, or an oral contraceptive taken within the past 3 months where the subject agrees to continue using during the study or to adopt another birth control method, or a doublebarrier method which consists of a combination of any two of the following: diaphragm, cervical cap, condom, or spermicide. Evidence of cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital, gastrointestinal/hepatic (except underlying disease), hematologic/immunologic, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, dermatologic/connective tissue, musculoskeletal, metabolic/nutritional (except underlying disease), endocrine (except diabetes mellitus), neurologic/psychiatric, allergy, recent major surgery, or other relevant diseases as revealed by history, physical examination and/or laboratory assessments, which could limit participation in or completion of the study History of acute abdomen History of fibrosing colonopathy History of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) within 6 months prior to enrollment Solid organ transplant or surgery affecting the large bowel other than appendectomy Small bowel surgery that significantly affected absorptive capacity (e.g. gastrectomy or pancreatectomy) Pregnancy or lactation Any type of malignancy involving the digestive tract in the last 5 years Celiac disease or Crohn's disease Known allergy to pancreatin or inactive ingredients (excipients) of pancreatin capsules Suspected noncompliance or noncooperation Intake of experimental drugs within 30 days prior to study start Mental disability or any other lack of fitness, in the Investigator's opinion, to preclude subject's participation in or ability to complete the study Diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus in medical history.</criteria>
