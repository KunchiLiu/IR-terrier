	<brief_title>Assessing the Efficacy of Clomiphene Citrate in Patients With Azoospermia and Hypoandrogenism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypogonadism (low testosterone level) is frequently observed in men presenting with non obstructive azoospermia. Controversy exists regarding the efficacy of preoperative hormonal manipulation in patients with hypogonadism. However, it is possible that hormonal therapy increases intra-testicular testosterone levels, and with a rise in serum testosterone, sperm production and surgical success with microTESE improve.</detailed_description>
