	<brief_summary>The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital, Shandong University and other several well-known hospitals in China.

	<brief_title>A Multicentre Investigation of 2 Cycles Rituximab Compared With Standard Regimen in Management of Steroid-Resistant/Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia （ITP）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 60 refractory ITP adult patients from medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive rituximab (given intravenously at a dose of 375mg/m(2) weekly for 2 weeks, i.e. Day 1, 8; the others are selected to receive standard rituximab treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 cycles, i.e. Day 1, 8, 15, 22). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy compared to conventional rituximab therapy for the treatment of adults with steroid-resistant/relapsed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).</detailed_description>
