	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-8228 for the prevention of clinically-significant CMV infection in adult, CMV-seropositive recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The hypothesis being tested is that MK-8228 is superior to placebo in the prevention of clinically-significant CMV infection through 24 weeks after transplant.</brief_summary>
