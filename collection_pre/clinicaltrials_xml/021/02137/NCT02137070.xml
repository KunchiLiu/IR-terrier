Another group will not choose to have any weight loss surgery. All research participants will be tested on thinking and memory processes at the start of the study, after 12 weeks, and again at 18 months. They will have an MRI Brain Scan at those same times also to look at changes in the structure and function of the brain tissue. Blood tests will be done to measure the sugar levels in the blood, and other proteins that may act as markers for disease.</detailed_description>
