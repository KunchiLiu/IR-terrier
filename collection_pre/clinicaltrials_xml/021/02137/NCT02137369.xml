	<brief_summary>While there are many effective options for treating a major depressive episode, there are no clinical markers that predict the likelihood of remission with an initial trial of either an antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. The goal of this study is to test how brain function changes in depress patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to patients treated with escitalopram ((s-CIT) - Lexapro®), an FDA approved antidepressant. The study aims to determine if bran scan findings might help physicians to select the most effective antidepressant treatment for an individual patient. At total of 150 male and female outpatients who are between 21-55 years old will be enrolled. Participation in the study will last from 14-26 weeks. Subjects will be randomized to receive either escitalopram (s-CIT) or CBT for 12 weeks. Resting-state positron emission tomography (PET) and BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans will be done before the treatment begins, and again at the end of treatment (week 12). Non-responders to s-cIT or CBT will be crossed over to receive an additional 12 weeks of treatment with the alternative intervention.</brief_summary>
