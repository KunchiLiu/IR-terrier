	<brief_title>Stop Vasodepressor Drugs in Reflex Syncope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several drugs which are commonly used in clinical practice, such as antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic and psychiatric drugs, are associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope. This phenomenon is much more evident in the elderly and with multiple therapies. The present study was aimed to investigate, in patients affected by reflex syncope, the clinical effects (reduction in syncope recurrence and associated symptoms) and the laboratory tests (negativization of carotid sinus massage and tilt table test) when such drugs are discontinued or reduced</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients assuming chronic (&gt;1 year) vasoactive therapy affected by reflex recurrent (&gt;2 episodes) syncopes who have a positive dominant vasodepressor or mixed response to tilt table test and/or carotid sinus massage 1. Orthostatic hypotension defined as fall in systolic blood pressure &gt;20 mmHg during the first 3 minutes of active standing 2. Competing diagnosis of syncope different from hypotensive reflex syncope 3. Reflex syncope with negative response to carotid sinus massage and tilt table test 4. Cardioinhibitory reflex syncope which requires permanent cardiac pacing 5. Severe hypertension which requires treatment (&gt;150/95) 6. Structured heart disease which requires hypotensive therapy in order to prevent acute heart failure 7. Cardiac hypotensive therapy in order to prevent recurrences 8. Previous stroke or transient ischemic attacks</criteria>
