	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to establish a modified minimally invasive surgical technique for sinus floor augmentation with a residual bone height of 3-6mm. Hypothesis: The investigators expect that the present surgical technique allows to achieve an adequate implant bed of at least 10mm height after a healing period of 3-5 months. Further the modification of the technique enables a reduced patient stress level.</brief_summary>
