	<brief_summary>The Investigator would like to see if taking a DHA supplement at a dose recommended for heart health will improve brachial artery dilation (relaxation) and help blood pressure. As a second goal the Investigator would like to see if this supplement can delay preterm delivery by improving heart health. In this research study, the Investigator is asking pregnant women with chronic high blood pressure to take Expecta (DHA - Martek Biosciences, now known as DSM Nutritional Lipil) during the last half of their pregnancy until six weeks after they deliver their baby.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docosahexaenoic Acid Supplementation of Women With Hypertension in Pregnancy to Improve Endothelial Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Investigator will be supplementing pregnant mothers with Expecta. This is an over the counter supplement often used by pregnant and nursing mothers and will be given to expectant mothers during the research study. This DHA supplement is available to anyone at most any store. The dose often used over the counter is 200mg, we are testing the heart recommended dose of 1000mg. Because the Investigator is using the heart health recommended dose and because there may be a health claim, the Investigator is doing the study using an FDA- food and drug administration IND. IND means investigational drug. This dose has recently been used safely and effectively in pregnancy both here in the United States and in Australia in hundreds of women. There are no risks to the fetus as the placenta prefers to transfer this important nutrient for fetal eye and brain development. The large studies done in pregnancy have followed their babies into school age and found no adverse effects.</detailed_description>
