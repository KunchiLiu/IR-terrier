	<brief_summary>The investigators want to demonstrate that there is an optimal expiratory pressure when using mecanical in-exsufflation for each patient in neuromuscular disease. This compromise is between the need to generate a high pressure difference between alveoli and the mouth and the need to avoide and superior airways collapsus.</brief_summary>
