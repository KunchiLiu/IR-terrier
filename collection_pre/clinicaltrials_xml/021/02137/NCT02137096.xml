	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to evaluate the response rates for patients undergoing high dose conditioning chemotherapy using Etoposide, Carboplatin and Ifosfamide followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC) in children, adolescents, and young adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma has shown promise when compared with standard chemotherapy. This study has been designed to evaluate response rates and toxicities associated with undergoing high dose conditioning with Etoposide, Carboplatin and Ifosfamide followed by autologous stem cell transplantation support in the treatment of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children, adolescents, and young adults.</detailed_description>
