	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to provide preliminary indicators of the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with continuous glucose monitoring compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose alone on: (1) metabolic control and (2) fear of hypoglycemia. Additional objectives will be: (1) to provide an estimate of recruitment rates, (2) to assess compliance with allocated treatment, and (3) to determine participants' satisfaction with allocated treatment. With increased and immediate information related to current and future (trend) glucose information provided by the continuous glucose monitor, children can then act upon this knowledge to prevent hypo- or hyperglycemia, thus, experiencing a reduction in glucose variability, leading to an improvement in metabolic control as shown by a reduction in HbA1c levels. Research on the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring on metabolic control in children with T1D using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion has been limited. Therefore, a pilot clinical trial will be designed to provide preliminary indicators of the feasibility and acceptability of continuous glucose monitoring on metabolic control and address the following objectives.</brief_summary>
