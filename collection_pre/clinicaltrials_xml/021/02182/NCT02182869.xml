	<criteria>1. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older 2. A diagnosis of COPD as defined by American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with a baseline FEV 1 &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1/FVC &gt;=70%. 3. A smoking history of more than ten packyears. A packyear is defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year 4. Able to perform technical satisfactory pulmonary function test 5. Able to be trained in the proper use of a MDI 6. Having signed an informed consent from prior to participation in the trial 7. Affiliation to the French social security system or beneficiary of such a system 1. Significant disease other than COPD. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study 2. Clinical relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the patient is excluded 3. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt;80 IU/L; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt;80IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0mg/dL or creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dL 4. Serum potassium level above or below the normal range 5. Total blood eosinophil count &gt;=600/mm続 6. Recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction 7. Recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy 8. History of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the last five years 9. History of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis 10. History of thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. History or a thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion criteria no. 1 11. History of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy 12. History of or active alcohol or drug abuse 13. Known active tuberculosis 14. Upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the six weeks prior to screening visit or between the screening visit and visit 2 15. Known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction 16. Known narrowangle glaucoma 17. Current significant psychiatric disorders 18. Regular use of daytime oxygen therapy 19. Use of betablocker medications, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants 20. Use of cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium 21. Use of antihistamines. 22. Use of oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six weeks on a stable dose before screening visit or a change between the screening visit and visit2) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day or 20mg every other day 23. Use of oral betaadrenergics or longacting betaadrenergics such as salmeterol (Serevent速) and formoterol in the two weeks prior to the screening visit or between the screening visit and visit 2 24. Changes in the therapeutic plan within the last six weeks prior to the screening visit or between the screening visit and visit 2, excluding changes from long acting or oral betaadrenergics to short acting inhaled betaadrenergics for purposes of this trial 25. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception 26. Known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic or betaagonist drugs or any other component of either Combivent速 formulations 27. Use of an investigational drug within one month or six half lives prior to the screening visit 28. Previous participation in this study 29. Patient deprived of their freedom by a judicial or administrative decision 30. Patient leaving in medical or social establishments 31. Patient hospitalized for mental disorder without his (her) consent 32. Patient under guardianship 33. Patient in emergency situations</criteria>
