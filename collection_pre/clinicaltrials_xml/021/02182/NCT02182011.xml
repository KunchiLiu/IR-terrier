	<brief_summary>Primary objective: to evaluate the procoagulant effect of TNK-tPA compared to rt-PA and streptokinase, administered to patients with AMI, by measuring the concentration of TAT at 2 hours after the start of treatment versus baseline values. Secondary objective: change from baseline in concentration of TAT at 6 and 24 hours; change from baseline in concentration of D-dimers, F1+2, PAI-1, PAP at 2, 6 and 24 hours. Incidence of adverse events (AE's), in -hospital complications, major or minor bleedings and serious adverse events.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Onset of symptoms of AMI within 6 hours from randomisation A twelvelead electrocardiogram (ECG) showing STsegment elevation ≥ 0.1 millivolt (mV) in two or more limb leads, or ≥ 0.2 mV in two or more contiguous precordial leads indicative of AMI, or new left bundlebranch block Age ≥ 18 Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt; 180/110 mmHg (systolic BP &gt; 180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 110 mmHg) on repeated measurements during current admission prior to randomisation Use of abciximab (ReoPro®) within the preceding 7 days or eptifibatide (Integrilin®) or tirofiban (aggrastat®) within the past 48 hours Use of heparin within the preceding 12 hours Current therapeutic oral anticoagulation Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within 2 months Any minor head trauma and any other trauma occurring after the onset of the current myocardial infarction Any known history of stroke or transient ischemic attack or dementia Any known structural damage of the central nervous system Ruptured aortic aneurism Active bleeding Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt; 10 minutes) in the previous two weeks Pregnancy or lactation, parturition within the previous 30 days. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test Any known active participation in another investigative drug study or device protocol in the past 30 days Previous enrolment in this study Any other condition that the investigator feels would place the patient at increased risk if the investigational therapy were initiated Inability to follow the protocol and comply with followup requirements</criteria>
