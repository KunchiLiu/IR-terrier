	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether 2 puffs of fixed combination of aerosolized 120 mcg salbutamol sulphate (equivalent to 100 mcg of the base) + 20 mcg ipratropium bromide confers significant additional protection against metacholine induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic atopic patients when compared to 2 puffs of aerosolized 100 mcg salbutamol alone.</brief_summary>
