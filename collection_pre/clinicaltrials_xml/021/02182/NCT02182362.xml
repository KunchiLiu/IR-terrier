	<brief_summary>The main objective was to investigate the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 201335 NA in healthy male subjects without Gilbert's syndrome or polymorphism (GS) following oral administration of a single dose (Day 1) and repeated doses (Days 4-24) of 20 mg, 48 mg, 120 mg, and 240 mg. Additionally, the safety, tolerability, and the PK of the highest tolerated dose of BI 201335 NA (determined during the multiple-rising-dose phase) were assessed in healthy male subjects with GS over a 28-day continuous drug administration period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy males according to the following criteria: Complete medical history, physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate), 12lead ECG (electrocardiogram), and clinical laboratory tests Age ≥18 and Age ≤55 years BMI ≥18.5 and BMI ≤30 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and the local legislation Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Subjects with polymorphisms associated with Gilbert's syndrome will be excluded from the initial 4 groups of the multiple rising dose phase of the study. However, only subjects with Gilbert's polymorphism will be allowed to participate in the last group which will be treated with the highest tolerated dose determined in the multiple rising dose phase of the trial Prior history of jaundice for subjects without Gilbert's polymorphism Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong the QT/QTc interval within 30 days prior to screening until trial completion Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial Smoking (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day) Inability to refrain from smoking during the trial Alcohol abuse (more than 60 g/day) Inability to refrain from alcohol during the trial Drug abuse Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the trial) Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms) A history of additional risk factors for TdP (Torsades de points) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)</criteria>
