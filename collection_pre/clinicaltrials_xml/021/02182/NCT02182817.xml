	<brief_summary>This prospective cohort study aims to determine if apparently healthy children with no significant co-morbidities who undergo general anaesthesia for minor surgery before 1 year of age will develop measurable deficits in neurocognitive development compared to apparently healthy children with no significant co-morbidities who do not undergo general anaesthesia or surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that healthy children exposed to general anaesthesia for minor surgery before 1 year of age will have significantly lower neurocognitive scores at 6,18, 24 and 36 months of age compared with age, and gender matched healthy children from the GUSTO cohort without prior exposure to general anaesthesia or surgery.
