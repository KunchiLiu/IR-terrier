	<criteria>Healthy male or female subjects determined by results of screening with a creatinine clearance &gt;80 mL/min (group 1, control group) Renally impaired male or female subjects determined by results of screening with the following creatinine clearance results: creatinine clearance &gt;50 ≤80 mL/min (group 2) creatinine clearance &gt;30 ≤50 mL/min (group 3) creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min (group 4) uraemia requiring maintenance dialysis (group 5) Signed written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Age &gt;=18 and &lt;=75 years BMI &gt;=18.0 and &lt;=32 kg/m2, at least 45 kg for females Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Clinically relevant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic or hormonal disorders Surgery of gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy, cholecystectomy or herniotomy) Clinically relevant diseases of the central nervous system Relevant history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Abnormal prothrombin time (PT), TT, aPTT (must be within the normal range after no more than one repeated test), thrombocytes &lt;150000/μl (two repeats of the first test) Evidence of haematuria either macroscopically detectable or microscopic on urinalysis (normal microscopic results after no more than one repeated test) Evidence of blood dyscrasia, haemorrhagic diathesis, severe thrombocytopenia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, bleeding tendencies associated with active ulceration or overt bleeding of gastrointestinal, respiratory or genitourinary tract or any disease or condition with haemorrhagic tendencies (e.g. cerebral aneurysm, dissecting aorta, central nervous system (CNS) trauma, retinopathy or nephrolithiasis) Recent or contemplated diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding (e.g. spinal puncture, lumbar block anaesthesia, surgery of CNS or eye or surgery resulting in large open surfaces) within 14 days before or after drug administration of this clinical trial Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator For women with childbearing potential: no reliable contraception (accepted methods are intra uterine device, hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, condoms) or pregnancy (known or detected by a positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding period Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) (&lt;1 month prior to administration or during the trial) Use of any drugs, within 14 days prior to administration or during the trial Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (&lt;2 months prior to drug administration or during trial) Drug abuse Blood donation or loss &gt;400 mL, &lt;1 month prior to administration or during the trial Excessive physical activities &lt;5 days prior to administration of study drug or during trial Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities Renally impaired subjects (groups 2, 3, 4 and 5) who met any of the following criteria were not be entered into this trial: Moderate and severe concurrent liver function impairment (e.g. due to hepatorenal syndrome) Clinically relevant gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic or hormonal disorders Surgery of gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy, cholecystectomy or herniotomy) Clinically relevant diseases of the central nervous system Relevant history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Abnormal values for PT, TT, aPTT and thrombocytes considered by the investigator or one of the coinvestigators to be clinically relevant Evidence of blood dyscrasia, haemorrhagic diathesis, severe thrombocytopenia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, bleeding tendencies associated with active ulceration or overt bleeding of gastrointestinal, respiratory or genitourinary tract or any disease or condition with haemorrhagic tendencies (e.g. cerebral aneurysm, dissecting aorta, CNS trauma, retinopathy, nephrolithiasis) considered by the investigator or one of the coinvestigators to be clinically relevant Recent or contemplated diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding (e.g. spinal puncture, lumbar block anaesthesia, surgery of CNS or eye or surgery resulting in large open surfaces) within 14 days before or after drug administration of this clinical trial Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator For women with childbearing potential: no reliable contraception (accepted methods are intrauterine device, hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy or condoms) or pregnancy (known or detected by a positive pregnancy test) or breastfeeding period Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (&lt;2 months prior to administration or during trial) Drug abuse Blood donation or loss &gt;400 mL, &lt;1 month prior to administration or during the trial Excessive physical activities &lt; 5 days prior to administration of study drug or during trial Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities except those values typical for renally impaired patients</criteria>
