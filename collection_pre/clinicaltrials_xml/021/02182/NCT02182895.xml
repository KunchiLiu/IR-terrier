	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called saxagliptin (Onglyza) for treatment of type 2 diabetes in non-critically ill hospitalized patients who have an HbA1c of 7.5 or lower, on 1 or no non-insulin agent at home, or an HbA1c ≤7.0% on ≤ 2 non-insulin agents at home.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Saxagliptin for Glycemic Control in Non-Critically Ill Hospitalized Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current professional organization guidelines recommend insulin as the preferred treatment for hospitalized patients. It is recommended that most critically ill patients should receive insulin infusion therapy and non-critically ill patients should receive basal bolus insulin therapy in the hospital. The study will test the hypothesis that treatment with saxagliptin is non-inferior to treatment with basal bolus insulin in this group of patients during their hospital stay. The study will evaluate the effect of saxagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, on glycemic control in non-critically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) The primary outcome will be mean daily blood glucose levels during hospital days 2 to 5. The study is designed to detect a non-inferiority margin of 20% in the saxagliptin group as compared to the control group</detailed_description>
