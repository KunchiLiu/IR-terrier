Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0 or 1 6. Written informed consent that is consistent with ICHGCP guidelines 1. Prior treatment for NSCLC including chemotherapy, biologic response modifier therapy, or any investigational drug 2. Participation in another clinical study within the past four weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with this study 3. Active brain metastases (stable for &lt;28 days, symptomatic, or requiring concurrent steroids or antiepileptic therapy) 4. Centrally located tumors with radiologic evidence (CT or MRI) of local invasion of major blood vessels 5. Cavitary or necrotic tumors 6. Sanguinous pleural effusion due to disease or pericardial effusion suspicious for disease 7.

Other active malignancy diagnosed within the past 3 years (other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer) 10. Gastrointestinal abnormalities that would interfere with intake or absorption of the study drug, such as a requirement for intravenous alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, treatment for peptic ulcer disease within the last 6 months, active gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to cancer (as evidenced by either hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena in the past 3 months and without endoscopic documented resolution), or malabsorption syndromes 11. Significant cardiovascular disease (i.e., uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable angina, serious cardiac arrhythmia, ≥NYHA Grade 2 congestive heart failure) 12. History of hemorrhagic or thrombotic event (including transient ischemic attacks) in the past 12 months 13. Clinically significant hemoptysis (1 teaspoon or more) in the past 3 months 14. Concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation (except heparin flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device) or antiplatelet therapy (except chronic lowdose daily aspirin &lt;325 mg) 15.
