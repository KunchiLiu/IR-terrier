	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety and Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBF 1120 combination therapy with docetaxel and prednisone in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Secondary objectives were to characterise the pharmacokinetic profiles of BIBF 1120 and docetaxel and possible Pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between BIBF 1120 and docetaxel and to obtain preliminary information on anti-tumour activity.</brief_summary>
