In this regard, however, subjects who meet one of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: FPG (Fasting plasma glucose) ≥110mg/dL eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) &lt;60 abnormal value of urinalysis Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms) A history of additional risk factors for TdP (torsade de pointes) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome)Samsung2014 Renal glucosuria or elevated urinary glucose levels at screening (&gt;15 mg/dl) Any abnormal finding in Kidney or patients who have history of renal disease Any other clinical conditions that investigator or subinvestigator judges that the subject is ineligible for study participation</criteria>
