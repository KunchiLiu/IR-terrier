Acceptable methods of contraception for male volunteers include a vasectomy no less than three months prior to dosing, barrier contraception, or a medically accepted contraceptive method. For female partners of male volunteers, acceptable methods of contraception include intrauterine device, tubal ligation, hormonal contraceptive for at least two months, or diaphragm with spermicide Participation in more than one other radiolabelled investigational drug trial within one year prior to administration of the trial drug. The previous radiolabelled trial drug must have been received more than six months prior to administration of the trial drug for this study, and the total exposure from this study and the previous study will be within the recommended levels considered safe (e.g., less than 5000 mrem whole body annual exposure) Irregular defecation pattern (less than one bowel movement a day)</criteria>
