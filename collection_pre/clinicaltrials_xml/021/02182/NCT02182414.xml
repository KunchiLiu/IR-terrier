	<brief_summary>Study to investigate the relative bioavailability of 5 new 400 mg tablet formulations (trial formulation II prototypes) of BI 207127 compared to the current 200 mg BI 207127 tablet formulation (trial formulation I) in healthy male volunteers with the aim to identify the best formulation for further drug development (formulation finding part / trial part 1) and to investigate the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of the most promising one of these trial formulation II prototypes (food-effect part / trial part 2).</brief_summary>
