	<brief_summary>To assess the metabolic profile, to obtain the mass balance after oral administration, to determine the concentration of [14C]-radioactivity in blood cells, plasma, urine and faeces, to determine BIBF 1120 and BIBF 1202 concentrations in plasma, urine, and faeces, if feasible, to determine the protein binding of [14C]-radioactivity, to determine the pharmacokinetics of BIBF 1120, BIBF 1202 and total radioactivity after a single oral administration of [14C]-BIBF 1120 in healthy volunteers</brief_summary>

History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells and blackouts 5. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders 6. Chronic or relevant acute infections 7. History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator 8. History of any bleeding disorder including prolonged or habitual bleeding, other haematologic disease or cerebral bleeding (e.g. after a car accident) or commotio cerebri 9. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within 1 month prior to administration 10. Planned use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to administration or during trial 12. Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) or inability to refrain from smoking on study days 13. Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60 g/day) 14. Drug abuse 15. Blood donation within 1 month prior to administration or during the trial 16. Excessive physical activities within 5 days prior to administration or during the trial 17.

Male subjects must agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming pregnant from the dosing day until 3 months after the completion of the study. Acceptable methods of contraception for male volunteers include a vasectomy no less than 3 months prior to dosing, barrier contraception or a medically accepted contraceptive method. For female partners of male volunteers, acceptable methods of contraception include intrauterine device, tubal ligation, hormonal contraceptive since at least two months and diaphragm with spermicide</criteria>
