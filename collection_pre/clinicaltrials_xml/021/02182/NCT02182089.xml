	<brief_summary>The overall goal is to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a measure of autoregulatory adequacy derived from CVInsight and compare it with other measures in recognizing hypotensive events during hemodialysis..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Cardiovascular Stress in Patients on Hemodialysis Study II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Assess the accuracy of a new rule set for CVInsight® in predicting intradialytic hypotensive episodes. 2. Assess the comparative predictive accuracy of CVInsight® to other measures with regard to intradialytic hypotensive events. 3. Assess estimated dry weight goals by monitoring post-dialytic vascular refill using CVInsight® and other measures. 4. Assess hemodialysis(HD)-induced myocardial injury by monitoring the occurrence and frequency of arrhythmias and the levels of cardiac Troponin T.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility shall consist of the following: Age ≥ 20 years old Speaks and understands English, Spanish or Chinese Provides Informed Consent Patients with 20% intradialytic hypotensive events over the last two months. Exclusion criteria for both groups: Unstable hemodialysis patients per judgment of the clinician prior to the start of the treatment Patients unable to have blood pressure cuff measured on the upper arm Inability to wear monitor on forehead Patients treated with sodium or ultrafiltration profiling and the patient's nephrologist is unwilling to alter this for the study treatments Patients unwilling to shave the anterior chest Patients with active infection of the upper chest wall tissue. Patients with a deep brain stimulator, as it may disrupt the quality of the ECG data. Patients who are unwilling to take short showers versus bathing during the 7 day period . Patients who require intradialytic testing (ie transonic) during the monitored treatment.</criteria>
