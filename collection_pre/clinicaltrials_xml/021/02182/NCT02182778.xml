	<brief_title>GEM/Cisplatin/S-1 vs GEM/Cisplatin for Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine/cisplatin combination therapy (GC) has been the standard palliative chemotherapy for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). Investigators have evaluated the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine/cisplatin/S-1 combination therapy (GCS) for patients with advanced BTC and observed the promising efficacy. In this randomized phase â…¢ study, investigators aimed to compare GCS with GC in patients with advanced BTC.</detailed_description>
