	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial was to quantify the effect of oral single-dose (480 mg) and steady-state BI 201335 NA (240 mg BID) on intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) probe drugs as a means of predicting drug interactions. The AUCs for the probe drugs caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and digoxin were assessed.</brief_summary>
