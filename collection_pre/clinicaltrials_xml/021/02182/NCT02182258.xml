	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of BIBF 1120 administered as intravenous (iv) infusions of 1, 3, 10, and 20 mg, and to assess the absolute bioavailability of orally administered 100 mg BIBF 1120 as soft gelatine capsules. A secondary objective was the exploration of the pharmacokinetic (PK) of BIBF 1120 after single iv dosing, including dose proportionality.</brief_summary>
