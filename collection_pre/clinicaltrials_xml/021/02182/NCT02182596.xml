	<brief_summary>For several years, the effective standard induction chemotherapy for AML has been limited to the association of anthracycline and aracytine. GO is the first effective targeted antibody used in leukemia patients. In a previous study, we showed efficacy and safety of fractionated doses of GO used as a single agent for treatment of adult AML patients in first relapse. In the present study the possibility of combining fractionated doses of GO to escalated doses of a 3+7 regimen old is studied in relapsed AML patients &gt; 50 and &lt;70 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Induction course are: GO 3mg/m2 on days 1, 4,7 + the three dose levels were as follows: level 1: DNR: 45 mg/m2 x 3 days + AraC: 100 mg/m2 x 7 days level 2: DNR: 60 mg/m2 x 3 days + AraC: 100 mg/m2 x 7 days level 3: DNR 60 mg/m2 x 3 days + AraC: 200 mg/m2 x 7 days. with 20 mg of methylprednisolone prior to each GO infusion. Consolidation course: patients in CR may receive 2 additional courses of consolidation chemotherapy with Amsacrine 90 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, and Ara-C (1g/m2/12 hours x 3 days) + GO 3 mg/m2 on day 1. Treatment with HSCT is offered at the discretion of the physician in charge of the patient. A delay between last infusion of GO and HSCT above 3 months is recommended</detailed_description>
