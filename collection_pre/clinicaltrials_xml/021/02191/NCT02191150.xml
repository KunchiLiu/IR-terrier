	<brief_title>Study of Haemodialysis Patients Switching From Aranesp to Biosimilar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biosimilars were approved in 2007 by the EMA in EU and in 2010 by the TGA in Australia. This study will look at the retrospective data of patients that have switched from Darbepoetin Alfa to an approved epoetin alfa biosimilar. Data will be collected for the 26 week period prior to switch and a 26 week period post switch to a biosimilar. Data to be collected includes haemoglobin measurements, dose requirements, iron use, any transfusions, hospitalisations and other lab values including TSAT, Ferritin and albumin. Data from the study will be published.</detailed_description>
