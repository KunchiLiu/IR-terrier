	<brief_title>Medical Abortion up to 10 Weeks Gestation at Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include 600 women opting for medical abortion. Women wanting to perform the last part of the abortion in their homes will be invited to participate. 300 women with a pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation (63 days) will be compared to 300 women with a gestation length between 64 and 70 days of gestation. The primary endpoints will be number of patients with an incomplete abortion, with a need for surgical or pharmaceutical intervention. Secondary endpoints include duration of bleeding, acceptance and satisfaction with the method and number of additional visits to the clinic/facility. The study will be performed in five abortion clinics in Sweden.</detailed_description>
