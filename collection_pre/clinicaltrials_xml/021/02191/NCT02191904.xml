	<brief_summary>To ensure minimal cervical motion during the intubation of trauma patients is important for the prevention of cervical spine injury (CSI) or further deterioration of existing CSI. Intubation is required to secure the airway in patient during an anesthesia management or a mechanical ventilation at intensive care units. Laryngoscopes are the assisting tools for intubations. The most widely used laryngoscope type is one with a Macintosh blade. However, various types of laryngoscopes have been developed to be used for in case of difficult intubations, the intubation of the patients with head and neck trauma, or the intubation attempts carried out by inexperienced individuals. Truview EVO2® and Airtraq® are newly developed laryngoscopes, integrated with an optical view system. The Truphatek TruView EVO2® (Truphatek International Ltd, Netanya, Israel) is a recently introduced, easy viewing type of laryngoscope, modified from the blades of Macintosh type laryngoscopes, having an angle of 46° at the end of blade and including a camera system that magnifies the image. The Airtraq® laryngoscope (ATQ; King Medical Systems, Newark, DE) is also a newly developed type of laryngoscope, including optical imaging system. There is a channel on the device for the placement of the endotracheal tube. Endotracheal tube is inserted into the channel before the laryngoscopy. It has been reported that Airtraq is a novel single use laryngoscope which provides glottis display without any deviation in the normal position of the oral, pharyngeal or the tracheal axes. In the literature, there are many studies comparing the effects of these newly developed laryngoscopes on cervical motions in different scenarios with cadavers and normal patients. However, in these studies, individual vertebral motion was reported during the placement of the tube, while the angulation of the head and neck and the difficulty of the intubations were not clear. In this study our first hypothesis was cervical motion during endotracheal intubation in Truview EVO2® and Airtraq® types of laryngoscopes is lesser than Macintosh. The second one was the endotracheal intubation time is similar to the Macintosh that is used more often.</brief_summary>
