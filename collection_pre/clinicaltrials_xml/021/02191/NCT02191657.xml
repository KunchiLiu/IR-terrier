	<brief_title>Antiretroviral Activity and Pharmacokinetics of Deferiprone in Healthy Volunteers and Asymptomatic HIV-infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three cohorts were enrolled: two of individuals who were asymptomatically infected with HIV and one of healthy volunteers. Dosages were as follows: - Cohort 1 (asymptomatic HIV infected subjects): 33 mg/kg deferiprone three times daily for a total of 99 mg/kg/day - Cohort 2 (healthy volunteers): 50 mg/kg deferiprone three times daily for a total of 150 mg/kg/day - Cohort 3 (asymptomatic HIV infected subjects): 50 mg/kg deferiprone three times daily for a total of 150 mg/kg/day</detailed_description>

For Cohort 2: HIVnegative For Cohorts 1 and 3: HIV1 positive; CD4 count of at least 300/mm3; HIV1 RNA copies (viral load) &gt;10 000 copies/mL serum; and current physical health stable and not requiring antiretroviral treatment For Cohorts 1 and 3: Chest xray showing absence of active infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis, viral or atypical bacteria or parasitic infection). Presence of any severe concomitant disease. History of or current, recurrent or recent (4 weeks) febrile disease. History of opportunistic infections, neoplasm or AIDSdefining conditions. Inability to discontinue any medication from screening onwards, or for at least 2 weeks before the first admission; in particular any antiviral or therapy with immunosuppressive activity. Significant liver impairment: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2.5 times the upper normal limit. Significant kidney impairment: serum creatinine ≥ two times the upper normal limit. Any concomitant disorder or resultant therapy likely to have interfered with subject compliance or with study procedures. Known hypersensitivity to any of the test materials or related compounds. Positive test for Hepatitis B and/or C antibodies. A history of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of anaphylactic reactions. History of seizures or epilepsy.</criteria>
