	<brief_title>Internet-delivered CBT for Adolescents With OCD: A Randomized Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for adolescents (12 - 17 years) with OCD. We aim to conduct a randomized controlled study with N = 66 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to ICBT or a wait list condition, either lasting 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Study participants will be followed up 3 and 12 months after treatment. ICBT is expected to yield significantly better symptom reduction than the wait list condition.</detailed_description>
