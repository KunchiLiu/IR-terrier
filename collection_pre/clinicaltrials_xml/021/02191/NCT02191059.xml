	<brief_summary>1. There is as yet no optimal treatment regimen for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene wild type non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . 2. Icotinib is a new type of small molecule EGFR TKI, developed and patented by Zhejiang BetaPharma Co., Ltd.(Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, Patent No. WO2003082830). It has the similar anti-tumor activity with gefitinib, erlotinib. Pre-clinical studies showed icotinib could significantly inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Notably, anti-tumor activities were observed in patients with advanced NSCLC. 3. In this study, we will evaluate the efficiency of intermittent high dose of Icotinib in combination with Docetaxel as second-line treatment for NSCLC patients with wild type EGFR. The overall response rate(ORR),progression free survival(PFS) ,overall survival(OS) and health related quality of life(HRQoL) will be monitored.</brief_summary>
