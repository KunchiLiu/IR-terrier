	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study in to analyse the way in which the body processes Niagen (nicotinamide riboside) in healthy people. Blood and urine samples from subjects who are given a dose of Niagen will be analyzed for metabolites over the 24 hours after taking the dose.</brief_summary>
