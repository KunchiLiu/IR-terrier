	<brief_summary>This study examined whether dietary-induced reductions in lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma affected metabolic profiles in PBMCs and plasma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Intervention Replacing Carbohydrate With Protein and Fat Has Greater Effect on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Metabolites Than on Plasma Metabolites in Patients With Prediabetes or Type-2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty nonobese patients (aged 40-70 years) with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a control group (normal diet with refined rice) or a whole-grain group (replacement of refined rice with whole-grains and legumes). This dietary intervention replaced approximately 7% of carbohydrate-derived energy with approximately 4% of protein-derived energy and approximately 3% of fat-derived energy.</detailed_description>
