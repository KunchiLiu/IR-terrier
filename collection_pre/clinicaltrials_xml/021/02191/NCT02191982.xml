	<brief_title>The Effect of Walking on Fatigue After Chemotherapy in Patients 65 and Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investiagors propose to evaluate the impact of a home-based self-directed walking program on post-chemotherapy fatigue among 150 cancer survivors age 65 and older -- Senior Physical Activity after Chemotherapy (S-PACT). Participants must have potentially curable cancer, moderate to severe fatigue (score of 4 or higher on the Brief Fatigue Inventory), currently exercise less than 120 minutes per week and have completed chemotherapy treatment (radiation treatment must also be completed if it is part of the patient's treatment plan) within the last 6 weeks. The design is a randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to a 3-month physical activity program (intervention group) or to wait-list control (this group begins the walking program at 3 months post-randomization). The primary objective is to compare the change in fatigue scores from baseline to 3 months between the intervention and wait-list control groups.</detailed_description>
