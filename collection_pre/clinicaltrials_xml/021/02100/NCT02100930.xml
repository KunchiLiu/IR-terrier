	<brief_title>Anti-GD2 3F8 Monoclonal Antibody and GM-CSF for High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This treatment uses 3F8/GM-CSF and isotretinoin for: Group 1 patients are in 1st CR/VGPR; Group 2 patients are in a ≥2nd CR/VGPR; and Group 3 patients have primary refractory NB in BM. All patients will receive 3F8/GM-CSF through 24 months. Road Map/Schema for Group 1 (1st CR/VGPR) and Group 2 (≥2nd CR/VGPR) patients: Cycle 1 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF subcutaneous (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval Cycle 2 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval* - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 3 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 4 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days on, 14 days off, 14 days on Cycle 5 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days on, 14 days off, 14 days on (6th cycle) Cycle 6 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval Cycle 7 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) Continue with 6-8-wk intervals through 24 months from 1st dose of 3F8. * assessment of BM status by standard histology Road Map/Schema for Group 3 patients (BM positive): The break between end of a cycle of 3F8/GM-CSF and start of next cycle is approximately 2-to-4-weeks through 4 cycles after achievement of CR in BM; subsequent breaks are ~6-8 weeks. Please see roadmap below for a patient achieving CR in BM after cycle 1. Cycle 1 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval* - BM negative Cycle 2 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval* - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 3 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 4 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 2-4-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 5 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days Cycle 6 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval - oral isotretinoin x14 days on, 14 days off, 14 days on (6th cycle) Cycle 7 3F8 (iv) + GM-CSF (sc) (1 wk) 6-8-wk interval Continue with 6-8-wk intervals through 24 months from 1st dose of 3F8. * assessment of BM response by standard histology</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of NB as defined by international criteria,62 i.e., histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or BM metastases plus high urine catecholamine levels.

Children and adults are eligible. Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the scheduling and side effects, as well as testing requirements, of this program. Existing severe major organ dysfunction, i.e., renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal toxicity &gt; or = to grade 3, except for grade 3 hematologic toxicity.
