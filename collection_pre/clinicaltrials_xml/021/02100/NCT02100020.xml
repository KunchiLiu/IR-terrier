	<brief_summary>The proposed project will evaluate two methods of implementation of the new Physical Activity Guidelines (PAGs) for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) living in two Ontario communities. The investigators will also determine if following the PAGs will improve aspects of fitness, function, quality of life and risk for cardiometabolic disease in this population. The investigators hypothesize that adherence to the PAGs will be higher in people who have been referred directly to a community-based exercise program, and that this greater adherence to physical activity will be associated with greater improvements in fitness, function and quality of life. This randomized controlled trial will provide important information on how best to implement physical activity recommendations within the community setting; this information will be translated to key stakeholders during the final stages of the project.</brief_summary>
