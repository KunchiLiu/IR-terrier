	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the axis location of toric contact lenses after 3 minutes of wear. During this 1-visit study, each participant wore 3 pairs of study lenses of various design iterations (2-87-1, 2-87-2, 2-87-3) for an exposure time of approximately 30 minutes each. Each pair consisted of lenses of the same design iteration, 1 lens with embossed mark [TEST1 (T1), TEST3 (T3), TEST5 (T5)], worn on the right eye, and 1 lens without embossed mark [TEST2 (T2), TEST4 (T4), and TEST6 (T6)] worn on the left eye.</brief_summary>
