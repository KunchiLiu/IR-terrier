	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the efficacy (activity), and tolerability of curcumin and cholecalciferol combination in treating patients with previously untreated stage 0-II chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Curcumin and cholecalciferol may prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Curcumin and Cholecalciferol in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage 0-II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) based on National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or the Cheson criteria in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the time to first cytotoxic treatment (TFCT), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and cholecalciferol PO daily on days 8-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial response or better may receive treatment for a total of 2 years. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3-6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
