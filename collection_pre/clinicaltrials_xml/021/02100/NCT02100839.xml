	<brief_summary>The purpose of the first part of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of AEM-28, an apolipoprotein E mimetic, in subjects with high total cholesterol who are otherwise healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AEM-28 will also be evaluated. The second part of this study will be a multiple ascending dose evaluation of AEM-28 in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia. AEM-28 has demonstrated significant lipid lowering activity and positive effects on the artery wall. AEM-28 is being developed for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Study: Male or female nonsmoker, ≥18 and ≤55 years of age, with BMI &gt;18.5 and &lt; 32.0 kg/m² Total cholesterol greater or equal to 5.0 mmol/L (≥194 mg/dL) at screening Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Study: Male or female nonsmoker, ≥18 and ≤75 years of age, with BMI &gt;18.5 and &lt; 35.0 kg/m² Diagnosis of refractory hypercholesterolemia with LDL cholesterol levels &gt; 2.5 mmol/L (97 mg/mL) at screening. On stable lipid lowering therapy for ≥ 8 weeks On stable diet for ≥ 12 weeks. SAD Study: Any clinically significant abnormality or abnormal laboratory test results found during medical screening or positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV found during medical screening. History of allergic reactions to diphenhydramine, ranitidine, methylprednisone or other related drugs, or history of significant allergic or hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. angioedema) to any substance. MAD Study: Significant health problems within 6 months prior to screening, which in the opinion of the Medical SubInvestigator would prevent the subject from participating in the study, including but not limited to: unstable coronary heart disease; transient ischemic attack; stroke; revascularization procedure; uncontrolled hyperthyroidism; coagulation disorder; peptic ulcers or GI bleeding; significant disease of the central nervous system; liver or renal disease. History of allergic reactions to diphenhydramine, ranitidine, methylprednisone or other related drugs, or history of significant allergic or hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. angioedema) to any substance.</criteria>
