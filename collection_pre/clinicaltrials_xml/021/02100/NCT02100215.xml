	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of various types of simulation preparation methods on novice nurses' competence and self-efficacy. Participants will be recruited from an academic course (N424 Integrated Practicum). Participants will be randomized to three intervention groups (i.e. expert modeling video, voice over PowerPoint, and traditional readings). All participants will complete self-efficacy surveys and two simulations. During simulation, participants will be scored based on their competence according to a performance rubric. The hypothesis is that participants in the expert modeling group will demonstrate more change in competence and report more change in self-efficacy scores than participants in other groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators will compare self-confidence and competence scores between the three groups after the pre-test and posttest simulations. The self-efficacy survey is an 7-item scale that involves participants rating their self-efficacy about providing care for multiple patients. Participants rate their self-efficacy on a 1 to 5 (not confident to very confident scale). The survey takes 5 minutes to complete. The self-efficacy survey has been used in many simulation research studies previously with novice nurses. Competence will be measured with a rater-observation measure which has previously been used in simulation research.</detailed_description>
