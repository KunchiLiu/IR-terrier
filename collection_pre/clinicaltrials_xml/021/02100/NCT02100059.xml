	<brief_summary>To determine changes in thigh muscle function and knee pain after a partial meniscectomy surgery and to also determine the effects of applying electrical stimulation to the knee to determine if this improves thigh muscle function and decreases pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective for this study is to determine the differences in corticospinal excitability and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways in individuals with a history of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared to healthy controls. Our central hypothesis is that quadriceps weakness following partial meniscectomy is due to higher levels of corticospinal excitability and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways, which can be modified with therapeutic interventions.</detailed_description>
