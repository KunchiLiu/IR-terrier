	<brief_summary>Physical exercise has been shown to significantly reduce subsequent energy intake in obese adolescents but not in lean, without altering their appetite feelings. Although previous studies have pointed out the role of gastric peptides in this post exercise nutritional response, some recent work question the role of the neural system in the post exercise drive to eat. This study tends to explore whether or not an acute bout of exercise can affect the neural response to food cues in adolescents, obese or lean.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After a medical inclusion, the adolescents will have to realise a DXA to assess their body composition and a submaximal exercise to evaluate their aerobic capacities. They will have then to enter the laboratory on 2 different occasions in a randomized order from 8am to 330pm: At 8am they will receive a calibrated breakfast. then, at 1045; they will have to complete one of the experimental condition: 1) a cycling exercise or 2) remaining sitting fpr one hour. after the one hour sitting station or the exercise bout, they will be asked to complete a computer task while and electroencephalogram will be recorded. This computer task consists in visual recognition of rare pictures compared to frequent ones (oddball method). at 1215 they will be offered ad libitum meals. At regular intervals through the day, their appetite feelings will be assessed using Visual analogue scales. Ad libitum energy consumption will be assessed by investigators and recorded for each participants.</detailed_description>
