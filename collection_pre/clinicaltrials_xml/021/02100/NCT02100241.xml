	<brief_title>Effectiveness Analysis of Active Stretching Versus Active Stretching With Low Frequency Currents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2012 we studied 51 young footballers with Short Hamstring Syndrome in Spain. Three groups were formed: 1. Stretching+Transcutaneous Electrical Nervous Stimulation (TENS); 2. Active stretching; 3. Conventional stretching. Parameters: straight leg raise test (SLR), popliteal angle with the passive knee extension test (PKE) and the toe-touch test (TT). The inter-group means were compared and clinically relevant parameters calculated [relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR) and number needed to treat (NNT)].</detailed_description>
