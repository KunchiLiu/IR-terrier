	<brief_summary>The aim was to identify minor genetic variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that explain the interindividual variability in bioavailability of fat soluble micronutrients (fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Genetic Variants on Fat-soluble Vitamin Bioavailability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy male volunteers were genotyped and submitted to 5 test-meals containing either no micronutrient of interest, 100 g tomato puree as a source of carotenoids, a lutein supplement, a vitamin E supplement or a vitamin D supplement. Blood samples were taken in the postprandial period (up to 8 hours after the test-meals intake) and the concentration of the studied micronutrients were measured in the chylomicrons. Multivariate analysis were then performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that best explained the variance in the interindividual response (0 to 8 h area under the curve) in micronutrients.</detailed_description>
