	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to see if there is a change in tear osmolarity over time when moderate to severe dry eye subjects are treated with TheraTears® lubricating drops.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Tear Osmolarity Over Time With Sustained Use of TheraTears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that the measured tear osmolarity from study participants decrease with sustained use of a over-the-counter artificial tears, TheraTears® lubricating drops, over an eight week period. Participant's dry eye symptoms would also improve with sustained use of TheraTears® lubricating drops.</detailed_description>
