	<brief_title>MyNewOptions: An Online Study of Reproductive Life Planning and Contraceptive Action Planning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most US families want 2 children, resulting in the average woman spending 3 decades of her life trying to avoid pregnancy. However, most women have at least one unintended pregnancy, resulting in 1.5 million abortions and 1.7 million unintended births annually. Women and couples try to avoid unintended pregnancy for a range of personal, social, and economic reasons, but also due to the increased physical and mental health effects for children that result from unintended pregnancy. Healthcare reform now requires that private health insurance companies cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods with no copays or deductibles to the patient, creating a great opportunity for women with health insurance to get contraceptive methods they previously could not afford. In this study, women with health insurance will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Reproductive Life Planning (RLP)â€”women will complete a reproductive life plan that guides them to think about if and when they would want any future pregnancies, and to determine what contraceptive method(s) are best suited to them; (2) Reproductive Life Planning Plus (RLP+) which additionally includes "if-then planning," where women determine what they will do when they encounter difficult situations that make it difficult to use their contraceptive method perfectly; or (3) an information-only control group. The online format of the study allows for the potential of wide dissemination. The RLP and RLP+ interventions are expected to result in greater likelihood of contraceptive use, continuity of contraceptive use, and contraceptive adherence, and thus reduce overall risk of unintended pregnancy.</detailed_description>
