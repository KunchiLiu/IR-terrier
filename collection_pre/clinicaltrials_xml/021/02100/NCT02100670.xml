	<brief_title>A Multicenter Efficacy Study of a Diclofenac+Menthol Gel in Subjects With Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, repeat-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in participants with ankle sprain. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (1% diclofenac plus 3% menthol gel, 1% diclofenac plus 0.09% menthol gel, 3% menthol gel or placebo gel with 0.09% menthol). Treatment will be self-administered by participants four times daily on an out-patient basis. Participants will rate pain intensity score (NRS) at rest and on movement, pain relief score (PRS) and cooling and soothing sensations. After leaving the clinic, participants will continue to complete scheduled pain intensity and pain relief assessments and answer questions about cooling sensation by answering questions in a paper diary card. The investigator (or designee) will measure the ankle swelling via the 'figure-of-eight' method on treatment Days 1 (at Baseline), 3, 7 and 10. Participants will continue treatment until they are pain free or for up to 10 days, whichever occurs first. At the end of the treatment, participants will be assessed for function of the injured joint by the investigator. In addition, the participants will evaluate treatment satisfaction, sensory features of the gel and provide a global assessment of the treatment by using a questionnaire.</detailed_description>
