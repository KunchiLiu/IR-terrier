	<brief_summary>Hot flashes are the most common symptom of menopause and affect almost 75% of menopausal women. Clinical evidence indicates potent antagonists of 5-HT2A are more likely to cause hypothermia. Risperidone is a potent 5-HT2A and a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and is proposed to have effect on reduciton of hot flashes through its dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if RCN3028 is effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated. In accordance with the latest FDA guidance study participants will have a minimum of 7 moderate to sever hot flashes per day, or 50 per week at baseline.</brief_summary>

Awake at night due to sweats will be recorded separately and will be considered as severe; Ability to understand and follow the instructions of the investigator, including completion of the VMS episode event logs (patient diary) as described in the protocol; Able and willing to provide written informed consent; Study participants should not be taking estrogen or a SERM alone or estrogen/progestin containing drug products. The following washout periods are recommended before baseline assessments are made for subjects previously on estrogen or a SERM alone or estrogen/progestin containing products: 1 week for prior vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels); ≥ 4 weeks for prior transdermal estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin products; ≥ 8 weeks for prior oral estrogen, SERM and/or progestin therapy; ≥ 8 weeks for prior intrauterine progestin therapy; ≥ 3 months for prior progestin implants and estrogen alone injectable drug therapy; ≥ 6 months for prior estrogen pellet therapy or progestin injectable drug therapy. Hypertension with uncontrolled blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg) Subjects with mild to moderate hypertension who are controlled on a stable antihypertension regimen may be enrolled if they meet the other inclusion/exclusion criteria; Use of SSRI and/or SNRI. Prior usage of herbal or dietary supplements, including black cohosh, soy, phytoestrogens will be eligible if subject agrees to cease taking above agents during the study; Subjects taking or having taken any other experimental drugs, or participating in or having participated in other clinical studies in the 30 days prior to this clinical trial; Subjects having a known history of allergic reaction, hypersensitivity or clinically significant intolerance to ingredients of the study drug; Subject has a history or suspicion of cancer with exception of breast cancer; Subjects with a current drug or alcohol abuse problem as judged by the investigator; Subjects have clinical significant conditional, such as acute myocardial infarction or stroke with 6 months of randomization; Subjects have suicidal tendency; Subjects who are considered unreliable as to medication compliance or adherence to scheduled appointments or for other reasons are felt to be inappropriate for inclusion in the study as determined by the investigators.</criteria>
