	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol or subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the requirements of the protocol. Subjects who completed their primary vaccination and received either two or three doses of GSK Biologicals' HPV16/18 vaccine according to a 0,6months schedule or a 0,1,6months schedule in the study HPV048 PRI (110659) (NCT00541970). A female between, and including, 9 and 14 years of age or 15 and 25 years of age, at the time of first vaccination, depending on which group they belonged to in the study HPV048 PRI (110659) (NCT00541970), i.e., 914 year old subjects should have received two doses of GSK Biologicals' HPV16/18 vaccine according to a 0,6months schedule and 1525 year old subjects should have received three doses of GSK Biologicals' HPV16/18 vaccine according to a 0,1,6months schedule. Written informed consent obtained from the subject/from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. In addition, subjects below the legal age of consent should sign and personally date a written informed assent form. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the HPV16/18 study vaccine administered in the study HPV048 PRI (110659) (NCT00541970) from the last visit of the primary study up to the current study visit or planned use during the study period. Administration of any HPV vaccine from the last visit of the primary study up to the current study visit or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within three months prior to blood sampling. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before study entry, with the exception of routine meningococcal, inactivated influenza, hepatitis B, diphtheria/tetanus and/or diphtheria/tetanuscontaining, poliomyelitis and/or pertussis vaccines up to 8 days before study entry. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.
