	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an integrated behavioral treatment approach can help overweight or obese individuals who also have chronic pain reduce their weight and manage their pain symptoms. The goal of this research is to develop better treatments for individuals with chronic pain and overweight or obesity. All participants in this study will receive treatment for weight management and/or pain symptoms. Participants will be assigned at random (like we picked it blindly out of a hat) to receive either: (1) Standard behavioral treatment for weight loss; or (2) Standard behavioral treatment for pain management; or (3) Integrated behavioral treatment for weight loss and pain.</brief_summary>
