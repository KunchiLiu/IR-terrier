	<brief_title>Open Label Study of Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIg) in Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder which causes the muscles to become weak because the immune system attacks the connection between the nerves and the muscles. Hizentra is a subcutaneous (under the skin) immunoglobin (SCIg). An immunoglobin is a blood protein. Hizentra is being studied for the treatment of patients with MG. Hizentra is administered by an injection into the skin through a portable infusion pump, which may be easier for patients to administer than the current treatments. Participants will be asked to complete 9 clinic visits and 3 telephone calls. It could take up to 30 weeks to complete all study visits.</detailed_description>
