	<brief_summary>Severe brain injuries induce alteration of state of consciousness. These functional limitations can be significantly alleviated by treatment neurorehabilitation, particularly if this is established early. It has been shown that treatment of vertical integration in patients in a vegetative state or minimally conscious state can improve the level of supervision and positive influence on rehabilitation. Therefore, there are sufficient indications that anticipate the treatment of vertical integration, since the phase of hospitalization in ICUs, may improve the functional outcome of the patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Verticalization in neuroICU With ERIGO: a Safety and Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early verticalization and stepping with the equipment Hocoma Erigo, during monitoring of vital parameters. The device Erigo is already CE marked and, for the purposes of the study, will be used in accordance with the intended use of the same mark (after-market clinical investigation).</detailed_description>
