	<brief_summary>Background: Endometriosis is a disease affecting 8-15 % of fertile women and is a cause of abdominal pain and suffering during women's menstrual periods. A subgroup of patients with DIE has an infiltration into the rectosigmoid bowel wall (4-37%). Knowledge of the growth pattern of rectosigmoid lesions related to subjective symptoms is mandatory in order to assess the need for follow-up with transvaginal ultrasound during medical treatment. Hypotheses: Symptoms will follow growth of rectosigmoid endometriosis. Material and methods: Two different cohorts of women, based on time of diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis and treatment with hormonal intrauterine device or continuous oral contraceptives will receive a questionnaire and a transvaginal ultrasound scan (measuring size and volume) at inclusion, (6) and 12 months later. Perspectives: Patients treated conservatively may be followed by questionnaires, thereby reducing the need for time consuming clinical controls.</brief_summary>
