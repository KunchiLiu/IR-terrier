	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, double-blinded, three-period crossover study of platelet activation and aggregation in 30 non-smoking healthy volunteers comparing chlorthalidone (CTD), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and aspirin (ASA; active control). The study hypothesis is that CTD has different effects on platelet activation and aggregation than HCTZ.</brief_summary>
