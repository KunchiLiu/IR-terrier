	<brief_title>Study of BMS-833923 in Two Specific Patients With Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS-833923 administered on an extension protocol in subjects with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS). This is an extension study of Protocol CA194002 to allow 2 specific participants with BCNS in the CA194002 study at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre who are still benefitting from the study drug BMS-833923, to continue receiving the study drug. In this open-label extension protocol, no new subjects will be recruited. The two BCNS subjects from Protocol CA194002 (subjects CA194002-1-14 and CA194002-1-25) will continue to receive BMS-833923 at the dose and schedule administered on CA194002 until fulfilling protocol criteria for discontinuation. These patients are receiving different doses: one being 60mg once every 2 weeks, and the other is receiving 300mg once daily. This study will continue to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS-833923 in these participants.</detailed_description>
