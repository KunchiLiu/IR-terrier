	<brief_summary>- About two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese which can cause adverse health consequences for those individuals. Post-prandial hyperglycemia is one of these possible consequences and is associated with a higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes. Controlling hyperglycemia is important in the prevention of the onset of diabetes and obesity. Resistant starch is a dietary carbohydrate which is not completely digested in the gut and produces energy for the body to use. The investigators are interested in assessing the effects of resistant starch on postprandial blood glucose and insulin concentrations. - Aim: To assess the effects of a resistant starch on post-prandial blood glucose and insulin concentrations. - Hypothesis: A baked snack bar with a resistant starch will blunt and sustain the post-prandial rise in blood glucose and insulin concentrations compared to a baked snack bar with maltodextrin (an easily digested carbohydrate).</brief_summary>
