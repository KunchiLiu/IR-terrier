	<brief_summary>The VIP-U Study is a clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of ustekinumab (Stelara) and placebo on reducing vascular inflammation and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. This study will look for systemic vascular inflammation in study participants with a test called FDG PET/CT (fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography). The study will also look for cardiometabolic identifiers (heart disease and metabolic factors) in blood samples, including markers of high cholesterol, cholesterol efflux function (the ability of cholesterol to move in the body), metabolic factors, and inflammation. The study will also examine the effects of ustekinumab compared to placebo on psoriasis activity, severity and safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females 18 years of age and older. 2. Clinical diagnosis of psoriasis for at least 6 months as determined by subject interview of his/her medical history and confirmation of diagnosis through physical examination by Investigator. 3. Stable plaque psoriasis for at least 2 months before Screening and at Baseline (Week 0) as determined by subject interview of his/her medical history. 4. Moderate to severe psoriasis defined by ≥ 10 percent Body Surface Area (BSA) involvement at the Baseline (Week 0) visit. 5. PASI score of ≥ 12 at the Baseline (Week 0) visit. 6. Subject is a candidate for systemic therapy and has active psoriasis despite prior treatment with topical agents. 7. Women are eligible to participate in the study if they meet one of the following criteria: 1. Women of childbearing potential who are willing to undergo periodic pregnancy testing during the study and agree to use at least one method of contraception throughout the study duration and for at least 15 weeks after the last dose of the study drug are eligible to participate. 2. Women who are postmenopausal (for at least one year), sterile, or hysterectomized are eligible to participate. 3. Women who have undergone tubal ligation are eligible to participate. 4. Women who agree to be sexually abstinent, defined as total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as a form of contraception, are eligible to participate. 8. Men are eligible to participate in the study if they meet one of the following criteria: 1. Agree to use a proven birth control method during the study and for at least 15 weeks after the last dose of the study drug. 2. Have a female partner who agrees to use at least one method of contraception throughout the study duration and for at least 15 weeks after the last dose of the study drug. 3. Have a female partner who is postmenopausal (for at least one year), sterile, or hysterectomized; 4. Have a female partner who has undergone tubal ligation, 5. Agree to be sexually abstinent, defined as total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as a form of contraception. 9. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the Principal Investigator based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, physical examination, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. 10. Able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with requirements of this study protocol. 1. Previous adverse event following exposure to an IL12/IL23 antagonist that led to discontinuation of therapy and contraindicates future treatment. 2. Previous lack of response to an IL12/IL23 antagonist that led to discontinuation of therapy. 3. Diagnosis of erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized or localized pustular psoriasis, medicationinduced or medicationexacerbated psoriasis, or new onset guttate psoriasis. 4. Diagnosis of other active skin diseases or skin infections (bacterial, fungal, or viral) that may interfere with evaluation of psoriasis. 5. Cannot avoid UVB phototherapy or Excimer laser for at least 14 days prior to the Baseline (Week 0) visit and during the study. 6. Cannot avoid psoralenUVA phototherapy for at least 30 days prior to the Baseline (Week 0) visit and during the study. 7. Cannot discontinue systemic therapies for the treatment of psoriasis, or systemic therapies known to improve psoriasis, during the study: Systemic therapies must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to the Baseline (Week 0) visit except for biologics. All biologics, except ustekinumab, must be discontinued for at least 90 days prior to Baseline (Week 0). Any IL12/IL23 antagonist (e.g., ustekinumab, briakinumab) must be discontinued for at least 180 days prior to Baseline (Week 0). Investigational agents must be discontinued at least 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the Baseline (Week 0) visit. 8. Subject is taking or requires oral or injectable corticosteroids during the study. Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed. 9. Poorly controlled medical condition, such as unstable ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction within the prior 6 months, psychiatric disease requiring frequent hospitalization, and any other condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk by participation in the study. 10. History of diabetes mellitus, type 1 or type 2 with the exception that patients with type 2 diabetes may be enrolled if the duration of diabetes is &lt;10 years and HbA1c is &lt;7.0%. 11. Uncontrolled hypertension, with measured systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg 12. Subject has infection or risk factors for severe infections, for example: Positive serology or known history of HIV, hepatitis B or C, or other severe, recurrent, or persistent infections; Excessive immunosuppression or other factors associated with it, including human immunodeficiency virus infection; Active tuberculosis (TB) disease; Evidence of latent TB infection demonstrated by positive QuantiferonGOLD result; except if prophylactic treatment for TB, as recommended by local guidelines, is initiated prior to administration of study drug or if there is documentation that the subject has received prophylactic treatment for TB within 3 years prior to the first administration of study agent. Any other significant infection requiring hospitalization or intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the month prior to Baseline; Infection requiring treatment with oral or parenteral (other than IV) antibiotics within 14 days prior to Baseline; Subject has received vaccination with Bacille CalmetteGuerin (BCG) within 365 days prior to Screening or will receive BCG vaccination during study participation including up to 12 months after the last dose of the study drug; Subject has received vaccination with a live viral agent 30 days prior to Screening or will require a live vaccination during study participation including up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug. 13. Subject has history of hematological or solid malignancy within the past five years other than successfully treated basal cell carcinoma, nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ. 14. Female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding or considering becoming pregnant during the study. 15. Male subject who is considering fathering a child during the study. 16. Screening clinical laboratory analyses showing any of the following abnormal results: Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt; 10 g/dL in females or &lt;12 g/dL in males; White blood cell (WBC) count &lt;2.5 x 109/L o Subject can be included if WBC count is &lt;2.5 x 109/L and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt;1000 cells / mm3.
