	<brief_summary>Aim was to detect EEG complexity in a specific group of patients to contribute to the discussion whether schizophrenia is associated with increased or decreased complexity. We included the EEG recordings of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We hypothesized that chronic residual schizophrenia is characterized by decreased complexity in EEG.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty right-handed patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, residual subtype, by two senior psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV)were recruited from Neuropsychiatry Istanbul Hospital. Only patients scoring 4 or higher on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity (CGI-S) were included. They were assessed with the Turkish version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Data was collected with a 16-channel Neuroscan Synamps II (Neuroscan Products, Compumedics, Charlotte, NC, USA), silver-silver chloride electrodes were applied to the scalp surface according to the international 10-20 system</detailed_description>
