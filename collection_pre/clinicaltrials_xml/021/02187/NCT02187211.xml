	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient study with a between-groups design. Sixty male and female heavy social drinkers will be randomly assigned to minocycline (200 or 400 mg/day) or placebo for 10 days. In the first 7 days of treatment, subjects will have 3 outpatient visits for medication administration, dispensing of take-home doses and monitoring of any adverse effects from study medications. On days 8 and 10 of treatment, subjects will have 2 laboratory sessions where alcohol or placebo will be administered intravenously using a clamp procedure. Alcohol administration will use a breath alcohol concentration (BrAc) method, targeting 100 mg %. The alcohol clamp procedure will allow collection of multiple outcome measures including subjective, motor, cognitive measurement and plasma cytokine levels.</brief_summary>
