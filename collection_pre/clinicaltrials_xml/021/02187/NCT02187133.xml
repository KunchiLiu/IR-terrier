	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted as a Phase Ib, open-label, non-randomized, single-institution study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and to determine the recommended phase II dose and preliminary efficacy of this combination. The study will have two phases: a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose of carfilzomib in this combination where participants will be monitored for toxicity, tolerability and response and a dose-expansion phase that will determine the preliminary efficacy in patients with Mantle cell lymphoma or any other disease subtype in which there is a preliminary efficacy signal observed. Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will follow standard 3+3 design with escalation of the carfilzomib dose only (Table 5.2). Dose levels of carfilzomib will be 15 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, and 36 mg/m2 IV administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16. The last 2 cohorts will have a starting carfilzomib dose of 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 2. Bendamustine will be administered at the well-tolerated dose of 90 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 2. A dose de-escalation of bendamustine to 75 mg/m2 (cohort -1) will occur if the starting dose proves intolerable in this combination. Rituximab will be given at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on day 9 of Cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Rituximab will be intentionally delayed to day 9 of cycle 1 to help facilitate performance of the correlative studies.</brief_summary>

Subjects must have measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm in diameter Age ≥ 18 years Life expectancy ≥ 3 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Laboratory: Adequate bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (80 g/L) within 14 days prior Cycle 1, Day 1 (subjects may be receiving red blood cell [RBC] transfusions in accordance with institutional guidelines) Platelet count ≥ 75 × 109/L or≥ 50× 109/L if there is lymphoma involvement in the bone marrow, independent of platelet transfusion Adequate hepatic function: Serum AST/ALT ≤ 3 times the upper limit of normal Serum direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (unless history of Gilbert's) Adequate renal function: Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/minute, either measured or calculated using a standard formula (eg, Cockcroft and Gault) Uric acid If elevated, corrected to within laboratory range prior to dosing Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing and to practice contraception. FCBP definition: A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months. Male subjects must agree to practice contraception.
