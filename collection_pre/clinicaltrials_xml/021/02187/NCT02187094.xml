	<brief_summary>Gastroparesis, also referred to as delayed gastric emptying, is a debilitating, chronic disorder that slows or stops the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine. The purpose of this study is to test whether TC-6499 is safe and effective at reducing gastric emptying time in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Effect of TC-6499 on Gastric Emptying Time in Diabetic Subjects With Gastroparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 4-way crossover study to assess the effect of TC-6499 on gastric emptying time in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. The length of study participation for a subject is up to 50 days. During screening, eligible subjects will complete an oral 13-C-spirulina breath test also known as the Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT). During the treatment period, subjects will complete 4 overnight drug assessment visits (treatment arms) where they will receive a randomized single dose of study drug and the GEBT. Each overnight visit will be separated by approximately 7 days. At least 18 subjects will be randomized and complete all 4 dosing arms (actual = 23 randomized subjects and 21 completing all 4 arms of the crossover).</detailed_description>
