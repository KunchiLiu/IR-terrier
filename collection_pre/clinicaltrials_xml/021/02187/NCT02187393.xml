	<brief_summary>The investigators are trying to understand the role of specific genes in the function of airway surface cells. The investigators know that there are some common genetic markers that are associated with various lung diseases. However, most people with these genetic markers never develop any evidence of lung disease, so it is not understand how or if these markers play a role in disease. Investigators are asking healthy people to provide three (3) tubes of blood as well as a sample of cells from their nose. Investigators will use the blood sample to provide genetic information (specifically, presence or absence of alleles known to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis). Nose cells from individuals with the genetic markers that investigators are studying will be grown in the the lab to allow investigators to learn more about how the cells respond to various forms of environmental stress, such as exposure to cigarette smoke. The goal of this study is to understand how specific genes affect airway cell function.</brief_summary>
