	<brief_summary>This study to evaluate treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) which has progressed through 2 to 3 prior lines of therapy, with the investigational drug CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab compared to treatment with a standard of care therapy. The study will compare which treatment resulted in longer time before progression of the RCC. Patients will be treated and followed for progression of their disease on average for up to 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CRLX101 in Combination With Bevacizumab for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) Versus Standard of Care (SOC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, randomized, controlled study in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) who have completed 2 or 3 prior conventional molecularly targeted therapy regimens (i.e. lines) including ≥ 1 VEGF-inhibiting therapies. A total of 110 patients with 55 per treatment arm will be recruited from up to 40 clinical sites. Subjects will be randomized to either CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab (CRLX101 15 mg/m^2 IV on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle; in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycle) or standard of care (SOC). Options for SOC treatment include the following agents to which the patient can have no prior exposure: sorafenib; everolimus; pazopanib; axitinib; bevacizumab; sunitinib, or other approved drug considered by the Medical Monitor to represent an acceptable standard of care therapy. Measurable disease will be assessed every 8 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles). Study treatment, for both investigational and reference therapy, will continue until confirmed disease progression. Duration of study treatment on average is expected to be up to 6 months. Other reasons for discontinuation of treatment may include Investigator determination of clinical progression without CT-Scan confirmation, patient withdrawal, unresolved adverse event, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator decision in consultation with the patient, death, Sponsor determination due to protocol violation, or Sponsor decision to close the study. Cross-over treatment will not be permitted on-study for either assigned treatment arm. Bevacizumab has been chosen as a combination partner with CRLX101 for a number of reasons. - Bevacizumab has proven activity in the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma. - Bevacizumab has been successfully combined with many chemotherapy partners including the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan. - It has been hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab with CRLX101 may have unique clinical activity in combination in the treatment of this disease due to the simultaneous inhibition of distinct steps along the ~vHL ┐ HIF → (CAIX) → VEGF → VEGFR2 pathway Primary Objective: To assess progression free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab (CRLX101+bevacizumab) vs. standard of care (SOC) per investigator's choice. This primary endpoint will be evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Secondary Objectives - To assess overall safety and tolerability of CRLX101+ bevacizumab compared to SOC. - To assess overall survival (OS) of CRLX101+bevacizumab compared to SOC. - To assess overall response rate (ORR) of CRLX101+bevacizumab compared to SOC. - To assess overall PFS, OS, and ORR among patients with clear cell RCC treated with CRLX101+bevacizumab compared to SOC. - To assess overall PFS, OS, and ORR among patients with non-clear cell RCC treated with CRLX101+bevacizumab compared to SOC. - To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CRLX101 when administered in combination with bevacizumab. Exploratory Objectives - To analyze tumor tissue samples for biomarkers of efficacy in the CRLX101+bevacizumab treatment group. - To analyze plasma samples for biomarkers of efficacy before and during treatment and correlate with efficacy outcomes for CRLX101+bevacizumab compared to SOC treatment groups. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CRLX101 in urine over time when administered in combination with bevacizumab in patients with and without non-infective cystitis.</detailed_description>
