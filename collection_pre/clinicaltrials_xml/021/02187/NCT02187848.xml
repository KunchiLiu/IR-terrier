	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR408701 administered as monotherapy, once every 2 weeks (with and without a loading dose at Cycle 1) to patients with advanced solid tumors (Escalation Phase). To assess efficacy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) (Expansion Phase) of SAR408701 administered once every 2 weeks without a loading dose at Cycle 1. Secondary Objectives: To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR408701. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR408701 and of its potential circulating derivatives. To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR408701. To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR408701.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration for an individual patient will start from the signature of the informed consent, will include a period to assess eligibility (screening period) of up to approximately 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period and an end-of-treatment visit around 30 days following the last administration of study drug, and at least one follow-up visit after the end-of-treatment visit. Additional follow-up visit may be required until resolution or stabilization of adverse events (at least 30 days). Additional tests for immunogenicity will be done at Day 60. Treatment may continue until precluded by toxicity, progression, or upon patient's request. If the patient stops study treatment for reason other than disease progression, follow-up visit will be performed every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of another anti-tumor treatment or death, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Locally advanced or metastatic solid malignant tumor disease for which no standard alternative therapy is available. Availability of archived tumor tissue for carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5 or CEA) testing. For participants in the Main Escalation Phase and in the Loading dose Escalation bis cohorts : patients with tumors expressing or likely to be expressing CEACAM5 which includes colorectal cancer (CRC), nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, pancreas adenocarcinoma, bladder transitional cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, epithelial ovarian cancer and endometrial adenocarcinoma are favored, or if carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) plasma levels &gt;5 ng/mL. For participants to the Expansion Phase cohorts: patients with CRC or with CEACAM5 positive nonsquamous NSCLC of the adenocarcinoma subtype or gastric carcinoma (including esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma of the Siewert types II and III). At least one measurable lesion by RECIST v1.1 in the Expansion Phase only. At least one lesion amenable to biopsy (Expansion cohort CRC and gastric cancer only). Patient must consent to a baseline biopsy for retrospective confirmation of tumor CEACAM5 expression, except if NSCLC without lesion amenable to biopsy. Signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Aged less than 18 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status more than 1. New or progressing brain involvement. Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy or inadequate washout period for prior anticancer therapies before first administration of SAR408701, or nonresolution of toxicities induced by these anticancer therapies. Female or male patients with reproductive potential who do not agree to use an accepted effective method of contraception during the study treatment period and for at least 3 months following completion of study treatment. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participation to any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug or therapy within 3 weeks of initiation of study regimen. Prior therapy targeting CEACAM5. Prior maytansinoid treatments (DM1 or DM4 antibody drug conjugates). Poor bone marrow reserve resulting in low blood cell counts. Poor kidney and liver functions. Any of the following within 6 months prior to study enrolment: infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients with malabsorption syndrome are excluded. Previous history and or unresolved corneal disorders. The use of contact lenses is not permitted. Unresolved signs and symptoms of neuropathy; Grade 1 is acceptable if prior neurotoxic drugs such as cisplatin or taxanes. Abnormal cardiac function defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt;50%, Cardiac conduction defects, or any other clinically significant arrhythmias. Known intolerance to infused protein products. Medical conditions requiring concomitant administration of medications with narrow therapeutic window, metabolized by CYPs and for which a dose reduction cannot be considered. Medical conditions requiring concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitor, unless it can be discontinued at least 2 weeks before 1st administration of SAR408701. Contraindications to the use of ophthalmic vasoconstrictor and/or corticosteroid as per package insert of each drug, including the following: increase intraocular pressure, prior or current glaucoma, narrowangle glaucoma, ongoing eye infection, uncontrolled hypertension, known/suspected allergy to constituents of the preparation (such as sodium bisulfite). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
