	<brief_summary>This research study has 2 aims. One aim is to see if saliva testing can show if a person has healthy gum tissue, gingivitis, or one of three degrees of periodontitis - mild, moderate, or severe. The second aim is to examine the effect of the Sonicare Elite/Flexcare toothbrush on periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salivary Inflammatory Biomarkers: Predictors &amp; Comparative Effects of Sonicare/Elite-Flexcare in Stages of Perio Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial to determine clinical and inflammatory benefits of Sonicare Flexcare tooth brushing following experimental induction of biofilm overgrowth in various periodontal conditions. This research study has both a Diagnostic Aim and a Treatment Aim. Aim #1 is to examine the utility of candidate inflammatory biomarkers within saliva to discriminate between health, gingivitis, mild, moderate and severe periodontis; and to discriminate between active versus inactive states of periodontal disease to see if these basal levels can predict the clinical response to biofilm overgrowth among various periodontal conditions; Aim #2 is to extend the claim of the anti-inflammatory and anti-infective efficacy of the Sonicare/Elite-Flexcare as compared to manual brushing to include 4 levels of periodontal disease [BGI-G, P1, P2 and P3].</detailed_description>
