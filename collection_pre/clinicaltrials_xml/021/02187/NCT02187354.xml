	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To estimate the incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events during treatment with blinatumomab in pediatric and adolescent subjects with B-precursor ALL in second or later bone marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or refractory to other treatments Secondary Objective(s): To describe key efficacy outcomes, including incidence of complete response (CR) within 2 cycles of blinatumomab, minimal residual disease (MRD) remission within 2 cycles of blinatumomab, relapse free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of alloHSCT, and 100-day mortality after alloHSCT. Hypotheses: A formal statistical hypothesis will not be tested. The incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events will be estimated. Study Endpoints: - Incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events - Incidence of CR within 2 cycles of blinatumomab - MRD remission within 2 cycles of blinatumomab - RFS - OS - Incidence of alloHSCT - 100-day mortality after alloHSCT Study Design: Multi-center, open-label, single-arm expanded access protocol</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This study seeks pediatric subjects aged &gt; 28 days and &lt; 18 years with relapsed/refractory Bprecursor ALL, to include: Second or later bone marrow relapse, Any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or Refractory to prior treatments: For patients in first relapse: failure to achieve a CR following full standard reinduction chemotherapy regimen For patients who have not achieved a first remission: failure to achieve remission following a full standard induction regimen Subjects previously treated with blinatumomab may be eligible, if blinatumomab was tolerated and response was achieved Note: Selection of sites for this expanded access protocol is limited to sites that have gained experience in the use of blinatumomab in the previous Ph1/2 Pediatric and Adolescent trial MT103205. If other institutions have patients they would like to put on the expanded access protocol, these patients need to be referred to the open participating sites.</criteria>
