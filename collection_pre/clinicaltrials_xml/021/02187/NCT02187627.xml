	<brief_summary>This study is designed to obtain basic information on three PET imaging tracers developed to detect tau pathology in the brain. In this study, healthy control participants and participants with AD will be studied. Information collected will include brain and plasma kinetics, tissue distribution (in the brain), radiation dosimetry, and test-retest variability of the signal in the brain. The study will consist of Part 1, Part 2A, and Part 2B. During Part 1, imaging data will be assessed on an ongoing basis and based on data, one tracer will be prioritized over the other two tracers. The tracer selected will be further investigated in Part 2A and Part 2B.</brief_summary>
