	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether monotherapy treatment with phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor roflumilast is more effective than treatment with glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) liraglutide or treatment with metformin as monotherapy in the treatment of obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) regarding weight reduction who have not been treated before. The investigators anticipated greater changes in body weight in patients on roflumilast treatment than in liraglutide or metformin.</brief_summary>
