	<brief_title>Treatment of IgAN With Multi-glycoside of Tripterygium Wilfordii HOOK. f.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of idiopathic glomerulonephritis throughout of the world. The disease is characterized by the predominant deposition of polymer Gal-deﬁcient IgA1 immune complex（pGd-IgA1-IC）in the glomeruli which leads to the proliferation of mesangial cells. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to be useful in the treatment of IgAN in Chinese patients, but the price is expensive together with some adverse events. Tripterygium Wilfordii HOOK. f. is a traditional chinese medicine and is useful in the treatment of CKD, the purpose of this study is to determine whether Multi-glycoside of Tripterygium Wilfordii HOOK. f. is effective and safe in the treatment of IgA nephropathy</detailed_description>
