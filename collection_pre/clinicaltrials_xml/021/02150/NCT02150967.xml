	<brief_title>A Phase II, Single Arm Study of BGJ398 in Patients With Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 gene fusion/ translocation or other FGFR genetic alteration who have evidence of radiologic progression following a cisplatin-and gemcitabine-containing regimen for advanced disease or a gemcitabine-containing regimen for those who are considered intolerant to cisplatin will be enrolled. Approximately 55 adult patients over age 18, both male and female will be enrolled. Of these 55 patients, 40 patients will have cholangiocarcinoma with identified FGFR2 gene fusions and up to 15 patients may have other FGFR genetic alterations. All patients will receive oral BGJ398, once daily, on a three weeks on (21 days), one week off (7 days) schedule. One treatment cycle will consists of 28 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inlcusion criteria: Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed cholangiocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis. Patients with cancers of the gallbladder or ampulla of Vater are not eligible. Patients must have received at least one prior regimen containing gemcitabine with or without cisplatin for advanced/ metastatic disease. Patient should have evidence of progressive disease following prior regimen, or if prior treatment discontinued due to toxicity must have continued evidence of measurable or evaluable disease. Exclusion criteria: Prior or current treatment with a MEK or selective FGFR inhibitor insufficient organ function ANC &lt; 1,000/mm3 [1.0 x 109/L] Platelets &lt; 75,000/mm3 [75 x 109/L] Hemoglobin &lt; 109.0 g/dL Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT &gt; 2.5x ULN (AST and ALT &gt; 5x ULN in the presence of liver metastases) Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x ULN and a calculated or measured creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min Inorganic phosphorus outside of normal limits Total and ionized serum calcium outside of normal limits Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
