	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this clinical pilot study is to determine at a random sampling time, the vaginal microbiome and metabolome of pregnant women, and to see if infection (bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, malaria) and exposure to environmental toxins affects could alter pregnancy and conception outcomes. It is hypothesized that infection and toxins will alter the vaginal microbiome and metabolome, increasing the risk of preterm labour and infertility in Rwandan women. In a sub-group of subjects, a preliminary assessment of the ability of orally administered probiotic lactobacilli to restore the vaginal microbiota to a healthy state and lower environmental toxins will be completed.</brief_summary>
