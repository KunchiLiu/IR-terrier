	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of single injection peribulbar anaesthesia against the classic double injection technique. This was a double blind randomized controlled trial involving two groups of consenting, adult Nigerian subjects with operable age-related cataract. An anaesthetic nurse who allocated the subjects to the two groups administered all the injections. The same surgeon operated on all the subjects while the principal investigator and a research assistant measured the outcome variables. All others were blinded as to subject allocation.</brief_summary>
