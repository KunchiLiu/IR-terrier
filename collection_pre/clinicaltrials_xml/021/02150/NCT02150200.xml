	<brief_summary>Hysterectomy is one of the most performed surgery in gynecologic surgery. Actually, 70 000 hysterectomies are performed each year in France. Laparoscopic surgery is in progression. The percentage of hysterectomies performed laparoscopically is increasing. The advantage of laparoscopy include fewer infections, less operative pain, faster recovery time and shorter hospital stay. In France, the average of hospital stay after laparoscopic hysterectomy reduced to 3-4 days. The study hypothesis is that a shorter postoperative stay does not decrease the quality of life of the patients. This study will compare the evolution of quality of life (with a questionnaire concerning measuring health related quality of life the Euroqol EQ-5D) of patients discharged after 3 days hospital stay to patients discharged the first day after a laparoscopic hysterectomy.</brief_summary>
