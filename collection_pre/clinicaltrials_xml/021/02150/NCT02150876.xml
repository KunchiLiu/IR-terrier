	<brief_summary>Bioresorbable polymer drug eluting stents (DES) are an indisputable improvement over first-generation DES with promising results on long-term adverse events. But the thicker polymer and/or strut may hinder its deliverability. Complex procedures challenge stent deliverability and stent delivery failure impacts clinical prognosis. This registry aimed to assess the immediate performance of the third-generation Synergy everolimus-eluting stent (sEES) and its 12-month clinical follow-up in an all-comer population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SWiss Evaluation of Bioabsorbable Polymer-coated Everolimus-eluting Coronary sTent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All consecutive patients treated with the SYNERGY stent at our institutions were prospectively included in the SWEET registry. Baseline and procedural characteristics were collected at index procedure. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 month and 1 year by clinic visit or follow-up call. The study end point was a composite of cardiac death (CD), myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 1 year.</detailed_description>
