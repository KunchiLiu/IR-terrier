	<brief_summary>Background: The main goal when diagnosing thyroid nodules, is to differentiate the few malignant from the overwhelming background of benign nodules. Currently available pre-operative tests are unable to rule out malignancy in a subset of patients and diagnostic thyroid surgery is necessary. Therefore, there is a need to develope the diagnostic tools for pre-operative diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules. The study will investigate a novel ultrasonographic technique called Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) in the pre-operative evaluation of thyroid nodules. Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic value of SWE in the pre-operative diagnosis of thyroid nodules in a tertiary surgical center. Perspectives: An optimization of the pre-operative risk-stratification and diagnosis of thyroid nodules can reduce unnecessary thyroid surgery, with a reduction in morbidity and better use of the economic and surgical resources.</brief_summary>
