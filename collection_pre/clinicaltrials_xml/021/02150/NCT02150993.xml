	<brief_summary>FIT-2 is a multi-country, phase IIb, randomized, non-comparative study, carried out in West Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Togo, Guinea). ARV-naïve HIV-2 infected adult patients will be recruited and followed during 96 weeks. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 first-line treatments in HIV-2 infected adult patients, in West Africa. A treatment will be considered as effective if more than 55% of patients in that arm attain "global success" at 96 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective To determine in treatment-naïve HIV-2 infected patients, with CD4 counts above 200 cells/mm3, which of the following three regimens of first line treatment, Tenofovir (TDF), Emtricitabine or lamivudine (FTC or 3TC) plus Zidovudine (ZDV); TDF-FTC (3TC) plus Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV / r); or TDF-FTC (3TC) plus raltegravir (RAL), will result in an "global success" rate of &gt; 55% at week 96. Number of participants : 210 Main outcome : The proportion of patients with "global success" at W96, defined by survival with a plasma HIV-2 RNA viral load of ≤50 copies/ml and the non-occurrence of AIDS classified events (excluding tuberculosis) and a delta of CD4 depending on the initial CD4 count (CD4 delta&gt; +100cells/mm3 for initial CD4s between 201 and 500 cells/mm3 or delta&gt; 50 cells/mm3 for initial CD4s &gt; +500 cells/mm3) Inclusion criteria: - Infection by HIV-2 only; - Age &gt; or = 18 years; - Naïve for antiretroviral therapy (including antiretroviral treatment in the context of PMTCT) - CD4 &gt;200 cells/mm3 - Resident of the city where the study is held or of city suburbs to facilitate participation - Signed informed consent</detailed_description>
