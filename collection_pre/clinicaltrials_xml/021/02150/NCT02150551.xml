	<brief_summary>In this trial, investigators will infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells intravenously, as a treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis that has not responded to conventional therapies. The goals of this study are to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. When isolated from a donor and infused into an animal or human, they have been demonstrated to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this trial, investigators will infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells intravenously, as a treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis that has not responded to conventional therapies. Mesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. They have also been demonstrated to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection. These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease. Investigators will culture donated bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in a unique automated system, and infuse the cells in a fresh, replicating stage of growth. This study is to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be age 5 years to 22 years, inclusive Patients must have moderateseverely active CD or UC, and documented active disease on colonoscopy or MR enterography within the preceding 2 months. Patients must have a PCDAI &gt;30 or PUCAI &gt;34 Patients who have failed or are intolerant to standard therapy for moderateseverely active CD or UC. Standard therapy is defined as corticosteroid induction with maintenance immunomodulator therapy (mercaptopurine, azathioprine, or methotrexate), and/or induction and treatment with a biologic (i.e. infliximab or adalimumab). Specifically, the patient will have recurrence or persistence of symptoms despite treatment with 1) steroids for at least 4 weeks, initiated at least 1 mg/kg/dose and delivered intravenously or orally, with taper to at least 20 mg or 0.5 mg/kg/day by the time of enrollment; OR 2) oral budesonide 9 mg daily for at least 4 weeks AND treatment with maintenance mercaptopurine/azathioprine or methotrexate, and/or treatment with a biologic. At the time of enrollment, study subjects may be currently receiving 5aminosalicylates, corticosteroids (≤ 20 mg daily or up to 0.5 mg/kg/day if weight &lt;40 kg), or immunomodulators (if the dose has been unchanged for the past 3 months for mercaptopurine/azathioprine and 2 months for methotrexate) during the study. Doses of these medications should remain stable during the 8 week study Patients &lt; 5 years of age or &gt;22 years of age Biologic therapy (i.e. infliximab or adalimumab) in the preceding 8 weeks. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Serum pregnancy test must be negative at screening for female subjects of childbearing potential. Urine pregnancy test must remain negative at each of 8 infusion visits Patients with toxic megacolon or intestinal perforation Evidence of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis or sclerosing cholangitis. Patients with fever &gt; 39° C or clinically significant active infection within 1 week (i.e. chronic infections including Hepatitis B/C or HIV or acute infections, including urinary tract infection and respiratory tract infection) Received an agent not approved by the FDA for marketed use in any indication or any small molecule inhibitors (i.e. naltrexone) within 60 days of enrollment Subjects who are taking greater than 20 mg (or if body weight &lt;40 kg, 0.5 mg/kg) of prednisone daily Abnormal biochemical and hematological parameters, including: Neutrophil count &lt; 1000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl Platelet count ≤ 130 cells/mm3 Creatinine ≥ 1.2 x the upper limit of normal Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 2x the upper limit of normal Conjugated bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL Has active infection with enteric pathogens as evidenced by positive microbiological culture of stool or C.difficile toxin PCR Had bowel surgery other than perianal procedures (fistulotomy, seton placement, abscess drainage) within 6 months of enrollment</criteria>
