	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to retrospectively and systematically review records of overweight and obese Medifast Weight Control Center (MWCC) members who have been assigned to the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Plan or the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Plan for weight loss to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of these programs. The study will describe demographics of this population, along with weight loss, anthropometrics, body composition and effects on available cardiovascular parameters. Adherence to the plans will also be examined. The study hypothesis is that the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Meal Replacement Plan and the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Meal Replacement Plan are both effective programs for weight loss in overweight and obese adults.</brief_summary>
