	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the top chambers of the heart beat very fast. AF catheter ablation is a known technique to convert heart rhythm from AF to normal rhythm. The technique sends out electrical energy through a catheter (long thin round solid tubes) to destroy the heart tissues in a focused area where AF is starting. This technique is practiced at many hospitals, including the Heart Institute, and is not experimental. The AWARE study will compare two techniques of AF catheter ablation: 1. Ablation of tissues in wide circular bands around the opening of the pulmonary veins (bring blood back from lungs) in the left upper chamber of the heart. A medicine called adenosine will be given to unmask any incompletely ablated area. Additional ablations will be given if required. This is standard procedure. 2. Same as above but adenosine will not be used. Instead, additional ablation of a second circular band of tissues around the opening of the pulmonary veins will be given. This additional ablation is not standard procedure and is considered experimental. We want to see if adding more ablation sites will help maintain normal heart rhythm and reduce the rate of return to AF. We will compare the occurrence of medical events and complications between the two groups. Identical supplies and equipment used in both techniques have been approved by Health Canada. Adenosine is currently approved by Health Canada for the treatment and diagnosis of arrhythmias. 342 participants from The University of Ottawa Heart Institute will be randomly assigned "similar to flipping a coin" to treatment group 1 or group 2. After the ablation, participants can expect to remain in hospital for up to about 4 days. They will have study follow-up at the Heart Institute every 3 months for 1 to 3 years, depending on when they enter the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmented Wide Area Circumferential Catheter Ablation for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical relevance: The problem of PV reconnection and recurrent AF after catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF is one of the important challenges faced by treating physicians. Rationale: The understanding of the role contact force plays in adequate lesion formation during catheter ablation and the fact that this may reduce pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection and AF recurrence is an exciting advance in the field of catheter ablation for AF. A few small clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of contact force guided catheter ablation in reducing PV reconnection and AF recurrence. There is a clear need for well designed and adequately powered clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this new strategy. Objective: Using contact force (CF) technology, our intention is to evaluate an "augmented- wide area circumferential catheter ablation strategy" that could potentially reduce the incidence of pulmonary vein reconnection and AF recurrence after catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF. Hypothesis: In patients with symptomatic, antiarrhythmic medication resistant paroxysmal AF an augmented-wide area circumferential catheter ablation strategy will result in fewer electrocardiographically documented AF recurrences compared to conventional wide-area catheter ablation. All subjects in the control arm of the trial will undergo wide area circumferential catheter ablation (WACA; lesions delivered 1-2 cm away from the pulmonary vein ostium) around all four pulmonary veins to the endpoint of electrical isolation (demonstrated by entry and exit block using differential pacing). Catheter ablation will be performed using CF and VISITAG guidance (average CF &gt;10g, Force time integral (FTI) &gt; 500 g-sec and minimum ablation duration &gt;10 sec). Dormant PV conduction will be tested using adenosine, after completion of the lesion set, and additional lesions will be delivered to eliminate dormant PV conduction. In the experimental arm of the trial all subjects will undergo WACA as described above; however without adenosine testing. In addition these subjects will receive "augmented" ablation lesions, guided by CF feedback, on the outer aspect of the first WACA lesion set. Our hypothesis is that this "belts and suspender" strategy of redundant, CF guided antral ablation lesions will result in a wider band of irreversible atrial muscle and cardiac autonomic ganglionated-plexi damage. It is our expectation that the augmented WACA strategy will result in more durable PV isolation and thereby significantly reduce AF recurrence. Trial Design: This trial will be a single blinded (patients blinded), prospective, parallel arm randomized clinical trial. Subjects who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the clinical trial. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either the control arm (WACA only) or the experimental arm (augmented- WACA). Patients randomized to the experimental arm will go on to have augmented-WACA. The first three-month period after catheter ablation will be considered a "blanking-period" and atrial tachyarrhythmias (AF, Atrial Flutter [AFl] or Atrial Tachycardia [AT]) occurring during this period will be documented. However, these will not be considered treatment failures. Patient accrual will occur over a 24-month period and each subject will have a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. The total duration of the trial will be 36-months (24 months for accrual and a minimum of 12 months of follow up for each subject). Patients will be followed up every three months after ablation, with transtelephonic monitoring as well as a 2-week loop recording prior to each follow up visit, for the entire duration of the trial. This f/u concurs with recommendations from 2012 Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation: Recommendations for Patient Selection, Procedural Techniques, Patient Management and Follow-up, Definitions, Endpoints, and Research Trial Design.</detailed_description>
