	<brief_summary>Since success of the combination therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV is contingent on maintaining adequate doses of both drugs throughout the treatment period, the emergence of hematological side effects is expected and requires intervention. The hematological adverse effects lead to a trade-off between continuing the treatment with optimal dosage, to clear the virus, exacerbating thereby the side effects versus decreasing dosage to relieve severe anemia, reducing thereby the chances of achieving sustained virological response (SVR). Therefore, we aimed at giving Folic acid® and Neurobion® to HCV-infected patients during treatment with different types of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin in an attempt to evaluate its efficacy and safety as a prophylactic treatment to prevent hematological adverse effects. Preventing adverse effects without interfering with the therapeutic efficacy of different types of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin in HCV patients will lead to better health outcomes and improvement in their quality of life (HRQOL).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Chronic hepatitis C patients of both sexes were eligible for inclusion if they were HCV RNA positive, naive to PEGINF and RBV, and had abnormal serum alanine transaminase levels on two occasions during the preceding six months. Patients with significant hematological abnormalities at baseline, such as neutropenia (ANC &lt;1200 x 103 cells/µL), thrombocytopenia (&lt;70 x 103 cells/ µL), and anemia (&lt;10.5 g/dL), were excluded. Patients were also excluded from study participation if they had serum creatinine ≥1.70 mg/dL (150 µmol), hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, decompensated cirrhosis, or other forms of liver disease not attributable to HCV. Patients with severe depression or psychosis, uncontrolled seizures, poorly controlled cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or autoimmune disorders were also ineligible. Women were ineligible for study participation if they were pregnant or unwilling to use at least 2 forms of effective contraception during the entire study period.</criteria>
