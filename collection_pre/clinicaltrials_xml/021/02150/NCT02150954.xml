	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare induction of labor using a foley catheter bulb with a low dose of oxytocin versus a foley catheter bulb with an increasing dose of oxytocin. A foley catheter bulb with or without oxytocin is a common method of labor induction in patients whose cervix is not significantly dilated or thinned out (effaced). Oxytocin (pitocin) is a medicine used to increase the number and strength of the womb's contractions.</brief_summary>
