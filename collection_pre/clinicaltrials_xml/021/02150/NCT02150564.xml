	<brief_summary>Phase 3 randomized open labeled trials will evaluate the 3 D navigable ultrasound (SonoWand) in improving the extent of resection in intra-axial brain tumors. All patients will undergo resective surgery. In the experimental arm, a navigable 3 D ultrasound will be used. In the standard arm, only navigation will be used. This study will help in assessing the usefulness sononavigation in improving radicality of resection in malignant gliomas and also to access the accuracy of SonoWand in predicting residue (histopathological correlation).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Routine presurgical evaluation of all patients will be conducted. The preoperative use of steroids, antiepileptics and other medications would be as per standard procedure and would be documented. In addition detailed MRI evaluation will be performed (including contrast enhanced MRI study, diffusion MRI, perfusion MR, MR spectroscopy, dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI for permeability studies, as well as functional MRI, and tractography if required) not more than 1 week prior to the date of surgery. Navigation specific MR sequences would be performed in all patients (both arms).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All radiologicallysuspected, previously untreated, supratentorial malignant gliomas being considered for debulking surgery. 2. Adults (above 18 years) 3. Eligible for surgical therapy (craniotomy not stereotactic biopsy ) 4. Resectability : A lesion would be considered "resectable" if the surgeons feel that all the radiologically imaged lesion can be removed (with reasonable certainty). Only deemed resectable lesions will be included 1. Unfit for GA 2. Unwilling for the study 3. Unresectable lesion</criteria>
