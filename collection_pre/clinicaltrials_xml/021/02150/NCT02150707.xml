	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine if different diabetes treatments have different effects on inflammation; in particular, kidney inflammation. This type of inflammation is common in people with diabetes, and can lead to kidney failure. This study will investigate the effect of different types of diabetes treatment on kidney inflammation. This will help us to decide if certain types of medicine should be preferred in people with evidence of inflammation in their kidneys, as this may help prevent major complications including kidney failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this prospective cohort study, patients who are clinically determined to require escalation of their glycaemic therapy, and prescribed a DPP4 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or insulin, will be invited to participate. Blood and urine samples will be taken before, 4 to 8 weeks after, and 26 weeks after starting the new therapy. Markers of inflammation, renal function and glycemic control will be measured at each timepoint.</detailed_description>
