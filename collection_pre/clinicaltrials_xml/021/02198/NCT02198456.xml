	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to intensify the follow up of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension via modern imaging guided methods in due consideration of the possibilities of three-dimensional echocardiography in order to optimize their specific therapy. The hypothesis is that the increased use of modern imaging guided tools is essential for the follow up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Control Study, 3D Echo, MR and RHC.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is not possible to perform a magnetic resonance imaging in all patients and as a result echocardiography is not only done at screening but also during the follow up. The imaging technologies made a great progress in the last few years and enable a better assessment of the haemodynamic parameters in our days.</detailed_description>
