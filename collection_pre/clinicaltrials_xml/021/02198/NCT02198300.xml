	<brief_summary>Coronary bifurcation lesions pose therapeutic problems during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and are associated with higher rates of periprocedural complications as well as higher rates of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. Provisional T-stenting (PTS) is the best treatment strategy at the moment. However, the optimal approach to coronary bifurcations treatment is still a subject of debate, especially when the side branch is large, not easily accessible and narrowed by a long lesion. One of the proposed alternatives are dedicated bifurcation stents (DBS). However, there is large scarcity of randomized trials with DBS. POLBOS II study is continuation of POLBOS I (POLish Bifurcation Optimal Stenting) study, in which paclitaxel-eluting stent BiOSS Expert® (Balton, Poland) was assessed. Now performance of sirolimus-eluting stent BiOSS LIM® (Balton, Poland) is verified.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DES Versus BiOSS LIM - POLBOS II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After signing the informed consent patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment strategies: BiOSS LIM® stent implantation or rDES implantation (envelope randomization, 1:1). If the patient was enrolled to rDES Group there was a second randomization: with or without final kissing ballooning (FKB). Clinical follow-up was performed with office visits or telephone contacts at 1 and 12 months after intervention. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study period. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed at 12 months unless clinically indicated earlier.</detailed_description>
