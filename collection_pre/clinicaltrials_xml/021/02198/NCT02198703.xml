BMI between 18,5 and 30 kg/m² ((limits excluded).

After V1 biological analysis the subjects will be eligible to the visit V2 on the following criteria: Fasting plasma LDLc level (Friedewald estimation method) between 1,3 and 1,89 g/L (3,35 4,92 mmol/L, limits included with ± 2% tolerated around). After V2 biological analysis the subjects will be eligible to the study on the following criteria: Fasting plasma LDLc level (Friedewald estimation method) between 1,3 and 1,89 g/L (3,35 4,92 mmol/L, limits included with ± 2% tolerated around). A rescreening can occur from 2 months after the exit of study for failure to comply with the one or more of the eligibility criteria listed above. Volunteers with the following criteria will be considered as non eligible to the study (assessment based on the medical examination performed at V1 with a checking at V3): Suffering from a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, uncontrolled thyroidal trouble or other chronic severe disease.

Regular intake of dietary supplements or "functional foods" which may interfere with lipid absorption and/or metabolism (e.g. rich in plant stanol or sterol like PROACTIV or DANACOL products, red yeast rice, policosanol, omega3 fatty acids like fish oils, ST HUBERT OMEGA 3 or PRIMEVERE products, soya protein, oat fiber like QUAKER OATS, psyllium, chitosan, guar gum, inulin, etc.) or stopped less than 3 months before the randomization. Under treatment which could disturb microbiota balance or stopped in a too short period before the randomization (e.g. less than one month for laxatives, less than 6 weeks for antibiotics). Regular intake of dietary supplements or "functional foods" containing prebiotics, probiotics or symbiotics (e.g. BION 3, LACTIBIANE, ACTIMEL, ACTIVIA, etc.) or stopped less than 1 month before the randomization. Under treatment or dietary supplement which could significantly affect parameter(s) followed during the study according to the investigator or stopped in a too short period before the randomization. With significant change in food habits or in physical activity in the 3 months before randomization or not agreeing to keep them unchanged throughout the study. With reported body weight variation &gt; 5% in the 3 months prior the randomization or with a hyper or hypocaloric diet planned in the next 5 months.

Under legal protection (guardianship, wardship) or deprived from his rights following administrative or judicial decision. Presenting a psychological or linguistic incapability to sign the informed consent. Impossible to contact in case of emergency. After V1 biological analysis the subjects will be considered as non eligible to the study on the following criteria : Fasting plasma glucose level &gt; 1,26 g/L (6,99 mmol/L). Fasting plasma triglycerides &gt; 3,5 g/L (3,95 mmol/L). Fasting plasma TC, HDLc or insulin with an abnormality judged as clinically significant according to the investigator. After V2 biological analysis the subjects will be considered as non eligible to the study on the following criteria: Fasting plasma TC, HDL or TG with an abnormality judged as clinically significant according to the investigator. Serum AST, ALT, GGT, ALP or bilirubin with an abnormality judged as clinically significant according to the investigator. Serum urea or creatinine with an abnormality judged as clinically significant according to the investigator.

The included subjects who cannot be randomized at V3 because of a too short wash out period related to the non inclusion criteria E8, E10, E12 or E34 can delay their visit V3 without to exceed 28 days from the visit V2. A rescreening can occur from 2 months after the exit of study for failure to comply with the one or more of the eligibility criteria listed above (except for E33 criteria).</criteria>
