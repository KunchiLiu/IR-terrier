	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine which of three types of dressings, a dry sterile dressing, a metallic silver dressing or an ionic silver dressing provided better patient outcomes for the post-sternotomy cardiac surgery patient population. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, the hypothesis was that subjects who received either of the silver impregnated dressings would have better outcomes (better wound healing, less discomfort, and less incidence of infection). Investigators also evaluated dressing factors such as adherence, time for application and ease of use.</brief_summary>
