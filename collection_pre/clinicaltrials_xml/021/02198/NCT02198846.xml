	<brief_summary>Insulin deficiency resulted from progressive beta cell failure and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes requires exogenous insulin therapy, escaping from oral antihyperglycemic agents. Previous data have been suggested that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) does not only have efficacy in glucose control but also restore beta cell failure. The investigators plan to compare the efficacy/safety and beta cell function between insulin pump treatment and the intensification of conventional treatment in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
