	<brief_summary>Over the past years, arterial closure systems have tended to replace manual compression to ensure hemostasis at femoral artery puncture points. Arterial closure systems reduce hemostasis and patient immobilization times, thus enabling early resumption of walking. These devices have contributed extensively to the development of outpatient stays for cardiology, vascular and neuro-radiology procedures. According to certain studies however, it would appear that arterial closure devices do not present any greater benefits than manual compression in terms of hemostasis and complications. Moreover, the use of increasingly small diameter instruments would tend to render manual compression sufficient. Finally, the use of these devices generates additional costs. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of manual compression before early resumption of walking in patients managed by conventional hospitalization for a diagnostic or therapeutic endovascular procedures by retrograde femoral puncture with 5F guide catheter.</brief_summary>
