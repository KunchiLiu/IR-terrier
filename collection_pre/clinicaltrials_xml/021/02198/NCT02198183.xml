	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure cerebral oxygenation and cardiac output of total shoulder replacement patients undergoing general anesthesia (GA) and positive-pressure ventilation (PPV). We hypothesize that cerebral desaturation occurs frequently during GA with PPV, but is rare during GA and spontaneous ventilation. We also hypothesize that cardiac output usually is well maintained under GA in the sitting position when epinephrine is used, but that decreased cardiac output increases the risk of cerebral desaturation.</brief_summary>
