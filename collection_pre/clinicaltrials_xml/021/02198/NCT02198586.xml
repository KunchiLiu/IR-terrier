	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the APOE genotype on brain morphology, function and metabolism, related to other factors such as cognitive reserve, cognition and episodic memory, in subjects at greater risk of developing AD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apoe Impact Study on Brain Structure and Function, in a Population 45 to 75 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of age and the APOE genotype on brain morphology and function, in 700 cognitively healthy individuals, 45 to 75 years old, recruited from an ongoing longitudinal cognition study exploring memory and executive functions (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01835717). All subjects have been APOE genotyped and underwent a clinical and cognitive assessment. Within this study, the subjects will be submitted to an MRI scanning protocol including morphological and resting state acquisitions. An identical follow-up MRI session will be performed in 2 years' time. The analyses will be focused on detecting the effect of the APOE allelic variants on the change rate of the neuroimaging variables as well as its interaction with aging.</detailed_description>
