	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of a phone-based weight loss program that has stress management techniques integrated throughout (Weight Talk-Mindfulness). The program is targeted at employees of certain companies who meet a cut-off score on a measure of stress-related eating. The control group will receive a standard phone-based program with no additional stress management information (Weight Talk-Standard). - Hypothesis 1: Participants in Weight Talk-Mindfulness (WT-M; n=50) will experience decreases in their stress-related &amp; emotion-related eating compared to the Weight Talk-Standard (WT-S; n=25) group. - Hypothesis 2: The WT-M group will lose more weight compared to the WT-S control group. - Hypothesis 3: Participants in WT-M will experience decreased perceived stress, increased eating self-efficacy, increased acceptance of weight-related thoughts &amp; feelings and increased mindfulness compared to those in the WT-S control arm. - Hypothesis 4: Participants in WT-M will be equally as satisfied with their weight loss program as those in WT-S.</brief_summary>
