Starting with peer support therapy in the first three months, the intervention group will then take Yoga music therapy before bed for another three months and be given support and guidance by the peer supporters. Compare the baselines and variations of two group's sleep, depression, blood sugar and related biochemical indicators, and self-management, life quality, medication and other aspects at the third month and sixth month.
