	<brief_summary>ItÂ´s a clinical research of the effects in portal hypertension caused by simvastatin. We are going to use the hepatic venous pressure gradient(HVPG) measurement and the azygos flow at echoendoscopy to evaluate the benefits of the drug. Preliminary studies demonstrated that simvastatin can lower portal pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simvastatin Effect on Portal Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The simvastatin can target the liver enhancing nitric oxide intra-hepatic and lowering resistance that may be responsible for most of cirrhosis complications. Indeed, the potential use of this drug may ameliorate the HVPG and azygos flow. Portal hypertension is responsible for most of the cases of death in cirrhosis. The esophageal varices, ascites and hepatorenal syndrome are the most harmful consequences of cirrhosis that should be prevented. In that way, simvastatin appears as a promising therapy.The study will include two groups of patients using aleatory randomization and one group will receive simvastatin while the other will receive placebo blindly. At the start and at the end of the study the patients will be submitted to HVPG measurement and azygous vein flow measure. The endpoints will be the normalization of HVPG or lower significantly(20% or more. The patients will be followed for 6 months after the end of the study.</detailed_description>
