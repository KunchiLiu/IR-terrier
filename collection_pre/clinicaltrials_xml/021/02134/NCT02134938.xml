	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether low caloric, low energy density, konjac food products are effective in appetite regulation when administered as caloric replacements. It is hypothesized that replacement of typical, balanced, vegetarian meals with konjac food products will have comparable satiety scores, decreased postprandial glucose response, and will not significantly affect subsequent food intake.</brief_summary>
