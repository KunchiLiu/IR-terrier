	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that moderate scoliosis patients have postural and kinematic differences (static and dynamic) compared with healthy volunteers and it is possible to characterize and quantify. The aim of this study is the detailed analysis of postural anomalies in moderate scoliosis patients compared with healthy volunteers</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects participating in the study must wear sensors that will be arrange at the shoulders, spine, pelvis and legs. Subjects will perform under the direction of the investigator, different tasks of a total duration of 45 minutes. During the period of experimentation, the data collected will be: - the positions of each one of the sensors in all three planes of space, - the ground support forces</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Scoliosis Group female children patients from 9 to 16 years old, patients with idiopathic scoliosis lumbar left and / or right thoracic, patients with moderate scoliosis: Cobb angle measured on a radiograph between 10 ° and 25°, both parents of patients must be affiliated to social security or similarly regime. Healthy Volunteers Group female children from 9 to 16 years old, matched in age and size with scoliosis patients, children with no neuromuscular disease that may have an influence on the required tasks, both parents of children must be affiliated to social security or similarly regime, refusal to consent: from child's in age to consent or from both parents</criteria>
