	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-site trial assessing the sensitivity of Chagas Detect™ Plus rapid test versus standard reference tests (e.g. IFA, IHA, RIPA) for Chagas diagnosis. The Chagas Detect™ Plus rapid test serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of Chagas infection in patients. This test is intended to be used on human whole blood or serum samples. Chagas Detect™ Plus results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing with a reference standard test. Subjects will be patients at clinical sites located in Chagas-endemic areas. After informed consent is obtained and the subject is screened for eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be collected. One is blood from finger prick, and the other is blood from venous puncture (drawn from vein in arm). Rapid tests and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples from each method independently.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All age groups and both sexes for archive samples, adults only and both sexes for prospective samples. Samples collected from subjects living in T. cruzi endemic regions. Information must be available about symptoms, age, and sex of patient from which samples are collected. The location of sample collection must be recorded. Archived samples with linked personal identifiers or any sample for which personal information can be discovered. Prospective samples from nursing home residents; inmates/subjects in police custody; participants who are unable to understand verbal or written local language in which a certified translation of the informed consent is available, or requires a Legal Authorized Representative (LAR) for consent.
