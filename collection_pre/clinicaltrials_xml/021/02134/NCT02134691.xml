	<brief_summary>This project will examine the impact of PE therapy for the treatment of PTSD with a sample of Latinos. The need to provide effective treatment to Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD is critical given the high prevalence of PTSD among Latinos. Furthermore, PTSD remains an under detected and under treated condition. Untreated PTSD has a substantial impact on health, functioning and quality of life. PE is one of the most empirically supported psychological interventions for PTSD. However, most studies that evidence the efficacy of PE have been conducted mainly with English-speaking Caucasian populations. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the well-being of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD.</brief_summary>
