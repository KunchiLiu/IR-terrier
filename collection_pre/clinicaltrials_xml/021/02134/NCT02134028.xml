	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with asthma who completed the treatment period in a previous dupilumab asthma clinical study (ie, PDY14192, EFC13579 or EFC13691) or patients with asthma who completed the treatment and followup periods in previous dupilumab asthma Study DRI12544. Exclusion criteria: Patients who experienced any hypersensitivity reactions to Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in the previous dupilumab asthma study, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, could indicate that continued treatment with dupilumab, may present an unreasonable risk for the patient.
