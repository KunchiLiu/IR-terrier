	<brief_summary>Bed rest produces insulin resistance in healthy volunteers. In this study the investigators aim to investigate the effect of 8 days bed rest on the incretin effect and how alternate daily fasting affects cognitive function and the insulin resistance produced by bed rest. The subjects will be randomized to either 3 meals a day (isocaloric diet), alternate daily fasting or one meal/day every second day (25% of daily calorie need) and four meals/day every second (175% of daily calorie need). The investigators hypothesize: 1. Bed rest reduces the incretin effect 2. Alternate daily fasting improves the cognitive function (memory and concentration) compared to isocaloric diet 3. Alternate daily fasting reduces insulin resistance produced by bed rest compared to isocaloric diet</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subjects will undergo 8 days of bedrest. Outcome measures will be performed before, under and immediately after the bed rest period. The individual study period will be 10 days in total.</detailed_description>
