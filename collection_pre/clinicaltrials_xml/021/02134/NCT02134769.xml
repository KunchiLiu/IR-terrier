	<brief_summary>Bionecteur® is a protective non-touch applicator to ensure aseptic connection made by Vygon. However, there are no studies describing a positive effect of using Bionecteurs ® in regard to catheter-related bloodstream infections. In this study Bionecteur® will be used on central venous lines and arterial lines in postoperative patients of a 40-bed ICU. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections will we compared to patients without inclusion of Bionecteur® devices.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Prospective, randomised observational study - Postsurgical patients in an anesthesiological ICU with ICU LOS (LOS: length of stay) &gt; 3 days - Inclusion: ---- Age ≥ 18 years ---. demand of central venous and arterial line --- written consent of patient and/or assignee - Exclusion - Handicapped patients - patient with ICU LOS &lt; 3 days - Study design 1. Three days after admission to ICU blood cultures are drawn to exclude preexisting blood stream infection 2. Patients in a bed with even number are assigned to Bionecteur® group. Control group (without using bionecteurs) are patients with an odd bed number. 3. Biconecteurs® are connected to all lumens of the central catheter and to arterial catheter. Control group is treated without using Bionecteurs®. Handling of vascular catheters are performed as described in institutional guidelines in both groups. 4. Catheter-related bloodstream infections are monitored by an independent person during ICU treatment 5. The study will be finished ab discharge of ICU or removal of catheters.</detailed_description>
