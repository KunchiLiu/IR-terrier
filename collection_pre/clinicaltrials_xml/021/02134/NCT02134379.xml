	<brief_summary>This pilot study proposes to perform measurements of approved thoracic impedance technology that will help answer questions in patients with decompensated heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Thoracic Impedance as a Marker for Heart Failure Decompensation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improved metrics derived from the transthoracic impedance (Z) available from implanted Medtronic devices may provide more sensitive indicators of the state of compensation for heart failure patients. Quantification of specific data may provide new information that can improve quality of life for patients and offer vital information to clinicians regarding the adequacy of inpatient and outpatient assessment and management of acute decompensated heart failure.</detailed_description>
