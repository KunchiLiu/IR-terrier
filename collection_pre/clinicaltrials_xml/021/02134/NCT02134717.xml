	<brief_summary>The study hypothesizes that inhibition of the receptor CCR5 by maraviroc will diminish inflammation in patients with sarcoidosis. Subjects with active sarcoidosis will first undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to recover lung immune cells for baseline analysis. They will then receive the drug maraviroc for 6 weeks duration. They will then undergo a repeat bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to recover lung immune cells for analysis following maraviroc treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of CCR5 Inhibition on Sarcoidosis Immunophenotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of CCR5 by maraviroc may have a beneficial immunomodulatory effect on the granulomatous inflammation of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The specific aim of this proposal is the investigate the effect of CCR5 inhibition on the trafficking of mononuclear cells to the lung, skin, peripheral blood in subjects with active sarcoidosis exposed to the CCR5 inhibitor, maraviroc. A second aim will be to isolate by cell sorting CD4+CCR5+ T cells for amplified gene expression profiling before and after CCR5 inhibition, experiments the investigators believe will elucidate genes associated with downstream activation and inhibition of CCR5 receptor function.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically proven sarcoidosis from any site (noncaseating granulomas without other causes). 2. Diagnosis of active sarcoidosis (Sec. 5.5.4.t) clinical stage II by CXR. 3. FVC &gt;4S% and DLCO &gt;50% of predicted values. 4. Evidence of active sarcoidosis (see criteria above) 5. Able and willing to complete all study procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy, postdrug surveillance) 6. Age: 18+ years old (prevalence greatest in young adults; pediatric maraviroc safety not established). 7. Not on immunosuppression for sarcoidosis at the time of recruitment, (e.g., steroids, TNFa blockade) 8. Liver function (transaminases, bilirubin), coagulation (INR, PTT, platelet count), BUN, creatinine, and WBC within normal limits. 9. If female: negative pregnancy test, agreement to use reliable contraception if of childbearing potential 30 days prior and for 30 days after study completion (drug safety during pregnancy not established). 10. Negative HIV and HBsAg tests 1. Diagnosis of infection based upon clinical evaluation and/or microbial testing. 2. The diagnosis of any disease involving the heart, lungs, liver (HVC), kidney, hematologic, endocrine, or Gl systems which, in the judgment of the PI, would pose an undue risk to the subject if they participated in this study. This includes but is not limited to diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, liver disease (HVC), or history of malignancy. 3. Medications that will either inhibit or induce CYP3A4 (including St John's Wort)</criteria>
