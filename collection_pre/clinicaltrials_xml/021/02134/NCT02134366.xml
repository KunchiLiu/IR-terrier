	<brief_title>Clobazam Use in Epilepsia Partialis Continua - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First approved in the United States in 2011 for use in treating Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, clobazam is the only 1, 5-benzodiazepine that is currently approved for clinical use in the United States. In previous clinical trials clobazam has been shown to have a greater efficacy and produce fewer side effects in individuals when it's adverse event profile is compared to the traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam. As a benzodiazepine, clobazam has been found to have anticonvulsant properties, and structural differences as a 1,5-benzodiazepines that appear to have a broader spectrum of anticonvulsant activity than those found in 1,4-benzodiazepines. In previous reports, clobazam has been seen to be effective in ether terminating or reducing both EPC in particular and partial status epilepticus.</detailed_description>
