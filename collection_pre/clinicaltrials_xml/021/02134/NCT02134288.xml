	<brief_title>Belatacept for Renal Transplant Recipients With Delayed Graft Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who undergo kidney transplantation require long term immunosuppressive therapy (therapy that reduces your body's ability to respond to anything foreign) to prevent damage to the graft, and some experience delayed graft function (DGF, a condition in which the transplanted kidney does not function properly) after transplantation. This study is being conducted to determine if kidney transplant recipients with delayed graft function (DGF) who are switched to the immunosuppressive regimen of belatacept with mycophenolate and steroid will recover from delayed graft function (DGF) in less time (which could potentially lower the risk of rejection associated with delayed graft function) than kidney transplant recipients with delayed graft function (DGF) who remain on the current standard immunosuppressive regimen (standard of care).</detailed_description>
