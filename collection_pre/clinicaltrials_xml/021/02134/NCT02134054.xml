	<brief_summary>In this cross sectional and longitudinal study, patients with inflammatory bowel disease on biological treatment with infliximab or adalimumab will be included. After inclusion, the dosage of their existing biological therapy will be adjusted following regular trough-level and antibody-level monitoring, according to a treatment algorithm. Disease activity markers, fatigue and QoL will be assessed during the study. The hypothesis is that therapeutic drug monitoring may improve clinical disease outcome after one year of follow-up.</brief_summary>
