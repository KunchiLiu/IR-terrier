	<brief_title>Open-Label, Dose-Finding, Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability Study of Oritavancin in Pediatric Patients With Suspected or Confirmed Bacterial Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study of oritavancin in pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) with suspected or confirmed Gram-positive bacterial infections. Approximately 48 patients will be enrolled at 10-15 US centers. This study will include 5 age cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the older age cohort (12-&lt;18 years). The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg. The safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure safety and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort. At least 8 patients will be enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to &lt;3 month age cohort which will have at least 16 patients enrolled. Seven PK samples will be collected over 14 days. The safety follow-up will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females &lt;18 years of age Neonates must be at least 34 weeks postconception age Parent or legal guardian has given informed consent, as appropriate; and pediatric patient has given verbal assent where appropriate. Suspected or confirmed Gram positive bacterial infection receiving antibiotic therapy Intravenous access to administer study drug In the investigator's opinion, the patient will require hospitalization for at least 24 hours after the study drug is administered. Septic shock or acute haemodynamic instability. History of immunerelated hypersensitivity reaction to glycopeptides (such as vancomycin, televancin, or teicoplanin) or any of their excipients. Currently using vancomycin or other glycopeptides Females who are of childbearing potential and unwilling to practice abstinence or use at least two methods of contraception or female patients of childbearing who are lactating or have a positive pregnancy test result at screening Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth control during the entire study period Any surgical or medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at increased risk or is likely to interfere with study procedures or PK of the study drug. Patients whom the investigator considers unlikely to adhere to the protocol, comply with study drug administration, or complete the clinical study Treatment with investigational medicinal product or investigational device within 30 days (or 5 times the halflife of the investigational medicine, whichever is longer) before enrollment and for the duration of the study. Any clinically significant disease or condition affecting a major organ system, including but not limited to gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrinologic, bronchopulmonary, neurological, metabolic or cardiovascular disease.</criteria>
