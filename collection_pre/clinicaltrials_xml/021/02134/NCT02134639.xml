	<brief_summary>Through the investigators involvement in an international consortium, the investigators had the opportunity to acquire a new type of synthetizer for the radiolabelling of such tracers. The investigators propose in this project to develop on their site, the radiosynthesis of 68Ga-DOTATOC and to evaluate prospectively the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, compared with the current imaging OctreoScan®. The objectives of this project are: - to validate the radiosynthesis of 68Ga-DOTATOC on their site with a new synthetizer - and clinically evaluate, through a prospective preliminary study, the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT with 68Ga-DOTATOC in comparison with other standard imaging examinations.</brief_summary>
