	<detailed_description>This survey was designed to examine the effect on QOL improvement and convenience of switching to leuprorelin acetate 3 month depot 11.25 mg injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg injection kit) from a 4-week adjuvant therapy with a LH-RHa 1 month depot over 48 weeks in premenopausal breast cancer participants in daily medical practice, as well as to evaluate the influence of condition of estrogen receptor expression on the efficacy and safety of leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit . For adults, leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg Injection Kit) is usually administered subcutaneously once every 12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle pointed upward, allowing the entire suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the powder. The powder is then fully suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not generated.</detailed_description>
