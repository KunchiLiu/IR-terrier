	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Everolimus in Reducing Total Native Kidney Volume in Polycystic Kidney Disease Transplanted Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney graft recipients receiving a firs kidney graft (between 6 months and 5 years post-transplantation) will be randomized 1:1 to receive an everolimus based immunosuppression (in association with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil) or to continue their calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression regimen.
