	<brief_summary>Swallowing is a complex phenomenon that allows oral feeding while protecting the airway. It involves many brain areas, including primary motor and sensory areas. Its dysfunction, called oropharyngeal dysphagia is present in approximately 60% of patients with a stroke. In this case, it is conventionally translated by a swallow response time delay of the swallowing reflex. Pathophysiology of dysphagia is explained by impairment of the dominant swallowing, function that representation center is bi-hemispheric but asymmetric (Hamdy, 1997). Half of patients with a stroke supra-tentoriel with oropharyngeal dysphagia (about 55 % of strokes) regain normal swallowing in a few weeks ( Barer, 1989). Mechanisms that determine the recovery appear to be related to a reorganization of the motor cortex intact. Patients who retain disorders are those who have not cortical reorganization. With this in mind a team used different methods known to modulate brain plasticity, which electrotherapy with an application endo- pharyngeal sensory threshold. This stimulation increases the excitability of the cortico- bulbar reflex, which improves swallowing function in the clinical application. The hypothesis of this work is that the transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied submental, noninvasive technique, would also have an impact on cortical plasticity may explain the improved coordination of swallowing observed in earlier studies (Verin , 2011) ( Gallas , 2010).</brief_summary>
