	<brief_summary>There are several different methods that can be used to determine the dose of iodinated contrast material for a CT scan. These include a standard fixed dose, a dose based on total body weight, a dose based on body mass index, a dose based on lean body weight, and a dose based on estimated lean body weight. The fixed dose method uses a predetermined amount of contrast material for all patients having a CT scan of the abdomen regardless of size. This is the standard procedure currently used at Duke. The other methods use the patient's weight, either the total body weight or lean body weight, to determine the amount of contrast necessary for the CT exam. For this study, the investigators will use the fixed dose, total body weight, the lean body weight, and estimated lean body weight methods. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these five methods of determining the IV contrast volume and which may be best for abdominal CT scanning.</brief_summary>
