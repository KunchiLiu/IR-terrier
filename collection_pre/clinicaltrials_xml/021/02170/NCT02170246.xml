	<brief_summary>This research project will study whether the drug telmisartan administered in conjunction with antiretroviral therapy (ART) will help reduce nervous system infection with HIV. The investigators are studying the effect of this treatment in people who have contracted HIV infection within the past three weeks, and thus have a form of HIV called acute HIV infection. The investigators will measure biological markers of immune activation in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid to see if telmisartan may reduce the spread of HIV reservoirs in affected patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Note regarding the primary purpose of the study: In the Study Design section, this protocol is classified as "Other", since it is specifically designed to examine the effect of telmisartan administered in conjunction with ART on the size of HIV reservoirs in the central nervous system.</detailed_description>
