Therefore concentrations of ethinylestradiol will be measured from blood samples after administration of a single intramuscular dose of norethisterone. In a comparison arm concentrations of ethinylestradiol will be measured from blood samples after administration of a pill containing ethinylestradiol itself.</brief_summary>
