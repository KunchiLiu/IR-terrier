	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the performance and safety of the HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist System (HM3 LVAS) To support obtaining CE Mark for the HM3 LVAS in Europe, a multi-center clinical study will be conducted in multiple countries. The clinical study will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH/GCP and EN ISO 14155:2011 Requirements for Clinical Investigations and in accordance with country-specific requirements, under one clinical study protocol. This study will evaluate the performance of the HM3 LVAS, side effects and undesirable conditions within acceptable risks and weigh them against the intended performance of HM3 LVAS in accordance with Essential Requirements 2, 5 and 16 of the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD).</brief_summary>
