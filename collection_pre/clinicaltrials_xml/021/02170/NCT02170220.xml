	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine and its metabolites Lu AA34443 and Lu AA39835 following a single oral dose administration of vortioxetine 5 mg in participants with severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Vortioxetine in Normal Hepatic Function or Severe Hepatic Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested to assess how it moves throughout the body in people with severe hepatic impairment compared to people with normal hepatic function. This study looked at lab results in people who took vortioxetine. The study enrolled 12 participants. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment groups based on their hepatic function (severe hepatic impairment vs. normal hepatic function). All participants in both groups will receive one vortioxetine 5-mg tablet. This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 58 days. Participants made 2 visits to the clinic, including one 12-day period of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study. 7. Has a resting pulse and heart rate (as read on electrocardiogram [ECG]) between 51 and 100 beats per minutes (bpm), inclusive. For healthy participants in good physical condition and aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, the lower limit is 45 bpm. 8. Has a negative result at screening on the fecal occult blood screen. Healthy Participants (Normal Hepatic Function): 9. The participant, in opinion of the investigator, is in good health as determined by a prestudy physical examination, medical history, vital signs, ECG, and the results of blood biochemistry, hematology, and serology tests, and urinalysis. Participants with severe hepatic impairment: 10. Has been classified as having severe hepatic impairment as defined by the ChildPugh classification system. 11. Has case record notes demonstrating stable biochemistry as judged by the investigator prior to Screening. 12. Has case record notes demonstrating physical signs consistent with a clinical diagnosis of liver impairment (eg, liver firmness to palpation, splenic enlargement, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy, testicular atrophy, ascites, gynecomastia). 13. For participants with hepatic encephalopathy, the condition does not, in the investigator's opinion, interfere with the participant's ability to provide an appropriate informed consent. (Participants who have severe encephalopathy receive a score of 3 or 4. The score reflects the degree of encephalopathy off treatment. This will be documented in the source.) General: 1. Has received any investigational compound within 45 days prior to first dose of study medication. 2. Has received vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or in a dependant relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has received or donated more than 400 mL of blood or blood products within the 45 days preceding the beginning of the study or planned to donate blood during the study. 5. Has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies to vortioxetine or related compounds with same mechanism of action including any associated excipients. 6. Has a medical history of, or presence of, gastric or duodenal ulceration, gastritis, recent head injury or any other trauma within 1 week of Screening, extensive ecchymoses, hemoptysis, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, repeated or significant nose bleeds, periorbital hematoma, retinal detachment, menorrhagia, hematuria, or melena. 7. Has had an acute, clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication. 8. Has a history of abdominal surgery (except laparoscopic cholecystectomy or uncomplicated appendectomy), thoracic, or nonperipheral vascular surgery within 6 months prior to the study medication. 9. Has a history of cancer, other than basal cell or Stage 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has not been in remission for at least 5 years prior to the first dose of study drug. 10. Has taken any medications, supplements or food products except for those allowed for hepatically impaired participants, or approved by Takeda on a casebycase basis. 11. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during, or within 30 days after participating in this study; or intending to donate ova during such time period. 12. If male, the participant intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or for 30 days thereafter. 13. Has poor peripheral venous access. 14. Has a serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dL at Screening or Day 1 (Checkin). 15. Has active stage 3 or 4 encephalopathy. 16. Has a diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg or a systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg (supine) at Screening or Day 1. 17.
