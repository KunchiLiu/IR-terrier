	<brief_summary>Acute secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) often leads to dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) and can be a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Selective pulmonary vasodilation with inhaled nitric oxide (INO) has become the treatment of choice for this condition. The evidence supporting INO safety and efficacy under these circumstances is sparse, however, and is largely extrapolated from the use of INO in neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, the high cost and potential toxicity of INO makes the therapy far from ideal. Emerging evidence suggests that inhaled aerosolized prostacyclins such as iloprost may be a favorable alternative therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 1- In the original study, 3 doses of Iloprost were given. This was revised after 5 subjects were enrolled in order to study the effects of continuous delivery over a longer period of time. Phase 2 - All remaining subjects received Iloprost as a continuous treatment. The study was designed for an enrollment of 200 subjects and was ended early.</detailed_description>
