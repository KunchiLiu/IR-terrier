	<brief_title>A Placebo-controlled Study to Investigate Safety and Efficacy of BIA 2-093</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial was performed as a multicentre, add-on, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase II study. During the double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks) patients were assigned to three treatment groups receiving BIA 2 093 once daily (ODG - once-daily group), BIA 2 093 twice daily (TDG - twice-daily group) or placebo (PLG - placebo group), respectively. Daily doses of BIA 2 093 were increased at four-weekly periods (400 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg). On completion of the 12-week double-blind treatment period, a 1-week tapering period was scheduled.</detailed_description>
