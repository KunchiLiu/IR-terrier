	<brief_summary>Understanding the onset and progression of spinal cord disorders is an important aim in clinical neurology. An early diagnosis with consequent therapy might prevent the progression of disability. Therefore, we aim to determine structural and dynamic changes in the microstructure of the spinal cord and CSF, and to explore the relationships between the MRI parameters, clinical disability, and electrophysiology.</brief_summary>
