	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hyaluronic acid in the surgical treatment of periodontal pockets in people with gum disease. This research consists of clinical and radiographic studies. Participants should have symmetric periodontal pockets in the upper or lower jaw. Participants will be treated surgically using hyaluronic acid on one side of the jaw. Clinical indexes and radiographic cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images will be taken for each participant before surgical treatment and 12 months after surgical treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hyaluronic acid in the surgical treatment of infra-bony pockets in chronic periodontitis patients. This research consists of clinical and radiographic studies. 1- The clinical study: is a randomized controlled trial with a split mouth technique. Chronic periodontitis patients with Infra-bony pockets will be collected from the Department of Periodontics in faculty of dentistry - Damascus university. Participants should have symmetric infra-bony pockets in the upper or lower premolar area with pocket probing depth more than 6 mm. Participants will be treated surgically using open flap curettage. Open flap curettage will be done for each patient in both sides of the jaw, but hyaluronic acid will be used in one of the two sides with random allocation of the site that in going to be treated with hyaluronic acid. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, tooth mobility index, pocket probing depth and clinical attachment loss will be taken for each participant four times; before surgical treatment, 3 months, six months and 12 months after surgical treatment. Radiographic study: will be done using CBCT radiography technique. CBCT will be taken for each participant before and after 12 months of surgical treatment. Different distances, vertical bone fill and depth of infra-bony defect will be measured on CBCT images.</detailed_description>
