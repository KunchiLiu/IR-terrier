	<brief_summary>Dr. MacIntyre and his colleagues are studying inhaled medications in asthma. There are two new medications that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA): levalbuterol and formoterol. Both of these drugs are similar to standard asthma bronchodilator drugs but offer theoretical advantages in terms of fewer side effects. There are also newer devices to deliver these medications into the lungs: breath actuated nebulizers (BANs) and non-static chambers (Aerochamber-max) that can be used with metered dose inhalers (MDIs or "puffers"). The purpose of this study is to deliver these new medications using several different devices and measuring lung function, heart rate, and sensations of breathlessness.</brief_summary>
