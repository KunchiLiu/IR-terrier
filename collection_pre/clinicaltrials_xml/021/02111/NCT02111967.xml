	<brief_summary>In this study we compare the vitamin B12 status by measuring serum vitamin B12 and holotranscobalamin in type 2 diabetic patients with and without metformin treatment. Afterwars we investigate which biomarker could be adequate to reflect B12 status in metformin-treated patients. With the help of a questionnaire we assess clinical, nutritional and demographic factors which are associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.</brief_summary>
