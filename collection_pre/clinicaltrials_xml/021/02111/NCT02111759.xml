	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine if the knee flexion angle (KFA) during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) graft fixation has an effect on postoperative outcomes. The specific research questions are: what is the effect of the KFA on 1) patient-reported outcomes; 2) postoperative extension loss; 3) antero-posterior (AP) knee stability; 4) rate of re-operation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male and female patients older than 16 years old with an isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury as diagnosed by clinical examination and MRI No preexisting arthritis as defined by the KellgrenLawrence radiographic rating system Patients treated with an initial period of rehabilitation to eliminate swelling, optimize quadriceps strength and restore range of motion surgical management with a transtibial or anteromedial portal singlebundle ACLR with bone patella tendon bone (BPTB) autograft by a fellowshiptrained sports medicine surgeon. Acute ACL injuries that have not undergone an initial period of physical therapy in order to restore the aforementioned parameters Associated grade III injury to the MCL (medial opening &gt;10mm at 30 degrees of knee flexion or any medial opening in extension) Presence of a PCL or posterolateral corner injury Lack of informed consent.</criteria>
