	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether preoperative abdominal imaging using either CT angiogram (CTA), or MR angiogram (MRA) will impact perforator dissection time, cost, and patient outcomes in DIEP flap breast reconstruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Imaging in DIEP Flap Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will prospectively compare the clinical, economic and patient outcomes of preoperative imaging using either CTA or MRA with those of no preoperative imaging in patients undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction. Subjects will randomly undergo either a CTA scan or an MRA scan, or no scan (control) preoperatively. An operative plan based on perforator size and course will be devised by an interventional radiologist and a plastic surgeon. The DIEP flap procedure will be planned for controls. Subjects will not be told if the operative plan is changed intraoperatively. Flap dissection time and changes in operative plan will be recorded intraoperatively and surgeon stress will be evaluated following surgery. Pain and narcotic use will be evaluated preoperatively and on days 1-4 postoperatively. The Breast-Q will be completed preoperatively and at 3 weeks, 3 months and 12 months postoperatively. Groups will be compared in terms of all variables measured.</detailed_description>
