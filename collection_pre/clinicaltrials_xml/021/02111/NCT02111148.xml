	<brief_title>Vaginal Fluid Wash in Pre-labour Rupture of Membranes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of measuring the urea and creatinine level versus that of nitrazine test in vaginal wash of pre-labour rupture of membranes patients.Each patient with rupture of membranes will be assessed clinically and then if not in labour , patients will be divided into 2 groups, 5ml saline will be injected in the vagina of each patient in every group then the vaginal wash will be collected in a test tube. Urea and creatinine group, biochemical tests for urea and creatinine in mIU/ml to detect their presence in the wash will be done. In Nitrazine group wash will be assessed by nitrazine paper showing bluish discoloration in rupture membranes. Sensitivity of each test in diagnosed rupture of membranes will be assessed.Which means how many patients in each test show positive results in case of diagnosed case.</detailed_description>
