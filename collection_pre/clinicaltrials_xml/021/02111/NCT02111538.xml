	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is a prominent clinical feature of patients affected by systemic immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL), with a prevalence ranging between 25-50%. Although the prognosis predominantly depend on the presence and severity of cardiac involvement, it was shown that malnutrition is an independent predictor of survival and quality of life. However, the assessment of nutritional status by common indices based on anthropometry is not always feasible and accurate due to reduced performance status and/or the presence of fluid imbalances (for example edema and ascites). Several recent studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of the phase angle. Moreover, the value is supported by its applicability to patients who are bedridden or present alterations in the state of hydration.</brief_summary>
