	<brief_summary>In patients with asthma, reactions to allergens in the environment (such as mold, pollen, weed, domestic pets, and dust allergens) play an important role in causing asthma symptoms. However, upper respiratory tract infections, typically those caused by the common cold virus, rhinovirus, can also cause asthma to get worse. In previous studies at the University of Virginia, it was found that mild asthmatics, who had high levels of the allergy antibody (called IgE) in their blood, developed more persistent cold and chest symptoms when they were given an infection with rhinovirus (the most frequent cause of the common cold). The cold symptoms produced by rhinovirus tend to peak during the first 4 -7 days of the cold. These symptoms, including nasal congestion, are similar to what you have experienced with previous colds. This study is being done to learn how a common cold caused by a viral infection affects people with asthma. The goal is to learn how to improve the care of asthma symptoms caused by the common cold virus (called rhinovirus). Most adults experience one or two colds caused by rhinovirus every year. In addition, 75-80% of asthma exacerbations caused by viral infections are caused by this virus, primarily in children. Adults are less likely to experience significant changes in their asthma symptoms when they get colds, because they have developed protective immune responses from previous colds which help diminish symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Criteria for all subjects: Subjects must be able to understand and provide written informed consent Age 18 to &lt; 40 years of age, any gender, any racial/ethnic origin. Participant must be willing to comply with study procedures and requirements. Participant must be considered eligible for participation based on results of screening procedures conducted by protocol number IRB# 12656 at the University of Virginia. Criteria for asthmatic subjects: Physiciandiagnosed asthma Mild asthma as per adapted definition in the new NAEPP Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. History of intermittent use of inhaled bronchodilators (e.g. albuterol) to manage their symptoms Positive Methacholine challenge test (i.e. at least 20% fall in FEV1 at a Methacholine concentration of ≤8 mg/ml). Total serum IgE level &gt; 600 IU/ml). Positive test for allergen specific IgE antibody by prick skin testing to dust mite, Alternaria, and/or ragweed for subjects challenged with RV in the fall, or positive tests to tree and/or grass allergens for those challenged with RV in the spring. In keeping with the study design goals of inoculating subjects during periods of allergen exposure, sensitization to other allergens (e.g., cat or dog) will also qualify for enrollment if subjects are currently exposed to these allergens at home. Criteria for nonasthmatic subjects (controls): • Subjects without a history of asthma or allergic disorders (e.g., allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, or food allergies). This does not include those with hypersensitivity to drugs or insect venoms who represent a distinct genetic subgroup. Exclusion criteria: Criteria for all subjects: Inability or unwillingness of a participant or subject's legal representative to give written informed consent and HIPPA authorization Positive test for serum neutralizing antibody to RV16 (the strain of rhinovirus used for this study). Subjects with a neutralizing antibody titer &gt; 1:4 will be excluded. Chronic heart disease, lung diseases other than asthma, or other chronic illnesses, including primary and/or secondary immunodeficiency. An upper or lower respiratory tract infection within six weeks prior to enrollment Previous nasal or sinus surgery within the last 12 months. A history of smoking Female subjects who are, or who plan to become pregnant during the study, or who are nursing a baby. Additionally, to be included in this study, a woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, during the runin, and prior to viral inoculation and agree to use an effective method of birth control such as, but not limited to, birth control pills, contraceptive foam, diaphragm, IUD, abstinence, or condoms. Criteria for asthmatic subjects: An FEV1 &lt; 70% predicted at enrollment, or at baseline prior to the inoculation with RV16 (day 0) before doing the methacholine challenge test. However, to accommodate subjects with lower lung volumes (i.e., an FVC &lt; 88% at enrollment) an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 80% will be used as the exclusion criterion instead of the FEV1 &lt; 70% predicted value. Hospitalization or treatment in the ER for asthma during the last three years Intubation or management in the intensive care unit for an asthma exacerbation Subjects using inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled ipratropium bromide, an inhaled long acting beta agonist, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil or systemic leukotriene modifiers for their asthma on a daily basis within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or subjects using nasal corticosteroids on a daily basis within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Subjects who are currently receiving betaadrenergic blocking agents. Subjects who are currently receiving allergen immunotherapy (IT), or who have received allergen IT within the last 2 years. Nonasthmatic subjects (controls): Subjects who have a positive methacholine test Subjects who have a total IgE level &gt; 50 IU/ml and/or a positive skin test at screening under IRB protocol #12656.</criteria>
