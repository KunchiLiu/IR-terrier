	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer following surgery and chemotherapy. Vaccines made from a person's peptide treated white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of folate receptor alpha dendritic cell (FRalphaDC) vaccination (folate receptor alpha-peptide loaded dendritic cell vaccine). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Measure time to disease recurrence of patients treated with FRalphaDCs. II. Measure overall survival of patients treated with FRalphaDCs. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of FRalpha-specific interleukin (IL)-17-secreting T helper (Th) cells, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot). II. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of FRalpha-specific T cells that secrete interferon (IFN)gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL-10, and granzyme B, as determined by ELISpot. III. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces antibodies specific for FRalpha. IV. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reaction specific for FRalpha. V. Measure FRalpha expression in patients' primary tumors and in tumors that recur after FRalphaDC vaccine treatment (when available). VI. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination is associated with changes in peripheral blood immune cell subsets. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccine ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 months for 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed surgical diagnosis of stage IIIC or stage IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; patients with stage III cancer must have had peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis more than 2 cm in greatest dimension and/or regional lymph node metastasis; NOTE: Histologic confirmation of the primary tumor is required; eligible histologies include serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, transitional cell, undifferentiated, or mixed carcinoma Completion of cytoreductive surgery and has completed one (and only one) course of platinumbased chemotherapy (59 cycles) &gt;= 4 but =&lt; 20 weeks prior to registration; NOTE: cytoreductive surgery may have been prior to or after the first cycle of chemotherapy but must include hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy, if the uterus and/or ovaries had not previously been removed; NOTE: patients may have had more than one chemotherapy regimen (ex: paclitaxel/carboplatin switched to docetaxel/carboplatin due to allergy; weekly treatment switched to every 3 week treatment due to intolerance), but may not have received a separate course of treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer (OC); NOTE: patients may receive both neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy provided both regimens are platinumbased and total 9 or fewer chemotherapy cycles No evidence of disease at the time of registration, including no clinical concern for disease recurrence based on each of the following: No evidence of disease by history and physical exam Cancer antigen (CA)125 within normal limits Computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis demonstrating no radiological evidence of disease performed after completion of chemotherapy =&lt; 28 days before entering study Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L Platelet count &gt;= 75 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.5 g/dL Lymphocytes &gt;= 0.3 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless patient has a documented history of Gilbert's disease, then direct bilirubin =&lt; 1.0 mg/dL Aspartate transaminase (AST) =&lt; 3 x ULN Creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL Monocytes &gt;= 0.25 x 10^9/L Able to provide informed written consent Expected survival &gt; 6 months Willingness to return to Mayo Clinic Rochester for followup appointments Willingness to provide blood samples for immune assessment and other tests Willingness to undergo a tetanus vaccination Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: Patients known to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: Ongoing or active infection Symptomatic congestive heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Cardiac arrhythmia Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Other uncontrolled intercurrent illness (specify) Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm Other active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration; EXCEPTIONS: nonmelanotic skin cancer or carcinomainsitu of the cervix; NOTE: if there is a history or prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for their cancer History of myocardial infarction =&lt; 6 months prior to registration, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias Epithelial ovarian cancer of low malignant potential (borderline tumor) Treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other immunotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Immunosuppressive therapy (excluding topical steroids) for any other condition =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Persistent fever (&gt; 24 hours) documented by repeated measurement =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Diagnosis of autoimmune disease, including, but not limited to: Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) Multiple sclerosis (MS) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Ankylosing spondylitis Other autoimmune disease (specify) Use of a systemic steroid (&gt; 5 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration</criteria>
