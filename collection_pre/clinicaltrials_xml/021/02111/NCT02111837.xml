	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, reference-controlled 4-month pilot safety study to evaluate the effects of specific lipid fractions-enriched infant formulae on growth of infants aged 0-4 months. The study will test the hypothesis that growth of infants fed the specific lipid fractions-enriched infant formulae will be noninferior to growth of infants fed standard infant formula.</brief_summary>
