	<brief_summary>There is currently no good description of patients surviving an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in the ICU. For instance, the prevalence of OSA and sleep hypoventilation in a stable clinical condition is not known in this population. This prospective cohort describes the clinical profile, predictors of readmission (followed over a year), and the prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders (polysomnography in a stable clinical condition 3 months after ICU discharge) in patients treated for an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in the ICU.</brief_summary>
