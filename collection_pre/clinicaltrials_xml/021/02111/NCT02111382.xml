	<brief_summary>Osteopathic medicine is based on a diagnostic and therapeutic system to treat tissue mobility/ motility dysfunctions in general, using different approaches (depending on the target tissue) known as osteopathic manipulative treatment. Among all the available techniques those ones addressed to the cranial field are most questioned because of the lack of scientific evidence; but the compression of the 4th ventricle technique has been largely studied in clinical trials. Studies have shown that the technique may affect both central and autonomous nervous system, modulating some reflexes (Traube-Hering baro signal), and modifying brain cortex electrical activity through central sensitization in subjects with chronic low back pain. Thus, investigators hypothesize that the compression of the 4th ventricle may modulate peak alpha frequency (electroencephalographic assessment) and promote physical relaxation in subjects in vigil.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled crossover trial with blinded assessor was designed to test the hypothesis. A total of 81 participants will be assigned to three treatment conditions, with seven days of washout: compression of the 4th ventricle group; sham compression of the 4th ventricle group; control group (no intervention). All participants will be recruited at the Outpatient Rehabilitation Service of the University Hospital of Brasília - University of Brasília (Brazil).</detailed_description>
