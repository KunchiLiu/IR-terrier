	<brief_title>Efficacy, Tolerability and Safety of LAS41004 Formulations in a Psoriasis Plaque Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this trial three concentrations of bexarotene in combination with a fixed concentration of betamethasone dipropionate, as well as monotherapy with bexarotene, will be investigated regarding their efficacy, tolerability and safety in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis and will be compared with the vehicle and an active comparator. Since a side effect of the application of corticosteroids is skin atrophy, additionally three non-lesional test areas (not affected by psoriasis) on the volar forearm will be treated with the active reference product, one of the fixed combinations and the vehicle. Skin atrophy will be investigated by visual assessment and ultrasound at these test areas</detailed_description>

Plaques with a clinical score of the parameter erythema and or induration of ≥ 2 for each sign at the screening visit. At Day 1 each parameter has to be scored ≥ 2. Where more than one plaque is to be used, plaques should be comparable, with at least "2" in each score for erythema and induration. • Body surface area (BSA) involvement &lt; 10 %. Prepared to give written informed consent specific to the trial, before any assessment is performed. • In the case of women of childbearing potential using reliable methods of contraception which result in a low failure rate i.e. less than 1% per year (e.g. contraceptive implants or injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner). During the study an additional barrier method (e.g. condoms) should be used. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, ovariectomy or tubal ligation), postmenopausal status (continuous amenorrhea of at least 2 years). In the case of men with partners of childbearing potential willingness of using condoms during the study conduct and 1 month after end of treatment.
