	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). This study is conducted in 2 parts where treatment will be administered in 3-week (21-day) cycles for 6 cycles. A standard 3+3 design will be employed in Part 1 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which will then define the dose to be used in Part 2.</brief_summary>
