	<brief_summary>Targeting the amount of fluid given to measurements of the patients own fluid status during major abdominal surgery has been linked with improved speed of recovery of gut function and reduced length of hospital stay, mortality and complications. Pleth variability index (PVI) offers a noninvasive, risk and pain free alternative to more invasive forms of monitoring to direct how much fluid to give. The study aims primarily to measure and compare how much fluid is given when guided by PVI compared to the established techniqueÍ¾ oesophageal doppler during major abdominal surgery. The study will compare 40 patients undergoing major elective abdominal surgery. Patients will receive intraoperative fluid guided by either oesophageal doppler or PVI. Secondarily, the study will examine biochemical markers, length of hospital stay and how frequently complications occur</brief_summary>
