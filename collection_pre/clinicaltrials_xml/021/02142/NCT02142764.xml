In spite of many works, the data in the literature concerning the antigens targeted by the CD8+ T-Cell response are still contradictory and insufficient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preliminary Study for Selective Detection of the CD8+ Myelin Specific T Cell in the Blood of Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 patients distributed in 3 groups of 10 patients with specific inclusion criteria will participate in this trial: - 10 MS patients in early disease onset, - 10 MS patients under Natalizumab treatment - and control group of 10 patients with other neurological diseases.
