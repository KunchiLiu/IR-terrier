	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of natalizumab (BG00002, Tysabri®) in the study population (Russian participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis). The secondary objectives are to look at evaluation of severity of relapse, hospitalization and steroid use requirement; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), functional tests, quality of life self-assessment questionnaires including the short form health survey self-assessment questionnaire (SF-36) and multiple sclerosis impact scale 29 (MSIS-29), evidence of MRI disease activity, participants free of disease activity (clinical activity and/MRI activity) and anti JC Virus (JCV) antibody evaluation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Must be natalizumab naïve. Must have a documented diagnosis of a relapsing remitting form of MS as defined by the revised McDonald Committee criteria (Polman et al., 2011) Must have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year: Must be stable in disability for at least 30 days prior to enrollment to the study Must be stable in symptomatic management of the disease, specifically spasticity, depression and fatigue for at least 30 days prior to enrollment to the study. Must be considered by the Investigator to be free of signs and symptoms suggestive of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on medical history, physical examination, or laboratory testing. Must be willing to discontinue and remain free from concomitant immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment (including IFNbeta and Glatiramer Acetate) while being treated with natalizumab during the study. Key Medical History: Onset of a relapse within 50 days prior to first infusion. Considered by the Investigator to be immunocompromised, based on medical history, physical examination, or laboratory testing or due to prior immunosuppressive treatment History of, or available abnormal laboratory results indicative of, any significiant viral, cardiac, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, psychiatric (including major depression), renal, and/or other major disease that would preclude the administration of a recombinant humanized antibody immunomodulating agent. The Investigator must rereview the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any diseases that would preclude treatment. History of malignancy (subjects with basal cell carcinoma that has been completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible) Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection or hematological malignancy History of organ transplantation (including antirejection therapy) A clinically significant infectious illness (e.g. abscess, pneumonia, septicemia) within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Treatment History: Treatment with any kind of immunosuppressant medications (e.g., mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, fingolimod, cladribine) within 6 months prior to Screening Miscellaneous: Female subjects who are not postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile (does not include tubal ligation), or unwilling to practice effective contraception (as defined by the Investigator) during the study Women who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant while on study Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Biogen Idec, make the subject unsuitable for enrollment into this study.
