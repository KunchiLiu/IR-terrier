	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of raptor/rictor-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (TORC1/2) inhibitor MLN0128 when given in combination with bevacizumab in treating patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor, or a solid tumor that has spread and not responded to standard treatment. TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the progression of tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORC1/2 Inhibitor MLN0128 and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma or Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of daily oral MLN0128 (TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128) when administered with bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors including recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). II. To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of the combination of MLN0128 and bevacizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination of MLN0128 and bevacizumab, as determined by response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. To assess tolerability throughout study therapy with MLN0128 and bevacizumab, including beyond the MTD interval with the following measures of cumulative treatment-related toxicities: frequency of toxicities leading to missed doses or delays; percentage of cycles given or not within 7 days of their scheduled times; percentage of actual planned dosage administration; percentage of patients that discontinue study drugs due to treatment related toxicity. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of MLN0128 in combination with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM by evaluating the plasma and CSF concentrations of MLN0128 in the absence and presence of bevacizumab. II. To perform archival tumor analysis for markers of dysregulated cell signaling that may predict response to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (expression by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (expression by IHC and deletion by FISH), phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (AKT), p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP), p-mTOR and p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk) in patients with recurrent GBM. III. To analyze select phosphorylated proteins (ERK, AKT, mTOR, 4EBP1, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta [GSK3beta], ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kDa, polypeptide 2 [p70S6K], rS6) from tumor biopsies obtained at baseline and after treatment with MLN0128 from endometrial and ovarian cancer patients enrolled in stage 2. IV. To analyze circulating plasma levels of angiogenic growth factors before, during and after treatment with MLN0128 and bevacizumab V. To perform genetic mutation analysis and proteomic analysis of tissue from biopsies of endometrial and ovarian cancer patients including analysis of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) and PTEN. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MLN0128. Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent glioblastoma or an advanced solid tumor in which bevacizumab has shown benefit in specific disease population and for which standard or curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective Measurable or evaluable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for nonGBM tumors and by Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria for GBM For stage 1 (all patients) and dose expansion (stage 2) endometrial and ovarian cancer cohorts, participants are allowed following unlimited prior therapy; for stage 2 GBM participants, no more than 2 prior relapses are allowed; for these patients, relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/ chemo if that was used as initial therapy) or a subsequent therapy; the intent therefore is that GBM patients enrolling onto stage 2 had no more than 3 prior therapies (initial and treatment for 2 relapses); if the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anticancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse NOTE: for participants who had prior therapy for a lowgrade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of glioblastoma will be considered the first relapse; therefore, these participants may have had more than 3 prior therapies Patients must have recovered from clinically significant toxicity of prior therapy to grade =&lt; 1 or pretreatment baseline; the following intervals from previous treatments are required prior to day 1 of study therapy: 12 weeks from the completion of radiation for recurrent GBM unless there is surgical diagnosis of recurrence or a new lesion that was not previously radiated 6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy 3 weeks from a nonnitrosourea chemotherapy 4 weeks from an investigational agent (not Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) (or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter) 2 weeks from administration of a noncytotoxic, FDAapproved agent (e.g., erlotinib, hydroxychloroquine, etc.) (or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;
