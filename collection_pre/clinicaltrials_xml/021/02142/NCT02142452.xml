	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the efficacy of a tailored behavioral lifestyle modification program to support cardiovascular health in postpartum women with excessive gestational weight gain. This program will include a mobile health texting component postpartum to support changes in nutrition and physical activity. The investigators will randomize women into either the control arm (usual care) or the intervention (usual care + mobile health program postpartum). The women will be recruited during their 3rd trimester once they have been identified as gaining too much weight according to the 2009 IOM guidelines during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
