	<brief_title>F901318 Single Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double blind, placebo controlled, ascending single intravenous dose, sequential group study. Forty subjects will be studied in 5 cohorts (Groups A to E), each group consisting of 8 subjects. Each subject will be on study for approximately 6 weeks. Each subject will participate in one treatment cohort only, residing at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 6 (120 hours post-dose). Each cohort will be dosed in a leading edge design in which two subjects will receive study drug (1 active and 1 placebo) on the first dosing day, and the last 6 will receive study drug (active or placebo) on the second dosing day. All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the dose of study medication. Cohorts will be dosed at 2 weekly intervals. There will be a review of safety and pharmacokinetic data prior to each dose escalation.</detailed_description>
