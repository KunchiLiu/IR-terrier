Other eligibility criteria include age between 18 and 75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1.5ⅹ109/L, platelet count ≥ 100ⅹ109/L, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5ⅹupper limit of normal [ULN], serum transaminases ≤ 2.5ⅹULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5ⅹULN, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5ⅹULN or actual or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min). Exclusion criteria include clinical stage T1 tumors, clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastasis, intestinal obstruction or impending obstruction, active tumor bleeding, interstitial pneumonitis or symptomatic pulmonary fibrosis, peripheral neuropathy of National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC) grade ≥1, pregnant or breastfeeding patients, and other serious diseases.</criteria>
