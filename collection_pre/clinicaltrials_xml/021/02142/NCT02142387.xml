	<brief_summary>Despite aggressive CPR training, the outcome of cardiac arrest is not good. The problem is method of education. So, the investigators want to add the dispatcher-assisted CPR simulation into conventional CPR training. In this study, the investigators aim is to investigate the effect of newer CPR training program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Before and After Community Intervention Trial With Dispatcher Assisted CPR Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The training program focuses on working in team with dispatcher, performing all steps from recognizing cardiac arrest to performing CPR, together with the dispatcher. The one hours training session is split into four parts: 1. Video self-instruction manikin practice (30 min), including a brief introduction to AED. 2. Practice in pairs (15 min). Practicing the dispatcher and rescuer role in a simulation to enhance learning. 3. Debriefing. Questions, answers and reflection (15 min). 4. Homework. Leaflet with tasks like learn how to activate the speaker function on your own phone. The main difference between DA-BLS and traditional BLS training is that DA-BLS provides the scenes and interactive experiences on calling EMS and receiving CPR instruction via telephone speaker function, following up the skill training by scenario simulation training.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All OHCA patients with presumed cardiac etiology who are 15 years of age or older and assessed and treated by EMS providers after dispatched by the EMS dispatch center will be included. We will exclude patients with noncardiac etiology, prolonged cardiac arrest with a suspected duration more than 30 minutes, cases such as livor mortis or rigor mortis, and decapitated or decomposed body, and patients who have "DoNotResuscitate" card documented by doctor.</criteria>
