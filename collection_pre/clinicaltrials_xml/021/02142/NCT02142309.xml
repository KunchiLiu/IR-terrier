	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is epidemic and its treatment has become more and more difficult. Consensus algorithms have been developed to help clinicians to select among the numerous medications and their combinations for achieving and maintaining a target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of &lt;7%. AMAZING, a pragmatic clinical trial, aims to compare commonly used oral diabetes medications, when combined with metformin, on glycemia-lowering effectiveness.</brief_summary>
