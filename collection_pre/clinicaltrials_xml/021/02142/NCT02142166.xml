	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to improve the usability of biomarkers for the timely prediction of new complications following a cerebral hemorrhage, especially in combination with invasive, functional and local measurements for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Based on analyzed biomarker profiles the chosen therapy efforts are assessed in their immediate and longer-term effectiveness.</brief_summary>
