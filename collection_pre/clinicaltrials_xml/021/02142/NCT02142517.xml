	<brief_summary>Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains a challenge even at specialized centers, and also affect significantly the surgical outcomes . The incidence of POPF after pancreaticoduodenectomy among different studies, ranging from 5 to 30%.Morbidity and mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy are usually related to surgical management of the pancreatic stump. The safe pancreatic reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy continues to be a challenge at high volume centers. The variety of reconstruction is a reflection of the lack of ideal one.Duct to mucosa and invagination are two classic PJ techniques. Many studies compared both techniques, but their surgical outcomes still unclear.The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness and surgical outcomes of both techniques of PJ after pancreaticoduodenectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Between Duct to Mucosa and Invagination Pancreaticojejunostomy After Pancreaticoduodenectomy:</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients who were treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy at Gastroenterology Surgical Center, Mansoura, Egypt Exclusion criteria included any patients with locally advanced periampullary tumour, metastases, patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients underwent pancreaticogastrostomy (PG), patients with advanced liver cirrhosis (Child B or C), malnutrition, or coagulopathy. All patients were subjected to careful history taking, clinical examination, routine laboratory investigation abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography , and abdominal computerized tomography . The patients were randomized into two groups: Group I: patients underwent duct to mucosa PJ. Group II: patients underwent invagination PJ. The primary outcome was POPF rate.Secondary outcomes were operative time, operative time needed for reconstruction, length of postoperative hospital stay, postoperative morbidities</detailed_description>
