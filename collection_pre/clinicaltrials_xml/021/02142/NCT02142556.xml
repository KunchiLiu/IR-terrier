	<brief_summary>Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily quetiapine extended release (XR) in patients with schizophrenia switched from other antipsychotics which were suboptimal due to insufficient efficacy or insufficient tolerability. Methods: This was a 12-week, open-label study conducted in the Chinese population in Taiwan. Quetiapine XR was administrated at 300 mg on day 1, 600 mg on day 2 and up to 800 mg after day 2. From day 8 until the end of the study, the dose of quetiapine XR was adjusted within 400-800 mg per day, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patients.</brief_summary>
