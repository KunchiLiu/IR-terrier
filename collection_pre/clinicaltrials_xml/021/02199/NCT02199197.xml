	<criteria>Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Men at least 18 years of age and life expectancy of greater than or equal to 6 months. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2. Metastatic disease as evidenced by both lymphadenopathy and bony metastases or just bony metastases on baseline bone scan and/or computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis within 28 days of registration. Chest imaging is only required if clinically indicated or if there is known disease in the chest. Castration resistant prostatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects must have castrate levels of serum testosterone (less than 50 ng/dL) achieved by orchiectomy or LHRH agonist or antagonist therapy. Previously received docetaxel or are not healthy enough per clinical judgment or declined to receive it Evidence of disease progression on or after the most recent systemic treatment defined by the following criteria: PSA: Increasing serum PSA levels as defined by the PCWG2, determined by 2 consecutive measurements and confirmed by a third. If the third measurement is below the second, then a fourth measurement must be greater than the second. The confirming third or fourth measurement must be greater or equal to 2 ng/mL. Measurements must be the most recent values and within 15 months (preferably with 14 days but with at least 7 days between each measurement). Measurable disease: greater than or equal to 20% increase in the sum of the short axis diameter of all measurable lymph nodes or the development of any measurable lymphadenopathy by RECIST 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria. Nonmeasurable disease: Lymph node disease: The appearance of 1 or more new lymphadenopathy, and/or unequivocal worsening of nonmeasurable disease when compared to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against the precastration studies if there was no response. Bone disease: Appearance of 2 or more new areas of abnormal uptake on bone scan when compared to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against the precastration studies if there was no response. Increased uptake of preexisting lesions on bone scan does not constitute progression. Symptomatic bone metastases Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function as evidenced by laboratory test results. (Transfusion of blood products are not allowed to normalize blood parameters within 4 weeks of the first radium treatment.) Subjects who have previously received docetaxel or are ineligible for docetaxel and who are candidates for treatment with enzalutamide alone or enzalutamide in combination with Radium223 Men must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the Informed Consent Form until at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Because of the potential side effect on spermatogenesis associated with radiation, men who are sexually active must agree to use condoms and their female partners of reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during and for 6 months after completing treatment. Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. The presence of or known brain metastases, malignant pleural effusions, or malignant ascites. Brain MRI is required at screening only if clinically indicated. Visceral metastases as assessed by chest, abdominal or pelvic computed tomography (CT) (or other imaging modality) Received systemic therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium89, samarium153, rhenium186, or rhenium188, or Radium Ra 223 dichloride) for the treatment of bony metastases Prior treatment with enzalutamide. Concurrent anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization) other than the protocol based treatment. LHRH agonist or antagonist therapy, and supportive noncancer directed therapies like biphosponates or denosumab are allowed. Prior cytoxic chemotherapy with the exception of docetaxel or cabazitaxel. Treatment with docetaxel or cabazitaxel must be discontinued greater than 4 weeks from the time of enrollment, and recovery of AEs to grade 1 or baseline (however, ongoing neuropathy is permitted). Major surgery within 30 days prior to start of study drug Pathologic longbone fractures, imminent pathologic longbone fracture (cortical erosion on radiography greater than 50%). Prior hemibody external radiotherapy. Subjects who received other types of prior external radiotherapy are allowed provided that bone marrow function is assessed and meets the protocol requirements for hemoglobin, ANC, and platelets. Use of biologic response modifiers, such as granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF) or granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF) within 4 weeks prior to screening Lymphadenopathy exceeding 3 cm in shortaxis diameter Any size pelvic lymphadenopathy if it is thought to be a contributor to concurrent hydronephrosis. Imminent spinal cord compression based on clinical findings and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment should be completed for spinal cord compression. Any other serious illness or medical condition in the opinion of the investigator, such as but not limited to: Any infection greater than or equal to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) version 4.03 Grade 2 Cardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Bone marrow dysplasia Fecal incontinence Concomitant use of narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e. alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (phenytoin, warfarin), and CYP2C19 (Smephenytoin). [Note: Patients on stable doses of anticoagulation with warfarin and fentanyl will be eligible, as long as they are monitored closely with additional INR monitoring]. Any infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever (temperature greater than 100.5 degrees F or 38.1 degrees C) within 1 week prior to registration. Concurrent other malignancy with the exception of: a) cutaneous squamous cell and basal carcinomas, b) adequately treated stage 12 malignancy , c) adequately treated stage 34 malignancy that had been in remission for greater than or equal to 2 years at the time of registration. Inability to comply with the protocol and/or not willing or not available for followup assessments Any medical intervention or other condition which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives</criteria>
