	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related/sibling donor (MSD), matched unrelated donor (MURD) or killer-immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) ligand mismatched haploidentical donor identified, will receive a combined T cell depleted (TCD) haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) using a total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) based preparative regimen. Primary objective: - To estimate the incidence of donor derived neutrophil engraftment by day +42 post-transplant for participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing a total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)-based hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using a T cell depleted (TCI) haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donor combined with an unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor. Secondary objectives: - Estimate the incidence of malignant relapse, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) at one-year post-transplantation. - Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the first 100 days after transplantation. - Estimate the incidence of secondary graft failure transplant related mortality (TRM) and transplant related morbidity in the first 100 days after HCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined T Cell Depleted Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Stem Cell and Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Using a Total Lymphoid Irradiation Based Preparative Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior to stem cell infusion, participants will receive a preparative regimen of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI), fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and thiotepa to prepare their bone marrow. Thereafter, they will receive a hematopoietic cell graft from a haploidentical donor and an unrelated umbilical cord blood donor. Post-transplantation immunosuppressive treatment will include tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.</detailed_description>
