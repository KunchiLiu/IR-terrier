	<brief_title>Topical Interferon Alfa 2b and Mitomycin C in Conjunctival-Corneal Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The corneal and conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia is the most common malignant tumor of the ocular surface. Classic treatment is complete excision with safety margins, however, usually the edges are not sharp and difficult clinical differentiation between healthy areas that are not; to this treatment has joined him carrying out cryotherapy bedding and borders . Despite this treatment the recurrence rate ranges from 9-52 %. Antineoplastic drugs have been used either as adjuvant or primary treatment . Among the drugs used the investigators have mitomycin C (MMC) and interferon alpha 2b (INFα 2b). Controlled clinical trial , single-blind , randomized . Non-probability sampling of consecutive cases. Patients will be assigned to treatment with MMC or INFα2b Periodic clinical evaluations and photos will be made. Time of resolution, resistance and adverse effects will be determined. Patients treated with mitomycin will be handled by cycles until resolution of the lesion, which according to previous studies is expected between 3 and 6 cycles (between half months and 3 months). Patients managed with interferon will be treated for a period ranging from one month to 12 months according to clinical resolution of the lesion. Both groups will be evaluated by at least one year after the resolution of the lesion to determine the presence of recurrences.</detailed_description>
