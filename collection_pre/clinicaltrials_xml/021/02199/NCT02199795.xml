	<brief_summary>This is a small pilot randomized controlled trial which will enroll both subacute (&lt;6 mos) and chronic (&gt;6 mos) stroke survivors (n=18 total) with dorsiflexion weakness. The subjects will be stratified based on interval post-stroke and baseline level of motor impairment and then randomized to Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES) versus control. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 6-weeks of lower extremity CCNMES, applied in an anti-phase application, on motor impairment and functional mobility to a control group; the effect of interval post-stroke, subacute (early) versus chronic (late) post-stroke, will be assessed. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of 6-weeks of lower extremity anti-phase CCNMES on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cortical activation patterns using an ankle dorsiflexion paradigm. The specific use of functional MRI as an outcome measure is to explore a central mechanism for between-group differences. AIM 1: Determine the effect of lower extremity CCNMES, applied in an anti-phase application, on motor impairment and functional mobility in hemiparesis compared to a control group; assess the effect of application in the subacute (&lt; 6 mos, early) versus chronic (&gt; 6 mos, late) post-stroke period. Hypothesis: Subjects randomized to the lower extremity CCNMES group will achieve greater improvement in motor impairment and functional mobility as compared to the control group; subjects in the subacute post-stroke period will achieve greater improvement than subjects in the chronic post-stroke period. AIM 2: Demonstrate change in functional MRI activation patterns using an ankle dorsiflexion paradigm following the lower extremity anti-phase CCNMES intervention. Hypothesis: Subjects randomized to the anti-phase CCNMES group will demonstrate change in functional MRI cortical activation patterns which differs from the control group; subjects in subacute post-stroke period will demonstrate change in functional MRI activation patterns that are distinct from change noted in chronic subjects. AIM 3: Define a central mechanism for post-stroke motor and functional recovery associated with lower extremity anti-phase CCNMES. Hypothesis: Change in functional MRI cortical activation patterns following anti-phase CCNMES intervention will correlate with change in motor impairment and functional mobility.</brief_summary>
