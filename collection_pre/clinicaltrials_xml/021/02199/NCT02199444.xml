	<brief_summary>The accumulation of p-cresol, a product of the metabolism of aromatic aminoacid operated by resident intestinal bacteria increases the cardiovascular risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to reduce plasma p-cresol levels are highly demanded. It has been reported that the phosphate binder sevelamer sequesters p-cresol in vitro, while in vivo studies on dialysis patients showed controversial results. Aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of sevelamer on p-cresol levels in CKD patients.</brief_summary>
