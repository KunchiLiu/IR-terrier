	<brief_summary>This research study examines the effect of hyaluronidase on the length of time of insulin infusion set wear. The aim of the study is to improve the length of time that an infusion set can be worn by infusing hyaluronidase directly into the insulin infusion site. The investigators will also assess the accuracy of the Dexcom G4 Platinum (G4P) sensors with extended sensor wear beyond the 7 day FDA approved time frame.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyaluronidase Effect on Infusion Set Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators would like to see if the use of hyaluronidase will improve insulin infusion set survival and improve the onset of insulin action. The investigators will also assess the accuracy of the Dexcom G4P sensors with extended site use beyond the 7 day FDA approved time frame. The use of sensor information combined with the knowledge of infused insulin from pump therapy could potentially help us detect when an infusion set is beginning to fail. Information from the sensor function to the point of failure, and sensor function in response to Tylenol may allow us to develop special formulas to determine when a sensor is not working well. This will be very important for creating an artificial pancreas. You are invited to participate in a research study to see if the use of hyaluronidase will improve insulin infusion set survival and improve the onset of insulin action. The investigators will also assess the accuracy of the Dexcom G4P sensors with extended site use beyond the 7 day FDA approved time frame. Eligible subjects are those with type 1 diabetes who wear an insulin pump. Thirty subjects will be enrolled. Fifteen patients from each of the two sites: Stanford University and University of Colorado.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year and using an insulin pump for at least 3 months 2. Total daily insulin dose of at least 0.4 units/kg/day 3. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment; C peptide level and antibody determinations are not needed. 4. Age 12 to 45 years 5. Hemoglobin A1c level less than or equal to 10% 6. Willingness to infuse 1 ml of hyaluronidase (Hylenex) into the insulin infusion set after insertion on day 1 and day 3 of the week they are assigned to use hyaluronidase 7. Willingness to use a Silhouette or Comfort insulin infusion set throughout the study. The set includes the Duo Infusion Tubing for infusion of hyaluronidase (Hylenex). 8. Willingness to eat the same breakfast each morning for the first two weeks of the study 9. Willing to take two 500mg tablets of Tylenol Regular Strength and monitor glucose levels at Â½, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours later. 10. For females, not currently known to be pregnant 11. An understanding of and willingness to follow the protocol and sign the informed consent 12. Must be able to understand spoken or written English 1. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months 2. Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness in the 6 months prior to enrollment 3. Known tape allergies 4. Current treatment for a seizure disorder 5. Cystic fibrosis 6. Active infection 7. A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere with the completion of the protocol such as the following examples: 8. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months for either the subject or the subject's primary care giver (i.e., parent or guardian) 9. Presence of a known adrenal disorder 10. If on antihypertensive, thyroid, antidepressant or lipid lowering medication, lack of stability on the medication for the past 2 months prior to enrollment in the study 11. Abuse of alcohol 12. Use of an OmniPod insulin infusion pump 13. Pregnant or lactating females</criteria>
