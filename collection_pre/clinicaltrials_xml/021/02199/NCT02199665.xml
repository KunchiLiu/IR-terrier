	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor and carfilzomib when given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has returned or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as selinexor and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor, Carfilzomib, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone in relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine safety and tolerability. II. Determine the efficacy, as measured by the rates of stable disease or better (including minimal response, partial response, very good partial response, complete response, and stringent complete response). III. To perform pharmacokinetic studies at first cycle for each dose level for both selinexor and carfilzomib, and compare the results to those from their respective single arm trials. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To perform an exploratory evaluation of pharmacodynamics. II. To study the effects of treatment on exportin 1 (XPO1) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at day 1 and day 15 of cycle 1, and at the time of progression/relapse. III. To assess clinical response in standard and high-risk prognostic subgroups based on cytogenetics and gene expression profiling. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor and carfilzomib. Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, and 17, carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and dexamethasone PO QD or IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 Diagnosis of multiple myeloma as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform criteria Measurable disease by IMWG as defined by at least one of the following: Serum Mprotein &gt;= 0.5 g/dL Urine Mprotein &gt;= 200 mg in a 24hour collection Serum free light chain level &gt;= 10 mg/dL provided the free light chain ratio is abnormal Measurable plasmacytoma; if plasmacytoma measurement is the only measurable disease, subject eligibility must be reviewed with lead principal investigator (PI) prior to signing consent Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with progressive disease at study entry Subjects must have been treated with at least 2 prior therapies including a proteasome inhibitor and a cereblonbinding agent Subjects who are refractory to carfilzomib may enroll throughout the trial; carfilzomib refractory status is defined by IMWG criteria: disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course In the expansion cohort of the study, enrollment will be limited to patients meeting carfilzomib refractory status Ability to adhere with the study visit schedule and other protocol procedures Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L; screening ANC should be independent of growth factor support for over one week for all patients Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL; subjects may receive red blood cell transfusions as clinically indicated per institutional guidelines but screening hemoglobin should be independent of red blood cell transfusion for at least 3 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 Platelet count &gt;= 50,000mm^3;

acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or postmenopausal;
