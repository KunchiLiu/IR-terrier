	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to those of a licensed product, MENVEO vaccine and also evaluate MenACYW conjugate vaccine when given alone compared to when given with Tdap vaccine and HPV vaccine. Primary objective: - To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given alone compared to those when MENVEO vaccine is given alone. Secondary objective: - To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine, when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given concomitantly with Tdap and HPV vaccines, compared to those when it is given alone - To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens present in Tdap vaccine, when Tdap vaccine is given concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine and HPV vaccine, compared to those when Tdap vaccine is given with HPV vaccine only Observational objective: - To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine, compared to that of the licensed vaccine MENVEO®, and when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given with Tdap and HPV vaccines.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 10 to 17 years on the day of inclusion Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or another legally acceptable representative Assent form has been signed and dated by the subject Subject and parent legally acceptable representative are able to attend all scheduled visits and comply with all trial procedures. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be premenarche, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination) Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination(s) or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination(s) or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks prior to or following any trial vaccination except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before or after any study vaccines. This exception includes monovalent influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines. Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or any mono or polyvalent polysaccharide or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing A, C, W, or Y antigens History of vaccination with any tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis vaccine within the previous 4 years Previous HPV vaccination Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (i.e., subjects with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or subjects travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease) Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances, including encephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days of administration of a previous pertussis antigencontaining vaccine Personal history of GuillainBarré syndrome Personal history of an Arthuslike reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccine within at least 10 years of the proposed study vaccination Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction Chronic illness (e.g., HIV hepatitis B, hepatitis C) that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
