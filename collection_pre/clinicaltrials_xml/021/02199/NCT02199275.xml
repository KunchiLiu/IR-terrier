	<brief_summary>During non urgent surgery, general anesthesia might induce enterocyte damage. I-FABP is a performant biomarker of enterocyte damage. We aimed to study whether patient ongoing general anesthesia for non-urgent surgery have an elevation of plasma I-FABP concentration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion criteria - Indication of non-urgent surgery - General anesthesia protocol using propofol and remifentanyl - One half of the patients have a history of ischemic arteriopathy - One half of the patients have no history of ischemic arteriopathy Exclusion criteria - Age &lt; 18 years old - Pregnant Primary objective Is there a significant elevation of I-FABP between the pre-anesthesic period and 11 minutes after induction of general anesthesia ? Secondary objectives 1. Is I-FABP elevation higher among patients with history of patent arteriopathy ? 2. Is I-FABP elevation higher among patients presenting with hypotension during anesthesia ?</detailed_description>
