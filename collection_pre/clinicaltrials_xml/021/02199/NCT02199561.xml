	<brief_summary>Manipulation of the intestinal microbiota through FMT is a potential therapeutic target for CD patients. Studies are now required to determine if repeated FMT can overcome the apparent immune response to FMT thereby maintaining sustained clinical improvement and remission. Prior to a large randomized controlled trial of FMT in CD we will carry out a feasibility study to determine if serial FMTs can sustain a clinical response and maintain stability of transplanted microbiota.</brief_summary>
