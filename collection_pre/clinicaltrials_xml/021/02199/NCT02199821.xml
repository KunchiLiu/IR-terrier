	<brief_summary>Background and Aims: Nutritional support is considered an integral part of the supportive care of bone marrow transplantation patients. Parenteral nutrition emulsions enriched with omega-3 fatty acids can modify the inflammatory response. The aim of this study is to compare plasma cytokines levels in children after bone marrow transplantation using a lipid formula enriched in n-3 FA and other classic soybean oil formula in parenteral nutrition. Methods: A randomized double blinded controlled study including 14 children with BMT and requiring PN for at least 10 days was conducted using a lipid emulsion with fish oil, or soybean oil. Blood samples at baseline, at 10 days and at the end of the PN were taken to analyze plasma interleukins 1 beta, 2, 6, 8, 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±).</brief_summary>
