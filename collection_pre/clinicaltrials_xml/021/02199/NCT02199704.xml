	<criteria>1. Parents/caregivers (mothers or fathers) with a Schizophreniaspectrum diagnosis who are: 2. Aged 18 years or more 3. Have at least one child aged 310 years old 4. Have a least 10 hours contact time per week with the child. 5. Identify difficulties in parenting during assessment 1. Parents/caregivers and family members who do not have good working knowledge of English. They should have enough practical experience to be able to adequately use the English language to understand and respond to questions, to read and complete questionnaires 2. Families who do not have at least one adult who has basic literacy skills 3. Families where there is known intention for their children to be taken into care or where the parent(s) have no regular contact with the index child 4. Parents with a clinical schizophreniaspectrum diagnosis who have recently been discharged from acute inpatient care for their condition and have less than four weeks of stabilisation of psychotic experiences (operationally defined as no significant change to management or severity of symptoms in a fourweek period since discharge as assessed from case notes). This is because if a potential parent with schizophrenia had recently required an inpatient stay, it is important to give them sufficient time to readjust to living in the community and ensure sufficient time is provided for symptom stabilisation before taking part 5. Families seeking support from services regarding child management issues 6. Families actively involved in another current cognitive behavioural therapy based intervention</criteria>
