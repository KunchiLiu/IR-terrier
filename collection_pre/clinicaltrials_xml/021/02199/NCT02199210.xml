	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to investigate the function of self-regulatory processes in anesthesiologists and how application of these processes influence performance in a crisis situation.The investigators intend to explore specifically the first phase of self-regulation, i.e. the forethought phase which describes processes related to strategic planning, goal setting, goal orientation, and outcome expectation. The investigators hypothesize that prompting forethought before engaging in a simulated massive transfusion crisis situation will result in better task performance in anesthesiologists.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct 3 studies building on each other. - Pilot Study: the purpose of this study is to develop measurement tools for forethought, performance and a tool for prompting forethought. This study will include 2 attending anesthesiologists and 2 anesthesia residents (PGY2, 5). - Study I: the purpose of this study is to validate the measurement tools for forethought, performance and the tool for prompting forethought. This will include 6 attending anesthesiologists, 6 PGY5 and 6 PGY2 anesthesia residents. - Study II: the purpose of this study is to investigate if prompting forethought in anesthesia residents will result in better performance in a simulated massive transfusion than no prompting.</detailed_description>
