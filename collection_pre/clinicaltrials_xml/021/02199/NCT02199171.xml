	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of heated carboplatin given into the abdomen at the time of surgery in treating patients with stage II-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Heating oxaliplatin and infusing it directly into the area around the tumor during surgery may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heated Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage II-IV Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carboplatin given as HIPEC for primary treatment of women with advanced ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine the dose limiting toxicities of HIPEC carboplatin. 2. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of HIPEC carboplatin. 3. To quantify changes in tissue temperature during HIPEC and compare to conventional temperature measures (esophageal and bladder). 4. To describe the extent of thermal damage and DNA platinum adduct formation in tissues resulting from HIPEC carboplatin. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive hyperthermic carboplatin intraperitoneally over 60 minutes during the planned surgical cytoreductive procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, known or highly suspected advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IIIV) ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, scheduled for primary or interval cytoreductive surgery If the patient has received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy, evidence of response must be documented by at least one of the following: decline in serum carcinoma antigen (CA)125 level, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions on radiographic imaging, or resolution of ascites or pleural effusion(s) Women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status =&lt; 2 Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/microliter (mcL) Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT))/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT)) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Albumin &gt;= 2.5 mg/dL Patients for whom the diagnosis of highgrade serous or undifferentiated carcinoma of ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tubal origin is confirmed at surgery Surgery achieves either no gross residual disease or optimal cytoreductive status defined as no single lesion measuring more than 1 cm in its greatest diameter (this protocol calls for the intentional delay in resection of up to 3 tumors per patient until the HIPEC procedure is complete; the surgeon will identify these tumors as easily resectable from a technical and safety aspect) Patients must be stable from cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic standpoints to continue with prolonged surgery and anesthesia Provision of written informed consent Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy whose disease has progressed following at least 3 cycles, defined by at least one of the following: clinical deterioration (new or worsening of existing ascites, carcinomatous ileus, malignant bowel obstruction, declining performance status), new lesion(s) or increase in maximal diameter of &gt; 20% of the two largest target lesions, rising CA125 (an increase of at least 10% of baseline value that increases over 3 values obtained every 21 days) Cardiac or pulmonary conditions that preclude aggressive cytoreductive surgery Patients found to have nongynecologic, uterine, or breast primary at surgery Patients with gynecologic malignancy of lowgrade serous or borderline histology Patients with suboptimal resection (any single tumor larger than 1 cm) Patients with core body temperature &gt; 37 degrees Celsius (C) at completion of cytoreductive surgery and prior to HIPEC Patients who are receiving other investigational therapeutic agents Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study</criteria>
