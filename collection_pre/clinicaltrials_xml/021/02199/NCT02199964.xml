	<brief_summary>This study will test that hypothesis that topical administration of the FDA approved immunomodulatory agent cyclosporin A emulsion will minimize irritation and ocular surface disease that results from a short term low humidity environmental stress</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Cyclosporin A in a Low Humidity Environment, on the Ocular Surface</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the effect of two conventional dry eye therapies, artificial tears to hydrate and cyclosporine A as an anti-inflammatory, on the irritation symptoms and ocular surface disease of dry eye patients who will be exposed to a low humidity environment for 90 minutes. Patients with dry eye will be enrolled in this study and complete a validated symptom questionnaire and then undergo a complete ocular surface and tear examination to characterize their disease. Enrolled subjects will be exposed to a low humidity environment at the initial evaluation prior to any treatment and will be exposed to a low humidity environment for a second time. They will be randomized to receive either artificial tears or 0.05% cyclosporine A emulsion drop four times a day for 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
