	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation (KT) requires a life-long immune suppression (IS). It has been well-known that long-term IS inevitably causes various complication e.g. infection, toxicity, diabetes, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis of hip joint, cataract, acne, and malignancies and so on. Tolerance induction showing graft function without maintenance IS has been considered as a final solution in the transplantation recipients. Tolerance induction can be achieved in KT recipients with donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this study, adult patients (18 and more years of age) with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haplotype match donor are enrolled. Patients receive preconditioning treatment for HSCT 1week prior to KT. Bone marrow is harvested from donor under general anesthesia at the time of nephrectomy for transplantation in donor. Donor BM is infused immediate post-transplantation at intensive care unit (ICU). Immunologic measurements including microchimerism study and protocol biopsy will be followed at several time points. IS will be tapered slowly and withdrawn over a period of several months.</brief_summary>
