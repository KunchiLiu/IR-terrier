	<brief_summary>Purpose: To examine the effect of the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio on age-related changes in executive functions in children and older adults. Participants: Eighty-four typically-developing 7-to 12-year-old children. Procedure (methods): Participants and a caregiver will participate in 4 sessions. Three sessions will consist of the screening. These sessions will be telephone calls to collect 24-hour diet information that will be used to determine whether they are eligible for the fourth session. Approximately 120 participants will be screened to find 84 participants who are eligible for the fourth session, in which participants will complete a series of tests on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) - a touch-screen device that provides computerized versions of standardized cognitive tests. They will also complete a maze task in which they figure out a path through the maze by walking on the correct squares. Brain activity will be recorded using a portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system.</brief_summary>
