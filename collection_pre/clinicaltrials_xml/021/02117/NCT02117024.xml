	<brief_summary>This study will test whether vaccination with viagenpumatucel-L combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide will prolong the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy for incurable or metastatic disease compared with chemotherapy alone. Patients will be randomized 2 to 1 into the viagenpumatucel-L arm and the chemotherapy alone arm, respectively.</brief_summary>
