	<mesh_term>Presbyopia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Must sign an Informed Consent document; Presbyopic and require at least 2.25 diopters (D) spectacle ADD power; Current or previous soft contact lens wearer; Not able to achieve monocular near visual acuity (VA) 0.2 logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) [Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)] or better in each eye with AIR OPTIX® AQUA Multifocal (AOAMF) High ADD Contact Lenses; Willing and able to wear multifocal contact lenses in both eyes within the available range of powers for this trial; Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 1.00 D; Able to achieve best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25 or better in each eye at distance (as determined by manifest refraction); Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, disease, or abnormality that contraindicates contact lens wear within 6 months prior to enrollment, as determined by the investigator; Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated, as determined by the investigator; or any use of topical ocular medications that would require instillation during contact lens wear; Any history of herpetic keratitis; History of corneal or refractive surgery, irregular cornea or unilateral pseudophakia; Biomicroscopy findings (except for corneal vascularization) that are moderate (Grade 3) or severe (Grade 4); Corneal vascularization that is mild (Grade 2) or higher; A pathologically dry eye that precludes contact lens wear; Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision); Anisometropia ≥ 1.50 D (contact lens distance prescription); Clinically significant (&gt; 1 millimeter) anisocoria; History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational products; Concurrent participation in a contact lens or contact lens care product clinical trial within the previous 30 days; Eye injury or ocular or intraocular surgery within 6 months prior to enrollment; Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude safe administration of the study lenses or affect the results of this study; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
