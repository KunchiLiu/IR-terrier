	<detailed_description>The study is a Prospective, Multi-center, Single Armed Registry to Evaluate The Safety and Efficacy of 'AVI' Stent for Treating Coronary Revascularization, 1200 primary coronary artery disease patients will be enrolled, at approximately 40 sites. Subject follow-up will occur via telephone contact or clinical visit at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 2-5 years after procedure.</detailed_description>
