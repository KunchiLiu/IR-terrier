	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess how the body handles LY2835219 when it is given with another drug called clarithromycin. The study doctor will measure the amount of LY2835219 that is absorbed into the blood stream and the time that it takes to remove LY2835219 from the body. The safety and tolerability of these drugs will be studied. Each participant will complete 2 study periods in fixed order. After screening, Period 1 will last approximately 8 days and Period 2 will last approximately 15 days. Participants who complete Period 2 may continue to receive LY2835219 in 28-day cycles until discontinuation criteria are met.</brief_summary>
