	<brief_summary>We will investigate the efficacy and safety of using tranexamic acid by intravenous, intra-articular and combinational administration to reduce blood loss during total knee replacement. We hypothesize a combined intra-articular and single intravenous dose protocol of tranexamic acid may achieve a higher therapeutic concentration at the intra-articular and extra-articular bleeding site with little or no systemic absorption and subsequent systemic side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Using Tranexamic Acid by Different Means to Reduce Blood Loss During Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled and parallel-assigned study comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous, intra-articular and combinational administration of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss during total knee replacement. Subjects will be monitored for occurrence of any complications, particularly deep venous thrombosis and thromboembolism during the hospital stay and for 3 months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
