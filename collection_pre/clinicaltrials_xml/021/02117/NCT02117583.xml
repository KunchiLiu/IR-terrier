	<brief_summary>To estimate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of oxycodone following oral administration of single 40 mg doses of PF 00345439 Formulation K taken whole or after chewing in healthy volunteers. We have described below the two cohorts each with two arms in this crossover study by listing them as four Arms/Groups in order to capture the differences between the cohorts prior to the crossover and after the crossover. 14 participants are planned for the first cohort and 18 participants are planned for the second cohort.</brief_summary>
