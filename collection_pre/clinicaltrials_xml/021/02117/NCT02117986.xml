	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that the loading dose of intravenous colistin (6 million of international units) is associated with greater clinical and microbiological efficacy, and reduced mortality of critically ill patients infected by multidrug resistant Gram- negative bacilli, compared to a scheme without loading dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Mortality of a Loading Dose of Colistin in Critical Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate a scheme with and without a loading dose of 6 million international units of colistin, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 million international units every 8 hours intravenous. The study should be conducted in 3 hospitals in Chile, in critically patients presenting infection by multidrug Gram-negative bacteria and requiring be treated with colistin for at least 48 hours. The objectives of the study are: to evaluate the clinical and microbiological response, and mortality.</detailed_description>
