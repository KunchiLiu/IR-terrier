	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized clinical trial to compare patient satisfaction and prosthetic outcomes with lower dentures retained by one or two implants. The investigators long-term objective is to establish evidence of the cost-effectiveness of a single implant intervention for improving tolerance to complete dentures. The investigators MAIN AIM will be to investigate patient satisfaction between and within groups with mandibular dentures retained by one or two implants over five years, and SECONDARILY to investigate the survival of implants, and the frequency of events to maintain the dentures and prosthetic attachments as clinically serviceable. Furthermore, multivariate analysis can assess the prediction of patient satisfaction with implant dentures based on various possible factors including age, health, demography and socioeconomic status, number of implants, and maintenance needs. Patient satisfaction will be measured by means of Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) including a measure of overall satisfaction and various specific aspects of satisfaction such as appearance, stability and comfort of the dentures. The CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that mandibular complete dentures retained by single implants are at least as satisfying to patients over a five years period as those retained by two implants for the same period. The SECONDARY HYPOTHESES are that: i) there is no difference over five years between groups in the survival of original implants, or in the number of events for maintenance of the dentures or implant attachments; and ii) using each treatment group as it's own control, there is no change in patient satisfaction with lower dentures retained by either one or two implants during the five year loading period.</brief_summary>
