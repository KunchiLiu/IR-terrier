	<brief_title>iAssist vs. Conventional Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty Using the Persona Knee System Among Patients With BMI&gt;=30: Radiographic, Clinical and Economic Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Male or female 2. Needs a primary TKR on the left or right knee 3. Diagnose of noninflammatory degenerative joint disease (e.g., osteoarthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, etc.) 4. Over 18 years old 5. BMI&gt;=30 6. Able to: Understand what participation in the study entails and give written informed consent, and Follow surgeon/staff instructions, and Return for all followup evaluations, and Able and willing to undergo a preoperative fullleg, standing radiographs (all cases) Willing to consent (patient or his/her legal guardian) to participate in the study by signing and dating an approved consent. Meet an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free of or treated for cardiac, pulmonary, hematological or other conditions that would pose excessive operative risk. 7. Presence of varus or valgus deformity of 15 degrees or less. 1. Currently enrolled in an investigational new drug or device study 2. Active Infection (including septic knee, distant infection, or osteomyelitis) 3. Severe hip arthrosis 4. Neurological disorders (including, but not limited to Parkinson's disease) 5. Prior ipsilateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, TKA, knee fusion or patellectomy 6. Hip or knee ankylosis 7. Inflammatory joint disease. 8. Either rheumatoid or posttraumatic knee arthritis 9. Scheduled for simultaneous bilateral TKA 10. Indications of intra and/or extraarticular deformations that would eliminate or tend to eliminate adequate implant support or prevent the use of an appropriately sized implant, such as polio, history of tibial plateau fracture, etc. 11. Any metal within 150 mm of the joint line for the operativeside knee 12. Knee deformities greater than 15 degrees of fixed varus, valgus, or flexion contracture on initial physical examination 13. A female who is pregnant or lactating 14. Current involvement in any personal injury litigation, medicallegal or worker's compensation claims 15. Arterial disease or stents that would exclude the use of a tourniquet 16. Insufficient quality or quantity of bone to support the implant due to prior knee surgery (or surgeries), cancer, metabolic bone disease, osteoporosis/osteopenia (diagnosed or treated with medication), active/old/remote infection, etc. 17. Mental condition that may interfere with his/her ability to give an informed consent or interfere with his/her ability or willingness to fulfill the requirements of the study. 18. Condition that would place excessive demands on the implant (e.g., Charcot's joints, muscle deficiencies, multiple joint disabilities, skeletal immaturity, etc.). 19. Collateral ligament insufficiency. 20. Immunosuppressive disorder (e.g., AIDS, etc.) that would require cytotoxic drugs, corticosteroids, large dose of irradiation, or antilymphocytic serum. 21. An existing condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise participation or followup in this study</criteria>
