	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy, based upon overall survival, of ruxolitinib added to capecitabine for the treatment of advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ruxolitinib in Pancreatic Cancer Patients (Janus 1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, in which approximately 310 subjects with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have failed, or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy, will be randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment groups: - Treatment A (N = 155): Capecitabine + ruxolitinib - Treatment B (N = 155): Capecitabine + placebo Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine will be self-administered for the first 14 days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo will be self-administered during the entire cycle. Treatment for all subjects will continue as long as the regimen is tolerated, and the subject does not meet discontinuation criteria. Subjects who discontinue treatment will continue to be followed for subsequent anticancer treatments and survival.</detailed_description>
