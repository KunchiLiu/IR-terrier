	<brief_summary>Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT will be performed 1-2 weeks after allogeneic stem cell transplant, and radiographic evidence of mucosal inflammation will be correlated with the subsequent development of acute graft versus host disease. The primary endpoint is the feasibility and safety of contrast-enhanced abdominal CT in the early post-transplant period, as defined by the risk of contrast-related nephropathy or allergic reaction.</brief_summary>
