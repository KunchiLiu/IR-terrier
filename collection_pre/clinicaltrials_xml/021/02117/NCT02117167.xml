	<brief_summary>Open label multicentric randomized phase II trial, using high throughput genome analysis as a therapeutic decision tool, aimed at comparing a targeted treatment administered according to the identified molecular anomalies of the tumor with a standard treatment (pemetrexed in Non-squamous patients and erlotinib in squamous cells, targeted substudy 1) as well as immunotherapy with maintenance therapy in patients without actionable genomic alterations or non eligible to substudy 1 (immune substudy 2).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening phase: New frozen biopsy or an archived frozen sample will be sent to the genomic plateforms for DNA extraction and genomic analysis (DNA microarrays and Next generation sequencing). Patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the targeted substudy 1 randomisation phase when both following mandatory conditions have been met : stable or responding disease has been observed after 4 cycles of chemotherapy (investigator judgment) and targetable alteration has been identified by the Molecular tumor board (MTB). If not eligible for the substudy 1 randomisation phase, patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the immune substudy 2 randomization phase when both following mandatory conditions are met: stable or responding disease (investigator judgment) is observed after 4 cycles of a platinum-based chemotherapy AND not eligible to randomization in the substudy 1 (because patient had no targetable alteration identified by the Molecular Tumor Board, or failed to have a genomic profile for the tumor [low tumor cells percentage, technical issue during genomic analysis, etc.], or a non-inclusion criteria that precluded entry into the substudy 1) Randomization phase: The mandatory post-chemotherapy 28-day wash-out period following cycle 4 of chemotherapy will provide time to achieve all the required tests and examinations. The randomization program will allocate the following treatments with a 2:1 ratio in favor of Arm A of the considered substudy: Substudy 1 : targeted therapies versus standard maintenance therapy - Arm A1 / targeted arm: targeted maintenance from a list of 6 targeted drugs guided by the genomic analysis, or - Arm B1 / standard arm : standard maintenance (pemetrexed in non-squamous and erlotinib in squamous NSCLC). Substudy 2 : immunotherapy versus standard maintenance therapy - Arm A2 / immunotherapy maintenance arm: MEDI4736 or - Arm B2 / standard arm : standard maintenance (pemetrexed in non-squamous and erlotinib in squamous NSCLC).</detailed_description>
