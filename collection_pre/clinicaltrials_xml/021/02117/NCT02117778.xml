	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate lung function and pain control of continuous supraclavicular versus suprascapular versus interscalene nerve catheters in subjects undergoing total shoulder replacement. The investigators hypothesize that all three groups would have similar pain control; the supraclavicular and suprascapular groups may have better lung function.</brief_summary>
