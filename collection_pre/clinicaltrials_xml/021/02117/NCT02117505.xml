	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability (the extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-54781532 formulation 2 (test) compared with JNJ-54781532 formulation 1 (reference) in healthy participants under fed conditions at a single dose of 150 milligram (mg).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Crossover Study to Evaluate Relative Bioavailability of Two JNJ-54781532 Tablet Formulations in Healthy Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial), and single-center study of JNJ-54781532. The duration of study will be approximately of 5 weeks per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (consists of 2 single-dose treatments, either JNJ-54781532 formulation 1 [reference] or JNJ-54781532 formulation 2 [test]), in subsequent 2-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 7 days); and End-of-Study (done upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 4 of Period 2, or at the time of early withdrawal). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences to ensure that they receive both of the following treatments, one in each period. Followed by an overnight fast of at least 10 hours participants will be administered with study treatment 30 minutes after high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. Participants will not be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative bioavailability of two formulations of JNJ-54781532 (test and reference) will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Female participants must be either: 1) not of childbearing potential: postmenopausal or surgically sterile at screening 2) of childbearing potential: Must use highly effective contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control (1 of which must be a barrier method) starting at screening, and agree to use highly effective contraception throughout the study period, and for 90 days after final study drug administration. Women, who are not heterosexually active at Screening, must agree to utilize a highlyeffective method of birth control if they become heterosexually active during their participation in the study Must have a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening; and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day ()1 of Period 1 Female participants must agree not to donate ova starting at screening and throughout the study period, and for 90 days after the final study drug administration If a man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a vasectomy, must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed appropriate by the Investigator (for example, vasectomy, doublebarrier, partner using effective contraception) and to not donate sperm during the study and for 90 days after receiving the last dose of study drug Participants eligible according to the following tuberculosis (TB) screening criteria: 1) following tuberculosis (TB) screening criteria 2) have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical examination 3) have had no recent close contact with a person with active TB 4. Within 2 months prior to the first administration of study agent, have a negative Tspot or QuantiFERONTB Gold test result History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection Participant had major gastrointestinal (GI) surgery Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis at screening or at admission to the study center on Day () 1 of Period 1 Participant has an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) the upper limit of normal (ULN) History of drug or alcohol abuse according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) (DSMIV) criteria within 1 year before Screening or positive test result(s) for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse (such as barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines) at screening or Day () 1 of Period 1</criteria>
