	<brief_summary>Although the effects of acute alcohol intake and sleep deprivation on exercise performance lacks evidence in the literature, in many situations, they occur simultaneously. Once the alcohol affects physiological processes, the processes that occur during sleep can be impaired, such as: suppression of GH release, action of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the CNS, changes in the proportion of sleep stages and may lead to suppression of REM sleep. These changes promote a significant functional impairment such as a reduction in alertness and modification in reaction time, which affects the performance of any activity of daily and professional life. However, the combined effects on the physical performance variables, such as aerobic and neuromuscular performance lack of evidence in the literature.</brief_summary>
