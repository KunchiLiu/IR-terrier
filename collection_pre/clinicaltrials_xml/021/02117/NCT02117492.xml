	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible impacts of two techniques of vaginal cuff closure during robotic hysterectomy. We aim to compare vertical vs horizontal vaginal cuff closure and the impact that these techniques have on vaginal length, sexual function, and overall complication rates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing Horizontal and Vertical Vaginal Cuff Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Validated questionnaire the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and total vaginal lengths will be used to evaluate patients pre-operatively, at 4-6 weeks post-operatively, and 6 months post operatively. The FSFI will also be sent to the patient 12 months post operatively. These data will be used to assess sexual function and total vaginal length in patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy. The study endpoint will occur after the 12 month follow-up questionnaire. Additionally, all complications following surgery will be tracked over the study period for comparison.</detailed_description>
