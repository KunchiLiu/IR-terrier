	<brief_summary>- Compared with traditional open colectomy, laparoscopic surgery is associated with less pain, earlier recovery, and better cosmetic outcome, and its short- and long-term oncologic outcomes have been demonstrated. - In experienced surgeons' hands, single incision laparoscopic surgery is increasingly performed for colorectal disease, and even for malignant lesion because of its reduced incision-associated morbidity and scarring. - However, the safety and efficacy of single incision laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer has not yet been evaluated. Thus, the prospective randomized trial comparing single incision versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is needed.</brief_summary>
