	<brief_summary>Analyze and evaluate the skeletal muscle of patients affected with hemophilia in the Region of Murcia. - Describe the periarticular muscular deficit of the lower limbs, depending on the degree of injury: acute and chronic, or subacute. - Identify the range of motion of joints with higher prevalence of hemophilic arthropathy. - Detect the biomechanical changes of the lower limbs and their impact on gait in patients with hemophilia. - Assess the factors that influence the perception of illness and quality of life of patients with hemophilia.</brief_summary>
