	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of chewing gum on reducing post-operative ileus and reducing post-operative gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric patients undergoing surgical correction of scoliosis. This study would provide minimal risk to its study population, and has the opportunity to provide a benefit to patients undergoing scoliosis surgery. If shown to be effective, this could lead to changes and improvement of the post-operative course for pediatric scoliosis patients.</brief_summary>
