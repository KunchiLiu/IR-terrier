	<brief_summary>Antibodies are natural proteins that the body makes to fight infections. Antibodies can also be manufactured like a drug and infused or injected into the body to prevent or treat a disease. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and the body's response to an antibody against HIV in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Drug Levels of an Antibody Against HIV in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and drug levels of five different schedules for the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of a human monoclonal antibody (VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB [VRC01]) against HIV in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. The study will enroll 88 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults aged 18 to 50 years. This study will enroll participants in 5 groups. Groups 1-3 will enroll simultaneously. Groups 1 and 2 will be randomized together but not blinded, while Group 3 will be randomized separately and will be blinded. With the implementation of Version 2.0, Groups 4 and 5 will be randomized together and will enroll simultaneously. Each group will have a different schedule of clinic visits and receive different doses of VRC01 or placebo for VRC01. Participants will attend 8 months of scheduled clinic visits. Participants in Group 1 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 on Days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, and 140. Participants in Group 2 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 on Days 0, 56, and 112. Participants in Group 3 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 or IV placebo for VRC01 on Day 0, followed by SC injections of VRC01 or SC placebo for VRC01 on Days 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112, 126, 140, and 154. Participants in Groups 4 and 5 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 (each group will receive a different dose) on Days 0, 56, and 112. Participants will remain in the clinic for about an hour after receiving the infusions and injections for observation and monitoring. Participants in Group 3 who have no problems with the first SC injection will have to wait in the clinic for only a half an hour after the rest of the SC injections. At study entry, participants will give a medical history; undergo a physical exam, blood collection, and urine collection; and receive HIV risk reduction counseling. At follow-up visits, participants will undergo a brief physical exam and blood collection, receive HIV risk reduction counseling, and be asked questions about their health and their experience participating in the study. At all visits, participants who were born female will have a pregnancy test. At select study visits, saliva, rectal, and semen or cervical secretion samples will be collected from participants who consent to collection of these samples.</detailed_description>

Reproductive Status Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG) pregnancy test performed prior to infusion on the day of initial infusion. Persons who are not of reproductive potential because of having undergone total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records) are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. Reproductive status: A participant who was born female must: Agree to consistently use effective contraception (see the protocol for more information) for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. Effective contraception is defined as using any of the following methods: condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicide; diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; intrauterine device (IUD); hormonal contraception; any other contraceptive method approved by the HVTN 104 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT); successful vasectomy in the male partner (considered successful if a participant reports that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia by microscopy, or [2] a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity postvasectomy); Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; Or be sexually abstinent. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit.
