	<brief_summary>This is an observational study that will examine the possibility of determining the type of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) using bedside ultrasound machines.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inferior Vena cavaCollapsibility Index in Patients With Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that different types of AKI (pre-renal, renal, and post-renal) are associated with different inferior vena cava diameters and collapsibility index. The investigators will include subjects ages 18-89 years with AKI (creatinine of 2mg/100ml or higher for less than 24 hours from baseline creatinine ≤1.2 or with unknown baseline creatinine). Standard of care treatment will not be different for patients taking part in this study. Participants will have bedside ultrasounds on days 0, 1, and 3, and baseline and follow-up data will be collected from medical records.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Creatinine of 1.7 mg/100ml or higher for less than 24 hours from baseline creatinine ≤1.2 or with unknown baseline creatinine 2. Age range: 1889 years 3. Age range ≥ 18 1. Only chronic renal disease will exclude a patient from our study regardless of past medical history and medications they are taking. (For the purposes of this study, any patient with creatinine higher than 1.2 mg /100ml for more than 24 hours will be identified as having chronic renal disease.)</criteria>
