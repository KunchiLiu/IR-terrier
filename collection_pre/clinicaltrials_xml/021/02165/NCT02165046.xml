	<brief_summary>Budesonide + Procaterol HFA MDI is a novel asthma product containing both budesonide and procaterol in a single inhaler. Budesonide is a corticosteroid that treats underlying airway inflammation in asthma. Procaterol is a direct acting sympathomimetic with predominantly Beta-adrenoceptor stimulant activity selective to Beta-2 receptors (a Beta-2 agonist). It is used as a bronchodilator in the management of reversible airways obstructive pulmonary disease. Budesonide and Procaterol therefore have complementary effects, treating two different components of asthma.</brief_summary>
