	<brief_title>The Cuff Pressure of an Endotracheal Tube After Supine-to-lateral Position Change</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The position of endotracheal tubes depends on the position of the patients. The change of the tube's position is known to influence the pressure of tube's cuff. The shape of the cuff (barrel-shaped versus tapered-shaped) may affect the tube's migration degree because of the difference of the frictional force. The investigator try to compare the the cuff pressure after supine-to-lateral position change between barrel-shaped cuff and taper-shaped cuff.</detailed_description>
