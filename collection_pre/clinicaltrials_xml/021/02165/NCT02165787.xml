	<brief_summary>In the cross-sectional component of this study, our overall objective is to gather a large pool of data from which we can generate gait "profiles". These profiles will consist of a constellation of gait (+/- electrophysiological) parameters associated with a particular neurological diagnosis or specific lesion(s) in neuroanatomical systems. Once developed, these profiles can be compared for differences and similarities; allowing insights into the specificity of the effect on gait of a given diagnosis or lesion in the case of the former and redundancy of neuroanatomical systems in that of the latter. A longitudinal component of the study will look at the evolution of gait parameters over time in a group of patients with spinal cord injury.</brief_summary>
