	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about using Navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (nTMS) in patients having surgery to remove a brain tumor in areas of the brain that control movement (motor function) and/or speech. nTMS is a system designed to map the brain's function relating to movement and speech.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be assessed by the nTMS system before surgery and then at the same time as your routine follow-up visits, about 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. At each visit, the following will occur: - For motor mapping, pads to monitor your movements will be placed on your face, arms and legs. A coil that is used to deliver stimulation will be placed on your head. During stimulation, you will be asked to move certain muscles and will be monitored for motor responses over the course of 20 to 30 minutes. You may feel a mild tingling sensation in your arms and/or legs during stimulation. - For speech mapping, you will be shown 95 black-and-white drawings of common objects and asked to name them. During stimulation, you will be asked to name the objects again and will be monitored for changes in speech or delays. You may feel a mild tingling sensation and contraction of the muscles in the face during stimulation. This should take about 1Â½-2 hours to complete. You will sign a separate consent form that describes the surgery you will have and its risks in more detail. Information collected during surgery will be compared to nTMS information collected before and after surgery. Your nTMS data, health information from your routine physical exams, and data about your motor and speech function collected during surgery will be analyzed by researchers. Basic information (such as your age, sex, and race) will also be collected from your medical record. Length of Study: Your participation in this study will be over after your last (12-month) study visit. This is an investigational study. The nTMS system is FDA approved to map the brain's function relating to movement and speech. Using the nTMS system before and after surgery to check movement and speech function in patients with brain tumors in these areas is investigational. Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
