	<brief_summary>This single-center, open-label study will investigate RO7033877 concentrations in plasma and in various lung compartments, including epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and alveolar macrophages (AM) in healthy volunteers after multiple intravenous (IV) administration. Bronchoscopy will be performed after the start of the last infusion on Day 3 at different timepoints. Blood, urine and brochoalveolar lavage samples will be collected to determine RO7033877 concentrations. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3 days.</brief_summary>
