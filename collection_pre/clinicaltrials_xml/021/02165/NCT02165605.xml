	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of HylaCareTM. The study will employ the patient as her own control, a commonly used method for the evaluation of topical dermatologic agents. Each patient will be randomized blindly as to whether the study serum will be applied to the medial or lateral portion of the treated breast, using the nipple as the dividing line. The product and placebo will also be applied to the contra-lateral breast in the same fashion, as a further control. The study drug and placebo will be applied three (3) times daily.</brief_summary>
