	<brief_summary>Polypharmacy is a common problem in elderly, leading among others to increased adverse drug events. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a systematic medication evaluation by a geriatric consultation team using the RASP (Rationalisation of drugs on admission by an adjusted STOPP*-list in older patients) list could reduce inappropriate prescribing for elderly admitted patients, admitted to non-geriatric departments.

	<brief_title>Rationalisation of Polypharmacy by the Geriatric Consultation Team</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polypharmacy and (potentially) inappropriate prescribing is highly prevalent in the older population, associated with increase health care expenditures, morbidity and avoidable adverse events . The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a systematic medication evaluation by a geriatric consultation team (GCT) using the RASP (Rationalisation of drugs on admission by an adjusted STOPP-list in older patients) list could reduce inappropriate prescribing for older admitted patients, admitted to non-geriatric departments. The GCT could offer the ideal format to deliver the intervention to a broad older hospitalised population.</detailed_description>
