	<brief_summary>Despite the burden of severe sepsis and septic shock deficiencies in the quality of sepsis management are recognized. Investigators present a population-based registry with easy feasibility as part of German Center for Sepsis Control &amp; Care (CSCC). All ICU patients of the Jena University Hospital, Germany will be screened for inclusion (severe sepsis or septic shock). Baseline data on ICU- and hospital care will be extracted from patient records at ICU discharge. The primary outcome is change in all-cause mortality from baseline to follow up at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after diagnosis of sepsis. Follow-up data will be collected from the primary care provider of the patient. The registry may provide valid data on quality in sepsis care.</brief_summary>
