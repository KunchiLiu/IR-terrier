	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter trial including 4 tertiary sacral neuromodulation referral centers in Switzerland (ZÃ¼rich, Bern, Nottwil, St.Gallen). Patients with refractory neurogenic LUTD are included and randomized after neuromodulator implantation into sacral neuromodulation ON or sacral neuromodulation OFF (n=30) for a 2 months double-blind phase. In addition to standard neuro-urological assessments, patients who agree will also undergo neurophysiological investigation of the lower urinary tract, i.e. recording of current perception thresholds, sensory evoked potentials, and electroencephalography after stimulation of the urethra and bladder.</brief_summary>
