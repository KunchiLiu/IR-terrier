	<brief_summary>The present Phase II study aims to assess the rates of late rectal toxicities of grade ≥ 2 after hypofractionated radiotherapy of prostate cancer of 62 Gy in 20 fractions of 3.1 Gy with an injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the space between the rectum and the prostate. Thirty-six patients with a low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer according to the D'Amico classification are included in the present protocol. The main characteristics of the study are that the patients benefit of a reduction of the treatment duration from 40 to 20 fractions, due to the hypofractionated irradiation, and of an injection of 3 to 10 cc of hyaluronic acid in the perirectal fat between the rectum and the prostate.</brief_summary>
