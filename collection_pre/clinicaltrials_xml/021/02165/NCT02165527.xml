	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Lunar iXDA scanning with the use of a computer software program can make accurate measurements of the length of leg bones compared to conventional x-rays.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Bone Length Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators would like to see how well the calculation of bone length using Lunar iDxa compares to conventional x-ray since the Lunar iXDA exposed patients to less radiation than conventional x-rays.</detailed_description>
