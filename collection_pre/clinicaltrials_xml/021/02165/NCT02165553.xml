	<brief_summary>Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces (HSC) extract is consumed in different parts of the world as a cold or hot drink and is available in the United Kingdom (UK) markets in different forms including tea bags. There is preliminary data that support the hypothesis that HSC extract consumption has beneficial effect on blood vessel health and blood pressure reduction. Hypertension, vascular dysfunction, inflammation and lipid abnormalities are all key modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the leading causes of death throughout the world. In the PHYTOVAS (PHYTOchemicals and VAScular Function) study the effect of the acute consumption a potentially bioactive food extracts: Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces (HSC) compared with a matched control (water) on blood pressure and blood vessels function will be investigated after a high - fat mixed meal. This is with a view to determining the impacts of the extract on postprandial (after meal) blood pressure and other CVD risk factors. Results from the PHYTOVAS study could lead to identification of more dietary approaches that will contribute to CVD risk prevention and management.</brief_summary>
