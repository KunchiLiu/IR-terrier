	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare a subject's sense of smell before and after endoscopic endonasal surgery to remove a skull base abnormality (i.e. tumor, inflammatory process, fracture, defect, etc.) and use the information collected to validate approaches to surgery that will minimize side effects to the sense of smell function. Data will be collected using a smell identification test along with two questionnaires. In addition, demographic, medical history, treatment, outcome, and follow-up information will be collected.</brief_summary>
