	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective, two-arm study reviewing the healing of cavitary defects in patients treated with Vitoss alone versus those treated with Vitoss with bone marrow aspirate (BMA). There will be a prospective follow-up visit at 24+ months to evaluate lont-term healing in patients identified during the retrospective portion of the study. It is thought that the inclusion of BMA will facilitate the resorption of the graft material, leading to better long-term bone healing.</brief_summary>
