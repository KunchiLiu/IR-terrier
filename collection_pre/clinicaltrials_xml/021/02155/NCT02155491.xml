	<brief_summary>The protocol is a large registry to describe acute, sub-acute and extended duration of anticoagulation management, clinical and economic duration of anticoagulation management, clinical and economic outcomes in patients with treated acute VTE (DVT and PE) in the real-world setting. Main objectives are to clarify the: - treatment related details for acute VTE (either conventional anticoagulation therapy, treatment with a direct oral anti-coagulant or other modalities of treatment) - Rate of early and late symptomatic VTE recurrence - Rate and nature of complications of VTE including post thrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension - Rate of bleeding complications - Rate of all-cause mortality at six months</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Other objectives are to clarify the additional outcomes of: - Stroke (Measured by number of incidences) - Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) (Measured by number on incidences) - ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) (Measured by number of incidences) - Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infraction (NSTEMI) (Measured by number of incidences) - Unstable Angina (Measured by number of incidences) - Quality of life and patient reported outcomes and costs associated with the management of VTE.</detailed_description>
