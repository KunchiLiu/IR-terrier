	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Kyrobak continuous passive motion home-use device in relieving low back pain, improving proprioception (balance and fall prevention) and improving the symmetry of muscle function on either side of the spine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of the Kyrobak for Chronic Low Back Pain (LBP-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Kyrobak is an electrically operated, continuous passive motion device including a platform that performs angular oscillations. The Kyrobak is used at home as an aid to relieve mild-to-moderate low back pain. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of daily home use of the Kyrobak for 3 weeks and to assess the sustained efficacy 1 week later. The evaluation will include the level of pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS), Digital Posturography, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Static Surface Electromyography (SEMG), a condition-specific low back pain disability status by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and subject satisfaction.</detailed_description>

Location lower tip of scapula to back of pelvis Etiology nonspecific Patients who have low back pain due to specific and known causes (infection, tumor, osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis, fracture, inflammatory process, radicular syndrome (radiating nerve pain from the spine such as sciatica), cauda equinal syndrome (serious neurological disorder where the spinal nerve roots are compressed which can cause).
