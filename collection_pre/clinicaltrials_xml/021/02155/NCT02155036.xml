	<brief_summary>The proposed research aims to examine whether regular aerobic exercise can preserve renal function, improve aerobic capacity, physical and psychosocial function, strength, cardiovascular function, general well-being and quality of life. Ultimately, the research aims to prove that exercise is a more cost-effective and a more efficient use or healthcare resources used in the treatment of patients with CKD. Exercise is a relatively cheap treatment option which is readily available and accessible for this patient population. establish if, compared with usual care, an exercise programme for pre-dialysis CKD patients; 1. Preserves renal function. 2. Improves aerobic capacity, physical and psychosocial function, strength, cardiovascular function, general well-being and quality of life.</brief_summary>
