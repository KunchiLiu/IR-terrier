	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 26 million individuals (13 percent) of the U.S. population, with a projected 70 percent increase by the year 2015 to over 40 million individuals. Impairments in physical function and mobility limitations have been reported in older Chronic Kidney Disease patients, however the consequences of impaired functioning on participation in daily life and quality of life have not been studied. Early identification and interventions to mitigate deterioration in physical function and mobility should lead to improved health and quality of life outcomes in older patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. Although older individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease have reduced survival expectancy, maintaining physical function and mobility may contribute to longer active life expectancy, and higher quality of life despite their diagnosis.</brief_summary>
