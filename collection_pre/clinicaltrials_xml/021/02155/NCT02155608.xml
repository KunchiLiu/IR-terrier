	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) as a potential nonmedication treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Study hypothesis address potential differences over 4 weeks of active vs. sham eTNS treatment on ADHD symptoms, measures of executive function, electroencephalography (EEG) profiles, other dimensional measures of height, weight, mood, anxiety, and sleep, and side effect profiles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This three-year developmental study is a double-blind randomized trial of active vs. inactive sham eTNS for ADHD, with four weeks acute treatment followed by an additional four weeks of clinical observation and testing after treatment cessation. The study will enroll 85-90 participants aged 8-12 years to achieve a completion target of N=36 for each study condition (total final N = 72). Participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) criteria for ADHD, any current presentation, as established by the Behavior Disorders Module of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS-PL) and clinical interview. Other screening procedures include measures of ADHD symptom severity, other behavioral ratings, and cognitive assessments. Once inclusion/exclusion criteria have been reviewed and verified, participants will have a pre-treatment visit to establish behavioral and cognitive baseline ratings and to obtain an EEG. Participants and parents will be instructed in the use of eTNS, and participants will begin use of the eTNS as directed during sleep each night. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to active or inactive sham eTNS. Participants, families, and most of the study team will remain blind to treatment assignment. Participants will have weekly assessments over the eight week study to assess behavioral, cognitive, and brain activation change and to monitor safety, tolerability, and compliance. Weekly ratings will be obtained from a parent, teacher, and clinician investigator. EEG will occur at baseline, end of treatment (week 4).</detailed_description>
