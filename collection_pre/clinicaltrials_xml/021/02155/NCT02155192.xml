	<brief_title>An Exploratory Genetic Study in Participants With Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 0, exploratory (intended to be conducted early in Phase 1, involve limited human exposure, have no therapeutic intent and are not intended to examine clinical tolerability), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) and pharmacogenomics study in participants with psoriasis. Participants who were treated in study Phase 2 NCT01483599 (X-PLORE), Phase 3 NCT00267969 (PHOENIX 1), Phase 3 NCT00307437 (PHOENIX 2) or Phase 3 NCT00454584 (ACCEPT), will be returning to their study site where a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be obtained for pharmacogenomics assessment. There will be no follow-up beyond the study site visit.</detailed_description>
