	<brief_title>IV Acetaminophen for Postoperative Pain After Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial of IV Acetaminophen compared to placebo will evaluate the effect of preoperative IV Acetaminophen on postoperative pain scores and narcotic requirements in women undergoing surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse. 204 women will randomly receive 1000 mg of IV Acetaminophen or saline preoperatively within 30 minutes of surgical incision. Subjects will be offered narcotic and non-narcotic pain medications as needed during the postoperative period. Visual analogue pain scales (VAS) will be obtained at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours postoperatively. Narcotic consumption will be recorded in morphine-equivalents. We hypothesize that women receiving IV Acetaminophen will have lower VAS scores and decreased narcotic requirements compared to controls.</detailed_description>
