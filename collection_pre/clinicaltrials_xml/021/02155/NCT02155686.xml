	<brief_summary>The elderly or people with disabilities want to remain in their homes even when their health condition has been getting worse. This project aims to demonstrate that home automation and telemonitoring can lead to develop a home safety environment that could help the elderly and individual with disability live independently in their own home. In this study, the automation sensors containing devices follow up chronic disease clinical factors to monitor their biometrical parameters and detect any abnormal prodromal disease decompensation via telemonitoring and geriatric expertise. The purpose of this study is: - to provide clinical evidence of the effectiveness of automation tools and telemonitoring/expertise for the home support for people at risk of loss of autonomy - to demonstrate the clinical benefit of combining the automation and telemonitoring and geriatric teleexpertise</brief_summary>
