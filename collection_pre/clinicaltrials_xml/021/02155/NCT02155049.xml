	<brief_summary>Prostaglandin analogues eye drops are common and effective treatment for decreasing Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP) in Glaucoma patients. A number of recently published case reports have documented periorbital fat atrophy following treatment by prostaglandin analogues. In this study the investigators want to use this side-effect of prostaglandin analogues for the treatment of orbital and periocular fat proliferation in inactive Thyroid eye disease (TED) patients, as a conservative substitute for surgical intervention.</brief_summary>
