	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective study to be carried out in representative medical institutions in order to get the information on administration of postoperative and post-radiation adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (including "go" / "no go" decision, regimens, dosages and duration) used in locally advanced prostate cancer patients with high and very high risk of recurrence in Russia. No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice. It is planned to enrol 200 subjects in up to 30 sites in Russian Federation. The average number of patients per site is planned as 6 - 10; there are no restrictions on minimum and maximum number of subjects per site in this study.</detailed_description>

Locally advanced stage of PCa (stage T3T4, NxN0, M0: prostate adenocarcinoma with extracapsular invasion (T3a) or invasion to the seminal vesicles (T3b), invasion to adjacent structures (T4) but without lymphatic invasion (N0) nor metastasis (M0)) 3.

Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma 1. Patients participating in clinical trials 2. Any medical condition which on the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the patient's participation in the study, e.g. severe nonmalignant concomitant disease which can affect life expectancy 3.
