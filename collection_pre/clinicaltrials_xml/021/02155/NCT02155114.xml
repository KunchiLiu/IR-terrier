	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to survey iron storage levels and their prognostic consequences in the context of acute inflammation. The impact of iron substitution in inflammatory states is controversial. We hypothesize that iron substitution may influence outcome in patients in inflammatory states.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Background: Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in the elderly, after bleeding and in the context of neoplasia. Our 2013 pilot study showed that iron deficiency is a common problem in medical inpatients (13.7%) and that about 55% of these also showed signs of inflammation. The relevance of iron storage levels on clinical outcome in the presence of inflammation is conflicting. On the one hand, lack of iron prevents many viruses and bacteria, as well as other microorganisms, to reproduce and on the other hand the abundance of available iron stimulates hematopoiesis and reduces symptoms of iron deficiency. - Methodology: We plan to enroll 1000-1500 patients with laboratory signs of inflammation during a period of six months and to analyze iron specific laboratory parameters twice during hospital stay. Additional laboratory analyses are planned for a smaller sample to portray the processes in iron homeostasis during inflammation. - Significance: Contradicting evidence of forty and more years of scientific research backs current therapeutic practices in patients with inflammatory disease and iron deficiency. This study records prevalence of different iron storage states, mortality, morbidity and therapies in inflammatory states combined with iron deficiency and could very well be able to recommend a therapeutic regimen as well as limits for typically used laboratory parameters.</detailed_description>
