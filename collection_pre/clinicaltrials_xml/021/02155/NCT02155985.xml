	<brief_summary>Since people started taking HIV medications, illness from AIDS has decreased, but other serious diseases like heart disease, cancer, and kidney, and liver disease have increased. HIV causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that cannot be felt but can be measured by blood. Inflammation can lead to diseases that have become some of the leading causes of death in people with HIV. HIV therapy can partially lower levels of inflammation measured in blood, however, levels of inflammation in people who have HIV may remain high compared with people not infected with HIV. Aspirin is a drug that is commonly used for pain relief but is also approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing heart attacks and stroke in those who are at increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Aspirin also is used (but is not approved by the FDA) to decrease the risk of some cancers in people who are at increased risk. Aspirin is thought to decrease risk of heart attack and stroke because it blocks the activation of platelets and prevents blood clots from clogging narrowed blood vessels, a disease called atherosclerosis. It is unknown how aspirin might decrease the chance of developing cancer in some people at higher risk, but aspirin has been shown to modulate (or change) the immune system. In HIV-infected people who have been taking antiretroviral therapy and have an undetectable HIV viral load it was recently shown that low-dose aspirin 81 mg (baby aspirin), given for one week, lowers platelet activation and reduces blood markers of inflammation which may improve the function of the immune system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune activation when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill) and to determine if 12 weeks of aspirin 300 mg and aspirin 100 mg is safe for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, it studied whether a higher dose and longer duration of aspirin provides further anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating benefit. This was done using blood and urine tests that measure inflammation and also with a test that uses ultrasound to measure the flow of blood in your arm, called flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BART). This is a painless test that bounces sound waves off of a blood vessel in your arm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation of Immune Activation by Aspirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase II prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 3-arm clinical trial to study whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune activation. At study entry, participants were randomized between the three study arms: aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg and placebo. The study treatment duration was 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week washout period. The study duration was 16 weeks. The study clinic visits included pre-entry (within 7 days prior to entry), entry, on treatment visits at weeks 2, 11 and 12, and final study visit at the end of the wash-out period at week 16. The samples for the primary and secondary outcomes were collected at pre-entry, entry, and weeks 2, 11 and 12. The evaluations of safety (clinical assessment for signs and symptoms, diagnoses, laboratory tests) were done at entry and weeks 2, 11, 12 and 16. The co-primary objectives used pair-wise comparisons to assess the effects of 300 mg and 100 mg of daily aspirin for 12 weeks on plasma sCD14 levels. Currently, the results are entered for the primary outcome measure only. The results on the secondary outcomes will be posted when they become available</detailed_description>

NOTE: This is defined as continuous active therapy with no treatment interruption longer than 7 consecutive days and a total duration offtreatment of no more than 14 days during the 48 weeks prior to entry. No change in ART regimen within the 12 weeks prior to study entry (except as noted below). NOTE: Modifications of ART dosing during within the 12 weeks prior to entry are permitted. In addition, the change in formulation (eg, from standard formulation to fixed dose combination or single tablet regimen) or dosing (eg, from once a day to twice a day) is allowed within 12 weeks prior to entry. Withinclass single drug substitution (eg, switch from nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to darunavir), are not allowed within 12 weeks prior to entry. No other changes in ART in the 12 weeks prior to entry are permitted. Screening HIV1 RNA must be &lt;50 copies/mL and performed by any FDAapproved assay at any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent within 45 days prior to study entry.

At least one HIV1 RNA test result obtained at any time point greater than 48 weeks prior to study entry must be BLQ and must be performed by any FDAapproved assay at a CLIAcertified laboratory or its equivalent. AND B. All HIV1 RNA tests reported during the 48 weeks prior to study entry must be BLQ and must be performed by any FDAapproved assay at a CLIAcertified laboratory or its equivalent. NOTE: A single RNA "blip" of ≤500 copies/mL is permissible if RNA levels most recent before and after (may include the screening HIV1 RNA test) are below the level of quantification (BLQ) for the assay. If the RNA level after the blip is the screening HIV1 RNA test, the result must be &lt;50 copies/mL.
