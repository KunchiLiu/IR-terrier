	<brief_title>Paraurethral Transplantation of Autologous Muscle Derived Stem Cells for Treatment of Stress Incontinency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will be assessed the 12-month potential efficacy of autologous muscle derived cells as therapy for stress urinary incontinence. A total of 20 women in whom stress urinary incontinence had not improved underwent intra-sphincter injection of low doses 50Ã—106 of autologous muscle derived cells, which will be derived from biopsies of their deltoid muscle. Assessments will be made at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after cell injection. Changes in stress urinary incontinence severity were evaluated by pad test, diary of incontinence episodes and quality of life surveys.</detailed_description>
