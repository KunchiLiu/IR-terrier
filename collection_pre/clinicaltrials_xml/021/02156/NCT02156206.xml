	<brief_title>Impact Evaluation of the 123 Women Emergency Phone Line in Medell√≠n, Colombia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 123 women emergency phone line of Medellin (Colombia) leads to a reduction in the violence suffered by women, as well as in their psychological wellbeing and attitudes towards violence. There is excess demand for the 123 women emergency phone line of Medellin. While on average 10 cases are reported (excluding referrals at night by the police, between 7pm and 7:00 a.m.), the average daily capacity of operation is 6 cases. So, is not possible for the 123 women team to track all women who call in 24 hours. Women who cannot receive the services of the 123 women team only get the emergency support of the police and do not receive additional aid (while it is verified that the rights of women are respected and they are guided to relevant services). The excess of demand over the capacity of the team of the 123 women line represents a natural experiment. Women will be recruited from those who are attended by the 123 emergency women phone line immediately as well as from those who were only attended by emergency support of the police and may have received later the support of the 123 women line (control group). In a first instance, women will be called to verify their address. A face to face survey will be conducted by mid-2015.</detailed_description>
