Following randomization and initiation of study drug treatment, participants will visit the study site at specified intervals throughout the study for assessments and blood work. All participants will be monitored for adverse events. All participants who have received at least one dose of study drug will be followed for safety for a minimum of 4 weeks following the last dose of study drug.
