	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a rehabilitation protocol based on individualized combined eccentric and concentric cycle ergometer training compared to classical concentric cycle training among patients with either coronary artery disease (CAD) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will therefore evaluate the efficacy of combined eccentric/concentric training on physical capacity and overall autonomy, and will analyse the adaptive mechanisms with regard to both adaptation to cardiac and muscular effort and tolerance. The research will take place in 3 phases: PHASE 1 (DURATION 6 MONTHS): 30 healthy volunteers will be included to test tolerance to personalized exercise on an eccentric cycle ergometer. PHASE 2 (DURATION 6 MONTHS): 15 patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) and 15 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be included to test the same protocol. PHASE 3 (DURATION 24 MONTHS): A total of 169 patients split into 2 parallel groups will be included: a group receiving conventional rehabilitation (group A) and the other group receiving eccentric exercise combined to conventional rehabilitation (group B). Coronary patients: 93 patients will be included (62 patients in group A and 31 in group B). COPD patients: 76 patients will be included (38 patients per group).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Persons who have provided written informed consent Healthy volunteers: Men or women aged between 40 and 75 years. Patients with CAD: Men or women aged between 40 and 75 years, with coronary artery disease without heart failure referred for a rehabilitation program.
