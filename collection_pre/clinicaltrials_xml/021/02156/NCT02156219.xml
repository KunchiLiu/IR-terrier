	<brief_title>Impact Evaluation of Separating Women and Men in the Metro of Mexico City</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the separation of men and women in the metro of Mexico City leads to an improvement in the violence and perception of violence towards women. The separation of men and women will take place in the Line 5 of the metro system. The separation will operate between 6:00am-10:00am and 2:00pm and 10:30pm. Line 4 and 6 will be used to estimate the counterfactual. Women eligible to participate in the study will be those aged 18 and 65 years who use lines 4, 5, and 6 between 7am and 9am or between 11am and 1pm before the separation between men and women is implemented. Eligible women must reside in Mexico City or the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico (60 municipalities agglomerates in the State of Hidalgo and Mexico State). Women will be recruited in the metro before the separation between men and women is implemented. They will be asked for their name, e-mail and telephone number. Also before the separation is implemented, they will be asked to answer a telephone survey to collect baseline information. The same women will be contacted again in the following 12 to 15 months to collect the endline survey, also by phone. The implementation of the separation will take place after the baseline survey has been collected.</detailed_description>
