	<brief_summary>We are studying new ways to look for abnormal areas/tissues of the colon during a colonoscopy. The current scopes used for colonoscopies are very good. But if the area doesn't look different to the naked eye, then the scope can't improve on that. We are using special stains or dyes and special scopes to see abnormal areas that are hard to see with the naked eye. The stain or dye is "fluorescent", meaning it glows when special light is used in the colonoscopy scope. You are being asked to let us spray a peptide with a fluorescent tag onto your colon. Peptides are small chains of amino acids (the building blocks that make up proteins) linked together. The peptide we use has 7 amino acids attached to a fluorescent tag ("FIT C" or Fluoresceinisothiocyanate). FITC is used by eye doctors to examine your eyes (the yellow eye drops). We are testing this "fluorescent peptide" to see if it will stick if there are any abnormal areas. If the peptide "sticks", it will "glow" when a special light in the scope is used. In this study, we will apply the fluorescent peptide to your colon by using a spray tube that fits in the colonoscope. This is a phase IB study. This means that although we have applied the peptide to 25 people in our first research study, we still need to learn more about "fluorescent peptide" in people. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this agent, but is allowing us to test it in this study. The main goal of this study is to see if the peptide "glows" well and if we can take pictures of areas that do glow. This is a research study of the peptide and our ability to see it "glow or fluoresce". Being in this study and applying the peptide won't change how our biopsies are taken or how your colonoscopy is done.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects felt to be at increased risk for CRC and colonic polyps OR Subjects with known colonic adenomas scheduled for colonic resection OR Subjects who are scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy for follow up surveillance of IBD with known dysplasia or who are at high risk for high grade dysplasia. Subjects who are scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy in the medical procedures unit at the University of Michigan Health Center All subjects who are medically cleared for the procedure (e.g. washout for anticoagulants, comorbidities) who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included. Standard practice guidelines for safely proceeding with the procedure will be sufficient for our study Adults aged 18 to 100 years Willing and able to sign informed consent The effects of Colon KCC Heptapeptide (5FITClabeled peptide) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test on the day of the procedure prior to receiving the Colon KCC Heptapeptide (5FITClabeled peptide agent) or be postmenopausal. Postmenopausal women are defined as posthysterectomy, or over 40 and at least 18 months without menses and not on birthcontrol. Subjects with known allergy or negative reaction to fluorescein or derivatives. Subjects on active chemotherapy or radiation treatment Pregnant or trying to conceive</criteria>
