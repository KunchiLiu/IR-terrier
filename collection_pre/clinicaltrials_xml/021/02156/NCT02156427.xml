	<criteria>Men and women aged over 18 years old with a diagnosis of nonscaring leukoderma that has been stable over the last 2 years (nonsegmental, segmental vitiligo and piebaldism) For nonsegmental vitiligo: symmetrical vitiligo lesions, or parts of a lesion. A part of at least 1 cm2 (1 x 1 cm), but preferable 4 cm2 (2x2 cm) and preferably in the center of each lesions (left/right) should be treated. The minimum distance between the normal pigmented skin and the test area should preferably be at least 0.5 cm. For segmental vitiligo lesion and piebaldism: all lesions possible if two parts of at least 1 cm2 (1 x 1 cm), but preferably 4 cm2 (2 x 2 cm) in the lesion can be treated. The minimum distance between the 2 areas should be 2 cm and between test areas and to the normal pigmented skin preferably at least 0.5 cm. Medical treatments of vitiligo failed (in case of vitiligo: at least cream treatment for 6 months). Absence of infected lesion Negative serology (HIVhepatitis B and C Syphilis) Without treatment one month for cream and 3 months for phototherapy Hypersensibility to local anaesthetics or one of the components of the device (trypsin, hyaluronic acid) Indication against biopsies Patient with a history of melanoma Positive serology (ongoing serious systemic disease, herpes, HIV, hepatitis B and CSyphilis) Positive pregnancy test History of keloidal scars and presence of Koebner's phenomenon (type 1 and type 2b) Infected lesion Test areas not on fingers and toes vitiligo areas in case of nonsegmental vitiligo Test areas not on facial non segmental vitiligo Pregnant women, or lactating Age &lt;18years Major deprived of their freedom by administrative or legal decision, or being the subject of a legal protection measure, or out of state to express their consent</criteria>
