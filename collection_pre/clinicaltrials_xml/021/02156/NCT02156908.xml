	<brief_summary>The investigators will first test, in a pilot study, the effects of 3 days of D-serine (DSR) on auditory plasticity in a sensory based remediation (SBR) paradigm, and then do a small-scale double-blind study of DSR + SBR on auditory emotion recognition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will initially enroll 5 subjects in an open label, three session pilot in patients will receive three sessions of tone matching SBR. We will then enroll 20 individuals in a parallel group, double blind placebo controlled intervention. Subjects will be assigned to D-serine (60mg/kg) or placebo to be taken 1x each week during the SBR sessions. Subjects will receive study drug 30 minutes prior to session. Subjects will under go three sessions of tone matching SBR, followed by 3 sessions of emotion recognition SBR. In total subjects will have 6 treatment sessions, and as before, treatment days will be separated by 1 week. Electrophysiology will be conducted at baseline and after the third weekly SBR session, and social cognitive and safety measures will also be completed at baseline and final. Double blind SBR intervention: First three sessions will be similar to SBR for pilot, with base tones limited to 100-400 Hz (emotionally relevant range). This will be followed by three sessions in which subjects are trained on identifying emotionally relevant tones. Tones will be developed based on previous research (Kantrowitz 2011).

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 18 to 64 years old, IQ≥85 and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) ≥60. All oral and depot antipsychotics (with the exception of clozapine) are allowable. Patients must be on their antipsychotic medication for 1 month and stable on dose of antipsychotic and adjunctive medications for 2 weeks prior to study entry. Exclusion criteria: history of neurological visual or hearing impairment, active suicidal ideation on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), current alcohol or drug abuse (&lt;1 month) or substance dependence (&lt;4 months). All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the baseline visit. We require an IQ of ≥85 to ensure that subjects will have a capacity to learn. In our crosssectional studies, we have observed an IQ≥85 in over 90% of candidates, suggesting that this is not an overly restrictive criterion.</criteria>
