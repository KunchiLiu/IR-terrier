	<brief_summary>Compromised peripheral tissue oxygenation during surgery may lead to worse patient outcome, mainly due to post-operative infections or heart failure. Insufficient stroke volume and/or cardiac output due to hypovolemia or cardiac defects play a central role in causing poor peripheral tissue oxygenation. In order to assess stroke volume, there are numerous invasive and non-invasive methods available. Up to the present date it is unknown, if these methods may by used interchangeably in patients with severe cardiac defects like aortic stenosis.</brief_summary>
