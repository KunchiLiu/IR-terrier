	<brief_summary>Although endoscopic colonic polypectomy has been an established procedure for two decades, the risk of bleeding is still higher after resecting of pedunculated polyps, because of the presence of a large artery in the stalk. Preventive methods such as endoloop and epinephrine injection have been proposed in the management of postpolypectomy bleeding in large colonic polyps. For prophylactic clip, there was no randomized controlled study assessing the efficacy in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large pedunculated polyps. So the investigators designed a randomized controlled trial to confirm the efficacy of application of prophylactic clip in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding in large polyps.</brief_summary>
