	<brief_title>An RCT Evaluation of a Diabetes Dashboard Team Model in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare a usual diabetes care condition (UDC) to a comprehensive diabetes care intervention condition (IC) involving a "diabetes dashboard" clinical decision support tool used by the diabetes team in primary care. The investigators used a parallel-groups randomized design. The diabetes team (i.e., diabetes nurses, diabetes dietitians, and providers) delivered a 5-visit, 6-month intervention to n=199 poorly-controlled (HbA1c &gt;7.5%) Latino T2D patients (mean age=55 years, 60% female) seen at 2 urban community health centers. This intervention was compared to an established, in-house diabetes team care program (n=200) for its impact on blood glucose control and key psychosocial outcomes (diabetes distress, depression, social distress).</detailed_description>
