	<brief_summary>Coming for a cardiac test can be a daunting experience. Despite providing written information sheets for patients, experience in the scanner demonstrates that many patients are ill-prepared when they attend for cardiac computed tomography (CT). Heart rate control is essential for high image quality, as this prolongs cardiac diastole (during which imaging occurs) and results in less motion blur, but this may be challenging to achieve in the context of an anxious patient. In such situations, additional radiation exposure is required to optimise the chances of diagnostic images. Thus, poor patient selection and preparation has been shown to increase the radiation burden to the patient, as well as to increase the rate of non-diagnostic scans, leading to patients needing additional, alternative testing. This can be distressing for patients and increases downstream costs for the hospital. Poor patient awareness is also known to increase the anxiety of attending for a test. Improved patient information and understanding has been shown to improve outcomes in a wide variety of hospital settings. Evidence from cardiac catheterisation angiography suggests that the use of alternative information formats can reduce patient anxiety and improve patient satisfaction, as well as improving their understanding of the technical requirements of a test. The latter may contribute to improved preparation - for example, patients who do not understand the requirements for cardiac CT, particularly the need for a slow heart rate, will often consume caffeine, stop their heart-slowing drugs, or even run or cycle to their appointment. We have agreed a collaboration with Plymouth University to create patient information videos for CT. These will utilise the expertise of media students (their department also runs a commercial arm, due to the quality of their output), in conjunction with the clinical requirements and patient participation groups, to create an accessible, engaging and informative film. We wish to evaluate the impact of this method of conveying information to patients on how well they are prepared to undergo testing. If this concept is successful, it may be of use to patients undergoing a huge range of tests or treatments across specialities. We therefore need to demonstrate the efficacy (or otherwise) of such an intervention.</brief_summary>
