	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine if patients suffering from diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain treated with ranolazine will have a greater reduction in pain compared to placebo. Hypothesis: From the prior clinical observations, and analgesic efficacy in the preclinical animal model of neuropathic pain, the investigators hypothesize that subjects randomized to ranolazine will show a greater reduction in diabetic neuropathic pain compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
