	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) (blood levels) comparability of 2 different formulations of ustekinumab, 90 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) liquid in vial (LIV) and 5 mg/mL LIV, following a single intravenous administration of 6 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) ustekinumab, diluted in saline, in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study of Single-Dose Intravenous Ustekinumab Delivered in 2 Different Liquid in Vial Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), parallel (a clinical trial comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) single-dose, inpatient/outpatient study in healthy participants. The study consists of following periods: Screening (within 28 days before study drug administration), inpatient period (Day 1 to 4) and outpatient period (up to Day 141). Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 1 of 2 treatment groups (that is, Ustekinumab 90 mg/mL or Ustekinumab 5 mg/mL) and will receive treatment on Day 1. The PK comparability of 2 different formulations of ustekinumab, diluted in saline, will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
