	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is considered the fourth most common malignancy cancer in America. However, in Colombia the incidence is higher, and it is considered the second cause of death among men for malignance diseases. In the framework of clinical localized prostate cancer there is a controversy regarding the best predictors of risk and the best treatment options. The actual literature is discussing the possibility of underestimate the disease and actual tools are not sufficient for proper characterization. Is in this context that extended pelvic lymphadenectomy emerges as a stratification tool in prostate cancer that defines the real commitment of the disease. The investigators need to know the characteristics that the disease has on the investigators community so the investigators can generate appropriate therapeutic approach. Thus, the present prospective observational-descriptive multicenter study, want to determine in three referral centers in Bogot√° Colombia , the frequency of pelvic node involvement in patients with localized clinical prostate cancer from the stratification achieved by pelvic lymphadenectomy extended.</brief_summary>
