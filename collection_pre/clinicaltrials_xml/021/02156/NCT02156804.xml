	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the rate and frequency of high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 or higher), treatment-related, select adverse events in subjects with histologically confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma and progression post prior treatment containing an anti-Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody, treated with Nivolumab (BMS-936558) at a dose of 3 mg/kg every two weeks.</brief_summary>
