	<brief_summary>Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) is an intervention for unilateral cerebral palsy (CP). It is currently part of standard of care for children with unilateral CP, but is typically done one-on-one and with the child wearing a cast 24 hours a day during the duration of treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of an intensive group-based CIMT summer camp in which participants wear a removable cast on upper extremity function, occupational performance, and patient-specific goals. The investigators hypothesize that upper extremity skills and occupational performance will increase, and that patients will reach their individualized goals.</brief_summary>
