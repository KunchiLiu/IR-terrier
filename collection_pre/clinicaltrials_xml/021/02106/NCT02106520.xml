	<brief_summary>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare (~ 1/6000) but ubiquitous genetic disease. It is associated with abnormal angiogenesis and autosomal dominant inheritance, leading to telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulae. More than 95% of patients are concerned by epistaxis (nosebleeds). These events are spontaneous, repeated, irregular, both diurnal and nocturnal, a source of anemia, disabling and very socially embarrassing. Anti-angiogenic treatments, including bevacizumab, are a new therapeutic option in HHT. The aim of this study is to evaluate 3 months after the end of the treatment the efficacy on the duration of the nosebleeds with 3 different doses (25, 50 and 75 mg) of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner (3 administrations) in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia complicated by nosebleeds. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, seamless phase II/III study is to be carried out on 4 groups of 20 patients for first step and 2 groups of 20 to 40 patients for second step</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years. Patients who have given their free informed and signed consent. Patients affiliated to a social security scheme or similar. Patients monitored for clinically confirmed HHT (presence of at least 3 Curaçao criteria) and/or confirmed by molecular biology. Patients who have not undergone nasal surgery in the 3 months prior to inclusion. Patient with nosebleeds of a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes and justified by followup grids completed for at least the 3 months prior to the time of inclusion. Women who are pregnant or likely to become so in the course of the study. Patients not affiliated to a social security scheme. Patients who are protected adults under the terms of the law (French Public Health Code). Refusal to consent. Patients for whom the diagnosis of HHT has not been confirmed clinically and/or by molecular biology. Patients with an ongoing infectious condition. Participation in another clinical trial within the 28 days prior to inclusion. Known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the excipients. Known hypersensitivity to products of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or other human or humanized recombinant antibodies. Patients who have incompletely filled in the nosebleed grids in the 3 months preceding the treatment. Patients who do not present with nosebleeds with a monthly average duration over the 3 months preceding the treatment of more than 20 minutes ((duration M1 + duration M2 + duration M3) / 3). Remark: only the 3 months strictly preceding the treatment will be taken into account, even if the grids have been completed over a longer period. Patients who have received Avastin® intravenously in the 6 months prior to inclusion.</criteria>
