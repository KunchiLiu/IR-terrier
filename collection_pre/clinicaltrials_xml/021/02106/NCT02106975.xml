	<criteria>Patients must have suspected or proven infection, and meet 2 out of 4 of the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response (SIRS) due to infection, and be accompanied by at least 1 criterion for sepsisinduced organ dysfunction, and meet all 5 criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Suspected or proven infection: (e.g., thorax, urinary tract, abdomen, skin, sinuses, central venous catheters, and central nervous system, see Appendix A). The presence of a systemic inflammatory response: Defined as: fever: &gt;38ºC (any route) or hypothermia: &lt;36ºC (core temp only), tachycardia: heart rate &gt; 90 beats/min or receiving medications that slow heart rate or paced rhythm, leukocytosis: &gt;12,000 WBC/µL or leukopenia: &lt;4,000 WBC/µL or &gt;10% band forms. Respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 &lt; 32 or invasive mechanical ventilation. The presence of sepsisinduced organ dysfunction: (any of the following thought to be due to infection) Sepsisinduced hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 90 mm Hg or an SBP decrease &gt; 40 mm Hg unexplained by other causes or use of vasopressors for blood pressure support (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine =/&gt; 5mcg, phenylephrine, vasopressin) Arterial hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300) or supplemental O2 &gt; 6LPM. Lactate &gt; upper limits of normal laboratory results Urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/hour for &gt; two hours despite adequate fluid resuscitation Platelet count &lt; 100,000 per mcL Coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.5) Bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 11 or a positive CAM ICU score ARDS characterized by all the following criteria Lung injury of acute onset, within 1 week of an apparent clinical insult and with progression of respiratory symptoms Bilateral opacities on chest imaging not explained by other pulmonary pathology (e.g. pleural effusions, lung collapse, or nodules) Respiratory failure not explained by heart failure or volume overload Decreased arterial PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 mm Hg Minimum PEEP of 5 cmH2O Known allergy to Vitamin C inability to obtain consent; age &lt; 18 years; more than 48 hrs since meeting ARDS criteria; patient or surrogate or physician not committed to full support (not excluded if patient would receive all supportive care except for cardiac resuscitation); pregnancy or breast feeding, moribund patient not expected to survive 24 hours; home mechanical ventilation (via tracheotomy or noninvasive) except for CPAP/BIPAP used only for sleepdisordered breathing; home O2 &gt; 2LPM, except for with CPAP/BIPAP diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (vasculitis); interstitial lung disease requiring continuous home oxygen therapy; Active kidney stone primary care givers unwilling/unable to use ARDSnet 6 ml/kg ventilation protocol; Non English speaking; Ward of the state (inmate, other)</criteria>
