	<brief_title>The Use of LMA-Proseal and Endobronchial Blocker for One Lung Anesthesia, Case Series</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of LMA has gained popularity secondary to benefits confirmed by many literatures. However, LMA is rarely used in thoracic surgery. To enable one-lung ventilation, the LMA need to be used with bronchial blocker. The use of this combination has been reported as a rescue technique in special clinical scenarios, i.e. patient with difficult airway. When used in patient with difficult airway, the LMA will be inserted until proper ventilation achieved, then endobronchial blocker will be subsequently placed through the LMA into the selected main bronchus. The success rate of the the bronchial blocker placement via properly placed LMA has never been studied. This pilot study was designed to evaluate the success rate, the quality of lung collapsed, the dislodgement or other associated problems including some minor complications i.e. postoperative dysphagia, sore throat hoarseness of voice.</detailed_description>
