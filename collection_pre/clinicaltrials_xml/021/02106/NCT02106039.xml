	<brief_title>Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients With Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tight glycemic control may improve tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcome and help reduce symptoms. However, active TB and TB treatment hamper glycemic control. Patients starting TB treatment experience rapid changes in appetite, body composition, and inflammation (which increases insulin resistance); inflammation is a feature of untreated TB and following an increase as a result of initial bacterial killing, inflammation subsides with successful treatment. In addition, TB medication (rifampicin) increases the metabolism of oral anti-diabetic drugs including the widely used sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones, though a possible interaction with the antidiabetic drug metformin has not been previously examined. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose with adjustments in anti-diabetes medication during the course of TB treatment may therefore be needed. However, frequent monitoring is associated with additional costs, and tools and skills for glucose monitoring and diabetes treatment may be lacking in TB or pulmonary clinics, creating a need to refer patients to other health providers. As such, a less intense schedule, preferably following the established decision points in TB treatment after 2 and 6 months would offer significant advantage. None of these issues have been addressed systematically so far.</detailed_description>
