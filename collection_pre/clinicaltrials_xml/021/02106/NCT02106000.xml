	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to record and compare the inhalation profiles of non pregnant women and those who are in the third stage of labour. The inhalation profiles will be recorded from consenting women as they inhale with maximal effort through an inhalation profile recorder [Glaxosmithkline (GSK), Ware]. The recorder will simulate resistance to airflow and will be representative of a dry powder inhaler of moderate resistivity. The inhalation endpoints will include Peak Pressure Drop, Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate, Inhaled Volume, Inhalation time, Average Inhalation Flow Rate and Acceleration rate which will be compared between the two female cohorts. Inhalation profiles recorded in this way may subsequently be used to study the in-vitro performance of investigational materials across inhalation parameters representative of the target patient population. An appropriate number of subjects will be consented so that approximately 40 subjects (20 non-pregnant females and 20 stage three labour subjects) complete assessments. The inhalation profiles will be recorded on the same day of screening or at another time within a span of 50 days</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A nonpregnant female subject is eligible to participate in the study if she is in the age group of 18 to 30 years (inclusive), at the time of signing the informed consent; is healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history; is having a body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) and Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 19 29.9 kg/meter^2 (inclusive); is capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form; OR is having a clinical abnormality which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor, if required, agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures Pregnant Female will be eligible to participate in the study if she belongs to the age group of 18 to 30 years (inclusive), at the time of signing the informed consent; is healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history; is capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form ;OR is having a clinical abnormality which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Healthy Volunteers will be excluded from the study if they have a history or regular use of tobacco or smoking products within 6 months prior to screening; have a current history of Asthma or history of lung disease; have a history of Airway obstruction or abnormality OR have an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within four weeks of the inhalation assessment visit. Pregnant Females will be excluded from the study if they are undergoing Caesarean Section; OR have preeclampsia; have an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within four weeks of the inhalation assessment visit; are receiving an epidural or opioid analgesia for pain management; OR require instrumental or otherwise assisted delivery as assessed by the midwife staff at time of inhalation assessment visit OR have a current history of asthma or lung disease ; have a history of airway obstruction or abnormality; OR have a history or regular use of tobacco or smoking products within 6 months prior to screening</criteria>
