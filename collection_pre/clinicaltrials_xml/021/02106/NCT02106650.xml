	<criteria>Diagnosed with relapsed or refractory PTCL. At least 18 years of age. Recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy, and is at least 30 days from the most recent cytotoxic therapy. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function as defined by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/μL. Platelet count ≥100,000/μL. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL. AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, GGT ≤2.5 × ULN, AST/ALT/GGT ≤5 × ULN if documented hepatic involvement with lymphoma). Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min. ECOG ≤2 Active concurrent malignancy. If there is a history of prior malignancies, the patient is to be diseasefree for ≥5 years. Patients with other prior malignancies less than 5 years before study entry may still be enrolled if they have received treatment resulting in complete resolution of the cancer and currently have no clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of active or recurrent disease. Congestive heart failure Class III/IV according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification. Uncontrolled hypertension. Known, uncontrolled HIVpositive diagnosis. Symptomatic CNS metastases or lesions for which treatment is required. Prophylactic CNS treatment are eligible. Active uncontrolled infection, underlying medical condition, or other serious illness that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment. Had major surgery within 14 days prior to enrollment. Used any investigational drugs, biologics, or devices within 30 days prior to study treatment or plans to use any of these during the course of the study. Had previous exposure to Folotyn within 6 months of study enrollment</criteria>
