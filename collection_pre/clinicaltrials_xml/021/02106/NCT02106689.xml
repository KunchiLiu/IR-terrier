	<brief_summary>The daily injections required for superovulation, a fertility treatment using injections to stimulate a women's ovaries to produce multiple eggs, can be an anxiety provoking process for many women and a deterrent to treatment. Alternative needle-free injection systems have been developed with the intention of reducing needle phobia and pain, while providing similar results. However, these needle-free systems are not yet being widely used for women with infertility. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the pain and apprehension patients often associate with needles and injections, can be alleviated by using a new, Health Canada approved, needle-free system. The purpose of the current study is to assess whether patient satisfaction is improved in patients using a needle free injection system for the daily self injections required for superovulation induction as compared to patients using the standard needle and syringe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Needle-Free Injections of Gonadotropins for Superovulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injectable medications called gonadotropins are often necessary for fertility treatments. Superovulation is the process of using injections to stimulate a woman's ovary to produce multiple eggs. Having multiple eggs mature increases women's chances that at least 1 egg is fertilized. The daily injections required for superovulation, can be an anxiety provoking process for many women and a deterrent to treatment. Alternative needle-free injection systems have been developed with the intention of reducing needle phobia and pain, while providing similar results. However, these needle-free systems are not yet being widely used for women with infertility. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the pain and apprehension patients often associate with needles and injections, can be alleviated by using a new, Health Canada approved, needle-free system. Studies have shown that needle-free injection systems are just as effective as standard self injections when used for the delivery of medications subcutaneously (i.e., delivered just beneath the skin) - such as insulin, vaccinations and local anesthetic. To date, there have been two studies that have examined the use of needle-free injections specifically for in vitro fertilization. The results of these studies showed that the needle-free system was as successful as standard injections in promoting ovarian stimulation and achieving pregnancies. However, what has not yet been demonstrated is whether patients think that the needle-free system is easier is use and less painful to administer than the standard injections. The purpose of the current study is to assess whether patient satisfaction is improved in patients using a needle free injection system for the daily self injections required for superovulation induction as compared to patients using the standard needle and syringe.</detailed_description>
