	<brief_title>Safety Study to Assess AFM11 in Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory CD19 Positive B-cell NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 is present on B-cells from earliest recognizable B-lineage cells during development to B-cell blasts and is lost only upon maturation to plasma cells. Expression of CD19 on B-cells at various development stages makes it an ideal target to treat B-cell associated malignancies.The rationale for the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both malignant cells via its anti-CD19 domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This results in the formation of the "immunological synapse" and the subsequent T-cell activation on leading to killing of malignant cells.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with CD19+, relapsed or refractory histologically (WHO classification) confirmed follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, mediastinal Bcell lymphoma, or transformed Bcell lymphomas. Patients with either indolent or aggressive NHL. Patients who relapsed or were refractory to the approved standard therapy, which must have included 1 treatment line with rituximab plus chemotherapy, and who are not candidates for bone marrow transplant with a curative intent. Measurable disease (at least 1 lesion ≥ 1.5 cm) documented by CT scan. Disease progression requiring therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. Total number of Bcells (healthy and malignant combined) in the peripheral blood exceeds the upper physiological limit (as per institutional guidance) of total Bcell counts in healthy individuals. Autologous Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within 12 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment. Prior allogeneic HSCT. Abnormal hematological laboratory values as defined below: 1. Peripheral lymphocyte count &gt; 20 × 10^9/L 2. Platelet count ≤ 75,000/µL 3. Hemoglobin level ≤ 9 g/dL. Known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) involvement. 1. History of or current relevant CNS pathology as epilepsy, seizure, paresis, aphasia, apoplexia, severe brain injuries, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, and/or psychosis. 2. Evidence for presence of malignant disease, inflammatory lesions, and/or vasculitis on cerebral MRI. 3. Infiltration of the cerebrospinal fluid by malignant Bcells, confirmed by lumbar puncture. Cancer chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment, or at least 4 times the respective halflives, whichever is longer. Radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment. Therapy with antibody, or antibody constructs within 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment, or at least 4 times the respective halflives, whichever is longer. Prior treatment with alemtuzumab (Campath®) within 12 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment, or at least 4 times the respective halflife, whichever is longer. Abnormal renal or hepatic function as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) ≥ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN; serum creatinine ≥ 2 × ULN; creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/minute. History of malignancy other than Bcell lymphoma within 5 years prior to study entry, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Uncontrolled infections; known bacteremia. Regular dose of corticosteroids during the 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment or anticipated need of continuous corticosteroids exceeding prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent, or any other immunosuppressive therapy within 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or chronic infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not willing to use an effective form of contraception during participation in the study and at least 12 weeks thereafter. Male patients not willing to ensure that during the study and at least 12 weeks thereafter no fathering takes place.</criteria>
