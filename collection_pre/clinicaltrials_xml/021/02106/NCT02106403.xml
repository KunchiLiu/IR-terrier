	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomised, examiner and subject blinded study is to evaluate and compare cooling performance and overall consumer liking of the prototype formulation with the currently marketed wound spray and negative control in subjects with experimental wounds. For each subject, three superficial wounds will be induced on two volar forearms, by sequential tape strippings until a glistening layer is visualized. After wounding, a randomised test product will be sprayed twice on test site, and the subject will be asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating product cooling performance and overall liking.</brief_summary>
