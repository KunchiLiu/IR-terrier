	<brief_summary>This study will test whether cardiac MRI can improve early detection of Hodgkin lymphoma associated heart disease compared to a stress echocardiogram. By doing both stress echocardiography and cardiac MRI, we will compare the ability of the two tests to detect heart disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Classical or nodular lymphocyte predominant HL treated at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. Age ≥ 18 years Treatment for HL that included mediastinal RT at initial diagnosis or relapse. ≥ 5 years from last HL treatment. Primary HL diagnosis prior to 1980. Additional mediastinal RT or subsequent cardiotoxic systemic therapy for secondary malignant neoplasm. Known CAD/CHF (defined as documented myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization, angiographic obstructive CAD, or decreased LV function [EF &lt; 55%] during prior clinical care). Contraindication to MRI (i.e. pacemakers, defibrillators, or aneurysm clips, or other implanted ferromagnetic objects), gadolinium (i.e. known hypersensitivity to gadolinium, advanced renal insufficiency as defined by glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m^2). Contraindication to exercise stress testing other than the above (i.e. unstable angina or severe valvular stenosis).</criteria>
