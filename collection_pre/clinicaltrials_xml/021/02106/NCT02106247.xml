	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Healthy males according to the investigator´s assessment, as based on the following criteria: a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests 2. Age 18 to 50 years (incl.) 3. BMI 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.) 4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with GCP and local legislation Exclusion criteria: 1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the investigator 2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg and &gt;= 140 mmHg at screening in supine position 3. Repeated measurement of diastolic blood pressure &lt; 55 and &gt;= 90 mmHg at screening in supine position 4. Repeated measurement of pulse rate &lt; 40 bpm and &gt; 90 bpm at screening 5. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be of clinical relevance 6. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator 7. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 8. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial drug 9. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), other neurological disorders or psychiatric disorders 10. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts 11. Chronic or relevant acute infections 12. Positive testing on infectious diseases 13. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial medication or its excipients) 14. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) within 30 days or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication 15. Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might reasonably influence the results of the trial 16. Participation in another trial with investigational drug administration within 60 days prior to administration of trial medication 17. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) 18. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days 19. Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 40 g per day) 20. Drug abuse 21. Positive testing in the alcohol breath test or the drug screening test 22. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial) 23. Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial 24. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site 25. At screening, a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as repeated demonstration of a QTcF interval &gt;450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding 26. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome) 27. Abnormal parameters for thyroid hormones (T3, T4, TSH), coagulation parameters (partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen (retests prior inclusion are allowed)) 28. Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance, because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study 29. Male subjects who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming pregnant from the first dosing day until two month after the trial completion. Acceptable methods of contraception comprise barrier contraception and a medically accepted contraceptive method for the female partner (intrauterine device with spermicide, hormonal contraceptive for at least two month prior trial participation) 30. History of retinopathy 31. Any history or present disease of the central nervous system, the spinal cord or the spinal column, which could provoke complications with procedure of the lumbar catheterization/intrathecal punction 32. Signs of intracranial overpressure as determined by funduscopy</criteria>
