	<brief_summary>The primary study objective is to demonstrate the superiority of APF530 500 mg given subcutaneously (SC) compared with ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg given intravenously (IV) (up to a maximum of 16 mg) in the delayed-phase (&gt; 24-120 hours) complete response (CR) rate (defined as no emesis and no use of rescue medications) in subjects receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) as defined by the 2011 ASCO CINV guidelines</brief_summary>

Subject is planning to receive multipleday chemotherapy. Subject has taken any of the following agents within 7 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy (the study): 5HT3 receptor antagonists, phenothiazines, benzamides, domperidone, cannabinoids, or NK1 receptor antagonist. Subject has taken any benzodiazepine within 1 day (24 hours) prior to initiation of chemotherapy (the study). Subject is scheduled to receive any other chemotherapeutic agent from Day 2 through Day 6. Subject is scheduled to receive any radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis from Day 5 through Day 6. Subject has received systemic corticosteroids or sedative antihistamines within 72 hours of Day 1 of the study, except as premedication for chemotherapy (e.g., taxanes, pemetrexed). Subject has symptomatic primary or metastatic central nervous system (CNS) disease. Subject has ongoing vomiting, retching, or nausea caused by any etiology, or has a history of anticipatory nausea and vomiting.
