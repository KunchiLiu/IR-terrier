	<brief_summary>Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail. Two thirds of those released with HIV-focused discharge planning are reincarcerated within one year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance use disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist, there remains a critical need to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jail. The Navigator Project is a five-year randomized study that will test the effectiveness of an intensive enhanced case management intervention to reduce sex and drug-related HIV transmission risk; increase HIV medication adherence; reduce drug dependence; and reduce reincarceration.</brief_summary>
