	<brief_title>Internet-Based Interventions for Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine if there is a benefit of an online intervention for persons with bipolar diagnoses, and what components appear to be useful. Specifically, the study will examine (1) whether exposure to the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention results in decreased depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression (MADRS) and (2) whether there is an association between graduated levels of involvement (Level I, 2, or 3) and resulting improvement? We expect that those participants assigned to the control condition (Level 1, peer discussion board only), will have fewer positive outcomes than those in Level 2 (discussion board and psychoeducation) or 3 (discussion board, psychoeducation, and interactive psychosocial tools) conditions.</detailed_description>
