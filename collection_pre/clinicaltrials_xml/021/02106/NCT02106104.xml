	<brief_title>Renal Effects of DPP-4 Inhibitor Linagliptin in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on preclinical and small-sized studies in non-diabetic individuals, incretin-based therapies, i.e. glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), may hold promise in preventing the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease. However, the potential renoprotective effects of these agents, that are believed to be effectuated "beyond glucose control", have not been sufficiently detailed in human diabetes. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the mechanistic and clinical effects of DPP-4i on fasting and postprandial renal physiology and biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes. Forty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes will undergo an eight week intervention with linagliptin or glimepiride in order to assess changes in the outcome parameters.</detailed_description>
