	<detailed_description>According to VA estimates, nearly 500,000 Veterans suffer from dementia. There is currently no cure for dementia. Ultimately, dementia will have a large impact on quality of life in Veterans and families, lead to expensive nursing home placement, and decrease life expectancy for patients and family caregivers. The experience of high burden in a caregiver for a Veteran with dementia increases the likelihood of permanent nursing home placement and can separate Veterans from their families. To address the high burden of caring for a Veteran with dementia, the investigators aim to study the effect of a rehabilitative intervention for family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. This novel approach will use video technology that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical centers.</detailed_description>
