	<brief_summary>The patients with sepsis are in high risk of malnutrition, which could contribute to infection, difficulty in weaning from ventilators. The investigators speculate whether nutrition therapy with high nitrogen could attenuate the malnutrition status and improve the outcome in these sepsis patients. In this prospective Randomized Controlled Trial, the investigators aim to compare high nitrogen intake with conventional nitrogen supply which were recommended in guidelines.</brief_summary>
