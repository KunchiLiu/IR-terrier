	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Silodosin on Nocturia for Patients With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a multi-center, prospective, open-label and single-arm study. Subjects who are willing to provide written informed consent will be enrolled after screening for eligibility criteria. The subjects will be administered with investigational product for 12 weeks and visit as outpatients for evaluation of safety and efficacy at baseline (visit 2) and 4 weeks (visit 3) and 12 weeks (visit 4) after baseline.</detailed_description>
