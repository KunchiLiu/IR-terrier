	<brief_title>Simvastatin Effect on Radiation Therapy of Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite current advances in therapies, the outcome for patients with brain metastases is fatal. New therapeutic approaches, such as radiosensitizing agents, are needed to provide a significant survival advantage for those patients. Statins have been reported to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in addition to a neuroprotective effect. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the efficacy and safety of radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases and on improving patients' quality of life.</detailed_description>
