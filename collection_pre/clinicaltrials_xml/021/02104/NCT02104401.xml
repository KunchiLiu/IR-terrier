	<brief_summary>This research will help us to understand whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can safely improve recovery of speech and language abilities, gait , and mood in people with Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Some of the disorders that will be studied to understand if tDCS can be useful include Parkinson's Disease, Multi-System Atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).</brief_summary>
