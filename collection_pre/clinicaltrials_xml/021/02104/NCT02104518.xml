	<brief_title>Evaluation of Different G6PD Testing Platforms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we propose to evaluate the performance of several G6PD testing platforms. We will also determine the concordance between point-of-care G6PD tests and the spectrophotometric gold standard. This study will also access the sensitivity and specificity between the point-of-care G6PD tests. This study will take place in Indonesia, specifically in the SW Sumba region. We will enroll 700 volunteers.</detailed_description>
