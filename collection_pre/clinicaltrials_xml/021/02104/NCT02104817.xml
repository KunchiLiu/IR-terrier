	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (corn oil), parallel group design that will enroll approximately 13,000 patients with hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL and high risk for CVD to be randomized 1:1 to either corn oil + statin or Epanova + statin, once daily, for approximately 3-5 years as determined when the number of MACE outcomes is reached.</brief_summary>
