	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Empegfilgrastim for Neutropenia Prophylaxis in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BCD-017-3 is an double-blind randomized phase III clinical study to compare the incidence of CTCAE grade 3/4 neutropenia after a single administration of recombinant human pegylated filgrastim empegfilgrastim (Extimia®) at a dose of 6 or 7.5 mg versus daily administration of filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg/day for neutropenia prophylaxis in breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The study also includes the following determination of pharmacokinetic parameters after repeated administration of the study drug.</detailed_description>
