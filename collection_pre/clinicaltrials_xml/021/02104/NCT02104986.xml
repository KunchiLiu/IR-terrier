	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study to Evaluate a Risk-adapted Strategy for Treatment of Extra Cranial Non Seminomateous Malignant Germ Cell Tumour in Children and Adolescent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two different situations will be considered: - in NSMGCT patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the objective is to maintain a 2-year progression-free survival rate &gt;80% despite a limitation of the number of course of chemotherapy (≤4) after the achievement of a clinical and biological response (primary endpoint); - in children over 10 years with testicular or extragonadal NSMGCT, the objective is to improve the overall survival by systematically classifying the patients in high-risk group to allow a dose intensification.</detailed_description>
