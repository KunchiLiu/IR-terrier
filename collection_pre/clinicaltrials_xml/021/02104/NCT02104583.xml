	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the effect of eleclazine (GS-6615) compared to placebo on the overall occurrence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions (antitachycardia pacing [ATP] or shock) in adults with ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key Have an ICD or CRTD implanted for primary or secondary prevention and at least one ICD intervention for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) [shock or ATP] within 60 days prior to screening or a documented VT/VF episode (prior to implantation) within 60 days prior to screening Use of highly effective contraception methods if female of childbearing potential or sexually active male Must be hemodynamically stable Key New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 4 weeks prior to screening or during the screening period before randomization Hemodynamically significant primary obstructive valvular disease History of congenital heart disease Inherited arrhythmia such as Brugada syndrome. Individuals with long QT syndrome Type 3 (LQT3) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be considered. Individuals who are being considered for cardiac transplantation and are on a cardiac transplant list History of seizures or epilepsy Cardiac ablation within 3 months prior to screening or planned cardiac ablation during the study Severe renal impairment Abnormal liver function tests Currently taking Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic drugs; such medications should be discontinued 5 halflives (or 28 days for chronic use of amiodarone) prior to randomization Currently taking drugs or products that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A; such medications should be discontinued 5 halflives prior to randomization Currently taking ranolazine; Ranolazine should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to Randomization Females who are pregnant or are breastfeeding Individuals with a subcutaneous ICD Body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 36 kg/m^2 Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
