	<brief_summary>This research represents a randomized trial of a program to improve timely postnatal care, comparing post-natal check-ups performed by community health workers delivered either by phone or in person to a control group. The study hypothesis is that when community health workers check on women three days after their delivery we will see improvements in the detection of maternal and child complications, better knowledge of complications and an increase in behaviors that are expected to lead to improved maternal and child health.</brief_summary>
