	<brief_summary>Recently, HDR brachytherapy delivering only a 19 Gy fraction was proposed as exclusive treatment for low and intermediate risk prostate cancers. With a median 3-year follow-up, the Spanish team reported a biochemical control rate of 100% and 87%, respectively, for low risk and intermediate risk tumors. In parallel with these encouraging results regarding biochemical control, the authors described excellent urinary and digestive tolerance, notably the absence of grade &gt; 2 complications. However, it should be noted, in this study, that special protection was provided to the anterior aspect of the rectum by means of a 10 ml transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid into the prostate-rectal interspace. The idea of using a single high dose (in one fraction) was proposed at the MSKCC by the team of Fucks et al. which, in 2008, following a median 18-month follow-up, published a a 90% local control rate for spinal metastases after a single dose at 18 to 24 Gy. The aim of the present study is to analyze acute urinary and digestive toxicity (&lt; 180 days) observed following interstitial high dose rate prostate brachytherapy delivering a total dose of 20 Gy in one fraction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Expected benefit(s) of the trial - Improved quality of life during brachytherapy on account of the absence of radioactive seeds in the prostate: - Fewer early urinary complications, - No urine filtration, - No post-operative use of condoms, - No 2-year ban on cremation following treatment, - Health cost savings, - Acquisition of dosimetric data for inverse optimization. Predictable risk(s) for patients Predictable risks in the context of this trial involve the frequency of essentially urinary disorders. Methodology Open, monocentric, phase I-II study.</detailed_description>
