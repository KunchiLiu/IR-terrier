	<detailed_description>There is currently no product approved for corneal epithelial wound healing. A Phase 1 Study SJP-0035/1-01 was conducted in healthy volunteers to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution and to determine the appropriate dose to be evaluated in patients with moderate to severe corneal epithelial disorders. This Phase 2a study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution in patients to promote corneal epithelial wound healing in conditions associated with corneal epithelial disorders.</detailed_description>
