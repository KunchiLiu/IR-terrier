	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of obesity on the pharmacokinetics of the levonorgestrel (LNG) only emergency contraceptive (EC) regimen and on markers of ovulation Primary hypothesis: 1) Obese users of LNG-EC have a pharmacokinetic profile that is consistent with a larger volume of distribution of LNG. Secondary hypothesis: 1. Alterations in these pharmacokinetic parameters of the LNG-EC regimen in obese women affect the primary mechanism of action, which is inhibition of ovulation. 2. Obesity may affect other factors that alter levels of LNG, such as sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin, which bind LNG and potentially lowers the amount of free LNG.</brief_summary>
