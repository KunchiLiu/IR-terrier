	<brief_summary>The objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of 6 vaccine doses of MVX-ONCO-1, administered sub-cutaneously (injections and capsules implantations), in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumor in progression who are not or not any longer amenable to any standard therapy of their tumour disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MVX-ONCO-1 in Patients With Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endpoints: Primary: To assess safety parameters including adverse and serious adverse events (incidence, causality, severity), local and systemic tolerance to the administered study treatment, changes in laboratory values and vital signs in patients with solid tumor; Secondary: to measure some tumor responses in using imaging technique, serological tumor markers, immune monitoring and metabolic monitoring.</detailed_description>

Life expectancy: estimate of at least 4 months. Have participated in any other investigational study or received an experimental therapeutic procedure considered to interfere with the study in the 4 preceding weeks. Have received any chemotherapy treatment in the 4 preceding weeks. Serious concomitant health condition such as organ transplant requiring immunosuppressive drugs, severe psychiatric disorders.

Patient with a systemic disease other than cancer, that is not controlled by usual medication. Therapeutic anticoagulation with coumarine or continues iv heparin. Lowmolecular weight heparin (LMWH) is permitted as long as treatment can be withheld several hours prior to subcutaneous implantation.
