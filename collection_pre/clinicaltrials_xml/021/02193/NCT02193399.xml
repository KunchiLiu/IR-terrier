	<brief_summary>Research project with patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation in the hematology and hemotherapy Clinical Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca. The main objective is to assess the differences in skeletal muscle and functional variables in the experimental group underwent a physiotherapy treatment that takes place during the pre-and post-transplant period, compared to a control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main characteristics of the study are: - Randomized, prospective and longitudinal in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation clinical trial. - A descriptive study of skeletal muscle characteristics of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for hematologic malignancies before and after carrying out a treatment with stem cells. - Clinical study of the variables of strength, mobility, proprioception and upper and lower pain in patients with hematologic malignancy member before and after cancer treatment. - Clinical study of the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment in clinical characteristics (strength, mobility, proprioception and pain) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. - Clinical study of psychosocial variables that are affected by hematological treatment, and the influence on them of a physiotherapy treatment. The data obtained in this project to identify and treat those functional deficits that appear as a result of cancer treatment and influencing patients, regarding the evolution of the disease and its treatment. They will use different psychosocial questionnaires and functional tests based on scientific evidence and the reliability of these, as well as its specific design for patients with hematologic cancer.</detailed_description>
