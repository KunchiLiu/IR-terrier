	<brief_title>Clinical Trial in Infants With Rapidly Progressive Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder that is caused by a marked decrease or almost complete absence of the LAL enzyme, leading to the accumulation of these lipids, predominately cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in various tissues and cell types. In the liver, accumulation of lipids leads to hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and hepatic failure. In the small intestine, lipid-laden macrophage accumulation in the lamina propria leads to profound malabsorption. LAL Deficiency presenting in infancy is extremely rare form of LAL Deficiency. It is characterized by profound malabsorption, growth failure, and hepatic failure, and is usually fatal in the first 6 months of life. There is currently no safe or effective therapy for the treatment of LAL Deficiency.</detailed_description>
