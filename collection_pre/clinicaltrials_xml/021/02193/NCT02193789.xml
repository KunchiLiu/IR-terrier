	<brief_summary>In patients of subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth-I or Billroth-II anastomosis, Anastomosis site stricture is very severe complication. It can improve by temporary through the scope covered metallic stent. It is very effective procedure about the stricture. But stent migration is very severe complication. Herein the investigators suggest newly method to prevent the stent migration. Fixation of stent by hemoclip is effective method to prevent stent migration. But it is difficult to remove stent after resolved stricture. So the investigators add the suture between hemoclip and stent. And the investigators cut the suture when stent removal.</brief_summary>
