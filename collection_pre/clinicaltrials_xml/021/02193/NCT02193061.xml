	<brief_summary>Assess the immunological behavior of children from 2 months of age that receive one out of seven anti-rotavirus vaccination programs: Group 1 (routine schedule with two doses of RV1 - Rotarix plus sterile water) and Group 2 (routine schedule with three doses of RV5 - RotaTeq) versus Group 3 (one dose of monovalent vaccine followed by two doses of pentavalent vaccine), Group 4 (one dose of pentavalent vaccine followed by two doses of monovalent vaccine), Group 5 (two doses of pentavalent vaccine followed by a dose of monovalent vaccine), Group 6 (one dose of pentavalent vaccine followed by a dose of monovalent vaccine and a dose of pentavalent vaccine), and Group 7 (a dose of monovalent vaccine followed by a dose of pentavalent vaccine and a dose of monovalent vaccine) in children from Mexico City. Secondary objectives - To describe number and features of acute diarrheal disease (ADD) due to rotavirus displayed in the seven prevention schedules. - To describe the adverse events temporarily associated with the seven prevention schedules. Hypotheses The seroconversion percentages and geometric mean titers (GMT) of anti-rotavirus antibodies from Groups 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are not inferior to the seroconversion percentages and the GMTs induced in subjects that received the routine vaccination schedules with two doses of the monovalent vaccine and three doses of the pentavalent vaccine (Groups 1 and 2).</brief_summary>

The parent/tutor can meet the study's requirements, such as attending the programmed visits and filling in the journal. Written informed consent signed by the parent/tutor before any procedure. The subject has a background of serious allergic reaction to any of the vaccine's components. The subject has a digestive tract malformation or acute/chronic disease. The subject has some kind of immunodeficiency including HIV. The subject suffers from a haematooncological disease. The subject has been under treatment with an immunosuppressing medicine including prednisone for two or more weeks. The subject has received gammaglobulin or any other bloodderived product or its administration is programmed during the study.</criteria>
