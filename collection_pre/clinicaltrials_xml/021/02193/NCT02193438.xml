	<brief_summary>Human studies have shown that capsaicin, a compound extracted from chilly peppers, can stimulate certain physiologic functions (for example, energy expenditure, thermogenesis, lipid oxidation, heart rate, etc.). The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of ingesting various spicy molecules on a set of physiologic parameters compared to a placebo. The molecules were selected for their different sensory properties. The results of this study will allow us to implement an effective method for measuring the impact of ingesting spices on certain body functions (for example, metabolism and autonomic nervous system activity). This study will also allow us to identify the beneficial properties of eating certain spices.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective and outcome: The main objective of this study is to establish a methodology to evaluate the acute impact of spice ingestion on metabolism and autonomic nervous system activity. Primary outcomes: Impact of the spice on autonomic nervous system activity: Power spectra analysis on heart rate variability (HRV) changes during the 90 post ingestive minutes (measured by ECG). Impact of the spice on metabolism: Energy expenditure changes during the 90 post ingestive minutes (measured by indirect calorimetry). As secondary outcomes blood pressure changes and facial temperature changes on specific area (nose, cheeks and forehead) will be evaluated. Substrate oxidation (carbohydrates and fat utilization) and the respiratory quotient (RQ) will be calculated using indirect calorimetry data for energy expenditure measure.</detailed_description>
