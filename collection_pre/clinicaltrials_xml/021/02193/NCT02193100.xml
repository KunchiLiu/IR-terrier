	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Leukemia Subjects: Each of the criteria in the following section must be met in order for a patient to be eligible for enrollment. Only patients with clinically diagnosed or histologically diagnosed leukemia will be eligible to participate in this nontherapeutic study. All patients must have measurable quantities of leukemic blasts on peripheral blood detected with a CBC. No history of diabetes for the experimental group or the control group. Patients with known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) are excluded. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Inclusion Criteria forHealthy Subjects: Subjects must have no known prior history of cancer or malignant blood disorders. Where possible, follow up will be carried out to verify that no cancer has developed since the blood collection. This will be done by a phone call performed one month from sample to ask if new medical conditions have arisen. Subjects must have WBC, RBC, and platelet counts within normal range on CBC. Subjects with known hepatitis C or HIV (AIDS) are excluded. No history of Diabetes At least 30 years of age Preferably be fasting for 12 hours (minimum 8 hours) prior to enrollment Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.
