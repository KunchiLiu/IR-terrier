	<brief_summary>Some men develop difficulty passing urine (voiding) as they age. This may be because an enlarged prostate gland (which sits round the base of the bladder) narrows the bladder outlet (urethra) or because the bladder becomes less able to contract. Prostate surgery is more likely to help symptoms in the first group, while the second group may have no improvement after surgery, while being exposed to risk of complications of surgery. Invasive urodynamics involves putting a tube (catheter) into the bladder via the penis, and another into the rectum, to measure bladder and abdominal pressures while the bladder is filled with a sterile fluid. Invasive urodynamics can measure bladder pressures during filling and voiding, and bladder outlet obstruction pressures. The procedure is considered safe, but some men find it uncomfortable or undignified, and a few develop urine infection afterwards. We think that it could be useful to select the men who should and should not have surgery. However, no studies have been conducted so far to tell us if this is true: UPSTREAM is designed to find out if the invasive tests are worthwhile. UPSTREAM is a randomised controlled trial in men who have bothersome difficulty passing urine and who are considering having surgery for the symptoms. The group studied will be men who continue to be bothered by difficulty passing urine, despite initial treatment such as drugs, where symptoms are thought to be due to bladder outlet obstruction. The men will be assigned at random to either invasive urodynamic tests as well as the standard tests ("Invasive urodynamics") or to the routine standard tests ("Usual care" control arm) alone. Routine standard tests include asking men to complete a questionnaire (the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)) and a bladder diary, carrying out flow rate testing, and checking the urine for infection. Some surgeons also use "discretionary tests" such as the PSA cancer-screening blood test. The following men will be invited to participate (inclusion criterion); â€¢ Men considering undergoing surgery as a treatment option for bothersome urinary symptoms Men will not be invited to participate (exclusion criteria) if they: - are unable to pass urine without a catheter (urinary retention) - have a relevant neurological disease, such as a stroke - are undergoing treatment for prostate or bladder cancer - have previously had prostate surgery - are not medically fit for surgery, or are unable to complete outcome assessments - do not consent to be assigned at random to one of the pathways We will compare the two methods of investigation by finding out whether the men had similar relief of their symptoms, by measuring the change in the prostate symptom score (IPSS) in the two groups at 18 months after randomisation. We will also look at the following secondary outcomes: - Whether the invasive tests changed the decision for surgery in some of the men (how many men had surgery in each of the two groups?) - The cost-effectiveness of the two management pathways - Adverse effects of (a) the tests and (b) the treatments at 6, 12 &amp; 18 months (e.g. urinary infection, urinary retention) - Urinary symptoms at 6, 12 &amp; 18 months, using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires (ICIQ) and the Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms questionnaire (ICIQ-MLUTS) - Quality of life, using the ICIQ-QoL questionnaire - Sexual function, using the ICIQ-MLUTS sex questionnaire - Satisfaction with urodynamic testing, using the ICIQ-UDS-S questionnaire - The maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) at 18 months - Health outcomes, using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the UPSTREAM trial is to determine whether a care pathway including invasive urodynamics is no worse for men in terms of symptom outcome than one in which it is not included, at 18 months after randomisation. We will also establish whether inclusion of invasive urodynamics reduces rates of bladder outlet surgery as a main secondary outcome.</detailed_description>
