	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of AZD2014, a novel anticancer agent, in combination with paclitaxel. AZD2014 will be given orally, twice daily at a starting dose of 25 mg per day for 3 days on, 4 days off with a weekly infusion of 80 mg of paclitaxel for 6 weeks followed by a treatment break of one week, therefore each cycle will be 7 weeks long. Cohorts of three patients will be treated at this dose of AZD2014 and then at 50mg and 75 mg providing is it safe to do so. Once we have determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using the 3 days on, 4 days off schedule of AZD2014, patients will be given AZD2014 2 days on, 5 days with their paclitaxel infusion. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of three to evaluate three escalating doses of AZD2014 to determine the MTD for the 2 days on, 5 days off schedule. On completion of the dose escalation phase of the study patients with ovarian cancer and squamous cell lung cancer will be treated at the MTD established for each dosing schedule. A minimum of 10 ovarian cancer patients and 15 squamous cell lung patients will be enrolled to the 3 days on, 4 days off schedule. Whilst a minimum of 10 squamous cell cancer patients will be enrolled to the 2 days on, 5 days off schedule to further assess the tolerability of the combination of AZD2014 and paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial of the Combination of AZD2014 and Weekly Paclitaxel.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, Phase I clinical trial of the combination of AZD2014 and weekly paclitaxel. Two intermittent BD dosing schedules of AZD2014 in combination with paclitaxel will be evaluated. The 3 days on 4 days off schedule will examine 3 continuous days of AZD2014 per week in combination with weekly paclitaxel. The 2 days on 5 days off schedule will examine 2 sequential days of AZD2014 dosing in combination with weekly paclitaxel. For both schedules, a dose escalation 3+3 design will be used to establish the MTD and the recommended Phase II dose. Approximately 15 patients with solid tumours will be entered into each schedule during the dose escalation of this phase. The expansion part of the trial will be used to further assess the tolerability of AZD2014 in combination with weekly paclitaxel. For the 3 days on 4 days off schedule 10 patients with ovarian cancer and 15 patients with squamous lung cancer will be enrolled and treated at the MTD established from the dose escalation phase. Accrual to these expansion arms may commence as soon as the MTD is determined and proceed in parallel with the dose escalation phase of the 2 days on 5 days off schedule. Once the MTD has been determined for the 2 days on 5 days off schedule 15 patients with squamous lung cancer may be enrolled. Determination of the MTD and decision to enter the expansion phase for each schedule will be made by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) taking into consideration the safety data and available PK/PD data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically proven solid tumour.refractory to conventional treatment, or for which no conventional therapy exists or is declined by the patient, or where treatment with paclitaxel is an appropriate treatment option. Patients enrolled in the expansion phase must have recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer only. 2. Patients who have had conventional treatment and where paclitaxel is appropriate. In instances where paclitaxel is appropriate but the patients has not already received it the patient may be enrolled after discussion between the referring oncologist and Principal Investigator. 3. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks 4. ECOG performance status of 01 5. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of childbearing potential or must have evidence of nonchildbearing potential 6. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception i.e., condoms 7. Measurable or evaluable disease. Patients enrolled in the expansion phase should have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria 8. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These measurements must be performed within one week (Day 7 to Day 1) before the patient goes in the trial. Haemoglobin (Hb)≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)≤ 2.5 x (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or ≤ 5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&lt; 5 x ULN Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (uncorrected value)OR Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting glucose ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) ErythrocyteHbA1c ≤ 59 mmol/mol 9. 18 years or over 10.
