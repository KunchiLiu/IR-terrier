	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called Plerixafor. Plerixafor is approved by the US FDA for use in increasing blood stem cell counts before collection in cancer patients. It is not yet approved for patients with sickle cell disease. The investigators want to find out if Plerixafor can be used to increase cell counts in patients with sickle cell disease.</brief_summary>

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an informed consent form. Patients who are: Receiving or received treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to entering the study OR have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier as determined by the treating physician. Patients with ALT(SGPT) &gt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal Patients with a creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 ml/min Patients who have uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to: Ongoing or active infection Emergency room admission or hospitalization in the past 14 days Major surgery in the past 30 days Medical/psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by the treating physician. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding Patients with active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection Patients with poor cardiac function as defined by an ejection fraction &lt; 40% are excluded due to potential poor tolerance of the fluid shifts with leukapheresis (only for patients enrolled on second phase of protocol for Leukapheresis).</criteria>
