	<brief_summary>The inclusion of breakfast cereals enriched with omega-3 for female users of a pharmacy who had some lipidic profiles to the limit is highly conditioned by their nutritional acceptance. The main objective is to assess the effect of breakfast cereals intake with omega-3 on women lipid profile values to the limit, users of a pharmacy in Elche and in this way reduce the small dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Induced by Breakfast Cereals Enriched With Omega-3 in the Lipidic Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators performed an intervention including 133 women (age 25-70 years). Participants were randomly and single-blind distributed into three groups: Group 1 (n=38) consumed cereal with omega-3 (Cw-3 + D), cereal (C) and diet (D), Group 2 (n=38). Volunteers consumed (C) + (D) and Group 3 (n=37) consumed only diet. All groups followed a limit levels-cholesterol diet. Circulating total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were determined at the beginning and end of a 30-day test. Statistical analysis was carried out using STATGRAPHICS Centurion XV software (StatPoint Technologies, Inc. Warrington, VA, USA); likewise, significance was defined at p ≤ 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (sem). Intra-group statistical comparisons were performed using the following hypothesis tests, both parametric and non-parametric: t-test, sign test and signed rank test for paired samples. Inter-group statistical comparisons were performed using the one-way analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis tests. Also, Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) Multiple Range Test and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) were used in order to determine which means were significantly different from the others. In addition, Generalized Multiple Regression was used to statistically analyze the relationships between the variations in the lipid profile and the different factors included in the study.</detailed_description>
