	<brief_title>A Retrospective Chart Review of Patients Treated With Ocriplasmin for Symptomatic VMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study (TG-MV-022) is a retrospective study utilizing Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients treated previously with JETREA® for VMA. The objectives of this study are to retrospectively review and further characterize anatomic and symptomatic changes over six months immediately following treatment of VMA with JETREA® (ocriplasmin), including incidence, time to onset and resolution of anatomy and symptoms. The retrospective study will collect Heidelberg Spectralis® SD-OCT images which will be masked and uploaded to a Central Reading Center (CRC) for review and analysis. The CRC will evaluate anatomic endpoints of interest from both baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and all follow-up OCT scans over the 6 month follow up period. Endpoints of interest include ellipsoid zone disruption, development of subretinal fluid, resolution of VMA and macular hole changes. Further, trained clinical personnel at the participating centers will transcribe data from the patients' records, to be entered into the study database.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Must be at least 18 years of age or older. 2. Have been treated with JETREA® for vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) between April 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 with at least six months of follow up visits post injection. Note: If a patient's second eye was treated, only the first eye treated is eligible for study participation. 3. Have been imaged with Heidelberg Spectralis SDOCT at least one time within 30 days prior to JETREA® injection. 4. Have been imaged with Heidelberg Spectralis SDOCT at least two times post JETREA® injection with at least one scan between Days 121 and the second scan within six months,, including a corresponding visual acuity (VA). 5. Be willing and able to provide informed consent. 1. Patients treated with JETREA® for medical conditions outside of the product label. 2. Patients with other retinal conditions that affect the vitreoretinal interface, or can lead to retinal atrophy, including but not limited to: Neovascular agerelated macular degeneration; Fibrovascular scar; Diabetic macular edema; and Proliferative diabetic retinopathy.</criteria>
