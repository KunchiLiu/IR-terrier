	<detailed_description>The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) is one of six recipients of the Permanency Innovations Initiative Grant. These funds support the statewide implementation of Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET) in Illinois. TARGET is a manualized, psycho-educational intervention designed to address complex trauma and difficulties with emotional regulation and relational engagement that occur across a wide range of trauma-related difficulties, including trauma-related and behavioral symptoms. The aim of this intervention is to address the key barriers to permanence for the target population. This population includes youth ages 11-16 who are placed in traditional, relative, and specialized foster homes throughout the state of Illinois, have been in foster care for at least 2 years, and are experiencing mental health challenges and/or at least one placement change. The three key barriers to permanency are: (1) children's need to improve emotional regulation and reduce symptom severity, particularly disruptive behaviors; (2) biological parents' skills in regulating their emotions so they are better able to complete services and address the underlying issues related to their involvement in the child welfare system; (3) foster parents and other placement resources skills in understanding and addressing the needs and disruptive behaviors of the children in their care with trauma histories. The local evaluation will examine the effectiveness of the TARGET program in increasing permanency rates for foster youth in the target population. The main hypothesis to be tested is that addressing unstable child affect &amp; behavior secondary to trauma using an intervention that improves both youth modulation skills as well as foster parent capacity to respond appropriately to youth will stabilize placements and improve youth ability to engage with potential permanency resources, thus facilitating progress toward permanence. The evaluation involves randomly assigning eligible foster youth to receive TARGET services or receive services as usual. The evaluators collect proximal and distal outcomes from multiple administrative data sources. Additionally, the evaluation includes the collection of key proximal outcomes through the use of interviews with foster youth, their foster parents and biological parents deemed eligible for participation in the project.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Youth ages 1116 who are placed in traditional, relative, and specialized foster homes throughout the state of Illinois who, upon reaching the twoyear anniversary of entering care, are experiencing mental health symptoms and/or have had at least one placement change. If a youth does not exhibit any mental health symptoms as indicated by the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strength (CANS) tool, they need to have at least 3 placement changes to be eligible for the study. Youth are ineligible to participate if at the time of eligibility assessment, they are in need of immediate and acute substance abuse treatment, have a Full Scale IQ score below 70, and/or have made recent suicidal threats or plans.</criteria>
