	<brief_summary>To determine minocycline's effects on cognitive performance and measures of mood in abstinent cocaine users. Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative antibiotic that also inhibits microglia activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide (NO) production. Previous animal and human studies suggest that minocycline may have utility as a treatment for cocaine addiction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Minocycline in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are proposing a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. A total of 40 male and or female subject completers will have two 4-day treatment periods, in which they will be randomized to minocycline (200 mg/day) or placebo. During the first 3 days of each treatment period, subjects will have daily clinic visits for medication administration and monitoring of adverse events. On Day 4, subjects will have an experimental session in which measures of mood and cognitive performance will be obtained. Following a washout period, ranging from 5 to 15 days, subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment. This study began July 2013; currently 7 subjects were randomized with 5 completers and two drop outs. This study is active with recruitment continuing.</detailed_description>
