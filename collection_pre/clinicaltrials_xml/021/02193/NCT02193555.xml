	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the visual performance of prototype soft contact lens designs compared to a commercially available contact lens</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Performance of Prototype Contact Lens Designs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, participant-masked, randomised, stratified, crossover, bilateral wear, dispensing clinical trial where participants will wear the prototype (test) and the commercial (control) lens. A minimum of an overnight washout period is required between the fitting /assessment visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent. Be at least 7 years old, male or female. Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator. Have ocular health findings considered to be "normal" and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses. Correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better with both eyes with contact lenses. Be suitable and willing to wear contact lenses. Any preexisting ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses. Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves' disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants. Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participant's ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial. NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an "as needed basis", provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.</criteria>
