	<brief_summary>A Phase 1/2a Dose Escalation Study of FF-10501-01 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hematological Malignancies to determine the safety and tolerability. A total of 6 cohorts will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the MTD. Phase 2 will consist of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include subjects with high-risk MDS/CMML who have relapsed or are refractory to prior therapy; Cohort 2 will include subjects with AML who have relapsed or are refractory to prior therapy or are ≥ 60 hears of age and not candidates for other therapies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive FF-10501-01 orally on a twice daily schedule for 14 days repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle). Disease assessments, including analysis of blood and bone marrow aspirates, will be performed at the end of Cycle 1 and every 2 cycles thereafter. Subjects who demonstrate objective response or stable disease will be allowed to continue therapy with FF-10501-01 until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent illness or changes in condition that prevent further study participation.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Confirmed advanced hematologic malignancies; Highrisk MDS/CMML (defined as ≥ 10% peripheral blood or marrow blasts and/or IPSS score ≥ 1.5) and relapsed or refractory to prior therapy AML relapsed or refractory to prior therapy, or ≥ 60 years of age and not a candidate for other therapies At least 3 weeks beyond the last chemotherapy, targeted anticancer agent, major surgery or experimental treatment and recovered from all acute toxicities (≤ Grade 1). Hydroxyurea used to control peripheral blast counts is permitted up to Day 7 of treatment on study. Adequate performance status: ECOG ≤ 2; Adequate renal and hepatic function: creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL, or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min total bilirubin ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT/AST ≤ 2 times ULN Negative serum pregnancy test Ability to provide written informed consent Known history of coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia or any other type of heart disease present within the last 6 months Known family history of hereditary heart disease QT interval corrected for rate (QTc) &gt; 450 msec on the electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at Screening Concomitant medication(s) that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes, with the exception of antimicrobials that are used as standard of care to prevent or treat infections and other such drugs that are considered by the Investigator to be essential for the care of the patient. Presence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. Subjects adequately treated for CNS leukemia documented by 2 consecutive cerebrospinal fluid samples negative for leukemia cells are eligible. Subjects with no history of CNS leukemia will not be required to undergo cerebrospinal fluid sampling for eligibility. Known positive for HIV, hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Active infection requiring IV antiinfective usage within the last 7 days prior to study treatment. Any other medical intervention or condition which could compromise adherence to study requirements or confound the interpretation of study results. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Treatment with any investigational product within 28 days prior to Screening.</criteria>
