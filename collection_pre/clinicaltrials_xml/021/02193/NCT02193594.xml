	<brief_summary>Preoperative chemoradiotherapy(CRT) had been introduced in the comprehensive treatment of gastroesophageal junction and upper gastric cancers in the decade.According to some researches,CRT had shown its good curative effects in local control and prolonged overall survival.However,the optimization scheme for CRT and its influence to surgery remains controversial.Meanwhile,there were many design flaws in the past few research,such as the lack of adjuvant chemotherapy,the insufficiency in lymphnodes dissection.We decided to carry out the trial,eliminating all the bias as far as we can,to illustrate the efficacy and safety of CRT.</brief_summary>
