	<brief_summary>A prospective exploratory study in patients with drug resistant epilepsy with a target comparison of long term outcome. NeuroScan software modules and a MagLink will be used to acquire EEG in combination with MRI/fMRI data. The MagLink system is used for obtaining integrated EEG and Event Related Potential (ERP) recordings while the subject is inside the MRI machine, without compromising the raw EEG data.</brief_summary>
