	<brief_summary>- Study objectives 1. To compare the safety and long-term efficacy of coronary stenting with biostable polymer everolimus-eluting coronary stent system (Promus PremierTM) with biodegradable polymer biolimus-eluting coronary stent system (Biomatrix®, Biomatrix Flex® and Nobori®) in patients with acute coronary syndrome 2. To compare the efficacy and safety of 5 mg prasugrel maintenance therapy compared with 10 mg prasugrel maintenance therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention - Study design : Prospective, open-label, 2-by-2 multifactorial, randomized, multicenter trial to test the following in CHD patients 1. Non-inferiority of biostable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Promus PremierTM) compared with biodegradable polymer biolimus-eluting coronary stent system (Biomatrix®,Biomatrix Flex® and Nobori®) in terms of patient-oriented composite outcome 2. Non-inferiority of 5 mg compared to 10 mg dose of prasugrel maintenance in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for Treatment of Coronary Artery Diseases III Trial - Comparison of REDUCTION of PrasugrEl Dose &amp; POLYmer TECHnology in ACS Patients (HOST III Trial - REDUCE POLYTECH RCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 3400 patients derived from a population of Korean patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving percutaneous coronary intervention will be enrolled in the present trial. All patients will receive a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg bolus) will be administered.Following angiography, patients with significant diameter stenosis &gt;50% of coronary artery or graft vessel by visual estimation that have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and have lesions that are eligible for coronary intervention without any exclusion criteria, will be randomized 1:1 to either receive either Promus Premier or Biomatrix® Biomatrix Flex® or Nobori®. At 1-month clinical follow-up, patients eligible for antiplatelet comparison will be additionally randomized 1:1 to either receive the reduce dose of prasugrel (5 mg daily) or conventional dose (10 mg daily). The exclusion criteria (age ≥75 years, body weight &lt;60 kg, or history of TIA or stroke) is classified as observational cohort. Post-PCI, dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 1 year. Follow-up data will be collected until 3-year after index procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be ≥ 18 years Subject is able to verbally confirm understandings of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving PCI and he/she or his/her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. Subject must have a culprit lesion in a native coronary artery with significant stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate) eligible for stent implantation Subject must have clinical diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome Following patients will be enrolled in stent comparison, but excluded from antiplatelet comparison. They will be classified as observational cohort. Subjects ≥75 years Body weight &lt;60 kg History of TIA or stroke The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin, Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor, Biolimus, Everolimus, Contrast media (Patients with documented sensitivity to contrast media which can be effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be enrolled. Those with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be enrolled.) Patients with active pathologic bleeding Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery within 2 months. Systemic (intravenous) Biolimus, or everolimus use within 12 months. Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study. History of bleeding diathesis, known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment).</criteria>
