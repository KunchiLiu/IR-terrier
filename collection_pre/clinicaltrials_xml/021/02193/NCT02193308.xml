Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial (especially unspecific inducing agents like St.John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or inhibitors like cimetidine) or that prolong the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial 12. Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day) 13.

Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site 20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms) 21. A history of additional risk factors for Torsade des Pointes (e.g., heart failure, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) 22. Any history of relevant low blood pressure 23. Supine blood pressure at screening of systolic &lt;110 mm Hg and diastolic &lt;60 mm Hg 24. History of urticaria 25. History of angioneurotic edema 26.

Females, who have not a vasectomised partner, are not sexually abstinent or surgically sterile will be asked to additionally use barrier contraception methods (e.g. condom, diaphragm with spermicide) 28.
