	<brief_summary>The aims of the study are to better understand how upper extremity injury and immobilization influences a patient's steering ability. Patients with acute distal radius fractures treated with surgery will be recruited for study in a driving simulator. The results will hopefully assist physicians to better counsel patients with upper extremity injuries on when it is safe to return to driving.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Upper Extremity Immobilization and Use of a Steering Wheel Spinner Knob Following Distal Radius Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability of an injured person to safely drive an automobile while immobilized in an upper extremity cast or splint is not well defined. The aims of the study are to better understand how upper extremity injury and immobilization influences a patient's steering ability. The secondary aim is to further evaluate the effectiveness of a steering wheel spinner-knob to assist with one-handed driving. A steering wheel spinner knob may be a surrogate to assist with one handed driving while immobilized.</detailed_description>
