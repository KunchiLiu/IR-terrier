	<brief_summary>Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion policy in adult patients admitted with Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (AUGIB) in order to inform the design of a definitive phase III randomised controlled trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial overview: TRIGGER is a pragmatic trial aiming to recruit adult patients admitted with all cause AUGIB (non-variceal and variceal). The study will take place in six United Kingdon hospitals and they will be randomly allocated to a transfusion policy at the cluster level; three sites will be allocated to a restrictive transfusion policy and three to a liberal transfusion policy. Given the challenges that will be involved in early recruitment and cross-speciality care, a feasibility study is essential to determine whether a sufficient proportion of eligible patients can be recruited into the trial and that clinicians can adhere to the allocated transfusion policy. Recruitment will operate for 6 months in total. The investigators will compare recruitment rate, protocol adherence, clinical characteristics of patients recruited, exposure to RBC transfusions and the difference in Hb concentrations between the restrictive and liberal transfusion policies. The investigators will collect important clinical outcomes which the investigators anticipate being central to the phase III trial, including 28-day mortality, further bleeding rates and serious adverse events between the restrictive and liberal transfusion policies. The investigators will also collect data to enable us to plan a health economic evaluation and quality of life assessment for the phase III trial.</detailed_description>
