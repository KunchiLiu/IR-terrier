	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies if cells donated by a close genetic relative can help keep acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from coming back after standard chemotherapy induces a complete remission. Blood cells obtained from a donor include a variety of blood cells that may trigger the patient's immune system to react against AML cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AML Therapy With Irradiated Allogeneic Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Toxicity of haploidentical allogeneic cellular therapy in patients in complete remission (CR) (or CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) after induction chemotherapy with fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)-cytarabine. II. Efficacy of haploidentical allogeneic cellular therapy in patients in CR (or CRp) after induction chemotherapy with fludarabine-cytarabine (remission rates at 6, 12, 18, 24 months). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Immunologic parameters before and after haploidentical therapy: host anti-leukemia T cells; host regulatory T cells. OUTLINE: INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once daily (QD) for 5 days and cytarabine IV over 4 hours for 5 days. Treatment may continue for 1 or 2 courses at the discretion of the treating physician. ALLOGENEIC CELLULAR THERAPY: Patients undergo irradiated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) of 3 x 10^8 cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ cells/kg at 8 weeks. Patients with stable disease may repeat irradiated DLI every 8-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
