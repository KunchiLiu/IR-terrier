	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether a community-based salt reduction program can reduce average salt consumption levels. Baseline levels of salt consumption were measured in 2011, the salt reduction program was then implemented, and now in 2014 investigators are remeasuring salt consumption levels in the community. The hypothesis investigators are testing is that the salt reduction program will have led to a change in salt consumption levels between 2011 and 2014. The study is being done in Lithgow, a regional town in New South Wales , Australia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this project is to determine whether there have been changes in average salt consumption levels in the Lithgow population from 2011 to 2014. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that there will be no difference between the mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion levels between 2011 and 2014. The sample of 419 individuals with 24-hour urine samples in the baseline survey and 600 individuals in the follow-up survey will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.7 g/day salt between the mean levels of excretion before and after the intervention. There will be more than 95% power to detect a difference of 1.0 g/day salt or greater.</detailed_description>
