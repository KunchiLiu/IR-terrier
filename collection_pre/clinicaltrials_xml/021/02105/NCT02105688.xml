	<brief_summary>This is a 2-part study. The purpose of Part A is to assess the efficacy and safety of grazoprevir (MK-5172) 100 mg in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) 50 mg for 12 weeks in the treatment of chronic HCV GT1, GT4, or GT6 infection in treatment-naïve participants who are on opiate substitution therapy (OST). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants who receive grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination (FDC) in the Immediate Treatment Arm and achieve a Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy (SVR12) will be superior to 67%. In addition, participants who received at least 1 dose of grazoprevir/elbasvir in Part A will be eligible to participate in Part B, which is a 3-year observational follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented chronic HCV GT1, GT4, or GT6 infection with no evidence of GT2, GT3, GT5 or nontypeable genotypes and HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) confirmed by screening lab results prior to randomization On opiate substitution therapy (OST; methadone, levamethadone, buprenorphine, naloxone, naltrexone) for at least 3 months prior to screening Treatment naïve to all HCV therapies Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)infected participants enrolled in this study must meet following criteria: Documented HIV infection Naïve to treatment with any antiretroviral therapy (ART) OR on HIV ART for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry using a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of tenofovir or abacavir and either emtricitabine or lamivudine PLUS raltegravir (or dolutegravir or rilpivirine). Dose modifications or changes in ART during the 4 weeks prior to study entry (Day 1) are not permitted Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) Tcell count &gt;200 cells/mm^3 if on ART or &gt;500 cell/mm^3 if ART treatment naïve Undetectable plasma HIV1 RNA at least 8 weeks prior to screening if on ART or &lt;50,000 copies/mL if ART treatment naïve Participants with HIV1 infection and on ART must have at least one viable antiretroviral regimen alternative beyond their current regimen in the event of HIV virologic failure or the development of antiretroviral drug resistance Females who are of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving study drug and for 14 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following: (1) practice abstinence from heterosexual activity OR (2) use (or have her partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity Evidence of decompensated liver disease For participants with cirrhosis, participants who are ChildPugh Class B or C or who have a PughTurcotte (CPT) score &gt;6 Is coinfected with hepatitis B virus Has cirrhosis and liver imaging within 6 months of Day 1 showing evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or is under evaluation for HCC Currently using or intends to use barbiturates during the treatment period of this study Is a female and is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or donate eggs from Day 1 or anytime during treatment, and 14 days after the last dose of study medication, or longer if dictated by local regulations Any medical condition requiring or likely to require chronic systemic administration of corticosteroids, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonists, or other immunosuppressant drugs during the course of the trial Evidence or history of chronic hepatitis not caused by HCV</criteria>
