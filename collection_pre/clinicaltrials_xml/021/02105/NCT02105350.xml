	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study (an early study to check the safety of a new drug or drug combination) to find the safest and most tolerated dose of the combination of oxaliplatin with gemcitabine and MEK 162 in patients with biliary cancer (including gallbladder cancers and cancers associated with the bile ducts leading from the gallbladder and to and from the liver) that is not curable by surgery and/or has spread beyond the biliary tree (place where cancer started). Everyone will receive the same standard doses of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine but may receive different doses of MEK 162. MEK 162 is a new drug which plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and has been shown to shrink tumours in patients with biliary cancer and other types of human cancers. This type of drug has also been shown to shrink tumours when given in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine in research studies done in animals and in some patients with biliary cancer.</brief_summary>
