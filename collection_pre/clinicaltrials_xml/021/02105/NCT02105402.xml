	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to carry out a high-level treatment efficacy study on children with speech sound disorders with motor speech involvement (SSD-MSI) using a well-controlled Randomized Controlled Trial design. The intervention of choice is the Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets (PROMPT) approach, which has been effective in treating motor speech disorders in adults and in children with autism and cerebral palsy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The results of this study will allow us to determine if there is a causal relationship between PROMPT treatment and outcome measures and predict how much improvement can be expected from this therapy. This study is being conducted as a part of a multicenter clinical trial in the province of Ontario, Canada with three sites: The John McGivney Children's Centre in Windsor, The ErinoakKids Centre for Treatment and Development in Mississauga, and The Speech and Stuttering Institute in Toronto. The study integrity will be monitored by an arms-length, external agency, The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The study is coordinated by the Department of Speech-Language Pathology at the University of Toronto and funded by the PROMPT Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</detailed_description>
