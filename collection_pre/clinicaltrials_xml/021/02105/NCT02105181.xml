	<brief_summary>Endoscopic treatment of benign biliary strictures can be challenging. Balloon dilation and/or plastic stent placement are currently the most popular techniques. Partially covered self-expandable metallic stents have also shown to be effective but can be difficult to remove. A novel fully covered metallic stent has recently been developed. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the placement of fully covered self-expandable metallic stents (FCSEMS) in this setting.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After inclusion, an endoscopic procedure (ERCP) was performed in all patients in order to place a FCMS across the benign biliary stricture. The FCMS was left in place for 6 months and then extracted during a second ERCP procedure. An opacification was performed to assess the efficacy of stenting. Patients were followed up during one year after FCMS extraction.</detailed_description>
