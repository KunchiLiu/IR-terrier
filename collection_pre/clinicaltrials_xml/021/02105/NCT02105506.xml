	<brief_summary>Rationale: The construction of esophageal anastomoses is associated with considerable risk at postoperative anastomotic leakage. Application of TachoSil®, a tissue sealant with human fibrinogen and thrombin, can improve strength of the esophageal anastomosis and potentially prevent anastomotic leakage. Objective: Evaluation of feasibility and safety of TachoSil® application on esophageal anastomoses. Study design: Non-randomized, non-blinded, single-center intervention study. Study population: Patients, 18-80 years old, undergoing an elective total gastrectomy with an esophago-jejunostomy or esophagectomy with a planned esophagogastric anastomosis will be enrolled. A total number of 15 patients will be included in the study. Intervention: Gastric or esophageal resection will be executed according to the common procedures used in the UMC Utrecht. After construction of the esophageal anastomosis, all enrolled participants will receive a TachoSil® patch, which will be applied on the esophageal anastomosis intra-operatively. Hence, TachoSil® is used as an add-on therapy. TachoSil® will be degraded enzymatically in a period of approximately 24 weeks after application. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is feasibility, which is assessed by evaluation of adherence of the patch. A time-action analysis of the application of the Tachosil patch will be performed. Nature and extent of the burden associated with participation: The burden for the patient is minimal. The total surgical procedure will be prolonged with 10-15 minutes. Postoperative care and outpatient visits do not differ from regular protocol. TachoSil® is approved and registered for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote tissue sealing by the European Commission.</brief_summary>
