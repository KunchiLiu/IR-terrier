	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation Among Adults and Older Children With Unilateral or Asymmetric Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral hearing loss is known to impair binaural hearing abilities. Specifically, localization, speech understanding in noise, and binaural squelch suffer due to lack of binaural timing and level cues. This study is designed to examine how binaural hearing is improved following cochlear implantation on the impaired side. The study endpoints are collected at 6 months and 12 months post activation of the implant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults 18 years of age or older, Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted must such that speech understanding is not possible with a well fitted hearing aid. Specifically, less than 40% monosyllabic word understanding when that ear is tested in the bestaided condition and the other ear is sufficiently occluded or masked. Onset of hearing loss in the adult group must be within the past two years for the ear to be implanted. Children Children 7 years of age and older Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted configured such that word understanding is less 40% in the best aided condition Onset of hearing loss recent within the past two years, and that occurred after the critical period of auditory development; the third year of life (Sharma et al., 2005).</criteria>
