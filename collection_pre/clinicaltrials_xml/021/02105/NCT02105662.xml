	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of grazoprevir (MK-5172) 100 mg in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) 50 mg in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in participants who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants who receive grazoprevir + elbasvir and achieve Sustained Virologic Response after 12 weeks of therapy (SVR12) will be greater than 70%.</brief_summary>
