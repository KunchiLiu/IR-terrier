	<brief_summary>In recent years, several studies revealed that the current influenza vaccine strategy might be of minimal vaccine effectiveness and had a smaller effect on reducing morbidity and mortality in the end-stage renal disease population than previously thought. Thus, this also raised the question about the effectiveness of administration of influenza vaccination in chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis. In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine, formulation 2013-2014, in patients with different stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect and Safety of the Seasonal Trivalent Influenza Vaccine in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Not on Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three influenza vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine, as measured by the method of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and ELISA-based microneutralization (microNT-ELISA) assays. All participants will be divided into 3 groups: participants refused to receive vaccination, those receive either one (week 0) or one more booster vaccination (week 0 and week 4). The investigators will collect serum of participants at the 5th weeks, 9th weeks, and 21th week post vaccination and evaluate the difference of immune response in these 3 groups.</detailed_description>
