	<brief_summary>Intraoperative intravenous fluid management practice varies greatly between anesthesiologists. Postoperative fluid based weight gain is associated with major morbidity. Postoperative respiratory complications are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and hospital costs. The literature shows conflicting data regarding intraoperative fluid resuscitation volume. No large-scale studies have focused on intraoperative fluid management and postoperative respiratory dysfunction. Hypotheses: Primary - Liberal intraoperative fluid resuscitation is associated with an increased risk of 30 day mortality Secondary - Liberal intraoperative fluid resuscitation is associated with increased likelihood of postoperative respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, reintubation, atelectasis, acute kidney injury and peri-extubation oxygen desaturation.</brief_summary>
