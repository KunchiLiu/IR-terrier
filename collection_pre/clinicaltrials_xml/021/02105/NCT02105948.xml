	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial evaluating mepolizumab 100 mg against placebo given every 4 weeks through subcutaneous (SC) injection. In severe COPD patients, sputum eosinophils levels are elevated similar as those seen in severe asthmatics. It is hypothesized that the reduction of eosinophils with mepolizumab in COPD patients would translate into a reduction of COPD exacerbations. The study will determine the reduction in exacerbations in subjects who are above and below the baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microlitres. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab on the frequency of moderate and severe exacerbations in COPD subjects at high risk of exacerbations, despite the use of optimized standard of care background therapy. Overall in this study, a total of 800 subjects will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or mepolizumab (100 milligram (mg)) administered SC. The total duration of this study will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a 1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week treatment period and 8-week follow-up period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>COPD diagnosis: Subjects with a clinically documented history of COPD for at least 1 year in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Severity of COPD: Subjects must present with the following: a measured pre and postsalbutamol Forced expiratory volume in one second/ Forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 at Visit 1 to confirm the diagnosis of COPD; a measured postsalbutamol FEV1&gt;20 percent and &lt;=80 percent of predicted normal values calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations at Visit 1. History of exacerbations: A well documented history (like medical record verification) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 of: at least two moderate COPD exacerbations. Moderate is defined as the use of systemic corticosteroids (IM, intravenous, or oral) and/or treatment with antibiotics, or at least one severe COPD exacerbation. Severe is defined as having required hospitalization. Note: At least one exacerbation must have occurred while the subject was taking Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long acting beta2agonist (LABA) plus long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Note: Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as a moderate exacerbation unless the use was specifically for the treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD. Concomitant COPD therapy: A well documented requirement for optimized standard of care (SoC) background therapy that includes ICS plus 2 additional COPD medications (i.e., triple therapy) for the 12 months prior to Visit 1 and meets the following criteria: Immediately prior to Visit 1, minimum of 3 months of use of an inhaled corticosteroid (at a dose &gt;=500 micrograms (mcg)/day fluticasone propionate dose equivalent plus); or LABA and LAMA. For subjects who are not continually maintained on ICS plus LABA plus LAMA for the entire 12 months prior to Visit 1 use of following is allowed (but not in the 3 months immediately prior to Visit 1): inhaled corticosteroid at a dose &gt;=500 mcg/day fluticasone propionate dose equivalent plus ; a LABA or a LAMA and use of at least one other class of COPD medication suggested by the 2013 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for patients who are prone to exacerbation (i.e., phosphodiesterase4inhibitors, methylxanthines, or a combination of short acting beta2agonist and short acting muscarinic antagonist). Note: Subjects must be willing to stay on their SoC COPD medication for the duration of the study. Informed Consent: Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in the study, which will include the ability to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Subjects must be able to read, comprehend, and write at a level sufficient to complete study related materials. Gender: Male or Eligible Female; To be eligible for entry into the study females of child bearing potential must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control from the time of consent, for the duration of the trial, and for 4 months after last study drug administration. Age: At least 40 years of age at Visit 1. Smoking status: Subject with confirmed COPD are eligible to participate independent of their smoking status and smoking history, i.e. current smokers, never smokers or exsmokers can be enrolled into the study; Current smokers are defined as those with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 packyears [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]; Former smokers are defined as those who meet the definition of a current smoker but have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1; Never smokers are those that do not meet the definition of a current or former smoker. French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Subjects having Asthma: Current and Former Smokers: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma (those with a prior history are eligible if they meet inclusion criteria for a current diagnosis of COPD); NeverSmokers: Subjects with any history of asthma; Other respiratory disorders: The investigator must judge that COPD is the primary diagnosis accounting for the clinical manifestations of the lung disease. Subjects with alpha1antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD are excluded. Also, excluded are subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases. Subjects are also excluded if maintenance use of bilevel positive airway pressure is required for the treatment of respiratory disorder. COPD stability: Subjects with pneumonia, exacerbation, lower respiratory infection within the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Lung resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1. Pulmonary rehabilitation program: Participation in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program are not excluded. Oxygen: Subjects receiving treatment with oxygen more than 4.0 Litres/minute (L/min). While breathing supplemental oxygen, subjects should demonstrate an oxyhemoglobin saturation greater than or equal to 89 percent. 12lead Electrocardiography (ECG) finding: An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12lead ECG conducted at Visit 1 if considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator. 12lead ECGs will be overread by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in consistent evaluation of subject eligibility. Results from the 12lead ECG overread must be received prior to assessing eligibility at Visit 2. Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: Subjects with any of the following would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months ; Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Heart failure. Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with (historical or) current evidence of clinically significant, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. Eosinophilic disease: Subjects with other conditions that could lead to elevated eosinophils such as Hypereosinophilic syndromes including Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA, also known as ChurgStrauss Syndrome), or Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Parasitic infection: Subjects with a preexisting helminthes infestation within 6 months prior to Visit 1 are also excluded.

Subjects with a QT interval corrected with Fridericia's formulas (QTcF)&gt;=450 msec are not eligible. For subjects with a QRS interval &gt;=120 msec, those with QTcF&gt;=480 msec are not eligible. Specific ECG findings that preclude subject eligibility are listed in the protocol. Abnormal chest Xray (or Computerized Tomography [CT scan]): No chest Xray (or CT scan) that reveals evidence of clinically significant abnormalities other than those believed to be due to the presence of COPD. If a chest Xray or CT scan is not available within 6 months prior to Visit 1, then a chest Xray must be taken at Visit 1 and the results reviewed prior to randomization. For sites in Germany: If a chest Xray (or CT scan) within 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, the subject will not be eligible for the study. Laboratory abnormality: No evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the haematological, biochemical, or urinalysis screen at Visit 1, as judged by the investigator.
