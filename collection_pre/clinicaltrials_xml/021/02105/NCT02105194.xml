	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy and SPECT Brain Imaging in Cerebral Decompression Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECT brain imaging has been shown to be the most sensitive imaging modality for cerebral decompression illness. This study is a retrospective review of the PI's experience using SPECT brain imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of all phases of cerebral decompression illness over the past two decades. The purpose of the study is to see if the functional imaging is consistent with the clinical condition and cognitive testing. Chart review of symptoms, and physical exam findings will be compared before and after treatment to SPECT brain imaging radiological readings to assess concordance.</detailed_description>
