	<brief_summary>This is an efficacy and safety study of grazoprevir (MK-5172) in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) with or without ribavirin (RBV) in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1, 4, or 6 infections who have failed prior therapy with pegylated interferon and RBV. The primary study hypothesis is that in at least one of the study arms, the percentage of participants achieving sustained viral response 12 weeks after the end of all study treatment (SVR12) will be superior to 58%.</brief_summary>
