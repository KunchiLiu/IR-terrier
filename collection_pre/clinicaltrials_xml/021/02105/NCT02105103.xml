	<brief_summary>Accu-Chek® Insight Insulin Pump EU Study is a Multicenter Study to evaluate the Accu-Chek® Insight Insulin Pump in routine practice. This is an open-label, prospective, multinational, multicenter study evaluating the CSII therapy with the Accu-Chek Insight Insulin pump in routine practice in adult subjects with Type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Subjects must have been on intensive insulin therapy for at least six months i.e. either on CSII or MDI. All subjects will receive training in the preparation, programming and daily use of the Accu-Chek Insight Insulin pump. In addition, subjects previously on MDI may receive more training in order to be comfortable with the use of an insulin pump. The study will be conducted in 10-12 sites in Austria, France and the United Kingdom. A total of 80-95 subjects will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>
