	<brief_summary>The investigators want to determine how much the skin on the back can move left to right of the midline and also up and down, in subjects presenting for procedure or in healthy volunteers. The investigators will do measurements on the back using samples of individuals in all age groups. It is hypothesized that an explanation to late epidural failure could be related to excess back motion in individual subjects.</brief_summary>
