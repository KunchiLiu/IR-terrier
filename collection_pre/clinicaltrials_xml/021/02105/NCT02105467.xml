	<brief_summary>This was an efficacy and safety study of grazoprevir (MK-5172) in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) in treatment-naive participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1, 4, or 6 infection. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1 ratio) to immediate treatment or deferred treatment (placebo control). The primary efficacy hypothesis was that the proportion of participants receiving combination therapy in the Immediate Treatment Arm who achieve sustained viral response at 12 weeks after the end of study treatment (SVR12) is superior to 73%.</brief_summary>
