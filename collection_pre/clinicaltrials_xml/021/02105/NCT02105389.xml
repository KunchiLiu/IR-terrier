	<brief_summary>Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a major problem in children, adolescents and adults receiving treatment for cancer, and intensively treated patients may be at higher risk. While exercise is an effective intervention for CRF, patients receiving the most intensive chemotherapy may frequently be too ill to participate in a standardized exercise program. A unique intervention that combines exercise and relaxation is yoga. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of three times weekly yoga sessions administered by a trained yoga instructor for a three week duration and will enroll between 10 and 20 children. If feasible, the intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
