	<brief_summary>Autonomic nervous system contributes to the regulation of renal blood flow, affected by upright posture. Kidney transplantation implies sympathetic denervation. The aim of this study is to compare the renal vascular response in volunteers and renal graft recipients to an orthostatic stress induced by a head-up tilt test. Renal peripheral resistances are assessed by echo Doppler. The sympathetic nervous system activity is evaluated by plasma concentrations of catecholamine before and after the head-up tilt test.</brief_summary>
