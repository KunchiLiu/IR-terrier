	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial compares vigorous or moderate exercise in enhancing active surveillance in patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. Active surveillance involves watching the patient's condition but not giving any treatment unless test results show that the patient's condition is getting worse. Exercise may improve fitness, quality of life, brain health, and blood biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance. It is not yet known whether vigorous or moderate exercise works better in enhancing active surveillance in patients with localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vigorous or Moderate Exercise in Enhancing Active Surveillance in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of performing vigorous intensity aerobic exercise using progressive, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with standard stationary cycling and 'cybercycling' compared to moderate intensity aerobic exercise with standard stationary cycling in prostate cancer (PCa) survivors on active surveillance (AS). II. To explore the potential effects of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (HIIT) using standard cycling and 'cybercycling' compared to moderate intensity standard cycling on changes in quality of life (QoL), cognition, fitness circulating inflammatory biomarkers and PCa-specific markers of progression (prostate specific antigen [PSA], time to AT) in PCa survivors in active surveillance (AS); and, to explore if these effects may be mediated by changes in body fat. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I: Patients perform moderate intensity exercise on a stationary bike for 20-50 minutes, three days a week for 16 weeks. ARM II: Patients perform HIIT exercise on a standard stationary bike, three days a week for 16 weeks. ARM III: Patients perform HIIT exercise on a cybercycle using racing or other games, three days a week for 16 weeks. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
