	<brief_summary>The aim of the investigators' project is to determine if patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of heart failure to Sanford Health facilities in regional southeastern South Dakota demonstrate benefits in improvement in functional capacity, quality of life, and a reduction in hospital readmission rates from a cardiac rehab program immediately following a discharge for an acute decompensated heart failure diagnosis related inpatient hospitalization encounter. The investigators hypothesize that those that receive cardiac rehab will have improved quality of life and reduced readmission rates at 30 and 90 days.</brief_summary>
