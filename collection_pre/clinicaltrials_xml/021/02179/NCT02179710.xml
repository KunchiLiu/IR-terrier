	<brief_summary>Real-world adherence to inhaled and oral therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients remains discouragingly low, ranging between 31-53% for inhaled antibiotics and 41-72% for hypertonic saline. Programs to enhance adherence, including comprehensive behavioral interventions with adolescents, have met with mixed success. Advances in therapy, treatment delivery systems, and data capture technology offer the potential for enhancing adherence by providing immediate and more frequent feedback to the patient regarding his or her fidelity to the prescribed treatment regimen. We propose to conduct a proof-of-concept study to evaluate a systematic approach to linking treatment and feedback components to enhance adherence.</brief_summary>
