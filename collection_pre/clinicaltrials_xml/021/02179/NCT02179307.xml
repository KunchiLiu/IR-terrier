	<brief_summary>The literature is not clear as to which training volume to employ during initial phases of resistance training programs to ensure optimal muscular adaptations. The purpose of this study is therefore to compare effects of strength training with low versus moderate volume on muscular function and hypertrophy in previously untrained, healthy individuals. Furthermore, the investigators will relate individual variation in responses to proxy markers of individual training state, such as baseline muscular function and muscle fiber type. The study will include 25 women and 25 men and will consist of a 12-week resistance training protocol. Each study participant will act as their own control, performing both the low- (1-set) and the moderate-volume (3-sets) protocol, allocated to either the dominant or non-dominant leg, in a stratified and randomized fashion. Primary outcome measures are thigh muscle cross section area and unilateral knee extension strength. Additionally, muscle fiber type composition will be evaluated as well as additional parameters of muscular function. The primary hypothesis is that low-volume protocols will be beneficial for individuals with glycolytic muscle phenotypes, whereas the opposite will be true for individuals with more aerobic phenotypes.</brief_summary>
