	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to prove whether the use of the SmartGuard feature of the MiniMed system significantly reduces hypoglycemic excursions and thus provide proactive protection to the user.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Hypoglycaemia With Predictive Insulin Suspend Using Sensor Augmented Insulin Pump in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is randomized two-arm parallel controlled open label study that will be conducted at two sites, in Slovenia and Israel. It is an investigator initiated pediatric clinical study. Study will be conducted on pediatric population during two weeks, following a 3 day Run-in period that will allow the patients to get familiar with study device and CGM (SmartGuard OFF). Patients will be asked to continuously wear the study device for 14 days, which will be set up by study staff according to randomization in the specific group. They will be provided with a diary for entering their daily activity, food consumption (carb count) and eventual adverse events.</detailed_description>
