	<brief_title>Brain Imaging, Heart Rate Variability and Serum Fatty Acid in Subjects With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies showed that the gray matter and white matter of the brain related to the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome patients. The investigators study is to analyse the relationship between thickness of cortex of irritable patients, the sympathetic tone and the serum fatty acid component of the irritable bowel syndrome patients. It is to clarify the mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome, whether the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are related to the thickness of cortex or inflammation status of the body.</detailed_description>
