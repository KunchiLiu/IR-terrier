	<criteria>Current diagnosis of primary openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes Qualifying intraocular pressure in at least one eye at Baseline Qualifying corrected ETDRS visual acuity in each eye Qualifying central cornea thickness in each eye Closed/barely open anterior chamber angle or a history of acute angle closure in either eye Diagnosis of primary openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension due to etiology known to be nonresponsive to conventional drug therapy Evidence of advanced glaucoma, visual field defect or progressive visual field loss that that do not meet the study criteria History of ocular surgery specifically intended to lower IOP History of any ocular or systemic abnormality or condition that may put the subject at significant risk, may confound study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study Intended or current use of any ocular medications other than study medications during the study Use of contact lenses within one week prior to Baseline (Day 1) until end of treatment Known allergy or sensitivity to any components of the study medications Use of steroids (systemic) within 30 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening) Anticipate the need to initiate or modify an existing chronic therapy that could substantially affect IOP or the study outcomes during the study period Females who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy</criteria>
