	<brief_summary>In patients with SCD, the use of low dose anticoagulation as an outpatient may lead to a significant decrease in morbidity and as a result, decrease healthcare utilization and costs. This study attempts to critically avoid admissions by reducing daily pain scores and pain crisis as an outpatient by use of a novel oral anticoagulant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There is not only significant morbidity associated with patients with SCD, but also costs associated with the numerous hospitalizations. Small studies have been unable to show clear benefit of the use of low dose anticoagulation in SCD due to limited sample size or the inclusion of very specific populations. However, studies have shown a decrease in the level of elevated prothrombotic markers with anticoagulation, and one study using full dose anticoagulation in patients with a generally milder form of SCD (with high protective hemoglobin) showed more rapid decrease in clinical pain with use of anticoagulation, suggesting a possible benefit of such therapy. Due to the paucity of data to support therapeutic dose LMWH in the more severe forms of SCD seen in the United States, we have chosen prophylactic dose anticoagulation. This study proposal attempts to critically avoid admissions by reducing daily pain scores and pain crisis as an outpatient by use of a novel oral anticoagulant. The development of novel anticoagulants such as oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors allows the realistic use of daily prophylactic dosing as an outpatient. Past studies as detailed earlier have been limited by attempts to use subcutaneous injections or frequent, close monitoring for acenocoumarol treatment, both which are not ideal for chronic daily use. Furthermore, the use of global assays such calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) have shown further details about thrombin generation in a population which is hypercoagulable at baseline. This is a double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled feasibility study with an enrollment target of 60 patients (30 per arm). All subjects that meet inclusion criteria as an outpatient, following a 1 month observation, will be randomized to receive an oral prophylactic dose factor Xa inhibitor (Apixaban 2.5mg po bid) or placebo for 6 months. Subjects will return for a 30 day (+/- 5 days) follow-up visit after the End of Treatment (EOT) visit. Initial randomization will occur by computerized randomization technique by the investigational drug services (IDS) at Duke University Medical Center.</detailed_description>
