	<brief_summary>This study is to examine if inhaled doses of menthol that produce low and high cooling effects change the appeal of e-cigarettes containing low and high doses of nicotine in adolescent smokers. The hypothesis is that the combination of nicotine and menthol, when compared with menthol or nicotine alone, will result in greater increase in liking of an e-cigarette and greater reduction in nicotine withdrawal.</brief_summary>
