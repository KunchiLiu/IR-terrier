	<brief_summary>Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer receive six cycles of chemotherapy(etoposide plus platinum) as first-line treatment,who achieve Complete Response(CR)/Partial Response(PR) will accept small doses of etoposide as maintenance treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the progression free survival,overall survival,objective response rate,disease control rate and safety of etoposide as maintenance therapy. Based on previous studies on maintenance therapy in small cell lung cancer,the hypothesis of this study is maintenance therapy using etoposide may improve progression free survival,overall survival for selected patients. The investigators will use the peripheral blood to assess circulating tumor cell and cell-free DNA,which may help us to screen a subgroup of patients with better response to etoposide maintenance therapy.</brief_summary>
