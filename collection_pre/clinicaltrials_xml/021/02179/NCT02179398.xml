	<brief_summary>Detecting serious bacterial infections (SBI) in children presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with fever without source (FWS) is a frequent diagnostic challenge. The recently described Lab-score, based on the combined determination of Procalcitonin, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and urine dipstick results, has been shown an accurate tool for SBI prediction on retrospective cohorts. The investigators aimed to assess the usefulness of the Lab-score in safely decreasing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in children with FWS, and to prospectively determine the diagnostic characteristics of the Lab-score compared to other classically used SBI biomarkers (white blood cell (WBC) count, band count and CRP).</brief_summary>
