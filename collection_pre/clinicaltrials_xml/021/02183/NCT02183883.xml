	<brief_summary>To assess if targeting activating EGFR and HER2 mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is more effective when these mutations are truncal dominant mutations (≥50%), as opposed to non-dominant (≥5 to &lt;50%) or low frequency mutations (&lt;5%). This trial will only be available to patients registered to the TRACERx study (NCT01888601).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This therapeutic trial is only relevant for patients involved in the TRACERx observational study. Subjects must be willing to have a biopsy of relapsed disease. Consent will be obtained through the TRACERx study. Procurement of the biopsy sample is not necessary at the time of trial registration. However, patients must undergo a biopsy prior to commencement of afatinib. Patients must have tumours harbouring a sensitising EGFR mutation or HER2 mutation in at least one biopsy at recurrence, or region of the primary sample. Written Informed consent for DARWIN1. ECOG performance status 03 No previous exposure to an EGFR TKI. No previous chemotherapy or biological therapy in the advanced setting. Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. At least 18 years of age. Anticipated life expectancy of at least three months. Adequate organ function as defined by the following baseline values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5x109/L Platelets ≥100x109/L Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). In patients with known Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin ≤3xULN with direct bilirubin ≤1.5xULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3xULN or ≤5x ULN if liver metastases are present Creatinine clearance must be ≥30mL/min Women with childbearing potential, or men who are able to father a child, must be willing to practice acceptable methods of birth control during the trial and for 1 month after the end of treatment. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days before the first dose of trial medication. Suitable for radical radiotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to registration. Palliative radiotherapy to a solitary target lesion. Requirement for intravenous feeding, active peptic ulcer, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or any medical comorbidity affecting gastrointestinal absorption. Patients with current or preexisting interstitial lung disease. Significant or recent acute gastrointestinal abnormalities with diarrhoea as a major symptom e.g. Crohn's disease, malabsorption, or CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥3 diarrhoea of any etiology at baseline. Known hypersensitivity to afatinib or to any of the excipients. Patients with rare hereditary conditions of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption Anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or major surgery within 14 days prior to start of trial therapy. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or syphilis infection. Subjects with evidence of hepatitis B virus clearance may be enrolled. History of other malignancy; Exception: (a) Subjects who have been successfully treated and are diseasefree for 3 years, (b) a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer, (c) successfully treated in situ carcinoma, (d) CLL in stable remission, or (e) indolent prostate cancer requiring no or only antihormonal therapy with histologically confirmed tumor lesions that can be clearly differentiated from lung cancer target and nontarget lesions are eligible. The following cardiac abnormalities: Corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥480 msecs History of acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina) within the past 24 weeks Coronary angioplasty, or stenting within the past 24 weeks Class III, or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system History of known arrhythmias (except sinus arrhythmia) within the past 24 weeks Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypertension etc), psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol; or unwillingness or inability to comply with the requirements of the trial, trial protocol or to provide informed consent. Pregnant, lactating or actively breastfeeding females.</criteria>
