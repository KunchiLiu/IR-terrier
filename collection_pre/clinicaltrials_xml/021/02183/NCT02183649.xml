	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial was to investigate the potential effects of pentoxyverine on the ECGs of healthy subjects. A secondary objective was the exploration of safety and tolerability. Pharmacokinetics (PK) were only to be investigated if necessary for the explanation of ECG effects.</brief_summary>

Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 4. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) 5. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders 6. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts. 7. Chronic or relevant acute infections 8. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) 9. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial 10. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial 12. Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day) 13.

Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) 17. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the trial) 18. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 19. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site 20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms); 21. A history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)</criteria>
