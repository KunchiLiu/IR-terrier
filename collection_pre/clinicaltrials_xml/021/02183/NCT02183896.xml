	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of intra-articular injections of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after arthroscopic microfracture.

	<brief_title>Efficacy of PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) Following Arthroscopic Microfracture of Chondral Lesions of the Hip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of intra-articular injections of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after arthroscopic microfracture. Our hypothesis is that platelet-rich plasma will improve patient's clinical outcomes and chondral healing following microfracture performed during femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) hip arthroscopy. This study has two aims: 1. Evaluate clinical efficacy of intra-articular injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) following arthroscopic microfracture. 2. Evaluate if microfracture followed by PRP injections improves chondral healing. Microfracture has shown good results with chondral lesions of the hip. However, microfracture does not regenerate normal hyaline cartilage. There is growing evidence that PRP can improve articular cartilage healing. Injection of PRP following microfracture may help regeneration to normal hyaline like articular cartilage together with soft tissue healing, thereby improving patients' early and long-term outcomes of chondral healing. Patients will be randomized to one of two study arms - microfracture with PRP (treatment arm) and microfracture with saline (control arm) in a 1:1 ratio.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients aged 1850, inclusive. 2. Healthy patients undergoing hip arthroscopy due to FAI. 3. No OA according to XRay, defined by the presence of joint space narrowing, osteophytes, sclerosis and subchondral cysts and surgery observation (Tonnis grade 01). 4. No other influential disabilities in lower limbs, which could alter the postoperative therapy. 5. No chronic use of NSAIDs, steroids, or chemotherapy drugs during the last 6 months before enrollment. 6. Women of childbearing potential will be allowed to enroll but must be willing to practice one highly effective method of contraception (oral, injectable or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine device [IUD] or intrauterine system [IUS] condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, male sterilization, or true abstinence) throughout the study. 7. Intraarticular cartilage lesion grade 2345 of Beck Classification or IIIIV of Outerbridge. 1. Patients with autoimmune concomitant disease(s) that may affect joints, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis and lupus arthritis. 2. Patients with polyarticular disease. 3. Patients with major conditions, such as poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or untreated depression. 4. Patients with blood disorders (thrombopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia with hemoglobin &lt;9g/dL). 5. Patients who had intraarticular treatment with steroids within 6 months of enrollment in this study or received more than 3 previous intraarticular steroid injections to the effected hip. 6. Patients who are pregnant or nursing at the time of consent. 7. NonEnglish speaking patients. (Scores used for evaluation have not been validated in Spanish). 8. Patients who had previous hip surgery. 9. Additional disabilities in any of the lower limbs that would interfere with any of the clinical assessments. 10. Chronic use of NSAIDs (defined as taking NSAID regularly every week for the last 6 months), steroids or chemotherapy drugs. 11. Patients with a BMI over 30. Due to the fact that this study utilizes an injection technique, which may be inaccurate in obese subjects. 12. Patients with pacemakers or metal implants who are unable to get an MRI. 13. Nonadherence according to inclusion criteria. 14. Patients allergic to lidocaine</criteria>
