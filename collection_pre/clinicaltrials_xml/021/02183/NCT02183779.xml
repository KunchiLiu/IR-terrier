	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to determine if implication of epoxy-eicosatriénoïc acids (EETs) and NO during cutaneous post-occlusive hyperemia differs between patients with Raynaud phenomena and healthy volunteers, by studying hyperaemic postocclusive response after microinjection of fluconazole and L-NMMA at the dorsal side of the fingers.</brief_summary>
