	<criteria>Healthy males and females according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests: No finding deviating from normal and of clinical relevance No evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease. Age ≥ 21 and Age ≤ 50 years BMI ≥ 18.5 and BMI ≤ 29.9 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and the local legislation Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Surgery of gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) History of recent surgery including dental surgery History of gastrointestinal ulcer or gastrointestinal inflammation (gastritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) Blood dyscrasias of unknown origin Subjects with porphyries diseases Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity/allergic rhinitis (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to he trial as judged by the investigator Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial except substitution therapy (thyroid, ovaries) and hormonal contraception Use of any drugs, which might influence the results of the trial (within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial) Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (within two months prior to administration or during the trial) Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days Alcohol abuse (more than 60 g/day) Drug abuse Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the trial) Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance Inability to comply with dietary regimen of study centre For female subjects: Pregnancy Positive pregnancy test No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraceptives, sterilisation, IUP (intrauterine pessary: in case a IUP was used for contraception, volunteers must be advised to employ additional contraceptive measures (e.g. condom by partner) because prostaglandin inhibition may alter IUP contraceptive efficacy) Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period Lactation period</criteria>
