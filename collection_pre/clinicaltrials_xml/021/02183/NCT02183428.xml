	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of multiple doses BI 1356 given once daily in the estimated highest therapeutic dose of 5 mg until steady state on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single oral conventional therapeutic dose of 1.75 mg glyburide. In addition, the effect of glyburide as a single oral dose of 1.75 mg being a conventional therapeutic dose on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of BI 1356 was investigated. Pharmacokinetic profiles of glyburide were determined when given alone or in combination with BI 1356. Pharmacokinetic profiles of BI 1356 and its inactive metabolite CD 1750 were determined at steady state of BI 1356 when given alone or in combination with glyburide.</brief_summary>
