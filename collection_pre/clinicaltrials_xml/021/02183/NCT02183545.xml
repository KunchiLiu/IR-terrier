Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or ECG(electrocardiogram)) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the investigator. Pulse rate outside the range of 5090 beat per minute or blood pressure outside the ranges of 90140 for systolic and 5090 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure if confirmed by repeat measurement. 2.

Glomerular Filtration Rate according to CKDEPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) Formula &lt; 60 ml/ min 5. Current or history of relevant kidney, urinary tract diseases or abnormalities (i.e. nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, acute or chronic nephritis, renal injury, renal failure, infections) 6. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 7. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the study drug 8. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), central neurological disorders or psychiatric disorders 9. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts 10. Relevant chronic or acute infections 11. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial medication or its excipients) 12. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (greater than 24 hours) within 30 days or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to study drug administration 13. Intake of any NSAIDs(Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs), COX2(Cyclooxygenase2) inhibitors, aspirin, ACE(Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors, H2blockers or OTC(Over the Counter Drug) or nutripharmaceuticals between screening examination and drug administration 14. Use of drugs that might reasonably influence the results of the trial (including renal function measurements) or that might prolong the QT/QTc interval within 14 days prior to study drug administration 15. Participation in another trial with investigational drug administration within 60 days prior to administration of trial medication 16. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) 17. Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days 18. Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g/day) 19. Drug abuse or positive drug screen 20.

Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial 22. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site 23. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as repeated demonstration of a QTc interval greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding 24. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome) 25. Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance, because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study</criteria>
