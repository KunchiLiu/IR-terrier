	<brief_summary>Fecal incontinence (FI) has an increasing prevalence in the geriatric population which cannot be explained by co-morbidity or anatomical and psychological changes of aging alone. In the nursing home population previous studies suggest a prevalence between 10 and 69%, but is most often reported to be between 40 and 55%. FI leads to a high direct and indirect economic burden to the health-care system, and is an important cause og institutionalization of the elderly patients. In addition, FI is associated with shame, social isolation and reduced quality of life. The importance of identifying treatable causes of FI in the frail elderly, rather than just managing passively, is strongly emphasized. It is indicated that the level of awareness among health personnel regarding appropriate assessment and treatment options is limited, and that FI is considered a normal part of aging. This study is based on the assumption that FI among nursing home patients can be prevented, cured or ameliorated by offering nursing home staff knowledge of best practise. The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program for staff on assessment and treatment of FI, is associated with a reduction in patients' frequency of FI. The design of the study is a two armed cluster randomized trail (C-RCT) with a repeated cross-sectional approach.The results will be analysed according to multilevel and longitudinal modelling, and the study will use mixed effect models with the cluster treated as a random effect.</brief_summary>
