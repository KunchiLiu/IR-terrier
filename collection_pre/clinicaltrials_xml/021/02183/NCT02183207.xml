	<brief_summary>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy(PEG) by introducer method has been proven to be safe and easy to perform. However, it is limited by its need to be performed in an endoscopy unit. E.G. ScanTM is an new portable ultrathin endoscope, capable of being performed in any hospital setting and introduced via nasal approach. Our aim is to prove that PEG by introducer method via E.G. ScanTM is feasible and safe. This will allow PEG to be done at hospitals and medical facilities without endoscopic units.</brief_summary>
