	<brief_summary>This multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Perjeta in combination with Herceptin and anthracycline-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with HER2-based locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage breast cancer. Each investigator will choose a treatment regimen (A or B) for all their patients to follow. Treatment A (Cohort A): Patients will first be given doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 IV) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2 IV). This will be followed by administration of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV), Perjeta (420 mg IV) and Herceptin (6 mg IV) for four cycles. Treatment B (Cohort B): Patients will first receive 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 IV), epirubicin (100 mg/m2 IV), and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2 IV). This is to be followed by docetaxel (100 mg/m2 IV), Perjeta (420 mg IV) and Herceptin (6 mg IV) treatment for four cycles. Patients in both cohorts will subsequently undergo surgical treatment and then resume Perjeta and Herceptin treatment. Total time on treatment is expected to last 1 year; patients will be followed-up for a further 4 years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt;/= 18 years Male and female patients with locally advanced, inflammatory, or earlystage, unilateral, and histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer must be able to have a core needle biopsy. Primary tumor &gt; 2 cm in diameter, or &gt; 5 mm in diameter and nodepositive HER2positive breast cancer confirmed by a central laboratory Availability of tumor tissue specimen Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;/= 55% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 1 At least 4 weeks since major unrelated surgery, with full recovery Use of effective contraception as defined by the protocol. Contraception must be used until at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment. Metastatic disease (Stage IV) or bilateral breast cancer Patients who have had an incisional biopsy of the primary tumor or the primary tumor excised History of other malignancies within 5 years prior to study entry, except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with malignancies occurring more than 5 years prior to study entry are permitted if curatively treated with surgery alone. Any previous systemic therapy (including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, HER2 targeted agents, and antitumor vaccines) for cancer, or radiation therapy for cancer Patients with a past history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are not allowed to enter the study if they have received any systemic therapy for its treatment or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast (they are allowed to enter the study if treated with surgery alone). Highrisk patients who have received chemopreventative drugs in the past are not allowed to enter the study. Inadequate bone marrow, renal, or liver function. History or evidence of cardiovascular condition. Any other concomitant serious medical condition, including infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Patients who received any investigational treatment within 4 weeks of study start Current chronic daily treatment with corticosteroids (dose &gt; 10 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent [excluding inhaled steroids]).</criteria>
