	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effect of double doses of a study drug known as insulin peglispro and insulin glargine in participants who have type 2 diabetes. Participants will be treated for up to 11 weeks, and will take part in two study periods. Each participant will receive insulin peglispro during one treatment period and insulin glargine during the other treatment period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, for ≥1 year. Use any type of basal insulin (except degludec), including onceor twicedaily human insulin neutral protamine Hagedom (NPH), insulin detemir, or insulin glargine. Have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels ≤9.0% according to central laboratory testing at screening. Have body mass index (BMI) ≤40.0 kilogram/square meter (kg/m^2). Have been treated with stable doses of insulin for at least 30 days before screening with: Basal insulin with daily doses ±30% of mean during the last 4 weeks. Doses of a basal insulin must be between 0.3 unit/kg/day and 1 unit/kg/day. If on metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, or dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) inhibitors, must be on stable doses for the last 30 days. Are using prandial, selfmixed, or premixed insulin. Participants using prandial insulin may be switched to everyday (qd) glargine if investigator judges that the participant will still meet fasting glucose requirements for randomization. Are using insulin pump therapy. Have excessive insulin resistance: Defined as &gt;1.0 unit/kg/day as baseline treatment. If being treated with sulfonylureas (SUs) before screening, then must have SUs washed out between screening and randomization. Use any of these concomitant medications: morphine, codeine, antidiuretics, glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonists (for example, exenatide, exenatide once weekly, lixisenatide or liraglutide), or pramlintide, used concurrently or within 90 days before screening. Have hypoglycemia unawareness, defined as confirmed by laboratory test results or by historical episodes of hypoglycemia &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) without symptoms. Have fasting hypertriglyceridemia &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol/L) at screening, as determined by the local laboratory. Have had any episode of severe hypoglycemia (defined by requiring assistance due to neurologically disabling hypoglycemia) within 6 months before entry into the study. Have had 2 or more emergency room visits or hospitalizations due to poor glucose control in the past 6 months. Have had a previous clinically significant episode of ketoacidosis as determined by the investigator (ketone bodies at fasting and without acidosis is acceptable) in the past 6 months. Have history of renal transplantation, are currently receiving renal dialysis, or have estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;60 milliliters/minute. Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease (excluding nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), acute or chronic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or elevated liver enzyme measurements. Have active or untreated malignancy, have been in remission from clinically significant malignancy (other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) for less than 5 years, or are at increased risk for developing cancer or a recurrence of cancer in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
