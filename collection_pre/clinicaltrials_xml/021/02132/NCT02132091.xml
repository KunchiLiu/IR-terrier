	<brief_summary>Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in a ten-week double-blinded crossover trial. The trial will consist of two, three-week periods of intermittent fasting, where subjects receive either antioxidant supplementation or placebo, the ordering of which will be randomly determined. A one-week preconditioning will precede each invention period, and a two week "wash-out" period will follow the first intervention period. Serum-based assays will be performed to assess levels of reactive oxidant species, antioxidant genes, sirtuins, and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and aging. The investigators hypothesize that an intermittent fasting diet in healthy young volunteers will improve these markers of cellular aging and that these beneficial effects will be abrogated by the supplementation of antioxidants. This study is a proof-of-principle study that will shed light on the mechanism and effects of IF as an anti-aging dietary intervention in the absence of weight loss. It will inform the design of dietary interventions that are both effective in improving markers of aging and feasible for patients to practice on a long-term basis.</brief_summary>
