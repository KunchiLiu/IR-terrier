	<brief_summary>Currently there is no clear guidance for the treatment of moderate risk of pulmonary embolism. The aim of the study is to compare two different therapeutic modalities - standard anticoagulation versus thrombolytic treatment followed by anticoagulation in standard regimen as stated in the pulmonary embolism guidelines.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard treatment of moderate risk pulmonary embolism constitutes of sole anticoagulation therapy. In case of troponin positivity and/or echocardiographic findings as i.e. thrombi in RV thrombolytic therapy should be considered. The aim of this trial is to compare the two treatment modalities in their ability to reduce/predict 12 month end-point: pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, exercise capacity.</detailed_description>
