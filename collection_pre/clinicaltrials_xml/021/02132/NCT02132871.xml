	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate wether the measure of stroke volume (SV) variations by impedance cardiography during passive leg raising (PLR) can reliably predict preload dependency after cardiac surgery, in comparison to a reference parameter : velocity time integral (VTI) variation measured by transthoracical echocardiography.</brief_summary>
