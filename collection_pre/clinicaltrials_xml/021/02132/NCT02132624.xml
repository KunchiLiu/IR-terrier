	<brief_summary>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with B cell lymphoma or leukemia. The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting antibody scFv with three intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta, CD28 and 4-1BB. Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Relapsed or refractory CD19+ Bcell lymphoma or leukemia. Measurable disease. Performance status ECOG 02. &gt;18 years old. Fertile females/males must consent to use contraceptives during participation of the trial. Signed informed consent. Any significant medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from giving informed consent or from following the study procedures. Patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Active and/or severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection). Other serious underlying medical conditions, which, in the Investigator's judgment, could impair the ability of the patient. Treatment with an investigational product within 30 days prior to enrollment, or at least 5 half lives of that drug, which is longest. Patients that do not consent to that tissue and blood samples are stored in a biobank. Pregnancy</criteria>
