	<brief_title>Epidemiology of Diverticulitis in Lung Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sigmoid diverticulitis is common and potentially problematic in immunosuppressed patients. The choice between conservative and surgical treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis remains unclear, as well as the value of the Hartmann's procedure (HP) for complicated diverticulitis. Our aim is to assess incidence, treatment options and outcome of complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis in highly immunosuppressed lung transplant recipients (LTRs) by retrospectively analysing our prospective database of around 400 lung transplant recipients transplanted between 1992 and 2013.</detailed_description>
