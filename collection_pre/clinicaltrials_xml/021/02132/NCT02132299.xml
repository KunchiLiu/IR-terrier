	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate whether relatively non-immune populations in endemic countries can effectively generate significant cellular and humoral immune responses that confer protection against P. falciparum infection after inoculation of aseptic, purified, vialed, metabolically active, non-replicating (live, radiation attenuated) Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Vaccine) administered intravenously (IV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation, Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of Intravenously Administered Attenuated Plasmodium Falciparum Sporozoite Vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine) in Tanzanian Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, Phase 1, dose escalating, randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Seventy-three healthy male volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years will be recruited. The study will have 5 study groups that will include 49 volunteers who will be intravenously injected with PfSPZ Vaccine, 8 control volunteers who will receive normal saline and 16 additional control volunteers who will be recruited at the time of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) at 3 and 24 weeks. The control volunteers will help better assess the occurrence of AEs compared to background disease patterns that occur in this tropical area, and the performance of the vaccine.</detailed_description>

History or indication of a history of drug or alcohol abuse interfering with normal social function. Use of chronic immunosuppressive drugs, antibiotics, or other immune modifying drugs within three months of study enrollment (inhaled and topical corticosteroids are allowed). Ongoing condition that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results or compromise the health of the volunteer. History of diabetes mellitus or cancer.
