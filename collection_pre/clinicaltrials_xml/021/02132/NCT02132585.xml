	<brief_summary>Speckle tracking (STE) is a novel echocardiographic technique which permits calculation of myocardial velocities and deformation parameters such as strain and strain rate (SR). It is demonstrated that these parameters provide important insights into systolic and diastolic function, ischaemia, myocardial mechanics and many other pathophysiological processes of the heart. In this preliminary study, we investigated the role of STE in detection of early ventricular dysfunction in patients with Sjogren Syndrome, focusing on cardiorespiratory fitness.</brief_summary>
