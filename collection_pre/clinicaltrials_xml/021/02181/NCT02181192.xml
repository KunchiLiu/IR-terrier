	<brief_summary>PSA-recurrence prostate carcinoma is associated with two general problems. 1. Localisation of PSA-recurrence is unconfident. In many cases it's not clear if a local, locoregional oder systemic relapse is available. 2. There is no standard therapy proved by randomised clinical trials. Recommended radiotherapy starting with PSA-value &lt; 0.5 ng/ml according to german S3 guidelines is based on retrospective data. These difficulties may lead to a therapy potentially not adapted to patients situation of disease.This study aims to randomised examine if an instant radiotherapy of prostate PSA-recurrence (PSA-value between 0.2 - 0.99 ng/ml) or a delayed radiotherapy with additional imaging (PSA value &gt;= 1 ng/ml) including PET/CT and bone scintigraphy for reliable information about tumor location and expansion is beneficial regarding therapy efficiency, quality of life and social economic aspects.</brief_summary>
