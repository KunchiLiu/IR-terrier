	<brief_summary>The investigators are attempting to determine a less invasive method of treatment for postdural puncture headaches that can occur after regional anesthesia. The investigators will be evaluating the relief of headache with those subjects receiving treatment with a sphenopalatine ganglion block with bupivacaine versus placebo, evaluating the incidence of epidural blood patch, pain score of headache at 1 hour, then 24, 48, and 72 hours lower with post study treatment versus placebo, and potential side effects of those patients receiving study therapy as well as epidural blood patch.</brief_summary>
