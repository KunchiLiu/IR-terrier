	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find the maximum tolerated dose of a drug called romidepsin when given with a treatment regimen called GemOxD. GemOxD is a routine treatment for certain types of lymphoma, and involves the administration of three drugs: gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and dexamethasone. In addition to finding the maximum tolerated dose of romidepsin, the investigators want to look at the side effects of these drugs when given together, as well as how the lymphoma responds to this treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Able to understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form Age ≥ 18 at time of informed consent Diagnosis of one of the following: relapsed/refractory peripheral Tcell lymphoma of any subtype including mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome of advanced stage (IIBIVB) **for the expansion cohort:patients must have biopsyproven Tcell lymphoma and measurable disease. relapsed/refractory DLBCL (up to 6 DLBCL patients are allowed in the doseescalation portion of the study) relapsed/refractory HL Note: extracorporeal photopheresis is NOT considered a systemic therapy for this study. Transplant eligible (as determined by referring physician) patients who have failed one prior salvage therapy or transplant ineligible (as determined by referring physician) patients who have failed one prior therapy ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 Laboratory test results within the following ranges: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL Potassium ≥ 3.3 mmol/L or at/above the lower limit of normal for the performing laboratory Magnesium ≥ 1.4 mg/dL or at/above the lower limit of normal for the performing laboratory. Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential Washout time of at least 4 weeks for prior biological, chemotherapeutic, or radiotherapy Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would in the opinion of the investigator prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form Pregnant or lactating women Any medical condition or laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion of the investigator places the subject at unacceptable risk, or confounds the ability to interpret data if he/she were to participate in the study Positive CSF cytology during staging, symptomatic leptomeningeal involvement, or parenchymal involvement of brain or spinal cord Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant Prior solid organ transplant Cirrhotic liver disease from any cause Known HIV infection Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease including any of the following: Congenital long QT syndrome Screening ECG with QTc interval ≥ 500 milliseconds Myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina ≤ 6 months of C1D1; however, subjects with a history of MI between 6 and 12 months who are asymptomatic and have had a negative cardiac risk assessment (treadmill stress test, nuclear medicine stress test, or stress echocardiogram) since the event would be eligible Symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), e.g., angina Canadian Class IIIV. In any patient in whom there is doubt, the patient should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present An ECG recorded at screening showing evidence of cardiac ischemia (ST depression of ≥2 mm, measured from isoelectric line to the ST segment). If in any doubt, the patient should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present Other significant ECG abnormalities including 2nd degree atrioventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardia (defined here as ventricular rate &lt; 50 bpm); right bundlebranch block + left anterior hemiblock (bifasicular block) Congestive heart failure (CHF) that meets New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV definitions (see Appendix 9) and/or ejection fraction &lt;40% by MUGA scan or &lt;50% by echocardiogram and/or MRI History or presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), torsade de pointes, or cardiac arrest Hypertrophic cardiomegaly or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior treatment or other causes Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e., blood pressure (BP) of ≥160/95; patients who have a history of hypertension controlled by medication must be on a stable dose (for at least one month) and meet all other inclusion criteria Any cardiac arrhythmia requiring an antiarrhythmic medication, excluding stable (i.e., at least 30 days from screening) doses of betablockers Concomitant use of drugs that may cause significant QT prolongation and/or torsades de pointes that cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to treatment Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers unless able to stop medication(s) prior to starting study treatment Patients who are unwilling to stop the use of herbal remedies while receiving study treatment Unable to accept blood product transfusions Men whose sexual partners are women of childbearing potential not using a double method of contraception during the study and 3 months after the end of treatment. One of these methods must be a condom Concurrent malignancy requiring active therapy *Patients with localized prostate cancer having undergone surgery or radiation (field confined to ≤ 30% of marrowbearing bone) at least 30 days prior to study treatment are eligible</criteria>
