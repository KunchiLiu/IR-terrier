	<brief_summary>Chronic liver disease/fibrosis can be the result of various causes, and the result is that the liver tissue becomes stiff. ShearWave™ elastography, available on the Aixplorer® ultrasound system, is a method that can be used to measure the stiffness of organs in the body, for example the liver. This study will evaluate how this technology performs as a non-invasive test to stage liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Fibrosis Assessment With ShearWave Elastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurements of liver stiffness made by the Aixplorer® will be compared to (where available) : - blood markers - biopsy results - other stiffness measurement exams (FibroScan, ARFI, ElastPQ...) The influence of other (confounding) factors on the reliability of SWE measurements will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
