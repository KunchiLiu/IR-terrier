	<brief_summary>The objective of ASSENT 3 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of full dose tenecteplase with heparin sodium (group A), full dose tenecteplase combined with enoxaparin (group B) and half dose tenecteplase combined with abciximab and heparin sodium (group C).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Onset of symptoms of AMI within six hours prior to randomisation A twelvelead electrocardiogram with one of the following: STsegment elevation ≥ 0.1 millivolt (mV) in two or more limb leads, or ≥ 0.2 mV in two or more contiguous precordial leads indicative of AMI, or left bundlebranch block Age ≥ 18 Informed consent received Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt; 180/110 mm Hg (systolic BP &gt;180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt;110 mm Hg) on repeated measurements during current admission prior to randomization Use of abciximab (ReoPro ®) or other glycoproteinIIb/IIIa antagonists within the preceding 7 days Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within 2 months Any minor head trauma and any other trauma occurring after onset of the current myocardial infarction Any known history of stroke or transient ischemic attack or dementia Any known structural damage of the central nervous system Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt;10 minutes) in the previous two weeks Current oral anticoagulation Standard unfractionated heparin (heparin sodium) &gt;5000 IU or a subcutaneous dose within 6 hours of randomization of a therapeutic dose of any low molecular weight heparin Known thrombocytopenia (prior platelet count below 100000 cells/μl (100 x10**9/l)) Known renal insufficiency (prior Screatinine &gt;2.5 mg% (&gt;220 μmol/l) for men and &gt;2.0 mg% (&gt;175 μmol/l)) for women Pregnancy or lactation, parturition within the previous 30 days. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, or use a medically accepted method of birth control Treatment with an investigational drug under another study protocol in the past 7 days Previous enrollment in this study Known sensitivity to TNKtPA, tPA, abciximab, heparin or low molecular weight heparin Any other condition that the investigator feels would place the patient at increased risk if the investigational therapy is initiated Inability to follow protocol and comply with followup requirements</criteria>
