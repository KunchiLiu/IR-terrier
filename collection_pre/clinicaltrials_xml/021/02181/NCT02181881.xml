	<brief_summary>The investigators will pilot test the intervention by randomizing 30 couples to one of three conditions: 1) DuoPACT, the newly-developed couples intervention; 2) Life Steps, a standardized antiretroviral adherence intervention for HIV+ individuals; and 3) a treatment as usual (TAU) assessment-only control condition. After randomization, intervention sessions will be delivered weekly (6 DuoPACT sessions, or 3 Life Steps sessions). All couples will be assessed pre/post intervention to evaluate intervention acceptability and feasibility.</brief_summary>
