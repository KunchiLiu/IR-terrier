	<brief_summary>Myofascial pain considerably affects women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, is characterized by the presence of myofascial taut bands and trigger points. This study aims to evaluate the effects of ischemic compression, high-voltage electrical stimulation and rehabilitation of kinesio in women with myofascial pain following treatment of breast cancer. This is a randomized blind controlled study. For this, we invited 60 volunteers undergoing treatment for breast cancer, randomized and allocated into three groups: G1 (cinesioterapia), G2 (ischemic compression cinesioterapia +) and G3 (high voltage electrical stimulation cinesioterapia +). The stance, the plantar pressure distribution and the balance will be assessed by means of photogrammetry and baropodometry respectively. Myofascial trigger points will be assessed with the use of infrared thermography, algometry and numerical rating scale of pain (END). Moreover, the quality of life of the volunteers will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B +4). The volunteers will undergo 10 sessions of treatment, and reassessed at the end of treatment and after thirty days. Normality test is used to verify data distribution and consistent statistical test for proper intra and comparisons between groups, being thus considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. A significance level of 5% is assumed.</brief_summary>
