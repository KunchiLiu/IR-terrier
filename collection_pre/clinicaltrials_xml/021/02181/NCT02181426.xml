	<brief_title>Dose Response of Ketorolac in Knee Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Past studies have examined different doses of ketorolac administered to patients after spinal fusion surgery and found that 7.5 mg every 6 hours was as effective as 15 or 30 mg every 6 hours in decreasing postoperative pain and patient opiate consumption. Since ketorolac side effects such as gastrointestinal and surgical site bleeding seem to be dose related, utilizing a lower dose of ketorolac may be more efficacious.</detailed_description>
