	<brief_title>Core Biopsy Endo Sonography Study Evaluation of the Significance of the Pro-coreÂ® Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound is an established examination method for tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas. Since imaging by itself is limited in differential diagnosis of tumors, EUS guided fine needle aspiration is seen as a valid complementary method. Since fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is mainly based on cytological diagnostics, this method is limited also because of lacking supplementary immune- histochemical diagnostics. Here, the obtainment of little histologically evaluable tissue samples (punched barrels) would be of benefit. A new punch needle device called Pro-core needle (Cook)(22 / 19 gauges) offers the possibility of increasing numbers of valid extractions of histologically evaluable tissues due to a better targeted precision and maneuverability in comparison to other devices of that kind (tru-cut needles, e.g.). A little notch at the pinpoint allows the obtainment of little tissue samples, that will be kept within the device by aspiration. This study compares the obtainment of tissue by Proc-core needle and conventional aspiration punction systems.</detailed_description>
