	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that automatically delivers glucagon only can prevent or treat hypoglycemia vs. usual care for people with type 1 diabetes &gt; 21 years old.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 21 years or older with type 1 diabetes for at least one year. Otherwise healthy (mild chronic disease such as asthma, hypertension, and depression will be allowed if well controlled). Selfreported frequency of documented hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 60 mg/dl) of at least 2 times per week Partial hypoglycemic unawareness (inconsistent symptoms with BG &lt; 50 mg/dl) or hypoglycemic unawareness (minimal or no symptoms with BG &lt; 50 mg/dl) Unable to provide informed consent. Unable to comply with study procedures. Current participation in another diabetesrelated clinical trial other than one that is primarily observational in nature. Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception History of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, or other pancreatic disease other than type 1 diabetes End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). Any known liver or biliary disease including cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, any form of viral hepatitis. Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea). Acute illness or exacerbation of chronic illness at the time of the study. Seizure disorder or history of hypoglycemic seizure in the last 1 year History of pheochromocytoma. Fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor: Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the last year). Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days) or substance abuse (any use within the last 6 months of controlled substances without a prescription). Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be susceptible to RF interference. History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and vomiting. Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the study period. Any factors that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with the safe completion of the study procedures.</criteria>
