	<detailed_description>All patients enrolled in the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium's Contact Registry were invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who self-identify as having one of 6 vasculitities: Wegener's Granulomatosis, Microscopic Polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Polyarteritis Nodosum, Takayasu's Arteritis, and Giant Cell Arteritis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding that they will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible. The introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required elements for informed consent in a brief format. By clicking the link to the reproductive health questionnaire, participants gave their consent to be included in the study.</detailed_description>
