	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group clinical trial with adaptive dose selection in subjects with post polio syndrome (PPS). The main purpose of this study is to select a dose of Flebogamma 5% DIF and confirm the efficacy of the selected Flebogamma 5% DIF dose by assessing physical performance, as measured by 2 Minutes Walk Distance (2MWD) test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) Flebogamma® 5% DIF in Patients With Post-polio Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II/III multicentre, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel‑group clinical trial with an adaptive design (flexible group sequential design with adaptive dose selection) in subjects with PPS. This study will consist of two stages. The first stage (Stage 1) is for dose selection, and the second stage (Stage 2) is to establish the superiority (efficacy confirmation) of Flebogamma® 5% DIF and for overall safety analysis. At Stage 1, three treatment arms, Flebogamma® 5% DIF 2 g/kg of body weight (IVIG 2 g/kg arm), or the equivalent volume of Normal Saline Solution (40 ml/kg of body weight), or Flebogamma® 5% DIF 1 g/kg of body weight plus the equivalent volume of Normal Saline Solution (20 ml/kg of body weight) (IVIG 1 g/kg arm) will be administered every 4 weeks over two consecutive days during a 52-week treatment period. At Stage 2, two treatment arms, the selected dose of Flebogamma® 5% DIF from Stage 1 and Normal Saline Solution (40 ml/kg of body weight), will be administered every 4 weeks over two consecutive days during a 52-week treatment period. During Stage 2, the selected dose of Flebogamma® 5% DIF and Normal Saline Solution will be administered in the same manner as in Stage 1, including administering the total dose for both treatment arms at a volume equivalent to that for the IVIG 2 g/kg arm, regardless of the selected dose. Primary efficacy endpoint will be: - Physical performance (2MWD) from baseline to the end of the treatment period (at End of Treatment Visit -Week 52). Secondary efficacy endpoints will be: - Pain (VAS of pain) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - HRQoL (SF-36 PCS) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - Endurance (6MWD) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. Exploratory endpoints will be: - Muscle strength of at least two newly weakened muscle groups (Manual Muscle Testing [MMT] using the modified Medical Research Council [MRC] scale) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - Muscle strength of at least two newly weakened muscle groups (Quantitative Muscle Testing [QMT] using a dynamometer) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - Walking activity in daily life (pedometer) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - Fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - HRQoL (SF-36 Mental Component Summary [MCS]) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - Blood and CSF (CSF is optional) inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-23, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) from baseline to the end of the treatment period. - Sustained effect of Flebogamma® 5% DIF compared to placebo as measured by: 1. Physical performance (2MWD) from baseline to Followup Visit (FU) (Week 64) and to the Final Visit (FV; Week 76). 2. Pain (VAS of pain) from baseline to FU3 and to the FV. 3. HRQoL (SF-36 PCS) from baseline to FU3 and to the FV. 4. Endurance (6MWD) from baseline to FU3 and to the FV. 5. Muscle strength (MMT using the MRC scale) from baseline to the FV. 6. Muscle strength (QMT using a dynamometer) from baseline to the FV. 7. Walking activity in daily life (pedometer) from baseline to the FV. 8. Fatigue (FSS) from baseline to the FV. 9. HRQoL (SF-36 MCS) from baseline to FU3 and to the FV. 10. Blood and CSF (CSF is optional) inflammatory cytokines from baseline to the FV. Safety endpoints will include Adverse Events (AEs), vital signs during infusions, physical assessments and blood tests for clinical safety.</detailed_description>
