	<brief_summary>Objective of this First in Man study is to assess feasibility and safety of Qvanteq's bioactive coronary stent for treatment of stable coronary artery disease patients with de novo coronary artery stenosis in native vessels. The proprietary surface of Qvanteq's bioactive coronary stent improves the in-growth behavior of the stent in the treated vessel. In-vivo animal studies revealed fast in-growth (similar to BMS), which however is not resulting in excessive tissue overgrowth as observed in BMS but rather has an efficacy profile similar to drug-eluting stent (DES), meaning suppression of tissue overgrowth. This should reduce the risk of restenosis and thrombus formation despite the presence of a short term dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT). Furthermore, prolonged DAPT time as applied with current DES increases the bleeding risk of patients. The study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm study; conducted in up to 6 cardiology centers in CH and NL. In total, approx. 35 patients will be enrolled. All patients will be treated with the Qvanteq's bioactive coronary stent. Clinical follow-up will occur at 1, 6 &amp; 12 months post-stent implantation. All patients will undergo angiography assessment (QCA) and Optical Coherence Tomography investigation (OCT) at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Baseline OCT should be performed after the successfully completed angiographic procedure (documentary OCT). 1 and 12 months clinical follow-ups are conducted via telephone. Primary Angiographic endpoint is in-stent Late Lumen Loss at 6 months; assessed by off-line QCA. Primary OCT endpoint is mean neointimal thickness at 6 months; assessed by off-line OCT analysis.</brief_summary>
