	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective phase 1 single-center trial designed to determine the safety of a single intravenous infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and assess the feasibility of various outcome measures to determine which measure(s) can be used as primary and secondary endpoints for a future randomized phase 2 clinical trial. All subjects will receive infusion of cord blood cells at baseline with follow up assessments at 6 and 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder with early onset in life. Currently, available treatments for patients with ASD are supportive, but not curative. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been shown to lessen the clinical and radiographic impact of hypoxic brain injury and stroke in animal models and in infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. UCB also engrafts and differentiates in the brain, facilitating neural cell repair in animal models and human patients with inborn errors of metabolism undergoing allogeneic, unrelated donor UCB transplantation. Infusion of autologous UCB does not require immunosuppression and has been shown to be safe in young children with brain injuries such as cerebral palsy and stroke. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that infusion of a patient's own umbilical cord blood cells (UCB) can offer neural protection/repair in the brain and reduction of inflammation associated with this disorder.</detailed_description>
