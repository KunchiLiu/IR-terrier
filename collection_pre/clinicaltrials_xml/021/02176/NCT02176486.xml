	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Rising Doses of Ixazomib in Lupus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to find a safe and well tolerated dose in participants with lupus nephritis. This study will look at side effects and lab results in participants who take ixazomib, along with the determination of the pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is designed as a randomized, sequential-panel, multiple rising dose study. The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. The study population will consist of 4 Cohorts. At least 5 participants (4:1) will be recruited into the 0.5 mg dose group (Cohort A), at least 5 participants (4:1) in the 2.0 mg dose group (Cohort B), 8 participants (6:2) in the 3.0 mg dose group (Cohort C), and 8 participants (6:2) in the 4.0 mg dose group (Cohort D). Participants in each Cohort will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 in a 28-days cycle, for 3 cycles. PK samples will be collected Predose on Days 1, 8 and 15. Cycle 1 - Postdose Day 1 at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 168 hours. Cycle 2 - Postdose Day 15 at 168 hours. Cycle 3 - Postdose on Day 15 following the third dose, samples will be collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, 168 and 312 hours . The starting dose in Cohort 1 will be 0.5 mg followed by administrations of 2, 3 and 4 mg in subsequent cohorts. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 196 days. Participants will make 19 visits to the clinic during the treatment period and will make follow-up visits monthly for 3 months for follow-up assessments.</detailed_description>

If no biopsy was done within 2 year of Screening Visit, biopsy can be done during the screening period as a study procedure. 2. Coexistence of classes is permitted. 6. Has a renal biopsy demonstrating either ISN/RPS or WHO class V or class V with class 2 nephritis with a UPCR of &gt;3 or the subject has a renal biopsy demonstrating either active ISN/RPS or WHO class III or IV nephritis, defined by either one of the following criteria: a) A UPCR* of &gt;=1.0 at Screening OR b) A UPCR* &gt;0.5 at Screening and at least one of the following: i. Active urine sediment in the absence of infection or other cause within 3 months of screening, defined as at least one of the following: &gt;=5 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field, not due to causes other than lupus nephritis. &gt;=5 white blood cells (WBC) per high power field in the absence of infection. Presence of cellular casts. ii. The participant has increased levels (above upper limit of normal [ULN] serum dsDNA autoantibodies at screening. iii. Low complement (either C3 or C4) at Screening (&gt;= 25 percent [%] lower than lower limit of normal [LLN]). iv. Biopsy within 3 months prior to screening visit indicating active proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis ISN/RPS class III or IV changes [excluding Class III (C), IVS (C) and IVG (C)] or World Health Organization (WHO) 1982 classification Class III or IV (excluding Class IIIc and IVd), with coexisting Class V permitted. Participants may be rescreened once for urinary sediment, proteinuria or complement levels within 2 weeks of the original screening visit. UPCR value for eligibility will be based on the average UPCR obtained from the 3 specimens collected during screening. 7. Has had an inadequate response, in the judgment of the Investigator, to at least 6 months of an immunosuppressive regimen including single or sequential use of at least one of the following: cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) mycophenolic acid (MA)or azathioprine (AZA). 8. If the participant is on glucocorticosteroids, must be on stable dose equivalent to 20 mg/day or less of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study medication. Participant who are on a stable dose equivalent to &gt;20 mg/day and â‰¤30 mg/day of prednisone may be allowed to the study reviewed by the adjudication committee and approved by the medical monitor; however, the steroid dose should be tapered. 9. Male participants who are sexually active with women of child bearing potential (WOCBP), even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), must: a) Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 10.
