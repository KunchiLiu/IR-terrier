	<brief_title>Low-Fat Diet and Fish Oil in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if a 1-year low-fat fish oil (omega-3 fatty acid) intervention results in decreased prostate cancer proliferation as compared to a control group in men on active surveillance. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of a low-fat (LF)/fish oil (FO) intervention on prostate biopsy tissue markers of proliferation and cell cycle progression, prostate biopsy pathologic features (Gleason grade, percent of cores with cancer, percent of tissue with cancer), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and long-term clinical outcomes (clinical progression, prostate cancer therapies). II. To evaluate potential surrogate biomarkers of proliferation (red blood cell [RBC] membrane fatty acid analyses, ex-vivo bioassay). III. To determine if a correlation exists between free fatty acid receptor 4 (GPR120) levels and the antiproliferative response to the LF/FO intervention. IV. To evaluate compliance with a 1-year LF/FO intervention. V. To evaluate safety of a 1-year LF/FO intervention. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive no intervention. ARM II: Patients receive dietary counseling with a research dietitian weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 11 months. Patients are given guidelines with recommended meals to follow a low-fat diet comprising 20% kilocalories (Kcal) from fat, 15% Kcal from protein, and 65% Kcal from carbohydrates for 1 year. Patients also receive 4 fish oil capsules per day orally (PO) for 1 year. After completion of study, patients are followed up yearly for 15 years.</detailed_description>
