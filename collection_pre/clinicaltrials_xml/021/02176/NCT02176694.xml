	<brief_title>Adolescent Controlled Text Messaging to Improve Asthma Medication Adherence in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our first aim is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and use of a low intensity text messaging intervention to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy among high risk adolescents with persistent asthma. Our second aim is to determine effect sizes of the intervention to improve adherence (As measured by electronic monitoring and self-report); clinical asthma control; and asthma related quality of life among adolescents with persistent asthma. Our third and final aim is to determine the temporal relationship between text message receipt and ICS canister actuation in order to understand mechanisms by which text messaging may increase ICS adherence.</detailed_description>
