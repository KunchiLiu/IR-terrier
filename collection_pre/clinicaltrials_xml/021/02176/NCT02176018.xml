	<brief_title>Nuedexta for the Prevention and Modification of Disease Progression in Episodic Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study to be conducted at the Headache Care Center in Springfield, MO and two other clinics in the United States. Approximately 45 subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, with frequent episodic migraine (6-14 days per month), with (1.2) or without aura (1.1) as defined by ICHD-3beta, will enter a 1-month baseline period to confirm the migraine diagnosis, as well as establish baseline characteristics. At Visit 1, subjects must not have a history of utilization of acute treatment greater than 14 days per month in the preceding 3 month period. Subjects must have a current history of ICHD-3beta migraine with 6-14 migraine days per month in the 3 months prior to the study enrollment. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will occur using a computer-generated allocation schedule. Subjects meeting entrance criteria as determined both at screening and through the review of the baseline headache diary will be given the lowest available allocation number for that site. Migraine preventative use is permitted if the subject has been on a stable does for at least 2 months prior to screening and has not failed more than 3 migraine preventatives due to lack of efficacy. The study will consist of 5 office visits per subject: Visit 1 - screening, Visit 2 - randomization, and Visits 3 to 5 - three-month treatment period. During the baseline period, the subject will treat migraines with their current preferred acute treatment of choice.</detailed_description>
