	<brief_summary>This study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple infusions of GS-5745 in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Participants will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive 1 intravenous (IV) infusion of GS-5745 or placebo every 2 weeks, for a total of 3 IV infusions.</brief_summary>
