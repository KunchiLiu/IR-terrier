	<brief_summary>Cognitive and memory problems characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD). Along with these disorders, psychological and behavioral symptoms (also known as neuropsychiatric symptoms) , as well as pathophysiological processes are frequently found and involved significantly in maintaining autonomy, prognosis and treatment of the disease. Apathy or disorder motivation is the most common disorder behavior and early stages of cognitive impairment. Apathy is particularly associated with cognitive difficulties such as attention deficit disorder - concentration. In terms of prevention as term care , there is now a broad consensus that interventions on cognition and behavior must not be limited to pharmacological treatment but should also promote non-drug approaches. Interest in video games (serious games and serious games) as intervention support rehabilitation is growing. Similarly, the virtual reality (VR) and the new information technologies and communications offer significant opportunities in terms of rehabilitation and therapeutic assistance. This protocol is part of a European project to propose techniques for improving the treatment of people at risk of social exclusion ( VERVE project ) aims . A first experiment conducted in 2013 showed the acceptability of Virtual Reality (VR) in healthy elderly subjects. In a second step , it is important to validate the feasibility of using the RV or in frail subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease in mild to moderate in a clinical environment. This is a biomedical , randomized given to a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease &amp; diseases associated with mild to moderate.</brief_summary>
