	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of DAV132 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study, DAV132-CL-1002, is to evaluate performances of DAV132 in healthy volunteers: - To capture residual concentration of antibiotics in colon without interfering with their systemic pharmacokinetics parameters. - To explore the influence of DAV132 to prevent the modification of gut flora due to antibiotic. In addition, the security and acceptability of DAV132 used during 7 days will be evaluated. The proposed study is prospective, randomized, controlled, four parallel groups, repeated doses, open-label study blinded to analytical and microbiological evaluations.</detailed_description>
