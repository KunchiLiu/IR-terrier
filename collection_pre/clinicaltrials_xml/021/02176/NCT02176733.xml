	<brief_summary>The Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy is a genetic disorder caused by maternal transmission of mitochondrial DesoxiroboNucleid Acid mutations. It is manifested by a rapidly progressive blindness, profound, due to atrophic optic nerve. The visual loss is primarily unilateral bilateralisation taking place in the vast majority of cases in weeks or months. The neuro-cardio-protective properties of cyclosporine (and its analogs specifically targeting the anti-apoptotic mechanisms) are particularly promising. The investigators hypothesis is that cyclosporine may limit apoptosis during the acute phase of the disease process and would limit the loss of visual acuity and improve the visual prognosis of these patients.</brief_summary>
