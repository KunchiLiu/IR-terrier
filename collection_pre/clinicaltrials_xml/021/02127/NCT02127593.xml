	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the bioequivalence of the hormones norgestimate, norelgestromin, and ethinyl estradiol in norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (NGM/EE) tablets, formulated by wet process compared with the same hormones in NGM/EE tablets, formulated by dry process, in healthy women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Bioequivalence Study of Norgestimate /Ethinyl Estradiol (NGM/EE) Tablets Manufactured at 2 Different Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), single-center and a 2-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one study group to another in a clinical trial) study in healthy women. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening phase, Treatment phase and end-of-study or withdrawal. Treatment periods will be separated by a wash out period of at least 10 days. The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be approximately 7 weeks. All participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following treatments: 1 oral tablet formulated by wet process or dry process, whereas each tablet contains norgestimate 250 microgram (mcg) and ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. The primary endpoint of the study will be assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
