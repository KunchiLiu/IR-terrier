	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether microbiome modulation and an experimental reduction in plasma LPS concentration improve inflammation and insulin action in insulin resistant (obese and T2DM) subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanism of Microbiome-induced Insulin Resistance in Humans (Aim2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this Aim we will test the hypothesis that lowering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration in the circulation will improve systemic (muscle) inflammation and glucose metabolism in insulin resistant (obese and T2DM) subjects by protecting the intestinal barrier with a synbiotic (Bifidobacterium longum R0175 and oligofructose) or by sequestering LPS in the gastrointestinal lumen with sevelamer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Both genders (50%, male). All races and ethnic groups. Premenopausal women in the follicular phase, nonlactating, and with a negative pregnancy test. Postmenopausal women on stable dose of or not exposed to hormone replacement for ≥6 months. Hematocrit (HCT)≥ 34%, serum creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dl, and normal results of serum electrolytes, urinalysis, and coagulation tests. Liver function tests (LFTs) up to 2 times normal Stable body weight (±2%) for ≥ 3 months. Two or less sessions of strenuous exercise/wk for last 6 months. Current treatment with drugs known to affect glucose and lipid homeostasis. If the subject has been on a stable dose for the past 3 months, the following agents will be permitted: calcium channel blockers, βblockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins History of allergy to sevelamer. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or systemic steroid use for more than a week within 3 months. Current treatment with anticoagulants (warfarin). Aspirin (up to 325 mg) and clopidogrel will be permitted if these can be held for seven days prior to the biopsy in accordance with the primary physician. Use of agents that affect gut flora (e.g. antibiotics, colestyramine, lactulose, PEG) within 3 months. History of heart disease (New York Heart Classification greater than grade II; more than nonspecific STT wave changes on the ECG), peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease, smokers. Poorly controlled blood pressure (systolic BP&gt;170, diastolic BP&gt;95 mmHg). Active inflammatory, autoimmune, hepatic, gastrointestinal, malignant, and psychiatric disease. History of gastrointestinal surgery or gastrointestinal obstruction within two years.</criteria>
