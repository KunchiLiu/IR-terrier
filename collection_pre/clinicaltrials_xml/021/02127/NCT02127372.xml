	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/Phase 2 study of STI571 combined with docetaxel and cisplatin for treatment of patients with recurrent and metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). This research study has 2 parts to it. The first part (Phase 1) is called a dose-escalation. Not all subjects enrolled into this phase of the study will receive the same dose. The purpose of the dose-escalation is to determine the highest safe dose of STI571 that can be used in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin. That dose will be used in Phase 2.</brief_summary>
