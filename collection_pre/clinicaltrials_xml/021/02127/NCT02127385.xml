	<brief_summary>Intra Uterine Growth Restriction is associated with increased oxidative stress. Haptoglobin (Hp) is an abundant plasma glycoprotein produced in the liver. The function of Hp is as anti oxidant agent, it binds free hemoglobin (Hb) released from red blood cells to decrease oxidative tissue damage. There are 3 differenet genotype of haptoglobin Hp 1-1 Hp 1-2 and Hp 2-2 with different anti oxidant properties and different prevalence ( Hp 1-1, Hp 1-2 and Hp 2-2approximately 16%, 48% and 36% respectively) . we hypotheise that IUGR will be more common and severe in the Hp 2-2 genotype with the less anti oxidant properties.</brief_summary>
