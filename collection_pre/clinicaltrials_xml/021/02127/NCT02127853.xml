	<brief_title>Effect of Gabapentin on Pain of the Second Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperalgesia occurring at the second operation in bilateral eye surgery is well known, and mechanism of central sensitization might be involved. Gabapentin is known to lower the effect of central sensitization, and its effect on acute postoperative pain has been reported.
