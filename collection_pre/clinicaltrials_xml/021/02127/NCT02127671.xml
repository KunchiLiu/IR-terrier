	<brief_title>Intervention Trial to Decrease Cardiovascular Risk in Persons With Serious Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to perform a randomized clinical trial (IDEAL) to test a comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction program for persons with serious mental illness. This trial will enroll adult mental health consumers with at least one cardiovascular risk factor and randomize them to the 18-month IDEAL intervention or control. Intervention participants will receive individual cardiovascular risk reduction counseling, coordination with primary care providers to ensure appropriate management of risk factors, and collaboration with mental health staff and social supports to encourage and motivate participants to reach goals. All participants will be offered group exercise classes, and programs will be provided with instruction to provide more healthy meals. The primary outcome will be the change in estimated cardiovascular risk from the global Framingham Risk Score.</detailed_description>
