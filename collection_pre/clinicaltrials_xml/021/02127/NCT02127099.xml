	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition in which a person's sleep is disrupted with momentary periods of apnoea and hypopnoea. This occurs when there is a blockage to airflow. When this happens, the patient will snore, gasp or choke in the attempt to attain more oxygen. This results in disrupted sleep and the patient may even awake from sleep. It has been found that a great proportion of Malaysians have habitual snoring and with the increase in obesity over the years, it is a concern that OSA may be prevalent in Malaysia. However, it has been seen that OSA is commonly undiagnosed in patient. This poses a worry because these people can come in for surgery. Diagnosis of OSA before surgery is important in order to prepare for the complication related to OSA.</brief_summary>
