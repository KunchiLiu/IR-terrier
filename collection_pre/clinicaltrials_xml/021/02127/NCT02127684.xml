	<brief_title>Frequent Dosing Regimen of Lucentis for Subjects With Persistent Diabetic Macular Edema Despite Standard antiVEGF Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, subject masked, phase II study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema. Persistent diabetic macular edema is defined as subjects who still have central subfield thickness on SD-OCT of greater than 320 microns after having received at least 3 previous doses of AntiVEGF therapy in the past 5 months. Consented, enrolled subjects will be randomized into two subgroups: (1) standard dosing of monthly 0.3mg ranibizumab or (2) 0.3mg ranibizumab given 2 weeks apart for 5 doses followed by monthly dosing.</detailed_description>
