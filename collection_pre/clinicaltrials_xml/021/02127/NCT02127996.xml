	<brief_summary>Angina is caused by narrowings or blockages within coronary arteries. Coronary angioplasty and stenting is performed for people with angina to improve the blood supply to the heart by placing metal tubes within the artery using balloon inflation. The procedure risks small but significant damage to the heart muscle downstream of the balloon. Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by cells in the gut in response to food. It acts by stimulating the release of insulin. In the heart it acts to increase glucose uptake into cardiac muscle. GLP−1 can protect the heart and improve heart muscle performance in people with coronary artery disease in physiological studies. This study which assesses whether GLP−1 protects the heart during coronary angioplasty and stenting. The hypothesis is that GLP-1 given during elective coronary angioplasty and stenting will reduce cardiac troponin rise (a measure of heart muscle damage) compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
