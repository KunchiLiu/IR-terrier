	<brief_summary>The investigators seek to evaluate a new test for determining presence of infection/sepsis as compared to non-infection/systemic inflammatory response syndrome among critically ill patients within the first 24 hours of their being hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) within the first 7 days of hospitalization. The primary purpose of the study is to validate SeptiCyte® Lab in this population as compared to: 1) the doctor's impression and 2) existing clinical parameters. The investigators also hope to assess how well a related, new blood test, SeptID® identifies different types of infection, as compared to cultures and other lab tests.</brief_summary>
