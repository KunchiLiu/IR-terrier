	<brief_summary>Emergent abdominal surgeries have very high rate of wound contamination due to exposure to bacteria from GI tract. There are several different approaches to wound management in these patients including wet-to-dry dressing or application vacuum assisted device on the wound. The investigators propose using the vacuum assisted device with Dakin's solution on patients undergoing emergency surgery for hollow viscus perforation installed immediately at the end of operation and remained there for the first 3 postoperative days, followed by delayed primary closure on postoperative day 4. The investigators believe this technique can achieve earlier wound closure, decrease patient discomfort, improve cost savings, and potentially standardize and revolutionize the investigators management of heavily contaminated wounds.</brief_summary>
