	<brief_summary>Hypoxemia may contribute increased morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. We aim to characterize the role of acute and chronic hypoxemia for vascular function. For this purpose we measure capillary oxygen concentration and vascular. Vascular function is assessed by flow-mediated dilation oft he brachial artery, forearm blood flow and laser doppler perfusion imaging. We hypothesize that hypoxemia leads to impaired vascular function.</brief_summary>
