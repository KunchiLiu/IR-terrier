	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators intend to compare therapies (abscess surgery and hygiene education compared to abscess surgery and hygiene education followed by decolonization) for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus skin and soft tissue infections (MRSA SSTI) to determine which is the more effective treatment. The investigators focus on patient centered outcomes as described by the families of MRSA infected patients. Such outcomes are likely to include quality of life, side effects, and school and work attendance. The hypothesis is that treatment with decolonization will decrease the rate of SSTI recurrence and improve overall patient centered outcomes. The rationale is that negative outcomes such as recurrence may be avoided through the use of readily available prevention strategies, but that it is important to determine how burdensome those prevention strategies are for patients and families.</brief_summary>
