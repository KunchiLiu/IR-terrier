	<brief_summary>This study is being done to determine the safety, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of 18F-DCFPyL, and to detect prostate cancer by visual analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of 18F-DCFPyL, a PSMA-based PET Radiotracer, in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the hypothesis that this new 2nd generation positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical, 18F-DCFPyL, may possess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that will represent an advance in imaging metastatic prostate cancer in ten patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients may be enrolled into this protocol only if all of the following inclusion criteria are met: 1. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age 2. Histological confirmation of prostate cancer 3. Radiologic evidence of new or progressive metastatic disease demonstrated on anatomical imaging (CT, MRI, or ultrasound), bone scintigraphy, 18FSodium Fluoride PET, or 18FFDG PET 4. PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL 5. Can be on androgen deprivation therapy if dose is stable for ≥ 1 week. 6. Platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 7. Neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mm3 8. Patient is judged by the Investigator to have the initiative and means to be compliant with the protocol and be within geographical proximity to make the required study visits. 9. Patients or their legal representatives must have the ability to read, understand and provide written informed consent for the initiation of any study related procedures. Patients will be excluded from enrollment if any of the following apply: 1. Karnovsky performance status of &lt; 60 2. Inadequate venous access (two antecubital or equivalent venous access sites are required for study drug injection and PK blood sampling, respectively) 3. Patient received a permanent prostate brachytherapy implant within the last 3 months (for Pd103 implants) or 12 months (for I125 implants) 4. Administered a radioisotope within 5 physical halflives prior to study enrollment 5. Serum creatinine &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal 6. Total bilirubin &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal 7. Liver Transaminases &gt; 5times the upper limit of normal 8. Patient has been treated with an investigational drug, investigational biologic, or investigational therapeutic device within 30 days prior to study radiotracer administration 9. Prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study radiotracer administration (Washout is one halflife of the drug or 2 weeks, whichever is longest). 10. Prior history of any other malignancy within 3 years, other than skin basal cell carcinoma.</criteria>
