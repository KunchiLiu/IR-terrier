	<brief_summary>Testing BRCA 1/2 mutation is important for patients with breast cancer, and Sanger sequencing is a standard method to identify BRCA 1/2 mutation. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput parallel sequencing that can provide genetic information with high accuracy. NGS is a faster and cost-effective method to detect gene mutations compared to Sanger sequencing. In this study, we evaluated the clinical role of NGS testing for BRCA 1/2 compared to Sanger sequencing.</brief_summary>
