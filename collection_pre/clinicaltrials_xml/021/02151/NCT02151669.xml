	<brief_summary>Epidemiologic studies suggest that some nutrients can be affected lung function. Moreover, no previous studies have prospectively evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in lung function in smokers. Phase II of the RESET study , a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a motivational smoking intervention based on information obtained by spirometry (FIS project PI11/01962).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial in primary care. Sample: We will recruit 80 smokers from 35 to 70 years without history of lung disease. Subjects will be randomly assigned to control or intervention group (1:1). Study variables: We measure socio-demographic, clinical, anthropometry and spirometry data. Food consumption will be evaluated by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), energy expenditure in physical activity by the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity questionnaire and adherence to Mediterranean Diet by a 14-item questionnaire. Intervention: Nutritional intervention conducted by a dietitian who designs a nutrition program to enhance the traditional Mediterranean diet pattern using new technology as an educational tool in primary care: DIET blog. Participants will be referred to a single annual visit and one group session per year for two years. Analysis: All analyses will be based on intention-to-treat. The results will be considered clinically relevant when it detects a difference in lung function (decreased FEV1) &gt;10-12 ml/year. A p-value of &lt;0.05 will defined statistical significance.</detailed_description>
