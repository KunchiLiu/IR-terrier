	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to see whether PT-20 can help people with a high level of phosphate in their blood (called Hyperphosphatemia) that are being treated with dialysis for kidney disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PT20 in Subjects With Hyperphosphataemia and Dialysis Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated serum phosphate is a ubiquitous complication of reduced kidney function and evidence suggests that this metabolic disturbance is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in subjects receiving haemodialysis Efforts to achieve normal serum phosphate with dietary restrictions, thrice weekly dialysis and phosphate binders have failed to substantially improve the achieved serum phosphate levels. Data from a large international practice pattern study suggest that approximately 50% of all dialysis subjects have serum phosphate above the recommended target value of 5.5 mg/dL The standard of care for phosphate control remains the prescription of phosphate binders with meals. These drugs act in the small intestine to bind phosphate and prevent its absorption into the bloodstream. The 2 general categories of phosphate binders currently commercially available include calcium containing phosphate binders (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate) and the non calcium containing phosphate binders (sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate While these 2 classes of phosphate binders have similar efficacy, they differ substantially in their associated side effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men or women aged 18 90 years Subject must have a stable dialysis prescription for at least 28 days prior to start of Screening. Subject must have the most recent serum phosphate measurement, taken during the 28 days prior to the start of Screening, of ≥ 4.0 mg/dL and ≤ 8 mg/dL. Subject's most recent historical predialysis serum bicarbonate value within 14 days prior to the start of Screening (Visit 1) is &lt; 18 mg/dL. Subject has, in the opinion of the investigator, severe chronic lung disease and/or carbon dioxide retention.</criteria>
