	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal, fibrotic disorder of the lung. The estimated prevalence is 30-80/100,000 in the United States with incidence estimates clearly rising. A major challenge in the care of patients with IPF is determining prognosis. The natural history of IPF is usually one of inexorable decline in lung function, ultimately resulting in death from respiratory failure. However, longitudinal physiologic decline in IPF is heterogeneous and difficult to predict in individual patients. While some patients with IPF may remain stable for years, in others the disease may progress rapidly over a relatively short time. We hypothesize that peripheral blood biomarkers based on extracellular matrix and matrix-modifying molecules will improve prognostication in patients with IPF.</brief_summary>

Diagnosis of collagenvascular conditions according to published American College of Rheumatology criteria. 4. Significant airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.60) or bronchodilator response, defined as a change in FEV1 ≥ 12% and absolute change &gt; 200 mL OR change in FVC ≥ 12% and absolute change &gt; 200 mL at baseline 5.

Uncontrolled arrhythmia or hypertension 11. Known HIV, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, or chronic active hepatitis 12. Active substance and/or alcohol abuse 13. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding 14. Any condition other than IPF that is likely to result in your death within the next year 15. Any condition that, in the judgment of the PI, might cause participation in the study to be detrimental to you or that the PI deems makes you a poor candidate</criteria>
