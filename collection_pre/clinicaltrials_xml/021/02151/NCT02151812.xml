	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is determine the safety and performance of the Agent™ Paclitaxel-Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter compared to the SeQuent® Please Paclitaxel-Releasing Coronary Balloon Catheter for the treatment of patients with narrowed previously-stented coronary arteries (in-stent restenosis). The performance will be determined at six months post-procedure by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) to measure Late Lumen Loss (LLL) in the re-opened stented segment. QCA results will be assessed by an independent, blinded angiographic core lab. Study statistical hypothesis: The loss of in-stent luminal diameter at six months after treatment of the restenosed stent with the Agent™ study device is not larger than the respective LLL after treatment with the SeQuent® Please control devices, i.e. study device is non-inferior to the control device with respect to LLL.</brief_summary>
