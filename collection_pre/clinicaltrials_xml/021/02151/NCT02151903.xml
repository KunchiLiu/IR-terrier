	<brief_summary>An open-label extension study enrolling patients experiencing clinical benefit following 6 cycles of DI-Leu16-IL2 while enrolled in the Alopexx Oncology AO-101 study. Patients will be permitted to continue to receive DI-Leu16-IL2 at the same dose, schedule, and route of administration they received while on the parent protocol. Prior pre-treatment (e.g. Rituximab) will continue as before.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Primary Endpoints: • To continue to provide DI-Leu16-IL2 to patients currently enrolled in Alopexx Oncology trial AO-101 who are experiencing clinical benefit. 2. Secondary Endpoints: - To continue to evaluate the safety of DI-Leu16-IL2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients currently entered on Alopexx Oncology Protocol AO101 2. Patient has received 6 cycles of DILeu16IL2 on Protocol AO101 3. Documented clinical benefit following 6th cycle of DILeu16IL2. 4. Able to begin extension study within 8 weeks of receiving 6th cycle of DILeu16IL2 5. Patients must have received prior Rituximabcontaining therapy. 6. Patients participating in the study are to use adequate birth control measures (abstinence, oral contraceptives, barrier method with spermicide or surgical sterilization) during study participation. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test on the days of dosing. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. 7. Provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures. 1. Pregnant or lactating female. 2. An immediate need for palliative radiotherapy or systemic corticosteroid therapy. 3. Actively infected with or chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) as demonstrated by positive hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg). (Patients who are seropositive only, i.e., surface antibody positive [HbsAb], are permitted). 4. Other significant active infection. 5. Major surgery, chemotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation within 30 days of Day 1. 6. Uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic ≥ 100 mmHg) or hypotension (systolic ≤ 90 mmHg). 7. History of prior therapy or a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder that in the Investigator's opinion would impair participation in the study.</criteria>
