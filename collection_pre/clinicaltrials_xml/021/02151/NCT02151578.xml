	<detailed_description>An integrated approach of home and community management of malaria and pneumonia may increase the proportion of children receiving prompt treatment; improve child survival as measured by a reduction of the under five mortality rate. To test this hypothesis, a cluster randomised controlled trial will be performed, involving children less than 5 years of age, in Burkina Faso using a community-based supplying community health workers (CHWs), a core group of mothers (KOLs) with Coartem and cotrimoxazole specially packed in age-specific blisters containing a full course of treatment. The study will be carried out in 111 clusters of a rural district in Burkina Faso where malaria and pneumonia are two major mortality causes in under five mortality.</detailed_description>
