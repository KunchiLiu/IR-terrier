	<brief_title>Pre-operative 3-DCRT vs IMRT for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-operative radiotherapy (RT) or chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) is internationally accepted as standard practice in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer. Multiple randomised trials have proved pre-operative CRT and RT, compared to surgery alone, reduce local recurrence, even prior to optimal surgery, and may improve survival for T3 circumferential resection margin (CRM) negative patients. This study aims to determine if 3-DCRT or IMRT result in lower incidence of grade 2 GI toxicities. Acute toxicities will be assessed weekly during radiotherapy, and at 2 and 4 week post treatment. Late toxicities will be assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months post treatment, and annually to 10 years.</detailed_description>
