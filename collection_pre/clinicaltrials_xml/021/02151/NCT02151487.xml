	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized, observer-blinded clinical trial is to evaluate the anesthetic and analgesic efficacy of adding dexamethasone and clonidine to ropivacaine in supraclavicular nerve block. The investigators hypothesized that addition of dexamethasone and clonidine to ropivacaine would prolong the duration of analgesia in supraclavicular nerve block compared with ropivacaine alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Ropivacaine Alone Versus Combination of Dexamethasone and Clonidine for Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately, 50 patients in each groups undergoing orthopedic surgery of upper extremities will be randomized to be one of the three groups to receive supraclavicular nerve block with group 1: ropivacaine alone; group 2: ropivacaine and dexamethasone; group 3: ropivacaine and clonidine or group 4: ropivacaine and dexamethasone and clonidine combination. Patients will be identified at the day surgery unit at Parkland hospital before the procedure and will be approached by their physician, the primary investigator, or research personnel for the consent for the study. If the patient chooses and consents fully to participate, he or she will be randomly assigned to receive one of the previously described local anesthetics for supraclavicular nerve block. The following clinical outcome will be assessed for up to 24 hr: Duration of the block, onset of the block, nausea, the number of vomiting, and complications of peripheral nerve block and used medications will be recorded. Pain at rest and movement will be evaluated by using a linear 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS; 0=no pain, 10= worst imaginable pain) immediately before the block, 5, 10, 15 minutes and 6 hr. after the block and postoperatively immediately at PACU, discharge from the Day surgery Unit, and 24 hr. later at home via phone call visit. Sensory and motor block in the related nerve dermatomes (via pinprick test) will be assessed. Patient will be instructed to document at what time did hand motion (finger movement) return and what time normal sensation (hot/cold) return. Specific time for both events will be asked to patient at phone call visit 24 hr later. Overall patient satisfaction will be evaluated at the discharge from the day surgery and 24 hr after the block via phone visit. At any point in which the patient is not experiencing pain relief after having received the injection, they will be removed from the study and other anesthetic techniques will be applied to resolve their pain along with pharmacological management of their pain. Rescue antiemetic, which is standard of care, will be given to any patient who complains of nausea or vomiting.</detailed_description>
