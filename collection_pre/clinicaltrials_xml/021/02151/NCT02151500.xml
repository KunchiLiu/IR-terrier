	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of providing an experiential assessment interview that targets emotional and stressful experiences in primary care. In this randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will compare an interview condition to a wait-list control condition. The investigators hypothesize that helping individuals first identify the links between their stress and symptoms will likely increase their awareness and endorsement of the link between stress and physical symptoms, including a willingness to engage in stress management techniques. It is also expected that helping raise an individual's awareness about their symptoms, followed by an experience and expression of unexpressed emotions is likely to influence their physical symptoms and psychological status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emotional stress, particularly when a patients inhibits their experiences and feelings, contributes to physical symptoms. However, primary care patients with medically unexplained symptoms are rarely assessed for the stress and emotions in an comprehensive manner. The goal of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of providing an experiential assessment interview that targets emotional and stressful experiences in primary care with medically unexplained physical symptoms. In this randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will compare an interview condition to a wait-list control condition. The interview will review patients health history, psychosocial history, make links between the two, and help patients identify and express emotions related to conflicts or victimization. The investigators hypothesize that helping individuals first identify the links between their stress and symptoms will likely increase their awareness and endorsement of the link between stress and physical symptoms, including a willingness to engage in stress management techniques. It is also expected that helping raise an individual's awareness about their symptoms, followed by an experience and expression of unexpressed emotions is likely to influence their physical symptoms and psychological status.</detailed_description>
