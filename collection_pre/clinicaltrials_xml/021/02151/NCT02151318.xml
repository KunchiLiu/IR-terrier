	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will collect tissue from patients undergoing trabeculectomy for primary open-angle glaucoma treatment. This tissue would normally be discarded. These trabecular meshwork (TM) cells can be cultured and used experimentally to better understand the mechanisms of glaucoma. These TM biopsies will be cultured on the same day as the trabeculectomy using established techniques.</brief_summary>
