	<brief_summary>Plantar warts can be bothersome and painful requiring treatment. The investigators will compare the efficacy of pyruvic acid and salicylic acid in treating multiple plantar warts. Patients with multiple plantar warts will be randomized to receive either pyruvic acid 70% or compound salicylic acid solution (salicylic acid 16.7%, lactic acid 16.7%, and collodion 100%) applying topically twice a day for 4 weeks. Patients will be visited every 2 weeks for one month after starting treatment and then every one month for up to 3 months. The number and size of warts will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
