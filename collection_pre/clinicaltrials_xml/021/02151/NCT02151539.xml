	<brief_summary>This research trial studies medical chart review in determining outcomes of second-line therapy in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease previously treated with extracorporeal photopheresis or other systemic therapies. Gathering information about second-line therapy in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease may help doctors learn more about the disease and find better treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Outcomes of Second-Line Therapy in Acute Graft-Versus-Host Study Including ECP (POSTAGE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine 6-month freedom from treatment failure for second-line therapy for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). II. To show that extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is associated with a superior 6 month (m) freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) as compared to other treatment modalities for second line therapy for aGVHD. III. To describe health care burden in patients receiving second line therapy for acute GVHD. IV. Quality of life measurement using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) in patients receiving second line therapy for aGVHD. OUTLINE: Study data are collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools at baseline and on days 5, 28, and 56. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Enrollment on study is within 5 days (including weekends) of starting secondline therapy aGVHD grade 2 or higher at time of enrollment; patients with late acute and recurrent aGVHD are permitted Donor lymphocyte induced aGVHD is permitted ONLY IF donor lymphocyte infusion given for mixed chimerism and not for progression of disease and meeting all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible Corticosteroid refractory or corticosteroid dependent aGVHD Corticosteroid refractory aGVHD is defined as worsening of aGVHD after 3 days of systemic corticosteroids (minimum dose of 1 mg/kg), or no improvement after 7 days of systemic corticosteroids (minimum dose of 1 mg/kg) Corticosteroid dependent aGVHD is defined as recurrence of aGVHD (grade 2 or higher) during corticosteroid taper and prior to reaching 50% of initial starting dose of corticosteroids Informed consent form Has received corticosteroids at 2 mg/kg or higher for 3 weeks or longer as part of firstline therapy for aGVHD Has received systemic therapy other than corticosteroids for treatment of aGVHD as part of firstline therapy for acute GVHD; simultaneous uses of topical or enteric corticosteroids or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) for firstline are permitted aGVHD after second hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is excluded Karnofsky performance status =&lt; 50% Requiring mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy at the time of enrollment Histologic or flowcytometric evidence of relapse or progression of underlying disease; molecular or cytogenetic presence of disease is permitted; mixed chimerism is permitted Current or prior diagnosis of chronic GVHD (classic or overlap) as defined by National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)induced aGVHD when DLI was given for progression of the underlying disease</criteria>
