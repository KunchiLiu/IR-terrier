	<brief_summary>Sciatica is a common pain problem that affects not only the patient but also constitutes a socioeconomic burden and thus affects the whole society. So far, current pharmacologic therapies are inadequate for many patients. Therefore, we evaluated application of high-tone external muscle stimulation (HTEMS) compared to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on radicular pain associated with sciatica.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospital patients (n=100) with chronic sciatica and stable oral analgesic regimen were included into this randomized controlled cross-over trial. Each intervention was administered for a period of 45 min 5 times within 10 days, with a 3-day wash-out period before cross-over. Health impairments had been assessed using the visual analog scales (VAS) for radicular pain before and after intervention and differences in radicular pain between groups were analysed with the Mann-Whitney test.</detailed_description>
