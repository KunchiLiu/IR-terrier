	<brief_title>Pregnancy After Stem Cell Transplantation in Premature Ovarian Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out of 112 high risk patients for POF, diagnosis was established in 10 cases. Endometrial fractional biopsy was taken, stained with H&amp;E stain and by immubohistchemical (IH) staining by stem cell marker OCT4. IH expression of stem cell marker OCT4 was evaluated before and after transplantation according to Edessy Stem Cell Score (ESS). After laparoscopic injection of stem cell sample in the ovaries, participants were followed up monthly for a period of one year by hormonal (FSH, LH and E2), clinical (resuming menstruation), US (folliculometry), histopathological (HP), and IH expression of stem cell (stem cell positivity and scoring according to ESS). These cases were of ESS 5 and 6.</detailed_description>
