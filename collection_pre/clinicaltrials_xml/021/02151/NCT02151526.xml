	<criteria>1. Be between 5 and 35 years of age, inclusive. 2. Have severe sickle cell disease (SCD) or transfusion dependent betathalassemia major, regardless of the genotype with the diagnosis confirmed by Hb studies. Transfusion dependence is defined as requiring at least 100 mL/kg/year of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). 3. Be eligible for allogeneic HSC transplant based on institutional medical guidelines, but without a matched related donor. 4. Have been treated and followed for at least the past 2 years in a specialized center that maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history. Subjects with severe SCD also must: 5. Have failed to achieve adequate clinical benefit following hydroxyurea treatment with sufficient dosage, for at least 4 months unless this treatment was not indicated or not well tolerated. 6. Have 1 or more of the following poor prognostic risk factors: Recurrent vaso occlusive crises (at least 2 episodes in the preceding year or in the year prior to start of a regular transfusion program). Presence of any significant cerebral abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (such as stenosis or occlusions). Stroke without any severe cognitive disability. Osteonecrosis of 2 or more joints. Antierythrocyte alloimmunization (&gt;2 antibodies). Presence of sickle cell cardiomyopathy documented by Doppler echocardiography. Acute chest syndrome (at least 2 episodes) defined by an acute event with pneumonialike symptoms (e.g., cough, fever [&gt;38.5°C], acute dyspnea, expectoration, chest pain, findings upon lung auscultation, tachypnea, or wheezing) and the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate. Subjects with a chronic oxygen saturation &lt;90% (excluding periods of SCD crisis) or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) less than 60% in the absence of an infection should not be included in the study. 1. Availability of a willing 10 /10 matched HLA identical sibling hematopoietic cell donor, unless recommendation for enrollment is provided by the Comité de Surveillance following a review of the case. 2. Clinically significant, active bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection. 3. Contraindication to anesthesia for bone marrow harvesting. 4. Any prior or current malignancy, myeloproliferative or immunodeficiency disorder. 5. A white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3×10^9/L and/or platelet count &lt;120×10^9/L. 6. History of major organ damage including: Liver disease, with transaminase levels &gt;3× upper limit of normal. This observation will not be exclusionary if a liver biopsy shows no evidence of extensive bridging fibrosis, cirrhosis, or acute hepatitis. Histopathological evidence of extensive bridging fibrosis, cirrhosis, or acute hepatitis on liver biopsy. Heart disease, with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;25%. Kidney disease with a calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30% normal value. Severe iron overload, which in the opinion of the physician is grounds for exclusion. A cardiac T2* &lt;10 ms by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Evidence of clinically significant pulmonary hypertension requiring medical intervention.</criteria>
