	<brief_summary>No prospective randomized trials have evaluated the most efficacious dose of cyclophosphamide to mobilize autologous stem cells. We previously demonstrated that the time to collection of autologous hematopoietic stem cells is 10-12 days following the one dose of cyclophosphamide and daily G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor).9 This prospective randomized trial is designed to determine if a lower dose of cyclophosphamide (1.5 gm/m2) will be as efficacious as the intermediate dose (3 gm/m2), based on cell number collected, number of apheresis required and resource utilization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have a pathologic diagnosis of one of the following malignancies: NonHodgkin's Lymphoma, including B and Tcell lymphoma Multiple Myeloma or another plasma cell dyscrasia (Waldenstrom, Amyloidosis) The patient must be approved for transplant by the treating Transplant physician. This must be the patient's FIRST mobilization attempt. Patients are eligible if an autologous transplant is planned within approximately 12 months from the time of collection of cells. Prior Treatment: No previous cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy. (This does not include immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies or steroids.) No radiation within 4 weeks of mobilization attempt. Age &gt;18, and &lt; 75 years No significant comorbid medical or psychiatric illness that would significantly compromise the patient's clinical care and chances of survival. Informed consent must be signed prior to the treatment. Patients must willingly consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks and discomforts. (Human protection committee approval of this protocol and a consent form is required.) Medical, social, or psychological factors that would prevent the patient from receiving or cooperating with the full course of therapy. Documented hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used in the protocol.</criteria>
