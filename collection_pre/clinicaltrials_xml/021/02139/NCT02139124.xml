	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of PRC-063 in Adult ADHD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, forced-dose titration in which adult subjects (18 years of age or older) with ADHD will be randomized to PRC-063 (25, 45, 70 or 100 mg) or placebo for four weeks of double-blind evaluation of safety and efficacy. The study will have four phases: (1) screening and 1-week washout; (2)baseline and double-blind, forced-dose titration over a 2-week period; (3) double-blind evaluation over a 2-week period; and (4) a 14-day safety follow-up. Subjects will be required to visit the site 6 times over a 5 week period. Screening and Washout: Subjects will be screened to establish eligibility for study participation. Subjects who meet eligibility requirements will undergo ADHD medication washout, if applicable.</detailed_description>
