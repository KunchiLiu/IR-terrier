	<brief_summary>Several prospective trials and metaanalysis have demonstrated the superiority of bariatric surgery on the medical treatment of obesity. The Roux-en-Y Gastric ByPass (RYGBP) procedure has been practiced for more than 30 years, and is the procedure of choice for morbidly obese with metabolic disorders in most of the reference centers. Nevertheless, the RYGBP is a technically demanding procedure with a learning curve of more than 75 cases. The complication rate is around 10% in expert centers. More recently another procedure has been described which seems as efficient on weight loss and co-morbidities as the RYGBP, with the advantage of being less technically difficult and less morbid, especially for multi-complicated obese and/or the super obese. It consists of a unique gastro-jejunal anastomosis between a long gastric pouch and a jejunal Omega loop. However, this procedure could be at risk of biliary reflux and anastomotic ulcers with dysplastic changes of the gastric and esophageal mucosa. As a result, the Omega loop bypass (OLB) has only been developed by a few teams and remains a controversial subject, particularly as only one monocentric randomized trial has compared it to the RYGBP, which is remains the gold standard. The first litterature results show similar or even better weight loss efficiency than RYGBP with a better feasibility. The early complication rate seems lower, but there are still insufficient data on long term morbidity and biliary reflux consequences. By performing a randomized and prospective comparison of OLB to RYGBP, the aim of the investigators study is to analyze the weight loss efficiency, the morbidity and mortality, the feasibility, and the quality of life of both techniques, in order to validate the Omega loop bypass as a procedure of choice in bariatric surgery Hypothesis : The OLB, while being as efficient as RYGBP on weight loss and metabolic complications, could be less morbid.</brief_summary>
