	<brief_title>Therapeutic Response of Ultrasound and Muscular Stretching in Temporomandibular Disorder Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic response of ultrasound (US) and ultrasound associated with stretching of the masticatory muscles on the pressure pain threshold and the electrical activity of masseter and anterior temporal muscles in Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) patients . The study included 18 women with TMD diagnosed by the instrument Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC / TMD). The pressure pain threshold, evaluated through algometry, and the electrical activity of the masticatory muscles were evaluated, by means of surface electromyography, before and immediately after the therapeutic procedures. The volunteers underwent three different interventions: ultrasound, ultrasound associated with stretching and ultrasound placebo, with a 1-week of minimum interval between them.</detailed_description>
