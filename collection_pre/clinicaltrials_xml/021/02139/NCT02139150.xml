	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if PET/CT scans that use a radioactive substance called [18F] fluorothymidine (FLT), can detect and monitor changes in the tumor. Radioactive substances are used with PET/CT scans to "see" cancer cells, and are also called radiotracers. FLT is a new radiotracer that has been given to people in prior studies. FLT PET/CT is an experimental scan unlike FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET scan which is a standard clinical scan and is commonly used. The investigators would like to know if there is any evidence of early treatment response by obtaining FLTPET/ CT scans before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serial FLT PET Imaging in Cancer Patients for Monitoring of Response to Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol is an "umbrella" or "companion" protocol to be used in conjunction with other protocols that are evaluating treatment response in solid or hematologic malignancies. The aim of this protocol is to determine if PET imaging with the proliferation marker 18FFLT can monitor changes in FLT uptake parameters, in particular changes in the standardized uptake value (SUV), within tumor target lesions.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with histologicallyconfirmed (confirmation done at MSKCC) malignancies. Patients who have consented to a therapeutic protocol for the treatment of their cancer. Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years old. Patients who cannot undergo PET/CT scanning (i.e. because of weight limits, claustrophobia). Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
