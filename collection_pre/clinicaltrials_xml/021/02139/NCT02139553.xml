	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether rhythmic upper-limb movement training in post-stroke patients allows to improve only this particular type of movements or if it also improves some parameters of discrete movements. Based on our results we hope to be able to answer a fundamental question: are rhythmic and discrete movements two independent primitives?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Rhythmic Upper-limb Training in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are assessed four times during this longitudinal study. One month separates the first two assessment, next patients are trained 12 times during one month with rhythmic movement training on an end-effector robot. After this month, patients are assessed a third time and three months later a fourth time in order to study long-time benefits of the therapy.</detailed_description>
