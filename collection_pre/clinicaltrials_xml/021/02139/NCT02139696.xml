	<detailed_description>Background and Rationale In multiple sclerosis (MS), significant pathology correlating to disease progression, to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and to cognitive decline, takes place outside the plaque areas, i.e. in areas of normal appearing white matter and gray matter. Neuropathological studies suggest that mechanisms involved in this widespread pathology include activation of microglial cells, oxidative stress and deficiency in mitochondrial functions. Activated microglia can be detected in vivo with a translocator protein (TSPO), expressed in activated, but not resting microglia) binding radioligands and positron emission tomography (PET). 11Carbon-PK11195 radioligand is one such radioligand. Importantly, the possible effect of MS therapies on microglial activity can be evaluated in patients in vivo with PET-imaging performed before and after the treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Having signed the informed consent of the investigatorinitiated PET study Age 18 58 years at the time of informed consent. MS according to Poser or McDonald criteria EDSS score from 0.0 to 6.5. Moderate to heavy lesion load ( &gt;9 T2 lesions) in MRI Patients with other neurodegenerative disease than MS Disease modifying therapy (DMT) within 4 weeks of imaging Corticosteroid treatment within 4 weeks of imaging Patients with significant abnormal findings other than MS in the screening MRI. Patients with claustrophobia, or a history of moderate to severe anxiety disorder or panic attacks (which could potentially lead to preterm termination of the imaging) Contraindication to PET scan investigations Exposure to experimental radiation in the past 12 months such that radiodosimetry limits would be exceeded by participating in this study. Intolerance to previous PET scans; i.e. previous hypersensitivity reactions to any PET ligand or imaging agent or failure to participate in and comply with previous PET scans.</criteria>
