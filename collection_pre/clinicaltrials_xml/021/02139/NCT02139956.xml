	<brief_summary>Continent women have an intact internal urethral sphincter that extends from the bladder neck down to the perineal membrane. The internal urethral sphincter is a strong collagen muscle tissue cylinder lined by urothelium. On ultrasound scanning tissue echo will be detected torn internal urethral sphincter will not stand sudden rise of abdominal pressure. Three dimensional ultrasound assessment of the internal urethral sphincter is very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The internal urethral sphincter used to be said it's a muscular ring but the investigators will visualize by three dimensional ultrasound it's a cylinder in shape and it's the cause of stress urinary incontinence by being torn by stretching the vagina during normal delivery.</detailed_description>
