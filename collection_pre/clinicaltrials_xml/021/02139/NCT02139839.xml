	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 delivered via capsules to the vagina of post-menopausal women over a three day course of treatment can restore and maintain a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Exploratory analysis of microbial ecology, human microarrays and multiplex immunological assessments are included to characterize potential effects.</brief_summary>
