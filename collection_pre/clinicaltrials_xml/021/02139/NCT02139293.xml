	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of auricular autonomous nervous system stimulation on cardiovascular parameters and sympathovagal balance in healthy subjects. It is investigated if auricular vagal nerve stimulation affects heart rate variability as well as peripheral local blood perfusion, and if this effect depends on the site of stimulation in the auricle, whereas four distinct stimulation points are tested.</brief_summary>
