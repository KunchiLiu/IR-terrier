	<brief_summary>It is a randomized prospective controlled study of transcatheter renal denervation in patients with Heart Failure With Normal LV Ejection Fraction. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in patients with Heart Failure With Normal LV Ejection Fraction, due to reduction in renal and systemic sympathetic activity.</brief_summary>
