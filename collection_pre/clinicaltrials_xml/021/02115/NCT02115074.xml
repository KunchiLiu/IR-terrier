	<brief_summary>Optico-chiasmatic gliomas have therapeutic feature since surgical resection plays a secondary role. Unlike other sites, many of these tumors are not amenable to complete resection either because of anatomical location, and sometimes they only can be biopsied. A substantial number of children will have recurrences following resection or will experience progression following incomplete tumor removal or biopsy. Celebrex is a Cox-2 inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties, while statins are known to increase the sensitivity of gliomas to anti-tumor agents. Their association could be administered for long periods, in the hope of much reduced risk of toxicities. This is a national, multicentric, interventional, open-label, non-comparative, and non-randomized phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of the Fluvastatin in combination with fixed-dose of Celebrex. This project involves 10 SFCE health centers accustomed to phase I / II studies(Société Française de Lutte contre les Cancers et Leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - French Society for the Fight against Cancer and Leukemia in Children and Adolescents).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Fluvastatin-Celebrex Association in Low-grade and High Grade Optico-chiasmatic Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method : the total number of patients and the number of dose levels tested will depend upon the safety data that occurred in the previous level. A minimum of two patients will be included in each dose level. The second patient will be included after a sufficient time to assess the absence of dose-limiting toxicity in the first patient level, or within 3 weeks of treatment. The first cycle of the first patient must be monitored before proposing transition to the next level. Dose escalation : the safety data for each dose level will be reviewed and discussed before the transition to the next level. An IDMC will meet at the end the dose escalation step, and will decide the possibility of extending the study to 14 additional patients at a dose level set below the maximum tolerated dose.</detailed_description>
