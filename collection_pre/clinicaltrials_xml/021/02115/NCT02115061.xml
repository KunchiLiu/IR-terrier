	<brief_summary>The purpose of the spring is to maintain the cyanoacrylate polymer of the gastric varix, forming a conglomerate spring-cyanoacrylate, and thus preventing their migration to the adhesive embolism. The introduction of the spring is held by a echo-guided puncture. The window can be puncture through the distal esophagus or directly in the gastric varix via retroflexion to the fundus. Another advantage of this technique is its use in the presence of bleeding, when large amounts of blood in the stomach hinders the injection of the cyanoacrylate, by pricking the distal esophagus that difficulty decreases. The first study of this technique was performed by Binmoeller et al (21) and had good results with 100% hemostasis and low rebleeding rate (16%), but more studies are needed to prove the safety and efficacy of this technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastric Varices Treatment: Coil + Cyanoacrylate Versus Cyanoacrylate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE Compare the results of the treatment of gastric varices, coil associated with cianoarilato versus cyanoacrylate in patients with systemic shunts in relation to efficacy and embolic complications. PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS Drawing This is a prospective clinical trial, double-blind, comparative, randomized, single center, performed on quaternary level hospital involving patients with portal hypertension with gastric varices type 2 GOV or IGV 1. 28 cirrhotic patients will be randomized to the treatment of gastric varices type GOV2 IGV1 or more cyanoacrylate Cyanoacrylate or only patients with splenorenal shunt or gastrorenal spring. After signing the consent form, patients will undergo CT angiography to evaluate the presence of shunt and classification of the same. Patients without shunt will be excluded from the protocol. Dopller colored portal system will also be conducted in all patients prior to treatment for analysis of portal flow. After confirming the presence of shunt patients will be examined by echo-endoscopy for completion of treatment The following data will be collected: demographic data (age and gender), etiology of cirrhosis, degree of liver function, primary or secondary prophylaxis diameter of gastric varix, varices of the esophagus with or without signs of red color, size and type of shunt detected by CT, amount of springs inserted, number of ampoules of Cyanoacrylate injected complications (bleeding, damage to the endoscope by cyanoacrylate)</detailed_description>
