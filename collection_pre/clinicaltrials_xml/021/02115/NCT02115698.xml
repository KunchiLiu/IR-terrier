	<brief_summary>Up to 66 healthy elderly individuals (at least 65 years old) are recruited as subjects. They will be recruited as a subgroup to protocol ID: H-4-2013-070. Upon inclusion, each individual will be randomized into one of the five groups stratified according to gender (M/F) and 30s chair stand (&lt;16 OR â‰¥16). The five groups are: Heavy Resistance Training (N=12), Light Intensity Training (N=12), Protein Whey (N=15), Protein Collagen (N=15) and Carbohydrate (N=12). The individuals randomized into one of the supplementation groups (Protein Whey, Protein Collagen or Carbohydrate) will be blinded to the supplement content. Assessments will be performed at Baseline (before intervention start) and after 12 months of intervention. The primary outcomes are measures of muscle protein synthesis rate measured as the fractional synthesis rate from Baseline to 12 months of intervention. The hypotheses are i) that basal and protein-stimulated muscle protein synthesis rates are elevated in the exercise training groups after 12 months of intervention. ii) prolonged intake of protein of different quality will improve the muscle protein synthetic response to protein intake after 12 months of intervention.</brief_summary>
