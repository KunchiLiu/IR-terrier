	<brief_summary>Research has shown that nearly 50% of patients with chronic conditions around the globe do not adhere to their prescribed medicine, leading to enormous cost to the healthcare providers. Non-adherence can be due to various forms and have multiple causes. To address this need, Philips Research has developed Medication Non-adherence model. This tool will help in developing a systemic way of assessing medication non-adherence and providing decision support for targeted intervention to healthcare professionals. The aim of this study is to validate this model with 750 chronically ill patients in UK.</brief_summary>
