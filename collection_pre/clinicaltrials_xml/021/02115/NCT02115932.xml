	<brief_summary>People with diabetes can have nerve damage in their extremities (peripheral neuropathy), and this can lead them to being less able to maintain their balance when they are standing, walking or performing complex movement tasks in their day-to-day life. This results in them being more prone to falls, and consequent injuries. The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing strength and balance retraining (in the form of specific physical exercises or activities) can help people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy regain their ability to maintain their balance, increase their confidence in performing balance-based activities and improve their quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Physical Therapy in Improving the Health of Patients With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) comprise 16-24% of patients with diabetes mellitus in Singapore, and this is set to rise with the increasing prevalence of diabetes. DPN is also associated with the greatest reduction in health related quality of life (HRQoL) among all diabetic complications, specifically PCS (Physical health Component Summary) and its sub-components, physical functioning and physical role. However, there is currently no intervention that targets individuals with DPN for improvements in HRQoL and functional status. The investigators hypothesise that a targeted intervention providing strength and balance training will improve HRQoL and functional status in patients with DPN, which will be sufficiently large relative to increases in cost to make the intervention cost-efficient. The specific aims of the study are to test the effectiveness of a structured strength and balance training intervention in 1) improving the physical health component summary (PCS) measure of health related quality of life, 2) functional status, and 3) assessing cost-utility of the intervention, in individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).</detailed_description>
