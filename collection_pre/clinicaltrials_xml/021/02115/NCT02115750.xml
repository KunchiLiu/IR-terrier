	<brief_summary>This is a two part study comparing CHS-0214 to Enbrel in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response with Methotrexate (MTX) who are naive to biologic therapies. Pt.1 is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group, multi-center global study. The primary end point is 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR-20) at week 24. Comparing CHS-0214 to Enbrel for efficacy and safety. Pt. 2 is an open-label single arm study in which patients with at least an ACR-20 response receive CHS-0214. Continued response and safety will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
