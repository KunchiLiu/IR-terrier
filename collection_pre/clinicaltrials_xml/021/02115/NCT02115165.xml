	<brief_summary>Cabazitaxel is a new generation taxane with a high capacity for blood-brain barrier crossing and limited peripheral neuro-toxicity, two major potential advantages in patients with advanced NSGCTs. Cabazitaxel has a broader in vitro spectrum of activity than docetaxel. Taxanes have demonstrated activity in pre-treated GCTs and are now part of standard treatment, but cabazitaxel has not yet been tested in patients with NSGCT.</brief_summary>
