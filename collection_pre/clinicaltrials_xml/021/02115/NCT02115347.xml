	<brief_summary>This is a study to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of ertugliflozin (MK-8835, PF-04971729) in participants with hepatic impairment versus healthy participants. In Part 1 of the study, participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7-9) and matched healthy participants will be enrolled; depending on results in Part 1, Part 2 may be conducted and will enroll participants with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6).</brief_summary>
