	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine can help to control AML, high risk MDS, and/or CML in blast phase. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cladribine Plus Idarubicin Plus Cytarabine (ARAC) in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (HR MDS) or Myeloid Blast Phase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive treatment in 2 different parts: the Induction Cycle and the Consolidation Cycles. Participant will have 1 cycle of induction therapy first, followed by up to 5 cycles of consolidation therapy. Participant's doctor will tell them how many cycles they will have. This will be based on any response participant may have to the therapy. Each cycle is 28 days. During the Induction Cycle, on Days 1-5, participant will receive cladribine and cytarabine by vein over 1-2 hours. On Days 1-3, participant will receive idarubicin by vein over 30-60 minutes. During the Consolidation Cycles, on Days 1-3, participant will receive cladribine and cytarabine by vein over 1-2 hours. On Days 1-2, participant will receive idarubicin by vein over 30-60 minutes. If the disease has not started to get better after the first cycle, participant may receive an additional induction cycle, followed by 4 consolidation cycles. Study Visits: At the beginning of every cycle, participant will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time a week. If the disease starts to get better, the blood draws will happen every 2-4 weeks while participant is taking the study drug. After participant's last dose of study drug, the blood draws will happen every 4-8 weeks as long as they are on study. On Day 21 (+/- 7 days) of the first cycle participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to check the status of the disease. Participant may have another bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate later in the study if their doctor thinks it is needed. During treatment, participant will come to the clinic at least 1 time each week for the first month and then at least 1 time a month after that until they stop treatment. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have additional clinic visits after they stop treatment. Length of Treatment: Participant may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 cycles. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over when they have completed follow-up. Follow-Up Visits: After participant's last dose of study drug, they will be called every 6 -12 months by a member of the study staff to ask about any side effects they may be having. The phone call should take about 5-10 minutes. Participant will continue to be called for as long as possible. Participant will continue to have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests every 4-8 weeks while they are on study. Participant may also need to have additional blood draws as part of their standard of care. This is an investigational study. Cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of different kinds of leukemia. It is investigational to use these drugs in combination with each other. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 225 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with a diagnosis of AML, Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia, or high risk MDS (&gt;/= 10% blasts or IPSS &gt;/= intermediate2) will be eligible. Patients with CML in Myeloid Blast Phase are also eligible. 2. For Frontline cohort: No prior potentiallycurative therapy for leukemia. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, hematopoietic growth factors, azacytidine, decitabine, ATRA, or a total dose of cytarabine up to 2g (for emergency use for stabilization) is allowed. Patients with secondary AMLwho have been treated for their antecedent myeloid neoplasm will be enrolled into the separate Secondary AML cohort. 3. For Salvage cohort: Patients with previously treated, relapsed or refractory AML, Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia, or CML in Myeloid Blast Phase are eligible. 4. Age &lt;/= 65 years. 5. Adequate organ function as defined below: liver function (bilirubin &lt;/=2mg/dL, AST and/or ALT &lt;/=3 x ULN or &lt;5 x ULN if related to leukemic involvement), kidney function (creatinine &lt;/=1.5 x ULN ), known cardiac ejection fraction of &gt; or = 45% within the past 6 months 6. ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2. 7. A negative urine pregnancy test is required within 1 week for all women of childbearing potential prior to enrolling on this trial. 8. Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized representative is required prior to their enrollment on the protocol. 1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in this study have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided. 2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 3. Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapy program. 4. Men and women of childbearing potential who do not practice contraception. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.</criteria>
