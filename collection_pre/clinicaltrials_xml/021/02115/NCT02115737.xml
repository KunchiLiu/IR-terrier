	<brief_summary>Youth with depressive symptoms are at risk for a range of problems later in life. This includes problematic interpersonal relationships, occupational stress, and the occurrence of adult mental disorders. The main purpose of this study is to test how effective two types of group therapy are at reducing depressive symptoms in youth. A focus on group therapy is important because group therapy allows for many youth to be treated in a short amount of time. Group therapy is also helpful because youth can get social support and feel less alone in their symptoms when they participate in group. This study compares two groups, one that targets skills for managing difficult emotional experiences (dialectical behavior therapy skills group) and another group focuses on psychoeducation and is based on a publicly available treatment manual from the Services for Teens At Risk (STAR) Center at the University of Pittsburgh. The results of this study will provide insights regarding the comparative efficacy of these two treatments, and regarding predictors of treatment response.</brief_summary>
