	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug combination grazoprevir (GZR; MK-5172) + elbasvir (EBR; MK-8742) in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1, 4, or 6 infection and who have cirrhosis and Child-Pugh (CP) score 7-9 moderate hepatic insufficiency (CP-B). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of HCV-infected participants with hepatic insufficiency (the CP-B population) achieving sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of all treatment (SVR12) will be greater than 60%. Additionally, ten non-cirrhotic (NC) HCV-infected GT1 participants will also be given GZR + EBR at the beginning of the study; this will be done for the purpose of collecting plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data in HCV GT1-infected participants who do not have hepatic insufficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Efficacy and Safety of Grazoprevir (MK-5172) + Elbasvir (MK-8742) in Chronic Hepatitis C Participants With Child-Pugh (CP)-B Hepatic Insufficiency (MK-5172-059)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted sequentially in 3 Parts. Each participant will participate in only one Part. Participants will be enrolled in either Part A, Part B, or Part C: - Part A: CP-B participants will receive GZR 50 mg+ EBR 50 mg; NC participants will receive GZR 100 mg/EBR 50 mg. - Part B: CP-B participants will receive GZR 100 mg + EBR 50 mg. - Part C: CP-B participants will receive either GZR 50 mg or 100 mg + EBR 50 mg. Study progression from Part A to Part B and from Part B to Part C will be based upon a review of safety and efficacy in Parts A and B, respectively. Depending upon safety and efficacy in Part A, the study may progress directly from Part A to Part C using GZR 50 mg + EBR 50 mg, without performing Part B.</detailed_description>
