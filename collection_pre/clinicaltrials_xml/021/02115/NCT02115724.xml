	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Other studies have shown that stress, early in life, could be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, later in life. This study will look at the effect of early life stressors on your cardiovascular health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitric Oxide Bioavailability and Early Life Stress (NO-Stress)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will have two parts involved to investigate the role that childhood SES status has on cardiovascular health. Part one: Subjects will give a blood sample which will be processed and analyzed. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) and Pulse wave velocity (PWV/PWA) will be performed at baseline and 2 hours following either a single dose oral antioxidant cocktail (1000 mg of Vitamin C, 600 IU of Vitamin E, and 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid) or placebo on two days separated by at least 72 hours. Nitroglycerin mediated dilation (NMD, 0.4mg sub-lingual nitroglycerin spray), will be assessed at baseline. Part two: Subjects, if interested will undergo a subcutaneous gluteal/hip fat biopsy. Micro vessels will be isolated from the adipose tissue and analyzed by pressurized myography for endothelial function and nitric oxide bioavailability.</detailed_description>
