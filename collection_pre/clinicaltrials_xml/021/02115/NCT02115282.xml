	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies exemestane and entinostat to see how well they work compared to exemestane alone in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or another place in the body. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether exemestane is more effective with or without entinostat in treating breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exemestane With or Without Entinostat in Treating Patients With Recurrent Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer That is Locally Advanced or Metastatic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to endocrine therapy (exemestane) improves progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have previously progressed on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Al). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with exemestane, and to compare the safety profile to that of endocrine therapy with placebo. II. To evaluate the objective response rate of exemestane in combination with entinostat or placebo. III. To evaluate whether the efficacy of exemestane with entinostat varies with changes in acetylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). IV. To evaluate the time to treatment deterioration (as defined by decrease in health-related quality of life [HRQL], progression, death) of exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms. V. To evaluate the differences in overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) between the exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms. VI. To evaluate the difference with respect to specific symptoms that are associated with entinostat, i.e., fatigue, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea, between the exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms. VII. To measure adherence to protocol therapy. VIII. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in patients with advanced breast cancer. IX. To evaluate what, if any, patient variables alter the pharmacokinetic profile of entinostat in patients with advanced breast cancer. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect archival tumor samples and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to explore other potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy. II. To collect patient ratings of adverse events (AEs) using select patient-reported outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) items to evaluate the psychometric properties of PRO-CTCAE items and explore the incorporation of PRO-CTCAE items into a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and entinostat PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients receive exemestane as in Arm A and placebo PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In both arms, pre/perimenopausal female patients and all male patients also receive goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with staining of &gt;= 1% cells will be considered positive; receptor status may be based on any time during treatment prior to study randomization, and from any site (i.e. primary, recurrent, or metastatic) Patients whose tumors have HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, in situ hybridization (ISH) &gt;= 2.0, or average HER2 copy number &gt;= 6.0 signals per cell are not eligible; receptor status may be based on any time during treatment prior to study randomization, and from any site (i.e. primary, recurrent, or metastatic) Patients must have measurable or nonmeasurable stage III/locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the breast where local therapy with curative intent is not possible; lesions must be evaluated =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study randomization; diagnosticquality computed tomography (CT) scans with both oral and intravenous (IV) contrast are the expected radiologic method, unless an alternative is approved NOTE: Where baseline imaging has already been performed =&lt; 6 weeks prior to study randomization, repeat imaging may not be required Pre/peri and postmenopausal women and all men are eligible for this trial; postmenopausal is defined as: Age &gt;= 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea, with estradiol &lt; 20 pg/ml Age &lt; 55 with prior hysterectomy but intact ovaries, with estradiol &lt; 20 pg/ml Prior bilateral oophorectomy NOTE: Women who do not fit the criteria for being postmenopausal as above are deemed preor perimenopausal; pre/perimenopausal women and all men can enroll provided they agree to receive concomitant luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist; pre/perimenopausal women must have commenced treatment with LHRH agonist at least 4 weeks prior to randomization; if patients have received alternative LHRH agonist prior to study entry, they must switch to goserelin for the duration of the trial Sexually active males and pre/perimenopausal women must agree to use an accepted and effective method of contraception or to abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study and for 3 months after discontinuation of therapy Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding;
