	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Improvement of Chronic Low-grade AEs in Patients With Ph+ CML With Optimal Response to Imatinib When Switched to Nilotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale for study was the fact that Nilotinib is approved for the treatment of chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in adult patients resistant to or intolerant to prior therapy that included imatinib (400 mg BID), and for new diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in CP (300 mg BID). But the majority of CML patients treated with imatinib experience adverse reactions at some time. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash. Although the majority of adverse events experienced on imatinib are mild to moderate in grade and most either resolve or diminish over time, low grade adverse events requiring chronic treatment do occur which may adversely impact a patient's quality of life. This study will examine changes in chronic low grade chronic adverse events, measured by CTCAE, when patients are switched from imatinib to nilotinib therapy. So, Primary Objective for this study is to evaluate changes in chronic low grade non-hematological adverse events experienced by patients who have been treated with at least 6 months of imatinib and who have not responded to supportive measures, when they are switched to nilotinib (CTCAE grading system). Primary endpoint is: Changes of non-hematological AE grade at 3 months after switch to nilotinib. Secondary Objectives are: Rate of CCyR after switch to nilotinib (both newly achieved (if absent at baseline) or maintained) at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after switch to nilotinib; Rate of MMR at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after switch; Time to and duration of CCyR and MMR after switch until study end; Time to first documented and optimal improvement of the non-hematological adverse event(s) associated with imatinib; Overall nilotinib safety profile; QOL changes after switch to nilotinib and within the study period - measure at baseline (for imatinib) and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months; Evaluation of patients' experience with switching from imatinib to nilotinib due to low-grade chronic toxicity (diary) Study Design: Open-label, single arm study assessing the changes in chronic low grade adverse events when CML-CP patients are switched from imatinib to nilotinib therapy. Patients must have been treated with starting imatinib dose of 400 mg and at least 300mg QD of imatinib for ≥ 6 months and experience ≤ Grade 2 adverse events which persist ≥ 2 months despite maximal supportive care. Patients have to be optimal responders to imatinib according to LeukemiaNet 2009 criteria at the study entrance. Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE guidelines at baseline and will be assessed throughout the trial at each visit. Patients will be treated with nilotinib 300mg BID on study and followed up to 2 years. Number of patients &amp; centers: 40 patients, 8 centers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age ECOG ≤ 2 Diagnosis of CMLCP &lt; 15% blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow &lt; 30% blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow &lt; 20% basophils in the peripheral blood ≥ 100 x 109 /L platelets No evidence of extramedullary leukemic involvement, with the exception of hepatosplenomegaly. Optimal response to imatinib according to LeukamiaNet 2009 criteria defined as: MCR 6 months after starting imatinib CCR 12 months after starting imatinib MMR 18 months after starting imatinib (MMR response defined either as 3 log reduction of bcrabl/abl ratio or as 0,1% by IS). Initial treatment with 400mg imatinib with current treatment with imatinib 400 mg or 300 QD. Imatinib dose interruptions are allowed prior to inclusion but should not exceed 28 consecutive days Persistent Grade 1 2 nonhematological adverse events for at least 2 months despite supportive care. Toxicity will be evaluated by treating physician using CTCAE criteria. In case of several types of nonhematological AEs Adequate end organ function defined by Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN SGOT(AST) and SGPT (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Serum amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless considered tumor related Serum potassium and magnesium values ≥ LLN (lower limit of normal) or corrected to within normal limits with supplements prior to first dose of study medication. Patients must have an imatinib washout period of at least 3 days and not to exceed 7 days prior to the first dose of nilotinib. Ability to provide written informed consent prior to any study related screening procedures being done minimal duration of imatinib therapy 6 months Loss of response (hematologic, cytogenetic, molecular) any time prior to inclusion Prior accelerated phase or blast phase CML Previously documented T315I mutation Presence of chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 8) and/or clonal evolution other than Ph+.
