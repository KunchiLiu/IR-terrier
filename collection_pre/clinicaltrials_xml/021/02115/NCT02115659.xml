	<brief_summary>Triptolide was shown in experimental studies to inhibit the cyst formation and growth in ADPKD models, while triptolide-containing formulation was revealed to potentially slow the disease progression in several proteinuric ADPKD patients in our clinical practice. It remains to be shown the effect of triptolide-containing formulation on total kidney volume (TKV) enlargement and renal function protection in ADPKD patients.</brief_summary>
