	<brief_title>Nitrate Supplementation; Duration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral ingestion of nitrate (NO3-) in the form of both nitrate salts and beetroot juice has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure at rest and to also lower pulmonary oxygen uptake during exercise, in addition to improving exercise performance during cycle time trial. However, there has been no consensus on the optimal supplementation protocols, in terms of duration of supplementation to see these metabolic effects. Furthermore, a positive exercise performance effect of nitrate ingestion has primarily been observed in recreational athletes. The potentially ergogenic effects of nitrate in well-trained or elite athletes therefore remain to be fully established. Based on the gaps in current literature, our main goal will be to gain further insight into different aspects of nitrate supplementation to enhance (elite) sports performance. This will be investigated in this study by assessing the effect of an acute vs. chronic supplementation period of sodium nitrate (NaNO3-) on exercise performance.</detailed_description>
