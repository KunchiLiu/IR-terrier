	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is, starting from the Italian clinical practice in liver transplantation, to optimize the immunosuppressive therapy, considering specific patient characteristics as alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and short/long-term implications. Then efficacy and safety of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-withdrawal regimen will be evaluated in comparison with a CNI-minimization regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria at Baseline: Male and female liver transplant recipients who are ≥ 18 years of age, treated with a tacrolimusbased immunosuppressive regimen, who have received an induction therapy or i.v. steroids as per local clinical practice. Recipients of a fullsize or technically modified liver allograft will be eligible at 4 weeks (± 7 days) after liver transplantation. Allograft is functioning at an acceptable level by the time of Baseline as defined by the AST, ALT, total bilirubin levels ≤ 3 times ULN and INR &lt; 1.5 times ULN. Abbreviated MDRD4 eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Serum creatinine results obtained within 5 days prior to Baseline are acceptable. Inclusion criteria at Randomization: Effective tacrolimus minimization, confirmed by stable blood trough levels in the two months prior to randomization, i.e. verification of last two tacrolimus blood trough level ≤ 5 ng/mL in the two months prior to randomization. Investigators should make adjustments in tacrolimus dosing to continue to target trough levels ≤ 5 ng/mL prior to randomization. Abbreviated MDRD4 eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Serum creatinine results obtained within 5 days prior to Visit 5 are acceptable. Exclusion criteria at Baseline: Patients who are recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, (e.g., multivisceral or combined liverkidney transplants), or have previously received an organ or tissue transplanted, or who received an AB0 incompatible transplant. Patients who experienced more than one episode of treated biopsy proven acute rejection (BANFF ≥ 3 or RAI ≥ 7) or one steroidresistant acute rejection. Patients who require renal replacement therapy. Patients with a confirmed spot urine protein/creatinine ratio that indicates ≥1.0 g/24 hrs of proteinuria. History of malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, other than nonmetastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or HCC. Exclusion criteria at Randomization: Patients who experienced more than two episodes of treated biopsy proven acute rejection (BANFF ≥ 3 or RAI ≥ 7) since transplantation or one steroidresistant acute rejection during the runin period. Patients with a confirmed spot urine protein/creatinine ratio that indicates ≥ 3.0 g/24 hrs of proteinuria.</criteria>
