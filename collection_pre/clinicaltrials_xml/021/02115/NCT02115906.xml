	<brief_summary>Growth hormone (GH) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of body composition including ectopic lipid deposition in insulin sensitive organs like liver and skeletal muscle. Recent evidence indicates that the GH-IGF1 axis affects body composition via regulating mitochondrial oxidation capacity. Thus, excessive GH secretion by a pituitary adenoma (Acromegaly) might be accompanied by increased mitochondrial activity leading to inappropriately low intracellular lipid depots, especially in metabolically active tissue like liver and skeletal muscle. This study aims to assess metabolic activity and intracellular lipid content in skeletal muscle and liver in patients suffering from acromegaly compared to controls by 31P/1H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and in follow up examinations 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of GH lowering treatments including surgery, somatostatinanalogs or pegvisomant, as well as oral glucose tolerance tests at each examination to assess treatment responses and calculate validated parameters for insulin sensitivity and resistance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Growth hormone (GH) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of body composition including ectopic lipid deposition in insulin sensitive organs like liver and skeletal muscle. Direct inhibition of growth hormone action by a receptor antagonist has been shown to induce hepatic steatosis and growth hormone replacement decreases liver fat content in obese humans. Of note, recent evidence indicates that the GH-IGF1 axis affects body composition via regulating mitochondrial oxidation capacity. Hypothesis: Direct and/or indirect effects of GH on mitochondrial function might mediate the changes in body composition and lipid deposition. Thus, excessive GH secretion by a pituitary adenoma (Acromegaly) might be accompanied by increased mitochondrial activity leading to inappropriately low intracellular lipid depots, especially in metabolically active tissue like liver and skeletal muscle. Aim: Assessment of metabolic activity and intracellular lipid content in skeletal muscle and liver in patients suffering from acromegaly compared to controls. Methods: Non-interventional study: - 31P/1H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and in follow up examinations 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of GH lowering treatments including surgery, somatostatinanalogs or pegvisomant. - oral glucose tolerance tests at each examination to assess treatment responses and calculate validated parameters for insulin sensitivity and resistance.</detailed_description>
