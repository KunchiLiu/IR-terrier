	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine MEDI7510 in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase 1a, first time in human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cohort escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of a single ascending intramuscular dose of RSV sF or MEDI7510 or placebo. Approximately 146 participants will be enrolled at 3 US study centers and randomized in a 5:1 ratio by cohort as described below: Cohort 1: RSV sF 20 microgram (mcg) (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 1a: MEDI7510 (20 mcg RSV sF with 2.5 mcg glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) + 2% weight per volume stable emulsion (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 2: RSV sF 50 mcg (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 2a: MEDI7510 (50 mcg RSV sF with 2.5 mcg glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) + 2% weight per volume stable emulsion (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 3: 80 mcg RSV sF (n=20) or placebo (n=4) Cohort 3a: MEDI7510 (80 mcg RSV sF with 2.5 mcg glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) + 2% weight per volume stable emulsion (n=20) or placebo (n=4)</detailed_description>

Participant with severe, untreated or uncontrolled underlying medical disease that might either compromise participant safety or affect the ability to assess safety of the investigational product are excluded Clinically significant abnormalities in Screening laboratory assessments or Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) History of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection Cognitive disorder such that informed consent cannot be obtained directly from the participant Previous vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) History of allergy to eggs in adulthood History of or current autoimmune disorder Immunosuppression caused by disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or medications. Any oral prednisone dosing within 30 days of enrollment or planned dosing within the 360day followup period would disqualify.
