	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that the physiologic effects of these (PEP/ HFOO) resources may have positive effects in this population of children with acute respiratory illness. Thinking about this physical and physiological issue and due to the absence of a study that has evaluated the effectiveness of these instruments in patients with pneumonia, the objective of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects OOAF and mask of EPAP in children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assesment of the Effectiveness of High Frequency Oral Oscillation and Mask of PEP in Children With Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pneumonia is characterized by an acute infectious and inflammatory process, usually compromises the alveoli, bronchioles and interstitial space difficulting hematosis and may be in some or all of the cells filled with liquid and blood cells. The accumulation of secretion occurs as a consequence of this infectious and inflammatory process and contributes to clinical worsening by increasing airway resistance. Respiratory physiotherapy has been questioned in patients with pneumonia and recent clinical studies have shown that there is no benefit to these patients. Respiratory physical therapy in addition to manual techniques has in his repertoire instrumental resources such as therapeutic high-frequency oral oscillator (HFOO) and the mask of expiratory positive pressure (PEP). The hypothesis of this study is that physical and physiological effects of these resources may have positive effects in this population of children with acute respiratory illness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term effects HFOO and mask of PEP in children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.</detailed_description>
