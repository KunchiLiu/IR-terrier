	<brief_summary>Prevention of contrast induced nephropathy after interventional cardiologic procedures deserves close interest because of its association with prolonged hospitalization, increased cost and increased in hospital and long term mortality rates. An observational prospective cohort study was designed to determine whether metabolic syndrome predicts the development of contrast induced nephropathy after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
