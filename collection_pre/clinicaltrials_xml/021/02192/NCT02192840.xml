	<brief_summary>Coronary bifurcation lesions pose therapeutic problems during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and are associated with higher rates of periprocedural complications as well as higher rates of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. Therefore the optimal approach to coronary bifurcations treatment is still a subject of debate, especially when the side branch is large, not easily accessible and narrowed by a long lesion. One of the proposed alternatives are dedicated bifurcation stents (DBS). However, there is large scarcity of randomized trials with DBS. The aim of POLBOS I (POLish Bifurcation Optimal Stenting) study was to compare two intervention strategies for bifurcation treatment: provisional T-stenting (PTS) with any regular drug-eluting stent (rDES), the best treatment strategy at the moment, with stenting of bifurcation lesions with dedicated bifurcation paclitaxel-eluting stent BiOSS Expert® (Balton, PL).</brief_summary>
