	<brief_summary>Allogeneic mesenchymal trophic factors (MTF) from human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered intra-nasally to 20 patients is a safe and useful procedure for inducing improvements in pulmonary function and quality of life in asthma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Feasibility Study of Intranasal Mesenchymal Trophic Factor (MTF) for Treatment of Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic UC-MSC-derived MTF administered to asthma patients. Each patient will receive intra-nasal MTF once per week for a period of 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed consent form by the subject Male or female Between 18 and 65 years old and capability to comprehend this trial. Asthma diagnosed by a physician at least 1 year prior to study enrollment Poorlycontrolled asthma at study enrollment. Poorly controlled asthma is defined as: chronic symptoms, episodic exacerbations, persistent and variable airways obstruction despite a continued requirement for shortacting beta 2agonists despite the use of high doses of inhaled steroids. Nonsmokers (stopped smoking at least 1 year ago) and limited lifetime history of smoking (less than a 3 pack year history). Body mass index 1940 On a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry or had to use a rescue dose during the last 4 weeks. FEV1 &gt;50% predicted Pregnant or lactating women Cognitively impaired adults Systemic steroids within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for arthritis Current diagnosis of polyposis or sinusitis. Infection treated by antibiotics within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment Immunization within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment Lung pathology other than asthma Other significant nonpulmonary comorbidities such as: coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction &lt;50%, liver disease or elevated liver enzymes at baseline, malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), AIDS, renal failure with serum creatinine &gt;3.0, or disorders requiring steroid treatment such as vasculitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis Illicit drug use within the past year Current/active upper respiratory infection (URI) (if active URI, wait until asymptomatic for 1 week to enroll) Asthma exacerbation within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment (includes ER, urgent care, or hospital visits due to asthma resulting in an increase in asthmarelated medications) Undergoing evaluation for sleep apnea, or plans to institute treatment for sleep apnea (patients on a stable treatment regimen for sleep apnea for the last 3 months prior to enrollment will be allowed to participate) Clinically significant abnormalities present on screening 12lead electrocardiogram Women of childbearing potential using oral contraceptives who are not willing to use a second method of contraception during the study Participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks prior to enrollment Subject does not sign informed consent</criteria>
