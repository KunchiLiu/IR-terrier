	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1865 years old Chronic neck or back pain condition for at least 6 months VAS score of 48, despite opioid therapy On a stable morphine equivalent dose of at least 60mg/day and â‰¤ 240mg/day for at least 3 months Exclusion Criteria Has taken Methadone, Suboxone, Fentanyl, and/or Tramadol in the last six (6) months Has taken guanfacine (or other alpha2AR agonists) in the last six (6) months Changes to current or adding new pain treatment while enrolled in the study (i.e. opiates, epidural steroid injection) will be reviewed by the study physician Unable to independently provide informed written consent Sensory deficits at site of QST, such as peripheral neuropathy Intolerable allergies or has had a severe adverse reaction to study medication (i.e. guanfacine, lactose, vitamin B2 a.k.a. riboflavin) Takes vitamin B2 &gt; 1.6mg/day during the study Pregnant or breastfeeding Pending litigation related to neck or back pain Diagnosed with Raynaud's syndrome Has other chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or joint osteoarthritis that are predominant over back and neck pain with regard to its intensity (VAS) Has known preexisting severe cardiovascular disease (i.e. arrhythmia prolonged QT interval &gt; 440ms), cerebrovascular disease/accident (i.e., stroke), hepatic or renal impairment, CNS condition, metabolic condition, or history of syncope Hypotension (SBP &lt; 90 mmHg and DBP &lt; 60 mmHg for female or SBP &lt; 100 mmHg and DBP &lt; 60 mmHg for male; measured while in a sitting position) will be reviewed by a study physician Bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 60 bpm) will be reviewed by a study physician Subjects are on antihypertensive drugs (e.g., a betablocker) that result in hypotension and/or bradycardia as defined above Tests positive for illicit drugs, marijuana, or nonprescribed drugs Major psychiatric disorders that required hospitalization in the past 6 months such as: major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, or psychotic disorders Currently in a treatment program for alcohol or drug abuse, or currently on methadone or buprenorphine (i.e. suboxone, subutex) for treatment of addiction, or currently prescribed stimulants for treatment of ADHD History of substance or alcohol abuse (meets DSM IV criteria) per medical record or subject admission Subjects are on medications that serve as CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers including, but are not limited to, valproic acid, macrolide antibiotics, antifungal drugs, St. John wort, ACE inhibitors, nefazodone (antidepressant), calcium channel blockers, H2receptor antagonists, antiHIV or AIDS drugs, and antiepileptic drugs Subjects are on medications that are ligands for alpha2adrenergic receptors including antipsychotic drugs (e.g. clozapine) and tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, mirtazapine, mianserin). Any medications taken by a subject at the enrollment will be reviewed regarding their compatibility with guanfacine as well as possible confounding side effects. Subjects will be allowed to take nonopioid pain medications except for gabapentinoids and amitriptyline/nortriptyline as far as such medications do not have incompatibility with guanfacine.</criteria>
