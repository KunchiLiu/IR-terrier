	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the body). The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether intermittent intensive insulin therapy is an effective therapeutic strategy that can preserve pancreatic beta-cell function and maintain glycemic control early in the course of type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Intermittent Intensive Insulin Therapy as an Effective Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (RESET-IT Main Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, eligible patients with type 2 diabetes will be randomized to either intermittent insulin therapy or not, on a background of metformin, after first undergoing a short course of intensive insulin therapy. The hypothesis under study is whether intermittent insulin therapy can preserve beta-cell function.</detailed_description>
