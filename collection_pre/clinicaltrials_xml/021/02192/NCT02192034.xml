	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Two major barriers to successful colorectal cancer screening are appointment keeping and proper bowel preparation. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a patient navigation program to increase colorectal cancer screening at Rush University Medical Center. The investigators hypothesize that colorectal cancer screening will be improved for subjects who utilize a patient navigator.</brief_summary>
