	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a goal-directed fluid administration algorithm on early graft function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Fluid administration has increasingly been scrutinized within anesthesia related literature as an area for improvement, and the imbalance present between estimated blood loss and total fluid administered for kidney transplants must be amongst the highest case categories. Considering the patients are anuric for the majority of the procedure, unguided administration of multiple liters of crystalloid appears antiquated.</brief_summary>

We chose these exclusion criteria to prevent enrolling patients who would not tolerate aggressive hydration possible in the treatment group. The exclusion criteria may be excessively restrictive, however, given the current practice that frequently results in rapid large volume loading without a monitor of intravascular volume status.</criteria>
