	<brief_summary>Though the utility of NVM5 neuromonitoring by stimulating within the surgical site during XLIF has been demonstrated, it is hypothesized that more information may be gathered if a greater section of the motor neural pathway was monitored (i.e., stimulation above the surgical site and recording the subsequent muscle response in the lower limbs). Currently, there has not been demonstrated a practical method of stimulating the lumbosacral nerve roots locally, but well-above the surgical site in this fashion. This protocol is intended to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of using surface stimulation and return (anode) electrodes to stimulate the lumbosacral nerve roots, and record responses from the relevant innervated muscle groups of the lower limbs.</brief_summary>
