	<brief_summary>This study aims to probe the effect of SBRT as a treatment oligometastases of prostate cancer, regardless of basal treatment received, and I know the response, biochemical control, the progression-free survival as well as their impact on quality of life. Primary Objective: Local and symptomatic oligometastases Control of prostate cancer treated by SBRT. Secondary Objectives: Analyzing biochemical progression rates, progression-free survival, chemotherapy-free survival and overall survival. Analyze toxicities and quality of life of patients before and after treatment</brief_summary>
