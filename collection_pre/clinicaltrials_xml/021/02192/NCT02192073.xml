	<brief_summary>Biceps pathology typically includes pain in the anterior shoulder that is reproduced with provocative maneuvers. However, optimal treatment of patient with this diagnosis is not clear and can include tenotomy (cutting the biceps) or various forms of tenodesis (cutting then reattaching). As tenotomy can lead to cosmetic deformity and anterior humeral discomfort from spasms, many surgeons perform tenodesis. There are various techniques for tenodesis. This study will compare 2 methods: suprapectoral (doing the surgery using an incision higher in the shoulder) versus subpectoral fixation (surgery which involves making an incision lower in the shoulder). Purpose of the study is to prospectively determine whether arthroscopic suprapectoral or open subpectoral biceps tenodesis results in better function.</brief_summary>
