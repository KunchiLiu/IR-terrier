	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether insulin degludec compared to insulin glargine can reduce the risk of symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia in subjects with the greatest potential benefit from optimised insulin treatment, which are patients with type 1 diabetes and high risk of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Degludec and Symptomatic Nocturnal Hypoglycaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Insulin degludec is a novel insulin analogue that may reduce the risk of mild nocturnal hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes and recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (high risk patients) are also burdened by nocturnal hyoglycaemia (mild and silent). These episodes may contribute to the developement of hormonal counterregulatory failure and hypoglycaemia unawareness, which in turn increases the risk of further hypoglycaemic episodes, especially epiosdes of severe hypoglycaemia.The effect of insulin degludec on risk of mild nocturnal hypoglycaemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes and high risk of severe hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine is to be investigated. Study design and intervention: A controlled, cross-over multi-centre study in a Prospective, Randomised, Open, Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) design. Each treatment period last for 12 months. Patients will be randomised to treatment with basal-bolus therapy with insulin aspart/degludec or insulin aspart/glargine in random order. Endpoints will be assessed during the last 9 months of each treatment arm. Subjects: 175 type 1 diabetic patients with a history of one or more episodes of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia during the proceeding two years. Method: Patients will record all events of symptomatic (mild), asymptomatic (silent) and severe hypoglycaemia in a diary. All events of symptomatic nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia must also be reported by telephone within 24 hours. Patients will be instructed to do and record self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) i.e. 4-point profiles twice per week (blood glucose before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner and before bedtime). Outcomes: See "Outcome Measures". Concerning the primary endpoint all possible symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes will be adjudicated by an independent endpoint committee consisting of diabetes specialists blinded to the individual patient insulin regimen. Safety: Adverse reactions</detailed_description>
