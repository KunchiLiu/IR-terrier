	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial, examining the effects of a computerized, internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Intervention for persons with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder who experience distressing auditory hallucinations (voices). Participants are randomized to one of two conditions: either to receive the 10-session computer-based program on a weekly basis, or to their usual care at their mental health clinic. This study takes place at Cambridge Health Alliance in Cambridge Massachusetts. It is hypothesized that the participants who participate in the CBT program will have significant improvements in the severity of their auditory hallucinations, as well as their associated distress, compared to the participants receiving usual care.</brief_summary>
