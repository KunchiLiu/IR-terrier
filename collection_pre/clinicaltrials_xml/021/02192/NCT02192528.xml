	<brief_summary>We will use a retrospective data analysis to evaluate the association of the two vitamin D metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with clinical outcome in cardiac surgical patients. The occurrence of several postoperative adverse events such as myocardial infarction, low cardiac output syndrome, stroke and in-hospital death will be assessed from cardiac surgery to discharge. In addition, we will assess the association of the two vitamin D metaboolites with the duration of mechanical ventilatory support and intensive care unit stay from cardiac surgery to discharge. Moreover, in-hospital stay will be assessed according to vitamin D metabolite levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D and Outcome in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a retrospective data analysis, we will evaluate the association of vitamin D metabolites (circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) with MACCE (major cardiac or cerebrovascular event) in cardiac surgical patients. The occurrence of several postoperative adverse events such as myocardial infarction, low cardiac output syndrome, stroke and in-hospital death will be assessed from cardiac surgery to discharge. Approximately 4,000 data sets from mid of 2012 until the end of 2013 will be analyzed. In all patients, we will also assess the association of vitamin D metabolite levels with the duration of mechanical ventilatory support and intensive care unit stay from cardiac surgery to discharge. Moreover, in-hospital stay will be assessed according to vitamin D status</detailed_description>
