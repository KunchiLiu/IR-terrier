	<brief_summary>Patients with classical bladder exstrophy undergo many surgical interventions with secondary urinary tract infections complicating their course. lately primary definitive surgical correction of this congenital anomaly has been implemented with satisfactory results. Although bladder exstrophy patients are born with normal kidneys, infectious and mechanical surgical complications can potentially damage their kidneys in the long-term. therefore we decided to evaluate renal function in the long-term in these patients.</brief_summary>
