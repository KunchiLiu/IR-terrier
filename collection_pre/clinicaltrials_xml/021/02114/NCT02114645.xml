	<brief_title>The Effect of GnRH Agonist Administered in the Luteal Phase on ART Cycle Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective clinical trial evaluates the effect of a two dose GnRH agonist administered in the luteal phase on the outcome of ART cycles stimulated with the long GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist protocol. Decision between each of these two protocols was subjective and depended on the clinical context.In addition to routine luteal phase support with progesterone and estradiol valerate,women received two dose of GnRH agonist on the fifth and tenth day after ET.Live birth rate was the primary outcome measure.</detailed_description>
