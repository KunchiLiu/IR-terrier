	<brief_summary>The risk for postoperative acute kidney injury (pAKI), as for any other postoperative complications (PC), comes from a number of interactions between a patient's health before surgery, strength to tolerate surgery and influences on the operating room environment. At this time doctors do not have good tools to predict which patients may be at risk of having this complication. The purpose of this research study is to develop a urine test that can be used to predict the risk for having problems with kidney function after major surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During hospitalization, a urine sample will be collected and additional tests will be added to the daily standard of care blood samples before, during and three times following an elective surgical procedure. Study participants will complete telephone interviews at 6 and 12 months after discharge from the hospital with a study team member. The telephone interview will consist of a short questionnaire asking about state of health and a health survey. At the same times of the phone interviews, the study team will mail a urine dipstick that is used to detect any amount of protein in the urine. Study participants will be asked to urinate on dipstick and send it back to the study team in provided shipping material.</detailed_description>
