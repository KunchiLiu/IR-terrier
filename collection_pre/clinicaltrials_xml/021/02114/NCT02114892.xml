	<brief_summary>The Metabolic Syndrome is a high prevalence disease worldwide. About a quarter of the adult population suffers the disease. Resveratrol is a substance found in many plants, including grapes, nuts and wine, but it's also found in Polygonum cuspidatum. There is evidence that resveratrol consumption has beneficial effects on glucose and lipids metabolism, blood pressure and body weight. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. The investigators hypothesis was that the administration of resveratrol modifies the metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Resveratrol Administration on Metabolic Syndrome, Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 24 patients with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in accordance with the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Waist circumference, glucose, insulin levels, lipid profile, creatinine and acid uric were evaluated after a 75 g of dextrose load. 12 received resveratrol, 500 mg, three times per day (1500 mg) before meals during 3 months. The remaining 12 patients received placebo with the same prescription. Area Under the Curve of glucose and insulin was calculated as well as total insulin secretion (insulinogenic index), first-phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index) and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index). This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. Intra and inter group differences were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U-test respectively; p≤0.05 was considered significant.</detailed_description>
