	<brief_summary>Staying out of the hospital is valued by patients and their caregivers. Their interests converge with those of hospitals now that high 30-day readmission rates for some conditions place hospitals at risk for financial penalties from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This study focuses on developing and testing a program that combines a community health worker (lay patient advocate, acting as a "Patient Navigator") and a peer-led telephone support line to improve patient experience during hospital to home transition.</brief_summary>
