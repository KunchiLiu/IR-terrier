	<brief_summary>POSAS can be treated with CPAP however there is now evidence from a few studies that Night Balance is effective in POSAS. Night Balance seems to be better accepted than CPAP so we would like to examine if we could find similar results in routine clinical work and especially we would like to confirm the subjective effects with objective measures i.e. a reduction in AHI in the supine position during sleep.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Night Balance for Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (POSAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aim: Efficacy and adherence of Night Balance in POSAS versus no therapy after 2 months (Sleep supine). Secondary aim: Efficacy and adherence of Night Balance in POSAS after a 6 months period (Sleep supine and compliance and AHI). Nigh Balance is a vibrator and a belt that vibrate when laying supine so that after a few days you will not sleep supine.</detailed_description>
