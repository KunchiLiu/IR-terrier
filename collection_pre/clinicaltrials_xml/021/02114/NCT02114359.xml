	<brief_summary>The investigators compare the overall survival between combination chemotherapy and monochemotherapy as a first-line chemotherapy in elderly patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer. The investigators also compare the progression free survival, response rate, safety, and, quality of life between two groups, and evaluate that the comprehensive geriatric assessment tested at baseline can predict the toxicity and compliance of treatment, survival of the patients.</brief_summary>
