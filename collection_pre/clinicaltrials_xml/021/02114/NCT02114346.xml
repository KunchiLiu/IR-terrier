	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of atorvastatin in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing computed tomography coronary angiography. Investigators assume that atorvastatin is effective in this regard. Investigators include patients referring for elective computed tomography coronary angiography and allocate them to atorvastatin or placebo from 24 hours before to 48 hours after administration of contrast material. Investigators then measure serum creatinine and see if it is raised by ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or ≥ 25% of the baseline value.</brief_summary>
