	<brief_summary>ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of betamethasone gel and lidocaine jelly (over tracheal tube cuff) compared with distilled water on the post intubation syndrome incidence. This study has not been carried out in Iran. 99 patients of either sex undergoing elective surgery were recruited in a single blind randomized study. The patients, using randomization table, were divided into three groups. Anesthetics and medications used during surgery were similar for all the patients. For the all patients, the incidence of postoperative sore throat, cough and hoarseness of the voice in the different follow-up periods (1, 6 and 24 hours) based on the different types of medications were obtained.</brief_summary>
