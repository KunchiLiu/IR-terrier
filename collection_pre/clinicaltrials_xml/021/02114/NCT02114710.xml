	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether stress doses of hydrocortisone attenuate coagulation dysfunction in patients with septic shock. And discuss the probable mechanism by which little doses of hydrocortisone influence coagulation system in sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Stress Doses of Hydrocortisone on Coagulation Dysfunction in Patients With Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomized to receive either low-dose hydrocortisone or matching placebo.Severity of coagulopathy was estimated using ISTH DIC score. We determined the complications and mortality in two groups, and analyzed the relationship between hydrocortisone and coagulopathy.</detailed_description>
