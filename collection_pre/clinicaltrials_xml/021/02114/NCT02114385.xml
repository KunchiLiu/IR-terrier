Subject has received any immune globulin product or bloodderived product within the 6 months prior to the Day 1 vaccination, or plans to receive any such product during Day 1 through Month 7 of the study. Subject has received nonreplicating (inactivated) vaccines within 14 days prior to the Day 1 vaccination or has received replicating (live) vaccines within 21 days prior to the Day 1 vaccination. Subject has received a marketed HPV vaccine, or has participated in an HPV vaccine clinical trial and has received either active agent or placebo. Subject has had a fever within the 24hour period prior to the Day 1 vaccination.
