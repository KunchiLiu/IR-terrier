	<brief_title>Supplementation of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Children With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a total duration of 6 months. 100-120 boys with ADHD aged 8-16 years and 30 healthy boys will will be randomized to 3 months of treatment with a fixed dose of 6 capsules of food supplement "Eye q" per day divided in two daily doses (558 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 174 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 60 mg gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) per day) or to placebo (olive oil). At 3 months a one-way treatment crossover of the placebo-group to active treatment will be made so that both patient groups will receive active treatment for the remaining 3 month period. Control group will receive active treatment for 6 month. The assessment of children will be made 3 times: at the point of start, after 3 months, and after 6 months. The assessments will be made using standardized interviews and questionnaires, neuropsychological tests, pediatric and neurological examination and taking a 5 ml sample of blood to assess level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in serum and in cell membranes of erythrocytes.</detailed_description>
