	<brief_title>Cognitive Health in Ageing Register: Investigational, Observational and Trial Studies in Dementia Research: Prospective Readiness Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective single center study that will enroll participants without dementia who are considered at high, medium and low risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a community-based register (referred to as the CHARIOT registry) in the United Kingdom. No interventions (ie, study drugs) will be administered to participants in the study. The planned duration of the study is approximately 4 years with up to 2 years for participant recruitment. Data collection to assess outcome measures associated with disease progression will occur at baseline and every 6 months thereafter at the clinic during the follow-up period of 48 months. Blood, urine, and saliva samples will be collected from participants during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk factors for dementia, Alzheimer's disease or confounding factors of dementia risk. Adverse events experienced by the participants during their participation in the study will be monitored.</detailed_description>
