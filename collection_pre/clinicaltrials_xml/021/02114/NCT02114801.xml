	<detailed_description>Advances in the design and type of movement of electric toothbrushes can determine the increase in effectiveness in the control of biofilm by caregivers and patients.There is a paucity of studies evaluating the effectiveness of the electric toothbrush compared to manual toothbrush specifically in patients with cerebral palsy.Only one study used the electric toothbrush in patients with cerebral palsy and demonstrated superiority of the electric toothbrush over the manual. However, the study investigated the effect of various cleaning strategies on symptoms of gingival inflammation, not specifically focusing on the comparison of the efficiency of removal of biofilm from the manual toothbrush and electric toothbrush. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the electric brush on and off the removal of dental plaque in subjects with cerebral palsy compared to manual toothbrush. The secondary objective was to characterize the study as socioeconomic population.</detailed_description>
