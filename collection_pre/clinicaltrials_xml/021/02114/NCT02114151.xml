	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Simeprevir in Combination With Sofosbuvir in Participants With Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm, multicenter study. The study will consist of a screening phase up to 4 weeks, open-label treatment phase of 12 weeks, and post-treatment follow up phase up to 24 weeks after end of treatment. Approximately 100 participants will receive 150 mg simeprevir in combination with 400 mg sofosbuvir once dailyfor 12 weeks.
