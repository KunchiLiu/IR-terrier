	<brief_summary>Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor and proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) have been implicated in the mechanism of acid induced inflammation in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to evaluate TRPV1 and PAR2 mRNA expression levels in the GERD patients and their relationship with endoscopic findings and reflux symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All the subjects receive upper GI endoscopy and completed questionnaires about GERD symptoms under the supervision of a well-trained interviewer. Subjects are excluded if there was a history of gastrointestinal surgery, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal motility disorder, duodenal ulcer, benign gastric ulcer or gastroduodenal cancer and if he or she had any history of systemic disease requiring chronic medication (except for hypertension and diabetes mellitus). The subjects are classified into 3 groups after upper GI endoscopy and completing questionnaires about GERDsymptoms ; ERD(erosive reflux disease), NERD(nonerosive reflux disease) and control group.</detailed_description>
