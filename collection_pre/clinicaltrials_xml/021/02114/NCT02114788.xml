	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to study how to improve patients' management of chronic back pain, particularly their management of prescription medication, through increasing health literacy and patient empowerment through an internet based intervention. We do this by designing both patient education materials and physician communication strategies to increase literacy and volitional components of patients. We will test two conditions using a website called Oneself: one providing only information (literacy-only control) and a second providing relational communications designed to increase both literacy and volitional empowerment. To test the self-management enhancing effects of empowerment and health literacy, we will conduct a longitudinal experiment with 51 chronich back pain patients over two months. This span of time is the minimum necessary to achieve a systematic change in self-management and literacy skills, increasing also the range of possible decisions to be made and actions to be real-ized by the patients.</brief_summary>
