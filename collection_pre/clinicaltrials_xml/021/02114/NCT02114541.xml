	<brief_summary>The relationship of the natural history of atherosclerosis between different vascular beds has not been well characterized. Determination and comparison of the relative rates of progression and extents of atherosclerosis in the coronary and carotid arterial trees may have major impacts on clinical research and clinical practice. Correlation between findings in the carotid and coronary circulations is an important scientific and clinical topic to address. Results from a well design study incorporating imaging technologies that currently represent the gold standards for the assessment of coronary and carotid artery plaque burden, will have potentially impact on clinical research and clinical practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational, multi-center study expecting to enroll approximately 500 patients who have successfully undergone baseline imaging in the dal-PLAQUE 2 study. - Patients who have had baseline angiography and IVUS, with or without baseline carotid ultrasound IMT assessments but NOT undergone follow-up angiography and IVUS as part of the dal-PLAQUE 2 study to have a follow-up angiogram and IVUS performed within 18-27 months of their baseline imaging. - Patients who have had baseline carotid ultrasound IMT assessments but NOT undergone a follow-up carotid ultrasound IMT assessment within 18-27 months following enrollment into dal-PLAQUE 2 to have a follow up carotid ultrasound examination performed within 18-27 months of their baseline imaging. - Patients to be contacted by phone on a annual bases at 3, 4, and 5 years following randomization into dal-PLAQUE 2 to collect cardiovascular and cerebrovascular clinical endpoints.</detailed_description>
