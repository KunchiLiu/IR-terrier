	<brief_summary>The AirSeal® System will allow for lower CO2 absorption rates than the Xcel® System. Furthermore, lower variance in pneumoperitoneal pressure will allow for less "over-pressure" events and peritoneal stretch, which may reduce postoperative pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CO2 Exchange Patterns During Robotic Prostatectomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary observation to be made is the level of PaCO2 in the arterial blood, specifically when the patient is insufflated and deflated during the surgery. As a result of the consistent pressure that the AirSeal® system maintains, CO2 will be absorbed in lower levels when compared to the standard of care systems in which fluctuations in intra-peritoneum pressure are seen. Therefore, higher pressures will result in higher levels of CO2 exchange in the blood, leading to increased vasodilation and lower pH levels.</detailed_description>
