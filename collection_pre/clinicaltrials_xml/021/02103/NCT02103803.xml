	<brief_summary>This proposal aims to describe the oculometric features present during King-Devick (K-D) testing for subjects who experienced sports-related concussion. The investigators aim to better describe the underlying oculomotor anomalies present in this cohort that lead to increased K-D test time. Understanding these anomalies will allow for better understanding of the effects of sports-related concussion and may provide a rapid and reliable metric for diagnosing concussion as well as monitoring long-term recovery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal aims to describe the oculometric features present during K-D testing for subjects who experienced sports-related concussion. The investigators aim to better describe the underlying oculomotor anomalies present in this cohort that lead to increased K-D test time. Understanding these anomalies will allow for better understanding of the effects of sports-related concussion and may provide a rapid and reliable metric for diagnosing concussion as well as monitoring long-term recovery. The main objectives include: 1. Describing the oculometric deficits present in subjects with acute sports-related concussion. 2. Analyzing and quantifying the oculometric changes that occur during subject recovery. 3. Identifying possible oculometric features as potential biomarkers that may lead to reliable, rapid method for recognizing acute concussion.</detailed_description>
