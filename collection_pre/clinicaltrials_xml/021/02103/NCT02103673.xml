	<brief_summary>The population of dementia is increasing rapidly. Cognitive impairment as well as Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) add heavy burdens to caregiver. NMDA activation is critical for learning and memory. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have fewer NMDA receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus than controls. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug trial. All patients will be allocated randomly to two groups: (1) NMDA enhancer: DAOIB (starting dosage: 250-500 mg/day), (2) placebo, for 6 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that DAOIB may yield better efficacy than placebo for cognitive function and clinical symptoms in patients with BPSD.</brief_summary>
