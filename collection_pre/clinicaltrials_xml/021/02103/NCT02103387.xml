	<brief_summary>To test the effects of 2 different 5-wk stress management interventions (cognitive behavioral training or relaxation training) vs. a time-matched 5-wk health education condition on psychosocial adaptation and physiological adaptation in women being treated for breast cancer. Participants assigned to either of the stress management conditions will show improved psychosocial adaptation and physiological adaptation compared to those assigned to the health education condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Five Sessions Intervention to Facilitate Adaptation to Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study tests the effects of two 5-wk group-based stress management interventions (Cognitive Behavioral Training [CBT] (stress awareness, cognitive restructuring, coping skills training, interpersonal skills training), Relaxation Training [RT] (muscle relaxation, deep breathing, guided imagery, meditation) vs. a time-matched 5-wk group-based Health Education Training control condition (information about breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, side-effect management, recurrence, physical activity and nutrition, and life after breast cancer) in women who have recently had surgery for breast cancer but have not yet started adjuvant therapy. The study evaluates the effects of CBT and RT on psychological adaptation (includes measures of negative adaptation [negative affect and social disruption] and positive adaptation [positive affect and benefit finding]) at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. The study also evaluates the effects of CBT and RT on physiological adaptation (includes levels of PM serum cortisol and T-helper-type 1 (Th1) cytokine [interleukin-2, IL-2, and interferon-gamma, IFN-g, production after anti-CD3 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).</detailed_description>
