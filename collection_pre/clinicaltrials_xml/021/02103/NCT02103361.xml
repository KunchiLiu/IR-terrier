	<brief_summary>The purpose of the OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Study is to monitor planned and unplanned pregnancies exposed to certain medications, to evaluate the possible teratogenic effect of these medications and to follow live born infants for one year after birth. With respect to fetal outcome, it is important to evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be relevant to a medication exposure during pregnancy, and these include both easily recognizable defects which are visible at birth, as well as more subtle or delayed defects that may not be readily identifiable without special expertise and observation beyond the newborn period.</brief_summary>
