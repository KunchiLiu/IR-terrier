	<detailed_description>This study was conducted on 40 women at Al-Azhar University Hospitals. They are divided into two equal groups, group 1 with ovarian endometrioma and group 2 with normal ovary. Ovarian and endometrial samples were evaluated by hematoxlin &amp; eosin for histopathology (HP) and of oct-4 for immunohistochemistry (IH) for SCE. Evaluation of IH parameters revealed that the most important factors for evaluating SC were arranged as score ( Edessy Stem Cell Score=ESS).</detailed_description>
