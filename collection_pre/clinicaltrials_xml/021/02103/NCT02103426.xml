	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether ASP0113 (a CMV deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] vaccine) can be detected in plasma after intramuscular (IM) injections, and to determine whether CMV-seropositive healthy volunteers, CMV-seronegative healthy volunteers, CMV-seronegative dialysis patients mount an immune response to the CMV proteins produced by the vaccine after repeated ASP0113 IM injection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part 1 is open-label with no randomization, and Part 2 is single-blind and randomized. The purpose of Part 1 is to obtain pilot pharmacokinetic data so as to optimize pharmacokinetic sample collection times in Part 2.</detailed_description>

Current/ active CMV infection as evidenced by positive CMV Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plasma results at Screening. Any known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP0113 or any components of the formulation used, including aminoglycosides as kanamycin is used during the manufacturing of the vaccine.
