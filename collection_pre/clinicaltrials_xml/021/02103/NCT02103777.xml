	<brief_summary>The optimum caffeine dose for apnea of prematurity has not been well investigated so the objective of the study is to compare high versus low dose of caffeine citrate to facilitate successful extubation in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Versus Low Dose of Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double blind, clinical trial which will be conducted in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Mansoura University Children Hospital, Egypt on preterm infants born less than 32 weeks gestation mechanically ventilated within the first 10 days of life to study the optimum caffeine dose for apnea of prematurity and compare High dose (loading 40 mg/kg/day equivalent to 20 mg /kg/day of caffeine base and maintenance of 20 mg/kg/day equivalent to 10 mg /kg/day of caffeine base) versus low dose (loading 20 mg/kg/day equivalent to 10 mg /kg/day of caffeine base and maintenance of 10 mg/kg/day equivalent to 5 mg /kg/day of caffeine base) caffeine citrate started within the first 10 days of life and its effect on need of re-intubation within 72 hours of extubation from mechanical ventilation as primary outcome and frequency and duration of apnea, duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen support, length of hospital stay, neonatal mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, hydrocephalus, retinopathy of prematurity, and caffeine side effects as secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>
