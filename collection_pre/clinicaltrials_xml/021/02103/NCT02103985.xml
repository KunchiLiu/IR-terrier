	<brief_title>A Study of Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of a Single JNJ-39823277 (TPI-1062) Dose in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, 2 treatment-sequence, and crossover study (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study). The study consist of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 21 days before medication administration), a 2-period open-label treatment phase, during which each participant will receive 1 of 2 open-label treatment sequences, and the end-of-study or withdrawal assessments (within 7-11 days after the last dose of the study medication). Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment-sequences: Treatment Sequence AB (dosing in fed [with high fat diet] condition followed by dosing in fasted [without food] condition) or Treatment Sequence BA (dosing in fasted condition followed by dosing in fed condition). Study medication administrations will be separated by a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of 7 to 14 days. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
