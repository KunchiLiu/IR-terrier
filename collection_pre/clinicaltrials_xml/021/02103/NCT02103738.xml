	<brief_summary>This is an observational study to will evaluate and compare two Ranibizumab treatment regimens (Standard of care) in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) aiming to achieve and to maintain a maximum visual function benefit. The results will be used to generate further recommendations on the timing of treatment administration for patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). In this context, the study will use the anatomical imaging (for example, optical coherence tomography [OCT]) to evaluate wAMD disease activity impacted by the recurrence of disease instability and for decision making in the treatment decision algorithm.</brief_summary>
