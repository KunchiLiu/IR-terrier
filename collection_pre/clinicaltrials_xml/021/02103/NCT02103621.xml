	<brief_summary>This study will address questions of fundamental clinical significance including: (1) whether OCD patients maintained on long term SRIs can be discontinued without symptom exacerbation, (2) whether trans-diagnostic cognitive-behavioral treatment will reduce worsening following discontinuation compared to Taper and Monitoring, and (3) whether predictors of successful SRI discontinuation can be identified.</brief_summary>
