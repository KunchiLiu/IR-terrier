	<detailed_description>Since Japanese mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is lower than that in the USA although Japan is one of the top four tobacco consuming countries, this study aims to determine biomarkers of both level of exposure and CVD-related biological effects in Japanese smokers compared to non-smokers. Biomarkers of Exposure (BoExp) include 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), 4-(methylnitrosaminoi)-1-(3-pyridil)-1-butanone (NNK), carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine, pyrene and 0-toluidine (o-TOL). CVD-related biomarkers include white blood cell (WBC) count, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine in plasma; complemented with urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), urinary 11-DTXB2, plasma fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and von Willebrand Factor.</detailed_description>
