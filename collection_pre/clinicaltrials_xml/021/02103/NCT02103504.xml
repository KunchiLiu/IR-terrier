	<brief_summary>The DePuy Attune knee system incorporates several key features aimed at improving kinematics of the knee joint, range of motion, and smoothness of use compared to existing total knee replacement technologies. As this is a newly approved medical device, clinical testing in patients using high precision diagnostics is important to evaluate the stability of implant fixation and in vivo function. We propose a multi-centre consecutive series study examining the stability of the Attune posterior-stabilized knee design in 30 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for a follow-up period of 2 years. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) will be utilized to identify the micromotion of the tibial tray with respect to the surrounding bone. Health status and functional outcome measures will be recorded to quantify functional status of subjects before surgery and at follow-up intervals.</brief_summary>
