	<brief_summary>There is a high prevalence of falls in those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to healthy older adults. Balance is a key element of function that allows individuals to maintain posture and respond to perturbations, and poor balance control, a risk factor for falls, has been noted in those with knee OA. There is a lack of research guiding treatment for balance deficits in knee OA, with interventions aimed at improving balance deficits in those with knee OA having mixed results. Targeted dynamic balance interventions in other patient populations have been shown to significantly improve dynamic balance control and physical function. If results similar to such populations can be achieved, such a program may produce a significant reduction in functional disability in the knee OA population and improve quality of life. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a 10-week targeted dynamic balance intervention on dynamic balance and physical function in people with knee OA. This will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT).</brief_summary>
