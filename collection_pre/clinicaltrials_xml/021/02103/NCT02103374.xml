	<brief_summary>Design studies of nebulization in COPD does not respond adequately to the clinically relevant question: the intervention of administering nebulized bronchodilators at home it is likely to make a profit, compared to the standard optimized treatment as defined by the recommendations of the SPLF, patients with severe COPD (stage III, FEV between 30% and 50% of the theoretical value) and very severe (stage IV, less than 30% of the theoretical value FEV)? The concept of profit in this context is based on criteria of dyspnea, quality of life, use of health system (exacerbations, hospitalizations, prescription of antibiotics and steroids ...).</brief_summary>
