	<brief_title>Safety and Intake Effect of EPs速 7630 (an Extract of the Roots of Pelargonium Sidoides)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of EPs速 7630 intake - used as continuous protection and at the onset of cold symptoms - in adult participants during a long-term (4 months) medication. Due to the sparseness of empirical data in the population and this setting, no confirmatory hypotheses are formulated and the data will be analysed descriptively.</detailed_description>
