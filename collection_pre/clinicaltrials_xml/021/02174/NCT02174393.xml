	<brief_summary>Acne is a prevalent disorder mostly witnessed in adolescents, but can be seen in adults. Early treatment is imperative to reduce acne scarring which can appear with atrophic lesions, and depending on the skin type, significant erythema (redness) or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. A multi-modality approach to treatment is necessary when dealing with the aforementioned types of lesions. Pharmacologic management is essential, but safe procedural therapies are also necessary specifically with darker skinned individuals. Percutaneous collagen induction therapy (PCIT) is a non-invasive treatment achieved by using a micro-needling device, which is safe and effective in causing "micro-wounds" into the dermis thereby initiating wound healing followed by collagen production. This is an ideal treatment for acne scarring, re-texturizing of the skin, and hyperpigmentation for all skin types . Currently there are very few studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of microneedling and chemical peels in skin types III-VI. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the combination of microneedling and chemical peel for the treatment of acne scars in skin types III-VI.</brief_summary>
