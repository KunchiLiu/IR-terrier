	<brief_summary>Since introduction in 1989, propofol has gained wide acceptance for sedation during endoscopic procedures. The optimal sedation drug during esophagogastroendoscopy (EGD) is not established. Midazolam and propofol are used for sedation drug. Balanced propofol sedation (BPS) refers to the administration of an opiate, a benzodiazepine, and propofol. In this study, the investigators want to compare the patient satisfaction with EGD following balanced propofol sedation (BPS) versus propofol sedation alone.</brief_summary>
