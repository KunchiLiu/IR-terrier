	<brief_summary>End stage heart failure is characterized by a critical inability of the heart to meet the organism's blood demand even under resting conditions. Heart transplantation (HTx) is the established therapeutic approach in the treatment of end stage heart failure and still the gold standard treatment. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are considered as a vital therapeutic option to temporarily or permanently assist the failing circulation. The hemodynamic vascular consequences of implanting LVADs have not been studied in detail. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of LVAD implantation compared to heart transplant (HTx) on micro- and macrovascular function in patients with end stage heart failure.</brief_summary>
