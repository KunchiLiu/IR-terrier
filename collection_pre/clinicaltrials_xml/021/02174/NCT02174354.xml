	<brief_summary>Methotrexate (MTX) is widely prescribed to treat inflammatory conditions including psoriasis, where it is the recommended first-line systemic therapy in moderate-to-severe disease. Approximately 40% of patients with psoriasis have a sub-optimal response to MTX and a significant number experience side effects that may include deranged liver enzymes. There is currently no validated test to predict how patients with psoriasis will respond to MTX, in terms of disease outcome and/or toxicity, or to guide dose escalation in this group.</brief_summary>
