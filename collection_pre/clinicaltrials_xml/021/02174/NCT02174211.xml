	<criteria>Adults of either sex aged 55 years and older Active neovascular AMD in the study eye Intravitreal dose of 0.5 mg ranibizumab required, as per current clinical guidelines Venous access that is sufficient to allow easy blood sampling on a frequent basis Able to give written consent Willingness to comply with all study procedures Myopia greater than 8 dioptres in the study eye Axial length of eye under 22mm or over 26mm Pseudophakia or aphakia in study eye Glaucoma in study eye Current renal dialysis Presence of inflammatory eye conditions, such as uveitis, or systemic conditions likely to elevate CRP, such as infection, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. Intraocular surgery within 6 months of enrolment, except for routine phacoemulsification cataract surgery that may occur within 4 months of enrolment Current treatment for wet agerelated macular degeneration with an intravitreal agent other than ranibizumab in the study eye. Patients expected to change their antiVEGF agent during the sampling period are also excluded. Known significant allergy to ranibizumab Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not be willing or able to comply with the study protocol or provide informed consent. Patients with severe anaemia Patients who have received antiVEGF therapy in either eye within 8 weeks of enrolment, or who are likely to require antiVEGF treatment in the fellow eye during the course of venous sampling. Note that the final venous sample at 4 weeks can be undertaken on the same day as an antiVEGF injection, but must be taken prior to any injection. Patients presently taking any topical (skin or eye), periocular, intraocular, local or systemic treatment with immunosuppressive or antiinflammatory agents, such as steroids, steroid sparing agents, and NSAIDs. Patients who have received any of these agents within 2 months prior to enrolment are also excluded, as are those thought likely to receive these medications during the course of venous sampling.</criteria>
