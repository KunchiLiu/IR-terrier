Participants will be recruited from addiction treatment agencies and throughout the community. Those who complete a 4 week induction period will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of contingency management or a non-contingent control condition. Individuals will then be followed for an additional 3-months to assess the long term efficacy of the treatment.</brief_summary>
