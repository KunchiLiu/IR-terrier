	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiretroviral activity of a single dose of MK-8507 in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, HIV-1 infected participants. The hypothesis tested in the study is that at a safe and well-tolerated dose, MK-8507 has superior antiretroviral activity to a historical placebo control, as measured by change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 168 hours postdose.</brief_summary>
