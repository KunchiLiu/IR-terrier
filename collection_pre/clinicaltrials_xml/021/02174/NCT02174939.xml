	<brief_summary>1. The number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are inversely associated with coronary risk factors and atherosclerotic diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiovascular high risk. 2. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of cilostazol on human early EPCs and endothelial function as well as the potential mechanisms of action in patients with CAD and cardiovascular high risk.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. titration of drugs 1. run-in period: eligible subjects are screened and baseline blood samples are obtained 2. study period: 12 weeks - subjects with cilostazol and subjects with dummy placebo - On the first day after the end of the study period, the follow-up data are obtained by the same procedure 3. blood sampling and measurement of serum biomarkers - obtained from peripheral veins in all study subjects at the run-in period and the end of the treatment period of the study - sent for isolation, cell culture, and assays of human EPCs - also stored for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Stromal cell derived factor-alfa1, adiponectin, soluble thrombomodulin, vascular endothelial growth factor) 2. assays of human EPCs 1. colony formation by EPCs 2. quantification of EPCs and apoptotic endothelial cells 3. chemotactic motility, proliferation/viability and apoptosis assays 3. measurement of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of left brachial artery by sonography 4. assessment of long-term cardiovascular outcomes</detailed_description>
