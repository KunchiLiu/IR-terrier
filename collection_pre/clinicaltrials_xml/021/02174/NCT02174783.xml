	<brief_title>Mediterranean Diet and Protein-Sparing Modified Diet for Metabolic Syndrome in Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Mediterranean diet has been shown to be effective in improving hepatic steatosis, insulin sensitivity, diabetes control and reducing cardiovascular risk in adult patients, but there is no data available for patients who underwent liver transplant. The protein-sparing modified fast (PSMF) diet has been used for years at the Cleveland Clinic to treat adult patients with obesity-related medical problems, but its safety and efficacy has not been established in liver transplant recipients.</detailed_description>
