	<brief_summary>Post-operative ileus is a common complication following abdominal surgery. It results in abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting as well as abdominal pain. Furthermore, this results in prolonged hospital stay and occasionally readmission following abdominal surgery.The etiology of post-operative ileus is multifactorial and studies evaluating potential treatment options are abundant, though few reliable interventions exist. This study proposal describes a double-blinded randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of simethicone on post-operative ileus in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Simethicone on Postoperative Ileus in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Simethicone is an orally administered anti-foaming agent comprised of polydimethylsiloxane and hydrated silica gel. Its leads to the coalescence of gas bubbles in the intestinal tract, facilitating its emission. To date, there are no contemporary studies evaluating the efficacy of simethicone on POI in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The proposed study is a pilot double-blinded randomized controlled trial of simethicone versus placebo in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Starting on postoperative day one, patients in the experimental arm of the study will receive, in a blinded fashion, 160mg of simethicone orally four times a day for the first five postoperative days. Patients assigned to the control arm will receive a placebo agent orally with the same frequency and duration. All consenting patients over the age of 18 undergoing elective, abdominal colorectal surgery involving bowel resection with or without re-anastomosis at either the Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Center or St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario will be enrolled. This will include patients undergoing both open and laparoscopic surgery. Patients will be prospectively evaluated by a trained research assistant on a daily basis while in hospital. Passage of flatus, bowel movements, and postoperative pain will be evaluated at those visits. A two-week, and 30-day phone call to patients discharged from hospital will be done to assess for outcomes after discharge. Follow-up will end after the 30th postoperative day.</detailed_description>
