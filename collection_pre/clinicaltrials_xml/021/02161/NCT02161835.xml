	<brief_title>Relations Between Myotonia and Fitness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators aimed to investigate whether a 10-week bicycle exercise program can increase fitness levels in patients with myotonia, and thereby reduce the symptom of myotonia in everyday life. The effect on myotonia is assessed by a standardized myotonia scale with six statements concerning self-rated myotonia, and a number of performance tests that objectively describes the degree of myotonia. The effect of the training program is assessed by an incremental test, measuring maximal oxygen uptake, maximal heart rate and maximal workload. The muscle enzyme creatine kinase (CK) is measured in plasma to follow muscle injury and safety during the training.</detailed_description>
