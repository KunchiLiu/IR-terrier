	<brief_summary>Y-75/ginsan is an acidic polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 150,000 Da, isolated from the aqueous Korean Panax ginseng extract. Preclinical laboratory studies have shown its function as an immunomodulatory molecule. The present study performed to evaluate the safety and beneficial effects of Y-75 on immune function in a group of healthy adults. The focus of this trial was modulation of innate immunity, comprising cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells, phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear phagocytes, and serum levels of monocyte-derived mediators.</brief_summary>
