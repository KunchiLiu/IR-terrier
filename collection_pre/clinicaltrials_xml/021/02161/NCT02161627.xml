Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of intervention and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcomes 3. Are not a surgical candidate due to a diagnosis of a coagulation disorder, bleeding diathesis, progressive peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 4. Have a diagnosis of scoliosis that precludes lead placement 5. Have a condition, treatable with SCS, that requires leads to be inserted into the cervical region 6.
