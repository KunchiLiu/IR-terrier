	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to identify a safe dose of MK-2248 in participants with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) that mediates at least a 3 log10 reduction in viral load (VL) from baseline. It is anticipated that once-daily administration of a safe and well tolerated dose of MK-2248 will reduce VL by at least 3 log10 IU/mL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of MK-2248 in Participants With Hepatitis C (MK-2248-002)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this Phase 1b study, the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety profile of MK-2248 in HCV-infected participants will be evaluated as follows: Part I will assess sequentially ascending MK-2248 doses from 200 mg to ≤800 mg over 4 panels (A, B, C, and D). Part II will assess sequentially ascending MK-2248 doses from 200 mg to ≤800 mg over 4 panels (E, F, G, and H). Part III will assess sequentially ascending MK-2248 doses ranging up to ≤800 mg in 2 panels (I and J). The potential relationship between plasma MK-2248 levels and VL reduction will be determined.</detailed_description>
