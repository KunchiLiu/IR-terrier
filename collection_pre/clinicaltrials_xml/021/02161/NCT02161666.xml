	<brief_summary>To examine pancreatic islet function and incretin function during intravenous and oral stimulation &gt;2 years after gastric bypass surgery in patients with normal glucose tolerance. We hypothesize that islet cell and incretin function is enhanced in response to oral, but not intravenous, stimulation - i.e. incretin released from the gut in response to oral stimulation play a key role for the enhanced islet function after gastric bypass surgery.</brief_summary>
