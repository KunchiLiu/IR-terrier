	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, open-label study that evaluates the safety and efficacy of IMMU-132 alone and in combination with carboplatin in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. IMMU132 will be administered once-weekly for the first 2 weeks of 3-week treatment cycles. For those patients assigned to also receive carboplatin, will receive it on the same schedules starting 30 minutes after the completion of IMMU-132 administration. Patients may receive up to a maximum total of 8 cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of IMMU-132 Alone or in Combination With Carboplatin in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMMU-132 alone and in combination with carboplatin administered in 3-week treatment cycles for up to 8 cycles, in patients with triple-negative breast cancer that have received at least two prior treatments. The secondary objectives are to obtain data concerning pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. This is a multi-center study. Eighty patients are planned to be enrolled, with an equal distribution between the two groups. All patients will receive a starting dose of IMMU-132administered once-weekly for the first 2 weeks of 3-week treatment cycles. For those patients assigned to also receive carboplatin, carboplatin will also be administered on the same schedules starting 30 minutes after the completion of IMMU-132 administration. Patients may receive up to a maximum total of 8 cycles (16 doses), but patients with a complete response, partial response or stable disease at that time, or patients who had achieved an objective response, but relapsed after discontinuing treatment, may continue to be treated based on physician discretion. Follow up is then required until resolution or stabilization of any treatment-related toxicity, and patients with stable disease or objective responses must also continue evaluations until survived.</detailed_description>
