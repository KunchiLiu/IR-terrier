	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that SC abatacept is safe and shows evidence of efficacy (improvement in modified Rodnan score [mRSS]) in patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcScc) compared to matching placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Subcutaneous Abatacept to Treat Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind phase 2 trial of patients with dcSSc. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 125 mg SC abatacept or matching placebo, stratified by duration of dcSSc disease duration (&lt;18 months vs &gt;18 to &lt;/=36 months). Study participants will be treated for 12 months on double-blind study medication, followed by an additional 24 weeks of open-label SC abatacept therapy. 86 patients will be randomized in approximately 35 centers in the US, Canada and Europe, with the goal of analyzing 74 participants. The investigators study will test whether abatacept is statistically superior to placebo in reducing the MRSS at month 12 and explore the ability of abatacept to prevent or reverse progression in patients with early disease duration and lower MRSS scores, and reverse established disease in patients with longer disease duration and higher MRSS scores.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of Systematic Sclerosis (SSc), as defined using the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/ European Union League Against Rheumatism classification of SSc 2. Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc) as defined by LeRoy and Medsger 3. Disease duration of ≤ 36 months (defined as time from the first non−Raynaud phenomenon manifestation) 4. For disease duration of ≤ 18 months: ≥ 10 and ≤ 35 mRSS units at the screening visit 5. For disease duration of &gt;1836 months: ≥ 15 and ≤ 45 mRSS units at the screening visit and one of the following: Increase ≥ 3 in mRSS units compared with the last visit within previous 16 months Involvement of one new body area with ≥ 2 mRSS units compared with the last visit within the previous 16 months Involvement of two new body areas with ≥ 1 mRSS units compared with the last visit within the previous 16 months Presence of 1 or more Tendon Friction Rub 6. Age ≥ 18 years at the screening visit 7. If female of childbearing potential, the patient must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline visits 8. Oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) and NSAIDs are permitted if the patient is on a stable dose regimen for 2 weeks prior to and including the baseline visit. 9. ACE inhibitors, calciumchannel blockers, protonpump inhibitors, and/or oral vasodilators are permitted if the patient is on a stable dose for ≥ 2 weeks prior to and including the baseline visit. 1. Rheumatic disease other than dcSSc; it is acceptable to include patients with fibromyalgia and sclerodermaassociated myopathy 2. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis or sine scleroderma at the screening visit 3. Major surgery (including joint surgery) within 8 weeks prior to screening visit 4. Infected ulcer prior to randomization 5. Treatment with any investigational agent within ≤ 4 weeks (or 5 halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer) of the baseline visit 6. Previous treatment with celldepleting therapies, including investigational agents, including but not limited to, CAMPATH, antiCD4, antiCD5, antiCD3, antiCD19, and ABA 7. AntiCD20, and cyclophosphamide within 12 months prior to baseline visit. 8. Use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 12 weeks prior to baseline visit 9. Previous treatment with chlorambucil, bone marrow transplantation, or total lymphoid irradiation 10. Immunization with a live/attenuated vaccine within ≤ 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit 11. Treatment with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil rapamycin, colchicine, or Dpenicillamine, within≤ 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit 12. Treatment with etanercept within ≤ 2 weeks, infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab, ABA or adalimumab within ≤ 8 weeks, anakinra within ≤ 1 week prior to the baseline visit 13. Pulmonary disease with FVC ≤ 50% of predicted, or DLCO (uncorrected for hemoglobin ) ≤ 40% of predicted at the screening visit 14. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as determined by right heart catheterization or on PAH approved medications for PAH. It is acceptable to use PDFE5 inhibitors for Raynaud's and digital ulcers. 15. Subjects at risk for tuberculosis (TB). Specifically excluded from this study will be participants with a history of active TB within the last 3 years, even if it was treated; a history of active TB greater than 3 years ago, unless there is documentation that the prior antiTB treatment was appropriate in duration and type; current clinical, radiographic, or laboratory evidence of active TB; and latent TB that was not successfully treated (≥ 4 weeks). 16. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen prior to the baseline visit 17. Positive for hepatitis C antigen, if the presence of hepatitis C virus was also shown with polymerase chain reaction or recombinant immunoblot assay prior to baseline visit 18. Subjects at risk for tuberculosis (TB). Specifically excluded from this study will be participants with a history of active TB within the last 3 years, even if it was treated; a history of active TB greater than 3 years ago, unless there is documentation that the prior antiTB treatment was appropriate in duration and type; current clinical, radiographic, or laboratory evidence of active TB; and latent TB that was not successfully treated (≥ 4 weeks). 19. Any of the following at the screening visit: Hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dL; WBC &lt; 3,000/mm3 (&lt;3 x 109/L); platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3 (&lt;3 x 109/L); serum creatinine &gt; 2 x ULN; serum ALT or AST &gt; 2 x ULN 20.
