	<brief_summary>Patients with traumatic brain injury are likely to present with cognitive, psychological, emotional and behavioral problems during different periods, all of which affect patients' life quality seriously. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive and psychosocial outcome in patients with mild traumatic brain injury, and to determine the risk factors associated with cognitive and psychological outcome. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), activities of daily living scale (ADL), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and mental health symptom checklist (SCL-90) were used to assess the cognitive performance and psychological outcomes in 360 patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests and Logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors.</brief_summary>
