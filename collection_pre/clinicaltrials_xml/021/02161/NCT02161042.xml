	<brief_summary>Blood transfusion is often used to treat patients with Anemia. The period of storage of blood products prior to use for transfusion may vary. Prolonged storage of blood products may result in changing their biochemistry. This study aims to look into whether the transfusion of "old" blood, which is stored for more than 7 days, as compared to the transfusion of "Fresh" blood, which is stored for less than 7 days, will affect endothelial function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Blood Transfusion on Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endothelial function assessed pre and post transfusion. The EndoPAT uses a unique bio-sensors that are placed on the fingertips to measure pressure. The test takes about 20-25 minutes. During the procedure the participant will have biosensors placed on the index finger of each hand. The nondominant arm will have a blood pressure cuff applied with sufficient pressure for five minutes. At the end of the test the device will provide a reading that assesses the level of endothelial function/dysfunction.</detailed_description>
