	<brief_summary>Statins are widely used as lipid-lowering agents to lower cardiovascular risk with a favorable safety profile. In our recent in vitro study, the addition of simvastatin to chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU showed synergistic anticancer effect in various colon cancer cells (unpublished data). So we planned this study to investigate the synergistic effect of simvastatin combined with capecitabine and radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.</brief_summary>
