	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate phenoxymethylpenicillin (the v-penicillin) and trimethoprim's possible induction of oxidative stress in human cells. The induction is examined by comparing changes in oxidative stress in the treatment group with the change in a placebo group. The study is a randomized-based placebo-controlled study. Each treatment group consists of 30 healthy male volunteers who consume either v-penicillins, trimethoprim or placebo over 7 days. The induction of oxidative stress is measured by 8-oxoguanosine and 8-oxodeoxoguanosine, isolated from urine. A t-test will be performed to compare drug treatment with placebo. The results will be published.</brief_summary>
