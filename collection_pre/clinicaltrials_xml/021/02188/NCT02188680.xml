	<brief_summary>The patients having a syndrome SII would be more intolerant in the fructose than the healthy subjects and would benefit from a fructose diet but also from the fructans which contain some fructose. The intolerance in the fructose is diagnosed thanks to a respiratory test after absorption of fructose. However, the eviction of the fructose is sometimes recommended to the patients without having realized beforehand the test of intolerance.</brief_summary>
