	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is look at the safety of: - Taking a specific combination of immunosuppressant drugs after liver transplantation - Receiving one of three different doses of donor-alloantigen-reactive regulatory T cells (darTregs) while taking this specific combination of drugs</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor-Alloantigen-Reactive Regulatory T Cell (darTregs) in Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After liver transplantation, immunosuppressants must be taken every day to prevent the body from injuring the transplanted liver by a process called rejection. People who take these drugs may experience side effects. Studies show that some of body's cells, called T regulatory cells (Tregs), may play a part in accepting the transplanted liver. The investigators are learning about whether scientists can take Tregs from the blood of a liver transplant recipient and teach them to protect the transplanted liver from rejection. In the laboratory, the recipient Tregs are exposed to cells from the liver donor. Research data suggests that giving these "donor reactive" Tregs back to the transplant recipient might allow a liver transplant recipient to take lower doses of immunosuppressants, or perhaps to stop them altogether, without rejecting the liver.</detailed_description>
