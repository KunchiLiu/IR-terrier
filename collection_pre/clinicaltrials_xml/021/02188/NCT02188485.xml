	<brief_summary>With the long-term goal of improving interventions for late-life suicide, the purpose of this study is to examine whether a mechanism by which behavioral interventions reduce risk for late-life suicide is by increasing social connectedness. The investigators propose to examine whether a manualized intervention that targets connectedness--ENGAGE--increases connectedness in older adults who report clinically significant depression and disconnectedness—operationalized as feeling lonely and/or like a burden on others. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial comparing the ENGAGE intervention with care-as-usual (CAU), using n=100 primary care patients aged ≥ 60 years who report social disconnectedness (i.e., loneliness or burdensomeness) and either Minor or Major Depression. At baseline, 3-week, 6-week and 10-week assessments, subjects will report on social connectedness, depression, and suicide risk. The investigators hypothesize that those subjects assigned to ENGAGE will report greater increases in connectedness—measured as greater belongingness and lower burdensomeness—compared to CAU; that ENGAGE will produce greater reductions in depression and suicide ideation than CAU; and that changes in depression will be accounted for changes in social connectedness.</brief_summary>
