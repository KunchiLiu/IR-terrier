	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, prospective, active-controlled, randomized, open-label, clinical trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of single intra-articular injection of RegenoGel-SP for the treatment of OA. RegenoGel-SP is composed of fibrinogen in plasma linked to a high molecular weight HA. The viscoelastic properties resulting from the combination of these two natural macromolecules is further enhanced by joint surface associated factors to generate a viscoelastic gel with superior stability and mechanical integrity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I, Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Active-Controlled Clinical Trial for Safety Evaluation of Intra-articular Injection of RegenoGel-SP for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighteen subjects will be randomized and sequentially assigned to RegenoGel-SP or to hyaluronic acid (HA) treatments on a 2:1 basis, respectively. Treatment groups will be assigned as per a randomization list that will be prepared prior to the start of the study. Randomization will be done at Enrollment (Visit 2). Neither surgeon nor subject will be blinded to treatment. Subjects will be monitored for 6 months following treatment. Following signing the Informed Consent form (Visit 1), subjects who conform to the inclusion criteria will answer questionnaires for grading of their symptoms, pain level and overall functional performance. Subjects will be evaluated for vital signs, blood hematology, chemistry, INR, aPTT and ECG, and will be subjected to a 30-40ml blood withdrawal that will be used for the production of autologous RegenoGel-SP. Subjects randomized to receive RegenoGel-SP will receive a single, intra-articular injection (Visit 2), while subjects randomized to receive HA treatment (Euflexxa®) will be injected with 3 intra-articular weekly injections of (Visits 2-4). Subjects treated with RegenoGel-SP will attend visits 3 and 4 but will not receive treatment. All subjects will return for Observation visits after 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months following treatment (Visits 5-7). During treatment and observation visits, subjects will be monitored for safety parameters (local and systemic AEs, blood work analysis ) and response to treatment using the above questionnaires.</detailed_description>
