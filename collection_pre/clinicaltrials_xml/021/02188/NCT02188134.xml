	<brief_summary>Per-capita consumption of medication is higher in older adults than any other sector of the population. In fact, it has been estimated that although older adults comprise 13% of the population they take 34% of all prescriptions and 30% of the over-the-counter (OTCs) consumed in the US (National Council on Patient Information and Education, 2010). Given current trends in aging, the savings, freedom and flexibility that self-medicating provides, as well as the trends to switch prescription products to an OTC status, it is likely that older adults will increasingly turn to OTCs as part of their medical regimens for years to come (Hanlon, J et al, 2001). In addition to the advantages that self-medicating offers, there are risks. These risks are more pronounced in older consumers, who are likely experiencing physiological changes (e.g. pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, perceptual, cognitive and motor); this combines with a propensity for poly-pharmacy that escalates the likelihood of adverse drug reactions. It has also been suggested that low health literacy rates in older consumers detrimentally impact health and health outcomes in this population (Kutner et al., 2005 and Federman et al., 2009). Despite the risks associated with improper OTC use, the critical importance of OTC labeling information (there is no learned intermediary), and the fact that older consumers are significantly more likely to experience an adverse drug reaction than younger adults, surprisingly little information exists about the decision making process older adults employ when selecting and using an OTC product. We propose to recruit people 65 and older for an eye tracking study of mock OTC brands. The study has the following objectives: 1. To begin to garner insights regarding the proportion of subjects who closely examine (e.g. turn to the Drug Facts Label) the labeling of an OTC when deciding whether (or not) a drug is appropriate for them (based on their health history and current medications). 2. To quantify and compare the attentive behaviors to specific information (Specifically: name, active ingredient, symptom relief). 3. To quantify and compare the attentive behaviors to different formats of information (prominently featured information vs less prominently featured information). 4. To begin to benchmark whether or not older consumers make appropriate choices based on their current conditions and medication history.</brief_summary>
