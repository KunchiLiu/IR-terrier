	<brief_summary>In the Emergency Department Regional Hospital Horsens a monitor will display Geographical Information System data (GIS data) for all ambulances with the hospital as final destination. The location, estimated time of arrival (ETA) and urgency code for the ambulances will be showed. Furthermore the patient's name, personal identification number and the primary message received by the emergency medical dispatch center resulting in ambulance dispatch will be displayed. This may enable the coordinating nurse to optimize timing of the ad hoc trauma team and medical emergency team activation. The teams are activated if the patient's condition is assessed to be of the highest urgency and/or severity - triage 1 or "red". The coordinating nurse makes this assessment on the basis of information from the ambulance personnel and makes the decision to activate the team and when to do it. In this study the investigators want to examine if the availability of GIS data in the emergency department results in reduced waiting time for the members of the trauma team and medical emergency team. The study will be conducted as a before and after study.</brief_summary>
