Part B of the study will investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of LY2944876 in non Japanese participants. Participation is expected to last up to about 8 weeks, not including screening. All doses will be administered as injections into the fatty layer just beneath the skin. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study. All participants will attend a post study safety assessment approximately 6 weeks after their final dose.</brief_summary>
