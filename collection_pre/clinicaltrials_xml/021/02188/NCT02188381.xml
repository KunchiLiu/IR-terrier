	<brief_summary>Hypertension is the single most prevalent risk factor for heart diseases, heart failure, kidney failure and stroke. About 1 in 3 adults in the United States have hypertension. Approximately 28-30% of hypertensive patients suffer from resistant hypertension (RH). Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the hypertension. Additional data suggests the involvement of gut microbiota in host normal cardiovascular functions and pathophysiology. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that antibiotic treatment benefits patients with acute coronary syndromes and reduces the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events. Even though these studies did not address effects of antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiota, it is possible that gut microbiota could affect neurologic inflammation. Finally, intestinal microbiota has recently been proposed to modulate blood pressure (BP) through production of short-chain fatty acids. In order to investigate this, the investigators hypothesize that gut microbiota is involved in the neuroinflammation-mediated initiation and establishment of RH, and targeting gut microbiota by minocycline would produce beneficial outcomes in RH.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective cohort design. The study will enroll 123 subjects: 25 normal controls, 25 subjects with controlled hypertension, 25 subjects with resistent hypertension and 48 subjects enrolled in NCT 02133872. Subjects will provide stool samples for analysis. Subjects will also provide a blood sample for inflammatory marker and stem cell analysis.</detailed_description>
