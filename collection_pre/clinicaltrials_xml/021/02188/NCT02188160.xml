	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of KPI-121 in Subjects With Dry Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension versus vehicle in subjects with dry eye disease. Approximately 400 subjects will be screened and up to 150 subjects will be randomized at up to 12 centers located in the United States. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 study arms in an approximate 1:1 ratio. The study arms are: 1) KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension administered 1-2 drops in each eye QID for up to 28 days or 2) vehicle administered as 1-2 drops in each eye QID for up to 28 days. This study will include up to 6 clinic visits over 6 weeks. At Visit 1 Screening (14 ± 1 days prior to Day 1), subjects who meet screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will begin a 2-week run-in period during which they will be treated with 1-2 drops of single-masked vehicle in each eye QID for 14 ± 1 days. At Visit 2, Randomization (Day 1), subjects who continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for randomization to 1 of the 2 arms of the study (i.e., KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle). Following randomization, subjects will be instructed to return to the clinic to have a complete study evaluation at Study Visits 4 and 6 (Days 15 ± 1 day and 29 ± 1 day, respectively). Subjects will further be instructed to return to the clinic for diary collection and in-clinic symptom assessment only at Visits 3 and 5 (Days 8 ± 1 day and 22 ± 1 day, respectively). The last dose of investigational product and the final study visit will occur upon completion of 28 ± 1 days of exposure to investigational product. Subjects will be released from the study at the end of Visit 6 (Day 29 ± 1 day).</detailed_description>
