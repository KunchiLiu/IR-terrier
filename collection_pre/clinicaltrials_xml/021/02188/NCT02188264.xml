	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of selumetinib when given together with cyclosporine in treating patients with solid tumors or colorectal cancer that have spread to other places in the body and cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as cyclosporine, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving selumetinib and cyclosporine may be a better treatment for solid tumors or colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combination of AZD6244 (selumetinib) and cyclosporin A (cyclosporine) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population. II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of the combination. III. To evaluate the selected biomarkers of drug effect in patients with advanced solid tumors or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). IV. Evaluate the activity of the combination in terms of objective response rate (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS). OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of selumetinib followed by a phase Ib study. Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day -7 of course 1 and then on days 1-28 (one dose on day 1 only). Patients also receive cyclosporine PO BID on day -3 of course 1 and then on days 1-28 (one dose on day 1 only). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Before any study procedures are performed, subjects will have the details of the study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read; then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of study personnel DOSE ESCALATION PHASE: Histological or cytopathological diagnosis of an advanced cancer that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists COHORT EXPANSION PHASE: Histological or cytopathological diagnosis of advanced/metastatic unresectable colorectal cancer with known rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) mutational status;
