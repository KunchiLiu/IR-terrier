	<brief_summary>Greater occipital nerve (GON) anesthetic blockades are widely used for the treatment of headaches, yet its efficacy in migraine has hardly been assessed with controlled studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term clinical efficacy of GON anaesthetic blockades in chronic migraine and to analyze their effect on pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) in different areas. We hypothesize that those patients receiving real GON anesthetic blockade will receive greater improvements in pain nociception. We will conduct a double-blind, randomized, parallel and placebo-controlled clinical trial where one group will be treated with bilateral GON blockade with bupivacaine 0,5% and the other group will be treated with placebo.</brief_summary>
