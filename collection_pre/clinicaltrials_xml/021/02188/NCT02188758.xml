	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to identify chemical compounds in the blood and sputum (i.e., biomarkers) that are associated with objective measurements of health status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study builds upon observations that blood levels of hepcidin-25, a protein that regulates how the body uses and stores iron, vary during CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPE).</brief_summary>
