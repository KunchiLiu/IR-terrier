	<brief_summary>Previous studies suggest self-regulatory techniques including self-monitoring, and SMS text-messaging as an intervention modality, can modify health behaviors including physical activity (PA). The primary purpose of this study was to examine change in objectively measured PA in a randomized controlled pilot trial that tested a wearable sensor/device (Fitbit One) for self-monitoring and SMS text-messaging prompts to promote PA in overweight/obese adults. In a 2-group design, 67 participants were provided the Fitbit One and half were randomized to receive 3 daily SMS-based PA prompts. A Fitbit One was provided to facilitate self-monitoring with a wearable tracker for instant feedback and website of daily PA summaries. Outcome measures were number of steps and minutes of PA by intensity-level using two accelerometers: Actigraph GT3X+ (primary) at baseline and 6-week follow-up and Fitbit One (secondary) at baseline and weeks 1-6. The main hypothesis was that text messaging plus the Fitbit One would show a greater increase in steps and minutes of PA compared to only the Fitbit One at 6-week follow-up.</brief_summary>
