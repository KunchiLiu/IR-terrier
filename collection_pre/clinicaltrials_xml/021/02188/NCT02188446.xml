	<brief_summary>Radical cystectomy provides the best cancer-specific survival for muscle-invasive urothelial cancer. However the postoperative morbidity remains at 11-68 %. Smoking and alcohol consumption above two drinks per day is associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity. Six-eight weeks of smoking and alcohol abstinence prior to elective surgery is recommended to reduce this risk, but for cancer patients the preoperative period is often very short. This randomised clinical trial (STOP-OP) will reach a conclusion on the effect of a new Gold Standard Programme for both smoking and alcohol cessation Intervention using the Gold Standard Programme (GSP) on the frequency and severity of postoperative complications after bladder cancer surgery.</brief_summary>

The GSP includes benzodiazepine therapy for withdrawal symptoms, controlled disulfiram therapy, and Nicotine replacement.</detailed_description>
