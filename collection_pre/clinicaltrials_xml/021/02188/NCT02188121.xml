	<brief_summary>Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) die younger than persons in the general population. Much of the excess mortality for SMI patients is attributable to cardiovascular disease, and is exacerbated by treatment with second-generation antipsychotics (2GAs). Although the cardiovascular risks are well-known, and safe, efficacious therapy exists, few SMI patients receive cardiovascular prevention drugs. Care delivery fragmentation and poor patient adherence are central problems to reducing cardiovascular risks for patients with SMI. To address these problems, we propose to conduct a multi-site, open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing an initial treatment strategy of free, fixed-doses of two generic, cardiovascular prevention drugs (statins and angiotensin drugs) delivered within mental health clinics versus usual treatment. The study will include adult patients (18+ years old) with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or psychosis NOS who have received 2GAs treatment within the past six months from within four mental health clinics in the Boston area. We have three aims: 1) to compare the proportions of subjects in each arm who are receiving cardiovascular drug treatment and are adherent to therapy during 12-months of follow-up; 2) to compare changes in composite (e.g., Framingham scores) and individual (e.g., lipid levels) cardiovascular risk factor levels using an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach; and 3) to compare risk factor levels, accounting for variation in adherence over time, using causal inference techniques to estimate the per-protocol effect of the intervention. Our three aims examine whether this low cost, streamlined treatment strategy increases the numbers of subjects receiving cardiovascular prevention therapy and improves cardiovascular risk levels. We will follow subjects for 12 months, and collect interview and biometric data at baseline and over the following 12 months. Subjects will have the option to continue for another 12 months, during which we will continue to collect interview and biometric data, but will not prescribe cardiovascular medications. This population-based initial treatment strategy could be an effective and efficient approach for overcoming traditional barriers to cardiovascular disease prevention within the SMI population. Findings from this study will inform efforts to improve care and outcomes, and to enhance survival for patients with severe mental illness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fixed Dose Intervention Trial of New England Enhancing Survival in SMI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By design, all subjects in the Intervention arm will start by being under treatment. During the course of follow-up, we expect that some will stay consistently on treatment, some will discontinue treatment (become non-adherent), while others will make transitions on and off treatment in various patterns. In contrast, by design, subjects in the Usual Treatment (control) arm do not start on treatment; however, some will initiate treatment as a result of usual clinical care, e.g., primary care physician initiation. At any point we will be comparing two binary outcomes (on or off treatment) and will use standard methods for comparing two proportions to test statistical significance and get confidence intervals for the difference in the percent on treatment in the two arms. Participants who are ineligible for randomization will be followed similarly to participants in the Usual Treatment Arm, in a third, non-randomized group, which will be excluded from the primary analysis.</detailed_description>
