	<brief_summary>Obese asthmatics have more severe symptoms, reduced lung function, poorer quality of life and a reduced response to inhaled corticosteroid medication compared to non-obese asthmatics. In addition, the impact of a weight-loss program on clinical control and psychological outcomes has been poorly demonstrated and the effect of exercise training remain unknown. The investigators aim to investigate the effect of exercise training in a weight-loss program on asthma clinical control (primary outcome), health factors related to quality of life and psychosocial symptoms (secondary outcomes) in obese patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. Physical activity, inflammatory profiles and sleep disorders will also be evaluated. The investigators' hypothesis is that exercise as part of a weight-loss program is more effective to lose weight and improve asthma control, quality of life and psychosocial symptoms in obese asthmatics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training to Lose Weight in Obese Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled and single blinded trial. Fifty-four asthmatic adults will be randomly assigned into two groups: DBG (dietary and behavioral support group) or DBE (similar to DBG + exercise training). Both groups will complete a weight-loss program based on dietary and behavioral therapy. In addition, DBE will perform a training program based on aerobic and resistance training whereas DBG will perform a breathing and stretching program. Interventions will be performed twice a week for 3 months, 60 minutes each. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the variables obtained before interventions will be compared with the Student t-test or Mann-whitney U-test. Comparisons of the initial and final data on outcomes will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate post hoc of Bonferroni. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.</detailed_description>
