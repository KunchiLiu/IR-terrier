	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Absorbable Implant for the Treatment of Nasal Valve Collapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Multi-Center, Non-Randomized, Prospective Exploratory Study of the INEX Nasal Implant. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the INEX Nasal Implant in subjects with moderate to severe nasal valve collapse.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1) The subject is ≥ 18 years of age. 2) The subject is willing and able to provide informed consent. 3) The subject is willing and able to comply with the study protocol. 4) The subject is seeking treatment for nasal obstruction on one or both sides of the nose and is willing to undergo an officebased or intraoperative nasal implant procedure in lieu of alternative treatments (i.e., surgical repair or use of an external dilator). 5) The subject has a baseline NOSE Score ≥ 11. 6) The subject agrees to followup examinations for 18 months post treatment. 7) The investigator has determined that nasal valve collapse (NVC) is a primary or significant contributor to the subject's nasal obstruction based on clinical presentation, physical examination and nasal endoscopy. 8) Patient agrees to have mupirocin ointment prior to implantation. 9) The subject has sufficient space available to receive the implant and the shape of the maxilla allows for an appropriate anchor location. 10) The subject has been offered other available treatments and declined such treatments. 1) The subject has had concomitant surgical or nonsurgical treatment of their nasal valve or the subject has had prior rhinoplasty within 12 months. 2) The subject has had septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction or other surgical nasal procedures within the past six (6) months. 3) The subject has had recurrent methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureas (MRSA) infections or has a current Staphylococcus infection. 4) The subject plans to have concomitant surgical or nonsurgical treatment of their nasal valve within 6 months of the study (through 6 month followup). 5) The subject has used or plans to use intranasal steroids during treatment (within 2 weeks preimplant and 2 weeks post implantation). 6) The subject has a permanent implant, dilator and/or uses an external device in the nasal area. 7) The subject has concomitant inflammatory or infectious skin conditions or unhealed wounds in the treatment area. 8) The subject has a cancerous or precancerous lesion and/or has had radiation exposure in the treatment area or chemotherapy within 24 months of the study. 9) The subject has known or suspected allergies or contraindications for any general or local anesthetic agents and / or any antibiotic medications. 10) The subject has a history of significant bleeding disorders. 11) The subject is known or suspected to be pregnant or is lactating. 12) The subject has a known or suspected allergy to PLA or other bioresorbable materials. 13) The subject has significant systemic disease such as chronic steroid use or poorly controlled diabetes which in the investigator's opinion could predispose the subject to poor wound healing. 14) The subject is currently using nasal oxygen or CPAP. 15) The subject is not a candidate for procedures conducted under general anesthesia.</criteria>
