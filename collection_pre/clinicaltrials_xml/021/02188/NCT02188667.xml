	<brief_title>Integrating Patient Reported Outcomes (I-PRO) Study for Multidisciplinary Pain Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initiative has three components to aid clinicians' care of patients with chronic noncancer pain: (1) education, (2) standardized patient reported outcomes data collection, and (3) evidence-based brief treatment reminders. Practices will be randomized to either receive the three novel components (treatment group) or continue with usual care (control group). Providers in the treatment group will be asked (a) to complete a series of six online education modules in pain care, (b) will be given access to new patient reported outcomes questionnaire data collected from patients within the electronic health record, (c) asked to review this data and related care recommendations during the patient visit, and (d) asked to complete baseline and monthly online surveys related to experiences and satisfaction with providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain. Providers in the control group will provide care as usual to patients and will be asked to complete baseline and monthly online surveys related to experiences and satisfaction with providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain. Primary study outcomes include comparison of treatment and control group provider and patient satisfaction surveys. Secondary outcome measures include provider referral rates, patient outcomes, patient treatments recommended/ordered, and patient service utilization/costs.</detailed_description>
