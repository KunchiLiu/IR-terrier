	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of low-dose total lymphoid irradiation (LD-TLI) in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease that has not responded to treatment with steroids. LD-TLI is a procedure in which all of the body's major lymph nodes are treated with small doses of radiation in order to reset the dysfunctional immune system. LD-TLI may work as a treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Total Lymphoid Irradiation in Treating Patients With Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in cohorts of a selected population of refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) patients, given to cohorts with a total cumulative doses of TLI of 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 centigray (cGy). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy (failure free survival [FFS] at 6 months) of this therapy in the study population. II. Approximate the efficacy at different dose levels using the GvHD summary scores. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of this therapy on relevant subpopulations of immune cells in an attempt to elucidate a mechanism of action. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo LD-TLI daily for 1-2 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 45, at 3 and 6 months, at 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients may have received a prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) for any indication and from any donor Patients must have a diagnosis of cGvHD, in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines; patients with "overlap syndrome" are also eligible; NOTE: Patients with recurrent, late onset and/or persistent acute GvHD (alone) are not eligible Patients with chronic GvHD who have been exposed to two or more lines of therapy, including at least one of which was composed of a glucocorticoid and a calcineurin inhibitor are eligible. Patients must have active, but not rapidly progressive, refractory cGvHD; any degree of severity (as per NIH criteria) and/or pattern of organ involvement may be considered; that said, patients with more severe and/or extensive chronic GvHD are expected to be the usual candidates for therapy As above, GvHD should be controlled to a degree that would potentially allow no additional requirement for systemic IST before and following TLI =&lt; 15 and &gt;= day (d) +45, respectively The ability to administer protocol doses of TLI (i.e., 100, 200 or 300 cGy) without exceeding cumulative doses of radiation must be established; for patients with prior radiotherapy exposure, this determination will be made by Dr. Greven (or her designee) using published guidelines for excessive organ exposure Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 60% White blood cells &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 10.0 g/dL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL NOTE: If such hematologic abnormalities are present and deemed due to the process of cGvHD, such requirements may be waived with the approval of the PI Patients must have nonhematologic organ function as defined below: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40% Key pulmonary function tests (PFTs) &gt; 40% No further criteria for nonhematologic organ function are specified; however, if moderatetosevere (major) organ function is present, such should be discussed with the PI, as various degrees of nonhematologic organ dysfunction may compromise either (or both) outcomes and toxicity evaluation If there is concern regarding potential reversibility of any specific organ dysfunction, this issue should be addressed by consultation with an appropriate subspecialist Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an institutional review board (IRB)approved informed consent document Patients with evidence of persistent or active malignancy or uncontrolled infection at the time of study entry Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
