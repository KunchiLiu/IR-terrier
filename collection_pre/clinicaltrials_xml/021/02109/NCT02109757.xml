	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this research is to evaluate the performance, effectiveness, and long-term training benefits of a formal hearing protection fit testing program. This study may provide preliminary evidence on the benefits of direct education/training combined with a formal hearing protection device (HPD) fit testing on HPD fittings on United States Air Force (USAF) employees. Currently, Public Health provides informal, subjective training to employees; this practice may be altered by the results of this study.</brief_summary>
