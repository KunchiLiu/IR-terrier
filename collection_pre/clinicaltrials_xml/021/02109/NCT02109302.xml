	<brief_summary>The main objective of our study is to identify the first genetic etiology of primary Premature Ejaculation (PE). We will test and evaluate the existence of genetic determinism conferring susceptibility to a life-long syndrome (primary premature ejaculation) in some patients. To this end, we plan to establish a collection of biological samples and a database of patients with this extreme syndrome, which we will analyze by Genome Wide analysis. This will lead to improvements in the biological understanding, the "knowledge" of physicians of the disease, and should improve the patients' quality of life. Not all PE cases have the same physiopathology and treatment efficiency, which depend on the specific mechanism involved in the clinical context. Our work will make it possible to develop new therapeutic approaches suitable for a large proportion of individuals presenting PE. This integrative approach combining researchers, patients and ethics committees will facilitate profound reflection, promoting the creation of suitable structures capable of receiving patients for appropriate consultations. This unique study of PE should also favor industrial partnerships.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2.1 Main Objective - To identify the molecular basis of primary premature ejaculation (PPE) in humans for the development of new adapted therapy. - Check and confirm the genetic hypothesis of PPE to fill the void of genetic knowledge about this syndrome. - Improve knowledge of physicians on this disease to increase the comfort of life of patients. 2.2 Secondary Objectives - Provide the basis for new therapeutic approaches. - Expanded knowledge of the aetiology of PE and allow better management of patients. - Develop strategies to prevent the consequences, sometimes severe , of this condition on the intimate, personal, social and professional life of these patients. Because all the PE do not have the same pathophysiology and treatment success depends on its relevance to the specific mechanism of the clinical form concerned. - Increase the comfort of life of the patients. - Eliminate public prejudice based on misconceptions.</detailed_description>
