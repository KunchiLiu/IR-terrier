	<brief_summary>The investigators seek to examine the metabolic changes that occur amongst obese and lean pregnant women with normal glycemic control as well as pregnant women with diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus) compared to non-pregnant age matched controls. Given the adaptive tendency of the maternal body to use alternative energy sources such as ketones and free fatty acids rather than glucose and to shunt glucose and amino acids to the fetus, the investigators hypothesize that the amino acid and fatty acid profile will be reflective of this adaptive change and that maternal insulin resistance will result in alterations in this pattern in both the plasma and CSF. Furthermore, the investigators also hypothesize that maternal degrees of insulin resistance will also be reflected in CSF hormonal changes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Markers of Energy Metabolism in Pregnant Women With Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We seek to investigate for the first time whether CSF branched chain amino acid, free fatty acid, and energy regulatory hormone levels are altered in comparison to plasma levels among pregnant and non-pregnant individuals with varying degrees of insulin resistance. Furthermore, we seek to understand the effects of pregnancy on central and peripheral energy metabolism using metabolomic profiling as well as traditional hormonal measurements in maternal blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid as well as cord blood.</detailed_description>
