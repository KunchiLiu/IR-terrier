	<brief_summary>This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study in four groups of healthy adult male and female subjects who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. The study will be conducted at one or two sites located in South Africa. The purpose is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two injections of AERAS 404 prepared with four escalating amounts of antigen in healthy adult male and female subjects who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety and Immunogenicity of AERAS 404 (C-011-404)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study in four groups of healthy adult male and female subjects who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. The study will be conducted at one or two sites located in South Africa. Forty subjects will be sequentially enrolled into one of four study groups (i.e., Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, or Group 4) based on time of completion of screening, with 10 subjects enrolled into each group. Within each study group, subjects will be randomized to a treatment regimen of either AERAS-404 or placebo control administered by intramuscular injection on Study Day 0 and Study Day 56. All subjects will receive the same treatment on Study Day 0 as they receive on Study Day 56. The dose of antigen will increase between study groups. All subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. A total of eleven clinic visits are planned (excluding screening) for all subjects.</detailed_description>

History of allergic disease or reactions, including eczema, likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine 11. Previous medical history that may have compromised the safety of the subject in the study 12. Evidence of a new acute illness that may have compromised the safety of the subject in the study 13.
