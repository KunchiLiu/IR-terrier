	<brief_summary>1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of liver, representing the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. 2. Its overall dismal prognosis is a result of high incidence rates of metastasis and postoperative recurrence, in particular the intrahepatic recurrence. 3. TACE is the most widely used primary treatment for unresectable HCC. It was also used as the optional treatment of relapsed disease. However, the efficacy of TACE used as adjuvant therapy following hepatectomy remains controversial.</brief_summary>
