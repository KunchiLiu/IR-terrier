	<brief_summary>To evaluate the response to chemotherapy with the drug decitabine combined with rapamycin in the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia in patients of all ages, and in the treatment of newly diagnosed leukemia in those who are older than 65 when diagnosed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Decitabine in Combination With Sequential Rapamycin or Ribavirin in High Risk AML Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the efficacy of decitabine followed by Rapamycin in previously untreated elderly patients not able to receive standard chemotherapy or in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, through measurement of Complete Remission (CR), Complete Remission Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp), Partial Remission (PR), and event free and overall survival (Arm A). To determine the safety of administration of decitabine with escalating doses of Ribavirin in elderly leukemia patients or patients with relapsed/refractory disease with M4/M5 subtypes anticipated to express high eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) at diagnosis (Arm B). To establish effect of these sequential treatments on expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt /mTOR) pathway proteins and on eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) activation through Western blot and phospho-flow methodologies. To correlate the clinical response with baseline expression of phospho-p70S6 Kinase/phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) and with the in vitro inhibitory effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with rapamycin or ribavirin on the level of downstream effectors. To determine whether a leukemia stem cell phenotype is inhibited by the sequential administration of decitabine/rapamycin or decitabine/ribavirin.</detailed_description>
