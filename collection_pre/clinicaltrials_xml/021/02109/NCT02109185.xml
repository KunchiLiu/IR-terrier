	<brief_title>A Comparison of Mometasone Nasal Spray, Nasonex Nasal Spray, Nasonex Nasal Spray Suspension, &amp; Placebo for Treatment of Seasonal Allergies for Safety, Efficacy, &amp; Superiority in 1520 Male &amp; Female Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and superiority of generic mometasone nasal spray to reference products and to placebo in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. This protocol describes randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4- treatment group parallel study of 14 days duration preceded by a single blind 7-day placebo run-in period to investigate the clinical equivalence of Mylan's Mometasone Furoate Monohydrate Nasal Spray, 50 ug per actuation to Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme's (MSD) Nasonex® Nasal Spray, 50 ug per actuation or MSD EU's Nasonex® Nasal Spray Suspension, 50 ug per actuation. In addition, the superiority of the test and reference products to placebo will be assessed. Prior to randomization to one of 4 study groups, each subject will have a 7-day placebo run-in period. Each subject will then receive one of the following treatments: Mylan's Mometasone Furoate Nasal Spray 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-US Nasonex® Nasal Spray 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-EU's Nasonex® and Nasal Spray Suspension 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); or Mylan's Placebo Nasal Spray 50 μL/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day). Active treatment is for 14 days duration. Reflective total nasal scores (rTNSS) will be collected every 12 hours for 21 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age: 12 years of age or older. 2. Signed informed consent form. For patients under the age of majority, the parent or legal guardian should sign the consent form and the child will be required to sign a patient "assent" form. 3. Sex: Male and/or nonpregnant, nonlactating females. All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 21 days prior to the start of the study and must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control. Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following is reported and documented on the medical history: postmenopausal with spontaneous amenorrhea for at least six months and a serum FSH levels &gt;40mIU/ml, or bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of bleeding for at least 6 months, or total hysterectomy and an absence of bleeding for at least 3 months. 4. History of seasonal allergic rhinitis of at least 2 years duration 5. Positive response to skin allergen testing to the relevant seasonal allergen (e.g. grass/tree/ragweed) for that sites geographical area within 14 months or at the time of study entry. Wheal size must be greater than or equal to (≥) 5 mm larger in diameter than diluent control via prick testing or greater than or equal to 7 mm larger in diameter than diluent control via intradermal testing. 6. Clinically active status (symptomatic) at both screening and baseline. The total nasal symptom score is to be greater than or equal to 6 on a 03 symptom scale with a score of at least 2 (moderate severity) for each of nasal congestion/stuffiness and one other nasal symptom score (rhinnorea, nasal itching, sneezing), and an overall disease rating of moderate or severe (e.g. total score of six or greater). 7. Weight: Age appropriate weight. BMI not to exceed 40 kg/m2 8. Tobacco Use: nontobacco using for at least 3 months prior to study initiation. 9. Capable of providing informed consent or assent. 10. All subjects should be judged by the Principal Investigator or Medical SubInvestigator as otherwise normal and healthy and free of clinically significant disease except for signs and symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis that would interfere with the study schedule or evaluation of SAR during a prestudy medical evaluation performed within 21 days of the initial dose of study medication which will include: 1. normal or nonclinically significant physical examination including nasal passage evaluation, including vital signs (pulse, temperature, respiration rate, blood pressure) 2. within normal limits or nonclinically significant laboratory evaluation results (unless otherwise specified) for the following tests: Serum Chemistries Sodium Albumin Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Potassium Uric Acid Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) Chloride Iron Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Calcium *Total Cholesterol* Alkaline Phosphatase Creatinine *Glucose* Phosphate Total Protein *Triglycerides* Total Bilirubin Fasting or nonfasting may be performed based on clinical judgment Hematology Platelet Count White blood cell count w/differential Hemoglobin Hematocrit Red Blood Cell count Urinalysis Protein pH Specific Gravity Appearance Microscopic Examination (to be performed if urine dipstick is positive) 3. normal or nonclinically significant 12lead ECG 4. negative urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoid (marijuana), methadone, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine unless legal prescribed or allowed by state/federal law. 5. Additional tests and or examinations may be performed, if judged necessary by the Principal Investigator or Medical SubInvestigator. 1. Institutionalized subjects. 2. Individuals who have a rTNSS score of 6 or greater at the start of the placebo runin period but who on the randomization day (i.e. Study Day 8) no longer meet the requirement (i.e. score &lt;6) prior to randomization, or who have a score less than 2 for Stuffiness/Congestion, or who have a score of less than 2 for all 3 of the remaining Nasal Symptoms will result in discontinuation of the subject from the study and the subject will not receive randomized treatment. The rTNSS score assessed on the randomization day (i.e. Study Day 8) will be an average of the scores from the preceding 7 scoring time points. For example, if randomization occurs on Day 8, then the average total score of the placebo runin phase will include the rTNSS scores from Study Day 5 (AM &amp; PM), Study Day 6(AM &amp; PM), Study Day 7(AM &amp; PM), and Study Day 8(AM). 3.
