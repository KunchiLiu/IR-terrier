	<brief_summary>A prospective observational study on corneal opacities (scar and stromal dystrophy) in adults (n=150) will be conducted at OHSU. The Optovue anterior segment OCT prototype will be used to perform 3-D corneal scans. These scans will be used to assess opacity depth and measure corneal thickness (pachymetry), corneal topography (anterior and posterior), and epithelial thickness maps. The ultrahigh-speed MIT OCT prototypes will also be used when they become available. A comprehensive eye examination, Placido-ring corneal topography, ultrasound pachymetry, and Scheimpflug camera imaging, will be performed for comparison</brief_summary>
