	<brief_summary>The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test 2 experimental HIV vaccines in combination with 2 licensed vaccines for tetanus and hepatitis B. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. Tetanus is an infection that causes muscular spasms. Hepatitis B is a virus that can cause liver failure. About 100 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study. We are doing this study to answer several questions. - Are the HIV study vaccines safe to give to people? - Are people able to take the HIV study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable? - How do people's immune systems respond to the HIV study vaccines? (Your immune system protects you from disease.) - Can people's immune responses to a tetanus or hepatitis B vaccines help us understand how their immune systems might respond to the HIV study vaccines? - Is there a common immune response to licensed vaccines like the tetanus and hepatitis B vaccines?</brief_summary>

Negative HIV1 and 2 blood test: Sites may use locally available assays that have been approved by HVTN Laboratory Operations. Negative Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) Negative antiHepatitis C virus antibodies (antiHCV), or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the antiHCV is positive Normal urine: Negative urine glucose, Negative or trace urine protein, and Urinalysis (dipstick) for blood no greater than 1+ (if trace or 1+ hemoglobin is present on dipstick, a microscopic urinalysis with red blood cells levels within institutional normal range). Volunteers who were born female: negative serum or urine β human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination Reproductive status: A volunteer who was born female must: Agree to consistently use effective contraception (see Appendix C) for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. Effective contraception for participants in South Africa is defined as using 2 methods, including the following: Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicide, Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, PLUS 1 of the following methods: Intrauterine device (IUD), Hormonal contraception (in accordance with South African contraception guidelines), or Successful vasectomy in the male partner (considered successful if a volunteer reports that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia by microscopy, or [2] a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity postvasectomy); Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; Or be sexually abstinent. Volunteers who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit Blood products received within 120 days before first vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40; or BMI ≥ 35 with 2 or more of the following: age &gt; 45, systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg, current smoker, known hyperlipidemia Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent during the planned duration of the HVTN 097 study Pregnant, breastfeeding or lactating History of Hepatitis B viral infection History of tetanus disease Vaccines and other Injections HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 097 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the South Africa Medicines Control Council (MCC). For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 097 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. For volunteers who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 097 PSRT on a casebycase basis. Live attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine received within 30 days before first vaccination or scheduled within 14 days after injection (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio vaccine [OPV]; varicella; yellow fever) Influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines and were received within 14 days prior to first vaccination (eg, pneumococcal, Hepatitis A) Any requirement to receive an HBV vaccine other than the HBV vaccine given during the study period. Allergy treatment with antigen injections within 30 days before first vaccination or that are scheduled within 14 days after first vaccination Known to have received a tetanus vaccination within the last 5 years prior to first vaccination. Immunosuppressive medications received within 168 days before first vaccination. (Not excluded: [1] corticosteroid nasal spray; [2] inhaled corticosteroids; [3] topical corticosteroids for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or [4] a single course of oral/parenteral corticosteroids at doses &lt; 2 mg/kg/day and length of therapy &lt; 11 days with completion at least 30 days prior to enrollment.

A clinically significant condition or process includes but is not limited to: A process that would affect the immune response, A process that would require medication that affects the immune response, Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws, A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert grave danger to the volunteer's health or wellbeing during the study period, A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with reactions to vaccine, or Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below. Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a volunteer's ability to give informed consent Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide, or history of suicide attempt or gesture within the past 3 years.

For these volunteers, blood pressure must be ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.
