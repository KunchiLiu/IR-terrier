	<brief_summary>LY2605541 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. This study is designed to understand how the body handles the investigational drug, and to measure the quantity of LY2605541 in fat tissue. The study has two parts. It involves intravenous (IV) infusion of the investigational drug and a procedure to measure concentrations in the fat tissue. Both parts of the study will be conducted in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Part A and B of the study might take up to 7 weeks to complete.</brief_summary>
