	<brief_summary>Intraocular pressure is significantly increase during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy which is performed in a steep trendelenburg position at prolonged times of pneumoperitoneum. Therefore investigators decided to evaluate the impacts of surgical visibility through deep neuromuscular blockade on intraocular pressure in patients undergoing Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
