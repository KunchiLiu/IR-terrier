	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to identify specific genes that are up- or downregulated in multiple myeloma patients who receive a microdose of either Melphalan (Alkeran®), Bortezomib (Velcade®) or Dexamethasone (Dexaven®). The study treatment constitutes 1% of the planned standard myeloma treatment and will be given two hours prior to standard treatment. Blood samples are taken at baseline, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes for microarray analysis.</brief_summary>
