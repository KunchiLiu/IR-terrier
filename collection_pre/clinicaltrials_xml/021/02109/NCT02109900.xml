	<brief_summary>This observational study aims the potential role of serum progesterone levels on the day of oocyte pick-up on the probability of pregnancy, in patients undergoing antagonist IVF cycles. There has been evidence, that increased serum levels of progesterone on triggering day are associated with a decreased probability of pregnancy after IVF. There is no study that investigate assocation between serum progesterone levels on the day of oocyte pick-up and IVF outcomes. This study will be the first in this case.</brief_summary>
