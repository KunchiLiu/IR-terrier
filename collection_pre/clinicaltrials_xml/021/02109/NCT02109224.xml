	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib in treating B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned or does not respond to treatment in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether it is safe for patients with HIV infection to receive ibrutinib while also taking anti-HIV drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib in Treating Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Patients With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-agent ibrutinib in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART) specifically with respect to ibrutinib metabolism in HIV-infected patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell neoplasms. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib in this setting. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize ibrutinib pharmacokinetics in relation to ART-cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) interactions. II. To describe toxicity in relation to plasma concentrations of ibrutinib and its main metabolite. III. To estimate objective response rate, clinical benefit, times to tumor response and progression, and 6-month and 1-year progression-free and overall survival. IV. To describe changes in HIV viral load, immunologic parameters, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy numbers in plasma and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in relation to ibrutinib therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Known HIV infection and histologically confirmed Bcell nonHodgkin lymphoma or Bcell lymphoproliferative disease as follows, as defined by the World Health Organization classification: Active Bcell nonHodgkin lymphoma (cluster of differentiation [CD]20 positive or negative), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or multiple myeloma that has relapsed, progressed, or been refractory to at least one regimen Note: Patients with CLL, SLL, or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) may only be enrolled in Stratum C At least 14 days between ibrutinib initiation and last cancer therapy; any number of prior cancer therapies is permitted; patients otherwise fit for blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) should receive secondline chemotherapy before considering enrollment Serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as evidenced by positive enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive Western blot, or any other federally approved licensed HIV test; alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the participant has HIV infection based on prior ELISA and Western blot, or other approved diagnostic tests Participants must be on a stable antiretroviral regimen per current International Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Society guidelines as follows, with no intention of changing the regimen within 8 weeks after ibrutinib initiation: Choice of regimen: The specific antiretroviral agents are at physician discretion, and the use of investigational agents currently available on an expandedaccess basis is allowed; use of experimental antiretroviral agents or those containing zidovudine (including Combivir and Trizivir) is prohibited Patients with mantle cell lymphoma, CLL, or SLL must be on noncytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYPA3A4) modulating antiretroviral agents (Stratum C) to be eligible for this study Patients may be switched to nonconflicting regimens in order to participate Stability of regimen: With the exception of patients on zidovudinebased ART, any changes in antiretroviral regimen must be made at least 4 weeks prior to ibrutinib initiation; patients taking zidovudinebased ART must change to a nonzidovudinebased regimen at least 2 weeks prior to ibrutinib initiation; changes to ART therapy during the study may be made if medically necessary (e.g. toxicity, treatment failure) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Life expectancy &gt;= 2 months Absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count: &gt;= 75 cells/uL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 750 cells/uL Platelets &gt;= 50,000 cells/uL, or &gt;= 30,000/uL if bone marrow is involved by malignancy Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;
