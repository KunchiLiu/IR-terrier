	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is threefold. First, the ability of experienced colonoscopists to recognize the type of loop formed will be assessed and whether the use of the MEI improves this accuracy. Second, to determine which maneuvers are used for loop reduction and whether certain loops have set ways to reduce them. The third component will assess whether the colonoscopist thought that the imager helped or not.</brief_summary>
