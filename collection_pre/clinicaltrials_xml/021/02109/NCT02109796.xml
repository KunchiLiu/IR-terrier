	<brief_summary>Previous studies show that one session of tDCS allow to improve muscle strength in hemiparetic patients in anodal condition. We test a new electrods configuration : a anodale stimulation opposite to the cortical representation area of the injured hemisphere and a simultaneous stimulation opposite to the homonyme the cortical representation area of the healthy hemisphere. This approach seems to be the best relevant electrods configuration in order to restore the inter-hemispheric balance. We hypothesis that one session of tDCS with this electrods configuration allow to improve paretic quadriceps strength in hemiparetic patients after stroke.</brief_summary>
