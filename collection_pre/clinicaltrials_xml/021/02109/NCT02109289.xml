	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this preliminary project is to study the effect of etanercept, a medicine approved by Health Canada for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, on the inflammation of certain blood vessels. In particular, the inflammation of the aorta and the carotid arteries will be studied. This study's goal is to determine if etanercept (that blocks TNF (tissue necrosis factor) alpha) could have an effect on blood vessel inflammation. As well, the information from this study will be used to determine the number of patients to recruit in a future study. This study will evaluate the effect of etanercept on 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis at one rheumatology clinic in Montreal. The 10 patients will be recruited at the Montreal Rheumatology Institute (Institut de Rhumatologie de Montr√©al) and the images of the blood vessels taken at a medical imaging center will be analyzed by the Montreal Heart Institute. To evaluate vascular inflammation subjects will undergo a PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Vascular Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 16 week, single center, open label trial, to study the effect of etanercept on vascular inflammation of the ascending aorta and carotid arteries in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with active RA already receiving methotrexate for at least 3 months will receive etanercept for 16 weeks. Etanercept will be administered sub-cutaneously using the dose approved in the Canadian product monograph for RA (50 mg every week). Patients will continue methotrexate at a stable dose during the study unless a dose reduction or cessation is required as judged necessary by the study investigator. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan will be performed at baseline and after16 weeks of study treatment with etanercept. At the end of the study, all PET Scan images will be analyzed in a blinded manner by the Montreal Heart Institute core laboratory. Safety will be assessed using adverse events collection and laboratory hematology and chemistry analysis (screening and Week 4) and pregnancy test.</detailed_description>

Patient is eligible to receive etanercept according to Canadian Product Monograph. 6. Medications used to control angina, hypertension, serum lipids and any medication that can have an effect on inflammation must be on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before baseline. 7. Patient with an ascending aorta atherosclerotic plaque inflammation targettobackground ratio of 1.6 or more as determined by 18FDG uptake measured by PET scanning at preenrolment. 8. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening visit. Unless patient or patient's partner is in a menopausal state for at least a year, surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation or vasectomy), clinically diagnosed infertile, having a samesex partner or abstinent,female of childbearing potential or male patient (or his female partner of childbearing potential) is willing to use effective contraceptive method for at least 30 days before Day 0 and at least 4 weeks after the last study drug administration. Effective contraceptive methods are: Barrier methods such as condom, sponge or diaphragm combined with spermicide in foam, gel or cream Hormonal contraception (oral, intramuscular, implant or transdermal) which include DepoProvera, Evra and Nuvaring. Oral contraceptives must have been taken at a stable dose for at least 90 days before study start Intrauterine device (IUD). 9. If result not available in the last 6 months: Patient will be evaluated for latent TB infection with a PPD (Purified Protein Derivative (Mantoux test)) or a Quantiferon Gold test and CXR (chest xray). Patient who demonstrates evidence of latent TB infection defined below will not be allowed to participate in the study: Either PPD more than or equal to 5 mm of induration or positive Quantiferon Gold, irrespective of Bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG) vaccination AND/OR Clinically significant CXR findings or suspicious findings for active TB 10. Patients with diabetes should be well controlled and have a fasting glucose below 11.1 mmol/L. 11. Except for RA, patient is judged to be in good general health as determined by the principal investigator based upon the results of medical history, symptom directed physical examination,laboratory profile,and CXR performed at Screening. 12.
