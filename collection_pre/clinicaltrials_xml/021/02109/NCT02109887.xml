	<brief_summary>PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) is one of the important opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients including HIV-infected patients, transplant recipients, and immunosuppressant users. About one third of non-HIV patients with PCP have the evidence of co-infection with CMV. In this difficult clinical situation, physicians have difficulty to decide on whether anti-CMV treament will help patients with any evidence of CMV co-infection. However, there is no objective test to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from innocent bystander of CMV in those with PCP. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in patients with PCP to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from inocent bystander of CMV. This findings may guide physicians to decide anti-CMV treatment in patients with PCP and CMV co-infection.</brief_summary>
