	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is often performed in elderly patients, but non-adherence to post-CABG guideline medications is a common and serious clinical concern in this age group. A recent systematic review found that higher medication adherence significantly improved primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease outcomes in all the included studies. Another systematic review assessed studies published from 1999-2009 about motivational interviews, such as implementation intention, in relation to cardiovascular health. They found that motivational interview was an effective means of changing behavior, while offering promise in improving cardiovascular health status. The study is aimed to investigate effectiveness of long term volitional intervention in proving medication adherence in the CABG patient.</brief_summary>
