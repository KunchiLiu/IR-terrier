	<brief_summary>Erectile dysfunction is highly prevalent as men grow older. Among the various causes of erectile dysfunction, it has been shown that pelvic arterial insufficiency plays a very important role. The investigators have recently developed the first imaging analytical algorithm by using the abdominal/pelvis multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) angiography to delineate the whole arterial system supplying the penis. To establish a comprehensive, cutting-edge diagnostic and interventional therapeutic program for erectile dysfunction, the investigators therefore design this series of studies by including experts from Urology, Radiology, and Cardiology. This research project (PERFECT program) includes the following 4 sub-studies: 1) differential frequency of obstructive pelvic arterial lesions in coronary artery disease patients with and without erectile dysfunction/lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), 2) differential frequency of obstructive pelvic arterial lesions in patients with vascular risk factors and with or without erectile dysfunction/LUTS, 3) safety, feasibility, and efficacy of comprehensive pelvic angioplasty (with various interventional strategies/instruments) for patients with erectile dysfunction/LUTS and pelvic obstructive arterial disease: proof-of-concept study; and 4) efficacy and safety of comprehensive pelvic angioplasty (with various interventional strategies/instruments) for patients with erectile dysfunction/LUTS and pelvic obstructive arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>men 20 years of age or older with "consistent" erectile dysfunction defined as both IIEF5 scores, taken at least 4 weeks apart, are in the range of 5 to 21 points and with a difference of &lt;=2 points the anatomical inclusion criteria, based on pelvic CT angiography, are unilateral luminal diameter stenosis &gt;=70% or bilateral diameter stenoses &gt;=50% in the pelvic arteries with reference vessel diameter &gt;=2.5 mm and &lt;=4.0 mm and a targetlesion length &lt;=40 mm the arterial inflow to the penis is entirely from the accessory pudendal arteries rather than the usual internal pudendal artery and common penile artery; the presence of focal diameter stenosis &gt;=70% in the common iliac artery, internal iliac artery, or anterior division of internal iliac artery; previous radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, or Peyronie's disease; untreated hypogonadism (serum total testosterone &lt;300 ng/dL within 14 days before enrollment); acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or lifethreatening arrhythmia within 3 months before enrollment; poorly controlled diabetes mellitus with glycosylated hemoglobin levels &gt;9%; serum creatinine levels &gt;2.5 mg/dL; bleeding diathesis or known hypercoagulopathy; life expectancy of fewer than 12 months; known intolerance to contrast agents</criteria>
