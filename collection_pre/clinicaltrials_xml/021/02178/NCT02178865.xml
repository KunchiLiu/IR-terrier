	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of predicting the normal or carrier status of human embryos resulting from in vitro-fertilization (IVF) from patients carrying a balanced translocation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Normal vs. Carrier Status in Euploid Embryos of Translocation Carriers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate the validity of using informative SNPs to distinguish balanced from normal embryos. This will involve acquiring material from families to set phase for informative SNPs, evaluation of existing and new embryo SNP array data, and follow up analysis of children born after applying the procedure.</detailed_description>
