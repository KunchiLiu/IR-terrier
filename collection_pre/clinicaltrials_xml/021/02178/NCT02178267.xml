	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators investigated the effect of probiotic use on colonization of resistant microorganisms in newborn preterm infants receiving antibiotics. This study of the use of probiotics in preterm neonates in neonatal intensive care units expect to prevent colonization by resistant microorganisms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotics On Resistant Bacteria Colonization In Preterm Receiving Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gut which is sterile in newborn preterm infants begins to colonize with birth. Factors such as developmental immaturity of the immune system, encountering with the flora of neonatal intensive care unit, exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic interventional procedures, use of antibiotics, delay of enteral feeding may poorly affect the development of natural and mucosal immunity of intestine in newborns preterm during postnatal period. Exposure to these factors, newborn preterm infants' life threatens especially to change the development of the normal intestinal flora and intestinal immunity. Many randomized controlled studies reported that probiotics reduce intestinal inflammatory process and prevent colonization with pathogenic microorganisms of the intestines . In this study, the investigators investigated the effect of probiotic use on colonization of resistant microorganisms in newborn preterm infants receiving antibiotics.</detailed_description>
