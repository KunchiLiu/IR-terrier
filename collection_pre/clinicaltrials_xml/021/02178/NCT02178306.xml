Stable renal insufficiency with a serum creatinine between 200 and 600 µmol/l or maintenance of hemodialysis 4. Stable proteinuria of at least 500 mg/24h 5. No change in hemodialysis regimen within the last two months prior to visit 1 6. 18 years of age or more 7.

Mean sitting SBP ≥ 180 mmHg or mean sitting DBP ≥110 mmHg during any visit of the placebo runin phase 4. Hepatic dysfunction as defined by the following laboratory parameters: serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (ALT) or serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (AST) &gt; than 2 times the upper limit of normal range 5. Bilateral renal artery stenosis; renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, patients postrenal transplant or with only one kidney 6. Clinically relevant hypo or hyperkalaemia 7. Uncorrected volume depletion 8. Uncorrected sodium depletion 9. Primary aldosteronism 10. Hereditary fructose intolerance 11. Biliary obstructive disorders 12. Patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists 13. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months 14. Chronic administration of any medications known to affect blood pressure, except medication allowed by the protocol (ßblocker, alphablocker, calcium antagonists, clonidine, minoxidil, and diuretics) 15. Any investigational therapy within one month of signing the informed consent form 16. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation 17. Has no contraindication to a placebo runin period (e.g. unstable angina within the past 3 months, stroke within the past 6 months or myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery within the past 3 months) 18. Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of telmisartan 19. Compliance &lt; 70% during runin period (defined by pill count) 20. History of heart failure, malignancy, or any disorders requiring immunosuppressive therapy</criteria>
