	<brief_summary>The burden of diabetes is anticipated to grow yet the proportion of adults whose diabetes is controlled is decreasing over time. This project can have a significant public health impact because we are refining and pilot testing a primary-care based intervention aimed at improving patient engagement and function which are critical components of diabetes care and are associated with improved glycemic control, lower disease-related health-care expenditures, and reduced mortality.</brief_summary>
