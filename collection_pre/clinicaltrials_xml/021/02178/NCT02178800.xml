	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of an Investigational, Injectable HIV Medicine (GSK1265744) in HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate GSK1265744, which is an investigational, injectable HIV medicine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GSK1265744 in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Study researchers will evaluate the use of GSK1265744 for both the prevention of HIV infection (known as pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and for the treatment for HIV infection. This study will enroll two cohorts of participants (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Within each cohort, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive GSK1265744 tablets (also called oral 744) and injections (also called GSK1265744 long acting or 744LA), and Group 2 will receive placebo tablets and injections. Participants in Cohort 1 will attend several study visits through Week 81 or Week 105. Participants in Cohort 2 will attend several study visits through Week 85 or Week 109. From study entry through Week 4, participants in both cohorts will take a GSK1265744 tablet (Group 1) or a placebo tablet (Group 2) once a day. For 1 week after participants stop taking their assigned tablets, study researchers will assess safety and tolerability. If no safety or tolerability concerns are identified, participants will enter the injection phase of the study. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive two injections of GSK1265744 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) at Weeks 5, 17, and 29. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive one injection of GSK1265744 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) at Weeks 5, 9, 17, 25, and 33. All study visits will include HIV counseling, a physical examination, a medical history review, and a blood collection. Select study visits will include adherence counseling, central nervous system (CNS) symptom assessment, behavioral and acceptability assessments, a urine collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and rectal and/or vaginal swabs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and women, 18 to 65 years old at the time of screening Willing to provide informed consent for the study In the last 12 months (at the time of screening): No selfreported unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse with someone known to be HIVinfected or of unknown HIV infection status No selfreported stimulant use (cocaine [including crack], methamphetamine, or nonphysicianprescribed pharmaceuticalgrade stimulants) or inhaled nitrate No selfreported illicit injection drug use of any kind No selfreported diagnosis of gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT), incident syphilis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis Not reporting five or more different sexual partners, regardless of use of protection or knowledge of HIV status. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. In general good health, as evidenced by the following laboratory values, which must be from specimens obtained within 45 days prior to study enrollment: Nonreactive/negative HIV test results. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. Hemoglobin greater than 11 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count greater than 750 cells/mm^3 Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 70 mL/minute using the CockcroftGault equation Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin less than or equal to Grade 1 and direct bilirubin less than or equal to ULN Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Hepatitis C Ab negative Note: Chemistry and hematology parameters which do not meet the inclusion criteria above may be repeated once during screening. No alcohol or substance use that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by selfreport, or found upon medical history and examination or in available medical records). More information on this criterion is available in the protocol. No medical condition that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by selfreport, or found upon medical history and examination or in available medical records) Willing to undergo all required study procedures Additional requirements for all women: If of reproductive potential (defined as premenopausal women who have not had a sterilization procedure per selfreport, such as hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, or salpingectomy), must have a negative urine pregnancy test performed (and results known) within 48 hours before initiating the protocolspecified medication(s) at enrollment. Women are considered menopausal if they have not had a menses for at least 12 months and have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level of greater than 40 IU/L; if FSH testing is not available, they must have had amenorrhea for 24 or more consecutive months. (FSH testing is not a protocol requirement.) If of reproductive potential and participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, women must agree to use a form of contraception during the trial and for 30 days after stopping the oral study medication or for 52 weeks after stopping the long acting injectable from the list below: Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets less than 1% failure rate as stated in the product label Hormonebased contraceptive One or more reactive or positive HIV test result at Screening or Enrollment, even if HIV infection is not confirmed Any active sexually transmitted infection detected by laboratory testing at Screening Coenrollment in any other HIV interventional research study or other concurrent studies which may interfere with this study (as provided by selfreport or other available documentation; exceptions may be made if appropriate after consultation with the Clinical Management Committee [CMC].) Past or current participation in HIV vaccine trial. An exception will be made for participants that can provide documentation of receipt of placebo (not active arm).
