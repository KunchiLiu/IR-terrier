	<brief_summary>HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy, demonstrating that their co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However, the side effect profile of EFV overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI), such as dolutegravir (DTG), may offer an important alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy, HIV-seronegative subjects, and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone, which is the recommended dose for INI-naive patients. Therefore, ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a Phase III b, randomized, open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects), respectively. This study will include a Screening Period, a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to 48 weeks plus a 4-week extension), and a DTG Open-label extension (OLE). During the DTG OLE, subjects will be supplied with DTG until it is locally approved and commercially available, the subject no longer derives clinical benefit, or the subject meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, which ever comes first.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject or the subject's legal representative is willing and able to understand and provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to Screening Adult subject (at least 18 years of age) with plasma HIV1 RNA&gt;=1000 copies/ milliliter (mL) at Screening CD4+ cell count is &gt;= 50 cells/ cubic millimetre (mm^3) at Screening HIV1infected, ARTnaïve; (&lt;=10 days of prior therapy with any antiretroviral drug following a diagnosis of HIV1 infection) A female subject may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she: is of nonchildbearing potential defined as either postmenopausal (12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and &gt;=45 years of age) or physically incapable of becoming pregnant with documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or, is of childbearing potential, with a negative pregnancy test at both Screening and Day 1, and agrees to use one of the following methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of IP, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of all study medications Doublebarrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm, diaphragm/spermicide) Approved hormonal contraception plus a barrier method while receiving Rifampicin (RIF)containing TB treatment for subjects randomly assigned to the DTG arm or approved hormonal contraception plus a barrier method for subjects randomly assigned to the EFV arm (regardless of RIFcontaining TB treatment) Any intrauterine device with published data showing that the expected failure rate is &lt;1% per year Male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the study and this male is the sole partner for that subject Any other method with published data showing that the expected failure rate is &lt;1% per year Any contraception method must be used consistently, in accordance with the approved product label and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. A childbearing potential female subject who starts the study using complete abstinence as her contraceptive method and decides to become sexually active must use the double barrier method either as a bridge to an approved hormonal contraception (if possible) or as a method of choice to be maintained from that moment onwards All subjects participating in the study should be counseled on safer sexual practices including the use of effective barrier methods New diagnosis of pulmonary, pleural, or Lymph node (LN) TB based on identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using culture methods or validated nucleic acid amplification test on sputum or on samples collected by needle aspirate of pleural fluid or an affected LN RIF sensitivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis either by culture or validated nucleic acid amplification test RIFcontaining firstline TB treatment or an alternate RIFcontaining TB treatment started up to a maximum of 8 weeks before randomization and no later than the screening date Karnofsky score &gt;=70% before randomization Any previous TB treatment (not including treatment for latent disease) Evidence of RIF resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis either by culture or validated nucleic acid amplification test Expected requirement for TB treatment &gt;9 months Concomitant disorders or conditions for which isoniazid, RIF, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol are contraindicated Central nervous system, miliary, or pericardial TB Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Any evidence of an active Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)defining disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Category C).
