	<criteria>The subject should be at least 18 years of age and have passed secession of growth The subject should be in need of an implantsupported restoration in the posterior region of the mouth (maxilla: first premolar to third molar, mandible: first premolar to second molar, not third molar due to mobile gingiva), where at least 2 implants are needed of which at least one should be an Extra Short Implant Obtained informed consent from the subject The subject must be in such a physical and mental condition that a 5year followup period can be carried out without foreseeable problems The subject should have a severely resorbed posterior mandible and/ or maxilla. Implants are only to be placed in healed sites, defined as a site with minimum 6 months of healing following tooth extraction At least 6 mm residual bone width, between 47 mm residual bone height in the maxilla and between 69 mm residual bone height in the mandible At implant installation the implant should be stable; final tightening torque of the implant about 25 Ncm or higher, preferably not exceeding 45 Ncm The subject should be healthy and compliant with good oral hygiene Favorable and stable occlusal relationship The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent of participating Health conditions, which do not permit the surgical treatment Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the subject's total situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in subject records or in subject history Any disorders in the planned implant area such as previous tumours, chronic bone disease or previous irradiation Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in subject records or in subject history.
