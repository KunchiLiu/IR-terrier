	<brief_summary>The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one of common clinical critically diseases. In the United States, the incidence of ARDS reaches 31%, which is one of the main causes of death in patients. There is no unified treatment process for ARDS currently and the treatment measures are not yet standardized, so the standardization of ARDS treatment processes is needed to reduce mortality in patients. Following the evidence-based medicine principles and six-step treatment standards of ARDS, this study uses the method of multi-center randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate the standardized treatment process of ARDS, which provides the basis for the standardized treatment of ARDS.</brief_summary>
