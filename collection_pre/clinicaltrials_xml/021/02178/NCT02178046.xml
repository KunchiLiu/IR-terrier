	<brief_summary>There is a need for toothpastes that more effectively remove oral plaque and prevent re-formation. The objective of this study is to map the development and resolution of clinical gingivitis using conventional clinical examination and imaging data to determine how useful imaging techniques can be for evaluating how well a toothpaste cleans the teeth</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The researcher can use imaging techniques to map changes in gingival blood flow during the development and resolution of fully reversible, early clinical gingivitis using standard-of-care clinical indices as gold standard The researcher can use imaging techniques to map inflammatory microstructural changes in the oral mucosa including swelling, vasodilation and edema during the development and resolution of fully reversible, early clinical gingivitis using standard-of-care clinical indices as gold standard</detailed_description>
