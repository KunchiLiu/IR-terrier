	<brief_summary>Online self-help is an innovative way of providing self-help. The investigators want to study the effect of an interactive online self-help-program (Deprexis) in the treatment of severe depressive symptoms. Participants will be randomised to either twelve weeks of online-self help or a waiting-list control. Symptoms of depression and other aspects will be assessed over a six months period. The investigators hypothesise that online self-help is superior to the control condition in alleviating depressive symptoms and preventing full blown depression.</brief_summary>
