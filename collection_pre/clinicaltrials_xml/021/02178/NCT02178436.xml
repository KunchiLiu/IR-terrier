	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and to see how well they work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as selinexor, gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor, Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, and Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride), nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) and KPT-330 (selinexor) for untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. II. To determine the safety profile of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and KPT-330. III. To test whether gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and KPT-330 improves overall survival as compared to historical controls comprising of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine objective response rate to combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and KPT-330 using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. II. To confirm safety of KPT-330 at the RP2D in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in phase II arm of the study. III. To determine progression free survival (PFS) in phase II cohort treated with gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and KPT-330. IV. To determine the influence of KP-330, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel on the nuclear expression and localization of tumor suppressor gene proteins. OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of selinexor followed by phase II. PHASE IB: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV once weekly (Mondays) for 3 weeks. Patients also receive selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly (Mondays and Wednesdays) for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: The first 14 patients with liver metastases are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Remaining patients are assigned to Group II. GROUP I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV as in Phase Ib. Beginning day 3 of course 1, patients also receive selinexor PO twice weekly (Mondays and Wednesdays) for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and selinexor as in Phase Ib. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>
