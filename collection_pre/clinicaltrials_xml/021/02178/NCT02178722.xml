	<criteria>Subjects with histologically or cytologically NSCLC, melanoma, transitional cell carcinoma of the GU tract, renal cell cancer, triple negative breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the endometrium or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Phase 1) Subjects with histologically confirmed melanoma, NSCLC, transitional cell carcinoma of the GU tract, TNBC, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, MSI high CRC, RCC and DLBCL (Phase 2) Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 1. Presence of measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or Lugano Classification for subjects with DLBCL. Laboratory and medical history parameters within protocoldefined range. For Phase 1: Subjects who have advanced or metastatic disease as noted above that have received at least one prior therapy or have advanced or metastatic disease for which no curative treatment is available may be enrolled. For Phase 2 expansion cohorts: Subjects with NSCLC, melanoma, transitional cell carcinoma of the GU tract, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, MSI high CRC, RCC, DLBCL, and TNBC. Phase 2 expansion: NSCLC Subjects who have received at least 1 prior platinumbased therapy. Subjects who have a nonplatinumbased regimen may be enrolled with medical monitor approval. Tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive or anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor are permitted; however, subjects should have progressed on or be intolerant to the targeted therapy. Subjects must not have received immunotherapy with PD1 or CTLA4 targeted therapy. Phase 2 expansion: Melanoma Documentation of V600Eactivating BRAF mutation status Subjects must not have received immunotherapy with antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiCTLA4 therapy. Exception: Prior anti−CTLA4 in the adjuvant setting would be permitted. Ocular melanoma is excluded. Phase 2 expansion: Transitional cell carcinoma of the GU tract Metastatic or locally advanced and not amenable to curative therapy with disease progression on or after platinumbased chemotherapy or alternative therapy if platinumbased therapy is not appropriate. Prior PD1 or CTLA4 targeted therapies are excluded Phase 2 expansion: SCCHN Histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma not amenable to local therapy with curative intent (surgery or radiation with or without chemotherapy). Carcinoma of the nasopharynx, salivary gland, or nonsquamous histologies are excluded. Subjects must have received at least 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen that must have included a platinumbased therapy. Prior PD1 or CTLA4 targeted therapies are excluded. Phase 2 expansion: Ovarian cancer Subjects with FIGO Stage Ic, Stage II, Stage III, Stage IV, recurrent, or persistent (unresectable) histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube carcinoma. Subjects must have received a platinumtaxanebased regimen as firstline therapy. Prior PD1 or CTLA4 targeted therapies are excluded. Borderline, lowmalignantpotential epithelial carcinoma per histopathology is excluded. Phase 2 expansion: Relapsed or refractory DLBCL Prior allogeneic stemcell transplantation is excluded. Must have received &gt; or = 1 prior treatment regimen. Not a candidate for curative therapy or hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (either due to disease burden, fitness, or preference). Prior PD1 or CTLA4 targeted therapies are excluded. Phase 2 expansion: TNBC Histologically confirmed breast adenocarcinoma that is unresectable loco regional, or metastatic Pathologically confirmed as triple negative, source documented, defined as both of the following: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) negative Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative as per American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines Subject must have received at least 1 prior systemic regimen for advanced or metastatic disease Prior PD1 or CTLA4 targeted therapies are excluded. Phase 2 expansion: RCC Subjects with histological or cytological confirmation of clear cell RCC. Not curable by surgery. Subjects must have received prior antiangiogenic therapy Subjects must not have received prior immunotherapy with antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiCTLA4 therapy Phase 2 expansion: MSI high CRC Subjects with histological confirmation of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic MSI high CRC MSI status is, respectively, determined by examining CRC tumor Tumor biopsies are required. If a subject has inaccessible lesions, such as in ovarian cancer, or highly vascular lesions, such as RCC, enrollment may be considered with medical monitor approval, and archived tissue may be acceptable. Females of childbearing potential and males who use adequate birth control through 120 days post dose. • Subjects who participated in any other study in which receipt of an investigational study drug or device occurred within 28 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to first dose. Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways). Exception: Prior anti−CTLA4 in the adjuvant setting for subjects with melanoma would be permitted. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable. Has an active autoimmune disease. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Live vaccine use within 30 days of first dose of study medication Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</criteria>
