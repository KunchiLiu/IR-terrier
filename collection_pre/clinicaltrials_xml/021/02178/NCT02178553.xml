	<brief_title>Study of Exparel Versus Epidural for Pain Control After Thoracotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we will study to see if a single set of unilateral intercostal nerve blocks provides pain control as effectively as a continuous thoracic epidural, and will a lower incidence of side effects. Although the anesthesiologists involved in providing care for patients having thoracotomy incisions at St. Mary's Hospital are experts at placing thoracic epidural catheters, this study will attempt to show that a less technically challenging procedure done by surgeons intra-operatively can provide comparable pain relief.</detailed_description>
