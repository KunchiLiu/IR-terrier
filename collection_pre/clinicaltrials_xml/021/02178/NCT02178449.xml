	<brief_summary>The main aim of the study is to investigate the proven effect of dexamethsone on the duration of the interscalene block. The investigators try to define optimal dose and volume for ropivacaine, when used together with dexamethsone. The current literature uses often very high volumes of ropivacain when used together with dexamethasone. The investigators try to research the effect of using dexamethsone together with low volume, high concentration ropivacaine for interscalene blockade. The investigators' hypothesis is that dexamethasone has an positive effect on the pain free after used together with ropivacaine at the scalene block.</brief_summary>
