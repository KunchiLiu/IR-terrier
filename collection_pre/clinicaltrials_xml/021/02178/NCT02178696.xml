	<brief_summary>Major depression is a highly prevalent, frequently debilitating illness that too often fails to respond to currently available treatments such as antidepressant medication. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials of antidepressants consistently demonstrate large placebo effects. The investigators hypothesize that individual differences in the function of key brain circuits underlie the observed variability in clinical responses to both placebo and antidepressant medication. This study will test this hypothesis by recruiting treatment-seeking volunteers with major depression, with or without comorbid nicotine dependence. Volunteers will participate in positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans in the context of a treatment trial in which they will receive both placebo and antidepressant medication. A major goal of the study is to improve prediction of individual clinical responses in future treatment trials in which brain imaging may be unavailable, and to study the mechanisms of antidepressant response in Major Depression.</brief_summary>
