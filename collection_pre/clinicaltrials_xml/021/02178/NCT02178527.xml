	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory pilot Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of a multifaceted podiatry intervention designed to reduce falls in care homes. The investigators hypothesise that the intervention will reduce the high falls rates present in care homes for older people, compared to usual care. The results will inform the sample size calculation for a full-scale definitive RCT</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Podiatry Intervention to Reduce Falls in Elderly Care Trial (PIRFECT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Falls are a problem in care homes where it is estimated that half of all residents will fall at least once in a year. There is now strong empirical evidence that weakness of the foot muscles and painful foot problems such as corns and/or callus are a contributing factor to falls in this population. These problems are common and reversible; however there have been no trials of podiatry interventions that address these problems to establish whether or not this approach can be effective at reducing falls in care home populations. Methods: Care home residents meeting the inclusion criteria will be assigned to receive either the intervention (specific foot and ankle exercises, orthoses, footwear). We will then conduct an exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with the aim of acquiring data that will inform the design of a subsequent full scale RCT. The groups will then be compared on a number of balance and falls related outcomes. Main Outcome: The results will indicate the effect size to allow a sample size calculation for a later definitive trial to be conducted.</detailed_description>
