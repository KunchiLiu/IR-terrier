	<brief_summary>The intensive arterial pressure control in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during the first 24 hours can improve the prognosis in the short and long term. We confront two treatment strategies (standard and intensive treatment) to evaluate their superiority in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Arterial Pressure Control in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndrome is often associated with arterial pressure elevation which are deleterious for the heart and needs urgent intervention to lower the blood pressure to the required values, however there is no clear recommendations concerning the treatment intensity in this situation. The investigators know that high arterial pressure increases the oxygen myocardial consumption and it is deleterious in acute coronary syndrome, so , it is logical to reduce intensively this pressure.</detailed_description>
