	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the antiviral effect, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of presatovir in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive adults who have been hospitalized with acute respiratory infectious symptoms. Participants will receive 1 dose of presatovir and followed for 28 days postdose. Nasal swabs will be collected at each study visit (excluding Day 28) and assayed for change in viral load as the primary endpoint.</brief_summary>
