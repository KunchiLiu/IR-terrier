	<brief_summary>We are studying patients' abilities to correctly identify the prescription medications they are taking. We are interested in understanding what tools will help patients correctly identify their medications. People participating in this study will be asked to either review a paper printout of their medication list or a computer program with their medications. The program will show the names and pictures of the medications. In either situation, participants will be asked to indicate if they are taking the medications as prescribed. We will then compare reported adherence between each medication review process. Participation may help the program developers improve the product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>APHID- Primary Care Accuracy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial compares a paper-based medication adherence questionnaire to an electronic medication adherence questionnaire. Results from each arm will be compared to the ambulatory medication list on file with the clinic and a separate medication review interview conducted by a trained clinician. We intend to compare adherence patterns and medication use discrepancy rates between each approach. This data will help us to determine what strategies work best to solicit an accurate medication history from the patient.</detailed_description>
