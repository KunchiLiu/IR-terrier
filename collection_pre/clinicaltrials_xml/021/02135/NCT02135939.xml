	<brief_summary>In this randomized study the investigators aim to determine the effects of a whole-food plant-based vegan diet on markers of inflammation and glucometabolic profile in patients with cardiovascular disease. The investigators hypothesize that a whole-food plant-based vegan diet will reduce markers of inflammation and improve glucometabolic profile compared with the American Heart Association (AHA)- recommended diet at 2 months follow-up in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The investigators are also evaluating endothelial function using the EndoPAT device and stool microbiome.</brief_summary>
