	<criteria>1. Clinical failure of smallbore chest tube with persistent pleural effusion 2. 18 years of age or older 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 022. 4. Life expectancy ≥ 6 weeks 5. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 mm3, platelet count ≥ 100×109 L, hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL 6. Serum creatinine ≤2.0 times the upper limit of the normal range, total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal range 7. At least 2 days from administration of chemotherapy 8. At least 7 days from prior major surgery 9. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not surgically sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. 10. Patient judged to be 'medically stable' by primary investigator. 1. Prior treatment with intrapleural fibrinolytic agents 2. Presence of any intracranial mass 3. Traumatic hemorrhagic pleural effusion 4. Major hemorrhage, coincidental stroke, or major trauma 5. Highrisk for systemic bleeding 6. Allergy or intolerance to dornase alfa 7. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 2. 8. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. 9. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within seven (7) days of first study drugincluding neurosurgery. 10. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment plan and followup requirements. 11. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements. 12. Patients who are pregnant or lactating (females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to participation in this study) 13. Expected survival less than six weeks</criteria>
