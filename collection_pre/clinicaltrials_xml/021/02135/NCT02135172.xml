	<brief_summary>The number of people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing rapidly and about 2.9 million people in the UK currently have diabetes. There is increasing evidence suggesting that prolonged sedentary time may actually increase the risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases. Importantly, adults can meet public health guidelines on physical activity (150 minutes of moderate activity per week), but if they still sit for prolonged periods, their metabolic health is compromised. Going from sitting to standing and carrying out light-intensity activities (such as casual walking) may reduce diabetes risk. However, no one has investigated the effect of standing and walking on markers of cardio-metabolic markers in individuals with a high risk of T2DM. Therefore, the aim is to find out whether reducing the amount of time people spend sitting and replacing it with standing and light intensity activity (walking) reduces glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels, therefore reducing the risk of diabetes.</brief_summary>
