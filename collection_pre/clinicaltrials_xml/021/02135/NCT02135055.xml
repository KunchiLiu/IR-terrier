	<brief_summary>ICU patients always experience all kinds of pain, discomfort and sleep disturbance,especially the sepsis patients. Appropriate sedation and analgesia is must,the newest sepsis guideline strongly recommend that mechanically ventilated sepsis patients need sedation therapy. Recent studies show than immune dysfunction dose have an important effect on the occurrence and development of sepsis. When the body suffer from the pathogenic microorganism attacking and sepsis, it activate the systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). When it is out of balance between SIRS and CARS, the inflammatory response, immune paralysis or immune dysfunction occurs and the mixed anti-inflammatory response syndrome (MARS) exists, and then the multiple organ dysfunction. So, immune dysfunction is thought to be the key factors on the development of the sepsis. Some studies show that the sedation drug such as midazolam, propofol, dexmedetomidine could suppress the inflammatory response effectively and then modulate the immune function. Several recent studies show that midazolam has the immunoregulation effect and trend of suppress the inflammatory response, but the result is controversy, the possibly reason is the different immune status. Now there is the guideline about the different immune status: the normal immune function means that the value of mHLA-DR is more than 15000 monoclonal antibody; moderate-sever immune suppression means that the value of mHLA-DR is in the range of 5000 and 15000 monoclonal antibody; the immune paralysis means that the value of mHLA-DR is less than 5000 monoclonal antibody. The purpose of the study is to explore the effect of midazolam to inflammatory response and organ function at mechanically ventilated sepsis patients who have different immune status.</brief_summary>
