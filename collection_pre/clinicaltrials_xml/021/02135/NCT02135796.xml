	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that not all patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with a Central Venous Oxygen Saturation (ScvO2) less than 70% have cardiac dysfunction that would benefit from inotropic therapy (a key strategy in early goal directed therapy in patients with sepsis). Echocardiography might show that despite an adequate Central Venous Pressure (CVP), intravascular volume status is low and further volume expansion is warranted. Alternatively, echocardiography may indicate that left atrial pressure is elevated, and further intravascular volume resuscitation should be limited. Such observations may lead to a role for echocardiography within the parameters of the early goal-directed therapy protocol that may improve treatment of cardiac dysfunction and hypovolemia. The study objective is to correlate echocardiographic findings with objective parameters, namely central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), measured during the early resuscitation of critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Aim #1: Correlate echocardiographic findings of right ventricular (RV) systolic function and dilation, left ventricular (LV) systolic function and dilation, and left ventricular diastolic function with CVP and ScvO2 in the early hours of resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Aim #2: Evaluate the change in RV and LV dysfunction over time in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock and correlate with mortality. Aim #3: Evaluate the efficacy of bedside echocardiography performed by the intensivist in the ICU in the evaluation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.</brief_summary>

If a clinical TTE is performed in this timeframe, patients may be enrolled up to 24 hours after ICU admission. known pregnancy primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome or major cardiac dysrhythmia such as:* Ventricular tachycardia (Vtach) Ventricular Fibrillation (Vfib) Third degree heart block (complete hear block or complete AV block)</criteria>
