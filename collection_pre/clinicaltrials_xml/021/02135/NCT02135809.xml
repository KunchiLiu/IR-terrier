	<criteria>1. Age 18 or older 2. Willing and able to comply with study procedures and followup schedule and provide written informed consent to participate in study 3. Chronic pancreatitis of Cremer Type IV (Segmental pancreatitis of the head of the pancreas). See Appendix for Cremer classifications. 4. Improvement of pancreatic pain during previous placement of a single pancreatic plastic stent 5. At least one of the following: Abdominal pain most probably related to chronic pancreatitis Recurrent dominant main pancreatic duct stricture in the head of the pancreas after prior indwell of pancreatic plastic stent(s) if pain score was available prior to preceding stent therapy. Recurrent stricture to be visually assessed at endoscopy and confirmed by recurrent main pancreatic duct dilatation at MRCP. Relapsing pain due to pancreatic duct stent blockage (with only one stent in place) 6. Prior endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy (EPS), historically or to be provided at time of SEMS placement with informed patient consent. 1. Strictures caused by malignancies 2. Biliary strictures caused by chronic pancreatitis 3. Perforated duct. 4. Ansa pancreatica or H anatomy 5. Pancreatic duct stenoses not located in the head of the pancreas 6. Failed access during an attempted ERCP on a prior date 7. Prior pancreatic metal stent(s) 8. Concurrent ESWL (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) during the same treatment session 9. Patients for whom endoscopic techniques are contraindicated. 10. Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study that would directly interfere with the current study, without prior written approval from the sponsor 11. Inability or refusal to comply with the followup schedule including subject living at such a distance from the investigational center that</criteria>
