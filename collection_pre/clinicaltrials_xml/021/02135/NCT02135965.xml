	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to define a ratio of Caffeine and albuterol that gives a synergistic increase in metabolic rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Potential Synergistic Effects of Albuterol and Caffeine on Metabolic Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of 2 screening visits and 8 study visits. Screening visit 1: about 1 hour fasting from 9pm the prior night. Height and weight is measured, vital signs taken and questionnaires completed. Women will have a urine pregnancy test. Blood draw for chemistry panel and blood count. Screening visit 2: about 1 hour, Medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (a heart tracing). Visit 1-8 about 4 hours each. 8 separate occasions, with about 7 days between each visit. ON each visit, blood pressure, pulse and temperature is recorded. A resting metabolic rate (RMR) is measured. After a baseline measurement of about 30 minutes of breathing is taken , a pill will be swallow and metabolism(measured by breathing with a clear plastic hood over the upper body to measure metabolic rate ( the oxygen inhaled and the carbon dioxide exhaled).</detailed_description>
