	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to evaluate how the body absorbs and processes the sustained release (SR) and extended release (XL) medication bupropion (WellbutrinÂ®). Subject who are 1-3 years post gastric bypass surgery will be invited to participate. Non-surgical controls will also be enrolled based on a matching criteria to post gastric bypass subjects. Participants will be asked to complete two 12-hour study days approximately 11 days apart.</brief_summary>
