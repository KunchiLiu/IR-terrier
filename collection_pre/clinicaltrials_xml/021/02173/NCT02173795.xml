Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed Patients with a history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion criterion No. 1 Patients with any upper or lower respiratory infection in the past six weeks prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) or during the runin period Patients hospitalized or having had visits to the emergency room in the past six weeks before runin period Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme that will not be maintained throughout the duration of the study or who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation programme in the six weeks prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs or any other components of the trial medication including excipients Patients medically treated for prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma or raised intraocular pressure Patients who are being treated with betablocker medications Note: beta1blocker eye medications for treatment of nonnarrow angle glaucoma are allowed Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable dose (i.e., less than six weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisolone per day or 20 mg every other day Patients on inhaled or shortacting betaadrenergics other than the study medication Patients on inhaled or shortacting betaanticholinergics other than the study medication Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors Patients taking tricyclic antidepressants Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception for the previous three months (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine inhalers, diaphragm or subdermal implants) Patients with a history of and/or active significant alcohol or drug abuse Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six halflives (whichever is greater) prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) Patients who have already been enrolled and randomised to a treatment group in this study</criteria>
