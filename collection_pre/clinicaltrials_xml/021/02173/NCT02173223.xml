	<brief_summary>A. To evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of the rho-kinase Inhibitor (AR-12286 0.5% and 0.7%) ophthalmic solutions in glaucoma patients with failed prior glaucoma filtering surgery and uncontrolled IOP who are facing further surgical intervention. Patients will be treated for 6 months in this initial trial. B. To evaluate the efficacy of AR-12286 in enabling treated patients to delay or avoid the necessity of further surgical intervention.</brief_summary>
