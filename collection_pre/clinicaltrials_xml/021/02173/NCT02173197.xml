	<brief_summary>To date, there are no studies that demonstrate that the intervention of Occupational Therapy (OT) in patients considered to be complex, regardless of diagnosis, could improve clinical and functional outcome for the patient. For this reason, we intend to undertake a study that will allow us to deepen the knowledge about the impact of the OT on in-hospital patients considered "complex" according to the assessment by the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS ). Our hypothesis is that the intervention of OT can improve their care by qualified and focused on the needs of the person interventions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will therefore first af all to implement an observational pilot study, aimed at defining the characteristics and needs of the population in question, and the OT intervention "protocol". This information will then be used to implement a subsequent randomized controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the OT intervention on the basis of clinically relevant outcome measures.</detailed_description>
