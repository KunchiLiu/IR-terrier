	<brief_summary>The decrease in physical activity due to increasing dyspnoea that over time leads to a steadily worsening condition and increasing restriction of physical functioning is a key problem for COPD patients and affects even the early stages. Clinical studies to investigate both Spiriva® and Striverdi® Respimat® have demonstrated a marked improvement in physical exercise capacity. However, there have so far been no data from the daily practice setting about everyday functioning on combination treatment with Spiriva® Respimat® plus Striverdi® Respimat® or Spiriva® 18 Mikrogramm plus Striverdi® Respimat® in patients requiring treatment with 2 long-acting bronchodilators. The objective of this NIS is to measure changes in physical functioning as a surrogate for physical activity and exercise capacity in COPD patients on treatment with Spiriva® Respimat® plus Striverdi® Respimat® or Spiriva® 18 Mikrogramm plus Striverdi® Respimat® in routine daily treatment (so-called real life setting).</brief_summary>
