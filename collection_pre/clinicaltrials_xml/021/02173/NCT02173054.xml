	<brief_summary>Acne is an inflammation of sebaceous glands and follicles. Applying topical treatments such as adapalene gel may cause irritant adverse effects. Hence, using a moisturizer is another way to protect or relieve this undesirable event. Moisturizers that have anti-inflammatory property could reduce irritant effects, emergent from using topical treatment and also reduce severity of acne. Research teams chose an adapalene gel to act as topical treatment for curing acne. It has anti-inflammatory and comedolytic effects and has fewer side effects than other groups of topical retinoic acids. However, peeling skin, redness skin, tingling sensation or itching sensation may occur if they are continually used for a long period. Thus, for the purpose of studying the efficacy of moisturizer containing licochalcone A, L-carnitine and 1,2-decanediol in reducing irritant effect of using adapalene gel (Licochalcone A has anti-inflammatory effect, L-carnitine decrease sebum production and 1,2-decanediol has anti-bacterial effect).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficiency of a Moisturizer Containing Licochalcone A, L-carnitine and 1,2-decanediol With Adapalene Gel in Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators team research with patients by separate patients into 3 groups and compare among each other. In the first group use only adapalene gel, the second group use adapalene gel with moisturizer containing three substances mentioned above, and the last group use adapalene gel with placebo moisturizer. To compare outcomes among 3 groups, the investigators will measure degree of redness, scale, oily face, moist, number of acne, quality of life, and satisfaction after using moisturizer.</detailed_description>
