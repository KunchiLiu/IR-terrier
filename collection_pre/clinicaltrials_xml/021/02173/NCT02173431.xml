	<brief_summary>Prolonged external pressure to the tissue leads to compression, ischemia and development of pressure ulcer. Underweight seems to be associated with high pressure ulcer risk but the distinct relation between overweight and pressure ulcer development is uncertain. Bedsores are caused by pressure against the skin that limits blood flow to the skin and nearby tissue. Others factors related to limited mobility can make the skin vulnerable to damage and contribute to the development of pressure sores. Three primary contributing factors are sustained pressure, friction and shear. Bedsores are easier to prevent than to treat.</brief_summary>
