	<brief_summary>Our overall research goal is to determine how these novel psychosocial factors impact cessation. This pilot study will answer how dual use of other tobacco products, direct to consumer marketing, and the new phenomenon of butting-out and relighting influences cessation, and how understanding impulsivity and task persistence could lead to new and improved behavioral interventions for tobacco dependence. Answers to these pilot questions will lead to the publication of several manuscripts and provide important feasibility data to design large, well-powered clinical trials, population-level epidemiological studies, and contribute to furthering the field of tobacco treatment.</brief_summary>
