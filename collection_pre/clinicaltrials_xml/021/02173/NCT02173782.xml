	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that at least one of the two doses of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/20 µg ipratropium bromide and 25 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/10 µg ipratropium bromide, 1 puff q.i.d) administered via the Respimat® gives a bronchodilator response which is not inferior to that obtained from one dose of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/21 µg ipratropium bromide, 2 puffs q.i.d) administered via the MDI and that the safety profile is at least as good when COPD patients are treated for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
