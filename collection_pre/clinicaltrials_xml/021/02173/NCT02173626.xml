	<brief_title>Effect of Video-Module Based Mindfulness Training on Physician Stress and Well Being</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a video-module based mindfulness pilot program on the stress, well-being, and mindfulness skills of physicians in a community hospital setting. We administered an eight-week mindfulness training in October/November of 2013, offered as part of a wellness initiative for medical staff in a suburban community hospital in Puyallup, Washington. Participants enrolled on a first-come, first-serve basis, engaging in three 90-minute in person trainings, weekly online video-module trainings, and weekly teleconference coaching calls. Video-module trainings were available at all times, to be accessed at the participants' convenience. Journals and a guided meditation audio library were also provided. Physician stress, well-being (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization of patients, sense of personal accomplishment), and mindfulness skills (observing, describing, acting with awareness, accepting without judgment) were evaluated at baseline, end-of-program, and eight weeks post-intervention using well-validated instruments. Risks to participants were minimal, including only the possibility of a strong emotional response to personal work undertaken by participants during the course of the study. The project was funded by MultiCare Health System.</detailed_description>
