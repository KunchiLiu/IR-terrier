	<brief_summary>The PULsAR trial is an international, investigator-initiated, single arm open-label phase II study. The aim of this study is to measure the clinical activity of the combination FOLFIRI-aflibercept in an homogeneous group of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and treated with a FOLFIRI-aflibercept regimen as first line treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aflibercept and Chemotherapy as First Line Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Assessable With DCE-US (PULSAR).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with an unresectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) histologically proven will be treated with a combination of Irinotecan/bolus-infusion-5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (FOLFIRI regimen) and aflibercept. On day 1 of each cycle patients will receive aflibercept followed by irinotecan, 5-Fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (FOLFIRI regimen). This treatment will be repeated every 2 weeks until RECIST progression or unacceptable toxicities, investigator's decision or patient's refusal of further treatment or death, whichever comes first. All patients will be assessed during their FOLFIRI-aflibercept with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (DCE-US) at baseline, D7 (± 1 day), D28 (± 2 days). The recruitment period is 24 months. The average duration of the study per patient will be approximately 12 months, i.e. 3 weeks for screening, 10 months for the combination of FOLFIRI plus aflibercept and 30 days for follow-up of adverse events after the last dose of study treatment.</detailed_description>
