	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study are: 1. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 doses of XP23829 compared to placebo for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. 2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of XP23829 in subjects with psoriasis. 3. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of XP23829 through immunological analysis of peripheral blood samples.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Psoriasis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects, age ≥ 18. 2. Stable, moderatetosevere plaquetype psoriasis diagnosed for at least 6 months prior to randomization (no morphology changes or significant flares of disease activity in the last 6 months in the opinion of the investigator). 3. Severity of disease meeting all of the following three criteria prior to randomization: 1. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12 or greater 2. Total Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by plaque psoriasis of 10% or greater 3. Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 3 or greater 4. Must be a candidate for phototherapy and/or systemic therapy for psoriasis. 1. Subjects with current inverse, erythrodermic, predominantly guttate, or pustular psoriasis. 2. Subjects with current druginduced or drugexacerbated psoriasis. 3. Subjects with moderatetosevere psoriatic arthritis of any type; and subjects with mild psoriatic arthritis, who require systemic diseasemodifying therapy. 4. Subjects with unstable or significant illness, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities at screening that in the opinion of the investigator would place the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study. 5. Any skin condition (e.g. eczema) which confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 6. Treatment with a topical antipsoriatic therapy within 14 days prior to randomization (including topical steroids, topical vitamin A or D analog preparations, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, or anthralin). 7. Phototherapy or prolonged sun exposure or use of ultraviolet (UV) light sources within 28 days of randomization. 8. Use of investigational or approved biologic treatments that are known to affect psoriasis, such as adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab or infliximab within 12 weeks of randomization and ustekinumab within 24 weeks of randomization. 9. Use of systemic medications (nonbiologics) that are known to affect psoriasis (including but not limited to oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, lithium, and betaadrenergic blockers) within 4 weeks of randomization, or 5 halflives, whichever is longer. 10. Prior treatment with Dimethyl Fumarate (Fumaderm® or Tecfidera®) or any other Fumaric Acid Ester (FAE) containing products. 11. Have failed (due to inadequate response) more than 3 approved systemic agents for the treatment of psoriasis.</criteria>
