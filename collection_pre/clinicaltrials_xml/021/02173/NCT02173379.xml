	<brief_summary>ABSORB IV is a prospective, randomized (1:1, Absorb BVS to XIENCE), single-blind, multi-center study, registering approximately 3000 subjects from approximately 140 sites in the United States and outside the United States. ABSORB IV is a continuation of ABSORB III (NCT01751906) trial which are maintained under one protocol because both trial designs are related. The data from ABSORB III and ABSORB IV will be pooled to support the ABSORB IV primary endpoint. Both the trials will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Absorb BVS. The ABSORB IV Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is designed to continue to evaluate the safety and effectiveness as well as the potential short and long-term benefits of Abbott Vascular Absorb™ Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) System, and the Absorb GT1™ BVS System (once commercially available), as compared to the commercially approved, control stent XIENCE.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ABSORB IV: A. Primary Objective: - To evaluate 1-year clinical outcomes of the Absorb BVS compared to XIENCE in the treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to three de novo native coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two lesions per epicardial vessel. - To evaluate long-term clinical outcomes of Absorb BVS compared to XIENCE in the treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to three denovo native coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two lesions per epicardial vessel. B. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the incidence of angina occurring within 1 year, with treatment of Absorb BVS compared to XIENCE. The enrollment of the 3000 subjects in ABSORB IV will start after enrollment completion of the 2000 primary analysis subjects in ABSORB III. All registered subjects will have clinical follow-up at 30, 90, 180, 270 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, potentially at 6 and/or 7 years if it is necessary as determined by the Sponsor. In addition, all 3000 subjects in ABSORB IV will complete patient-reported outcome (PRO) self-administered questionnaires at baseline, 30 days,180 days, and annually throughout the remaining duration of the trial. The ABSORB IV trial will also include an imaging ischemia sub-study which will provide the physiological and mechanistic evaluation of whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment with Absorb compared to XIENCE results in differences in myocardial ischemia in the early post-procedural period, and at 14 months and 62 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age. 2. Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written Informed Consent prior to any study related procedure, per site requirements. 3. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., silent ischemia, stable or unstable angina, nonSTsegment elevation MI (NSTEMI), OR recent STsegment elevation MI (STEMI). Patients with stable coronary syndromes can be enrolled any time after symptom onset if eligibility criteria are otherwise met. Patients with acute coronary syndrome can be enrolled under the following conditions: 1. Unstable angina or NSTEMI within 2 weeks of the index procedure. 2. STEMI &gt; 72 hours ≤ 2 weeks prior to the index procedure. Note: Subjects with Unstable angina (UA) or NSTEMI or STEMI occurring &gt; 2 weeks of the index procedure can be included in the trial but should be categorized based on their current angina class. 4. Subjects must be suitable for PCI. Subjects with stable angina or silent ischemia and &lt; 70% diameter stenosis must have objective signs of ischemia as determined by one of the following: abnormal stress echocardiogram, nuclear scan, electrocardiogram (ECG), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or fractional flow reserve (FFR). (Note: subject with silent ischemia must have a prior history of typical angina, anginaequivalent symptoms, or atypical angina within the past year to be included in the trial.) 5. Subject must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 6. Female subject of childbearing potential who does not plan pregnancy for up to 1 year following the index procedure. For a female subject of childbearing potential a pregnancy test must be performed with negative results known within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard. 7. Female subject is not breastfeeding at the time of the screening visit and will not be breastfeeding for at least 1 year following the index procedure. 8. Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical study for a period of 5 years following the index procedure. Angiographic Treatment of up to three de novo lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two lesions per epicardial vessel. If only a single lesion is to be treated, it must be a target lesion. Up to one nontarget lesion can be treated. Nontarget lesion treatment can occur only in a nontarget vessel. If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is considered as a single target lesion for lesion (and stent) length determination and must be treated with a single study device. 1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated or quantitatively assessed %DS of ≥50% and &lt; 100%, with a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1, and one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow reserve ≤0.80 AND/OR a positive stress test), or presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or NSTEMI within 2 weeks of index procedure, or STEMI &gt;72 hours but ≤ 2 weeks prior to the index procedure). 1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with reference vessel diameter (RVD) by visual estimation of ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm. 2. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with length by visual estimation of ≤ 24 mm. Note: Subjects with Unstable angina (UA) or NSTEMI or STEMI occurring &gt; 2 weeks of the index procedure can be included in the trial but should be categorized based on their current angina class. Note: To exclude enrollment of excessively small vessels, if the operator believes that based on visual angiographic assessments, the distal reference vessel diameter is ≤ 2.75 mm such that the plan is to implant a 2.5 mm device (stent or scaffold) in a target lesion, it is strongly recommended that either online QCA or intravascular imaging (ultrasound or optical coherence tomography) is used and demonstrates that the measured distal RVD for this target lesion is ≥ 2.50 mm (by at least one of these imaging modalities). This measurement may be performed before or after predilatation, but before randomization. If the distal RVD measures &lt;2.5 mm, that lesion IS NOT ELIGIBLE for randomization. Such a lesion may be treated as a nontarget lesion. General 1. Any surgery requiring general anesthesia or discontinuation of aspirin and/or a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is planned within 12 months after the procedure. 2. Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to device material and its degradants (everolimus, poly (Llactide), poly (DLlactide), lactide, lactic acid) and cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers that cannot be adequately premedicated. Subject has a known contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. 3. Subject has known allergic reaction, hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following: aspirin; or clopidogrel and prasugrel and ticagrelor; or heparin and bivalirudin, and therefore cannot be adequately treated with study medications. 4. Subject had an acute STEMI (appropriate clinical syndrome with ≥1 mm of STsegment elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads) within 72 hours of the index procedure. 5. Subject has a cardiac arrhythmia identified at the time of screening for which at least one of the following criteria is met: 1. Subject requires coumadin or any other agent for chronic oral anticoagulation. 2. Subject is likely to become hemodynamically unstable due to their arrhythmia. 3. Subject has poor survival prognosis due to their arrhythmia. 6. Subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% assessed by any quantitative method, including but not limited to echocardiography, MRI, multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scan, contrast left ventriculography, PET scan, etc. LVEF may be obtained within 6 months prior to the procedure for subjects with stable CAD. For subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), LVEF must be assessed within 1 week of the index procedure and after ACS presentation, which may include contrast left ventriculography during the index procedure but prior to randomization in order to confirm the subject's eligibility. 7. Subject has undergone prior PCI within the target vessel during the last 12 months. Prior PCI within the nontarget vessel or any peripheral intervention is acceptable if performed anytime &gt;30 days before the index procedure, or between a minimum of 24 hours and 30 days before the index procedure if successful and uncomplicated. 8. Subject requires future staged PCI of any lesion other than a target lesion identified at the time of index procedure; or subject requires future peripheral vascular interventions &lt; 30 days after the index procedure. 9. Subject has received any solid organ transplants or is on a waiting list for any solid organ transplants. 10. At the time of screening, the subject has a malignancy that is not in remission. 11. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). Note: corticosteroids are not included as immunosuppressant therapy. 12. Subject has previously received or is scheduled to receive radiotherapy to a coronary artery (vascular brachytherapy), or the chest/mediastinum. 13. Subject is receiving or will require chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., coumadin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or any other related agent for any reason). 14. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3. 15. Subject has a documented or suspected hepatic disorder as defined as cirrhosis or ChildPugh ≥ Class B. 16. Subject has renal insufficiency as defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 or dialysis at the time of screening. 17. Subject is high risk of bleeding for any reason; has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy; has had a significant gastrointestinal or significant urinary bleed within the past six months. 18. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) within the past six months, or any prior intracranial bleed, or any permanent neurologic defect, or any known intracranial pathology (e.g. aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, etc.). 19. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion. Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the patient if radial access may be used. 20. Subject has a life expectancy &lt;5 years for any noncardiac or cardiac cause. 21. Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason. This includes completion of Patient Reported Outcome instruments. 22. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed its primary endpoint. 23. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator, is unable to give Informed Consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include: Individuals with a mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, persons in emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also may include members of a group with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the Sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.
