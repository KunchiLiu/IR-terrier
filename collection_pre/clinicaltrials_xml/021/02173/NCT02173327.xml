	<brief_summary>Postoperative pulmonal complications (Abbreviation - PPC) after major abdominal surgery remains a significant clinical problem delaying rehabilitation after surgery. CPAP is one approach to minimize the frequency and severeness of PPC. In the investigators' organization intermittent mask CPAP every 2 hour, 15min, is used routineously after major abdominal surgery. Recently new devices has been designed, which give the opportunity tip deliver continuously CPAP with out interruptions because of presumed better comfort. Therefore better patient compliance. No studies to date have investigated the possible benefit of using continuously helm CPAP versus the traditional intermittent mask CPAP after major abdominal surgery. The investigators' study will investigate if there are any benefits with continuously Helm CPAP Versus intermittent Mask CPAP After Major Abdominal Surgery.</brief_summary>
