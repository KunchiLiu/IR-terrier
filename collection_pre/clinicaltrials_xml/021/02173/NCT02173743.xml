	<brief_summary>Needle aspiration of calcific deposits (NACD ) is the treatment of choice for calcific tendinitis which does not respond to conservative treatment. NACD is effective in approximately 70% of the patients.When NACD is not effective, surgery is often the only treatment that remains.Surgery, however, is discouraged by th e Dutch guidelines for diagnosing and treating patients with subacromial pain syndrome.Therefore,both patients and the doctors treating those patients will benefit from a more effective minimal invasive treatment for calcific tendinitis.Injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) might, considering its positive effect on tissue repair, be a possible solution here.Previous research investigating the effects of PRP on other tendinopathies did, however, show controversial results. The aim of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effect of the adjuvant application of PRP after NACD on pain reduction ,recovery of shoulder function, tendon recovery,resorption of calcific deposits, the percentage of patients with persistent complaints and quality of life.</brief_summary>
