	<brief_summary>This screening and multi-sub-study randomized phase II/III trial will establish a method for genomic screening of similar large cancer populations followed by assigning and accruing simultaneously to a multi-sub-study hybrid "Master Protocol" (S1400). The type of cancer trait (biomarker) will determine to which sub-study, within this protocol, a participant will be assigned to compare new targeted cancer therapy, designed to block the growth and spread of cancer, or combinations to standard of care therapy with the ultimate goal of being able to approve new targeted therapies in this setting. In addition, the protocol includes a "non-match" sub-study which will include all screened patients not eligible for any of the biomarker-driven sub-studies. This sub-study will compare a non-match therapy to standard of care also with the goal of approval.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Screening component: I. To establish a National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) mechanism for genomically screening large but homogeneous cancer populations and subsequently assigning and accruing simultaneously to a multi-sub-study "Master Protocol." II. To evaluate the screen success rate defined as the percentage of screened patients that register for a therapeutic sub-study. Sub-study-specific Objectives: Design #1: Phase II/III Design: III. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the Phase III component of the sub-study by comparing investigator-assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) between investigational therapy versus standard therapy (SoC) in patients with advanced stage refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the lung. (Phase II) IV. To determine if there is both a statistically and clinically-meaningful difference in IA-PFS among advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to receive investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) V. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) Design #2: Phase II followed by Phase III (Sequential Phase II to Phase III): VI. To evaluate the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial). (Phase II) VII. To determine if there is both a statistically and clinically-meaningful difference in IA-PFS among advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to receive investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) VIII. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Sub-study-specific Objectives: Design #1: Phase II/III Design: I. To compare response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) among patients randomized to receive investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase II) II. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase II) III. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) among patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (1.1). (Phase II) III. To compare the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) among patients randomized to receive investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) Design #2: Phase II followed by Phase III (Sequential Phase II to Phase III): V. To evaluate PFS and OS with investigational therapy. (Phase II) VI. To evaluate the DoR among patients who achieve a CR or PR (confirmed and unconfirmed) by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II) VII. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with investigational therapy. (Phase II) VIII. To compare the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) among patients randomized to receive investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) IX. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with investigational therapy versus SoC. (Phase III) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the treatment arm randomization acceptance rate (TARAR) within each treatment arm of each sub-study defined as the percentage of patients randomized to a treatment arm that receive any protocol treatment. (Design #1: Phase II/III Design) II. To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers that may modify response or define resistance to the targeted therapy (TT)/targeted therapy combination (TTC) beyond the chosen biomarker for biomarker-driven sub-studies. III. To evaluate potentially predictive biomarkers for non-match therapy (NMT) in the non-match studies. IV. To identify potential resistance biomarkers at disease progression. V. To establish a tissue/ blood repository from patients with refractory SCCA of the lung. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to a biomarker-driven targeted therapy phase II study.
