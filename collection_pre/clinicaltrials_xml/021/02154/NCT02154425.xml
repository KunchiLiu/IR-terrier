Note: subjects with mastitis infection should not have samples collected until the infection is completely resolved Subject has history of breast implants, breast augmentation, or breast reduction surgery Subject has previously participated in this study Subject has participated in a study of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) (or a medical device) within the previous 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to Screening or is currently participating in another study of an IMP (or a medical device) unless the study is UCB UP0017 [NCT02019602] or a registry study Subject has received treatment with any biological therapeutic agent, or other antiTNF agents with the exception of CZP, within 5 halflives prior to obtaining the first sample Subject has a positive or indeterminate QuantiFERON®TB GOLD In Tube test at Screening. In case of indeterminate result, a retest is allowed if time permits; 2 results of indeterminate require exclusion of the subject Subject with known tuberculosis (TB) infection, at high risk of acquiring TB infection, or latent TB (LTB) infection. If tested within the 6 months prior to screening and test was negative for TB, and there is no change in the patient's clinical status, nor social, family, or travel history, there is no need for an additional TB testing at screening</criteria>
