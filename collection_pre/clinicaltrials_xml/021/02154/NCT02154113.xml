	<brief_title>Ultrashape System in Combination With VelaShape II Device for Circumferential Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UltraShape® Contour I V3 system is a non-invasive (not breaking the skin) focused ultrasound for body contouring purposesdesigned to selectively disrupt sub-dermal fat cells employing focused ultrasound. All other types of tissue, such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral nerves, remain intact. There are no thermal effects. Fat-cell destruction is achieved by ultrasound-induced mechanical effects during a very short exposure time. VelaShape is a non-invasive device for Body Reshaping and Cellulite Treatment. VelaShape combines controlled infrared (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with mechanical manipulation.</detailed_description>
