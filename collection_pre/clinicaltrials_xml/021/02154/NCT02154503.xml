	<brief_summary>Androgenetic Alopecia is the most common non scarring alopecia worldwide. Treatment of which has been limited with few options for medical and surgical treatment, the cost of the latter being prohibitive for many. Recently there have been several new modalities proposed as treatment, namely Microneedling and Platelet Rich Plasma. Microneedling has been shown to overexpress hair growth factors which may enhance or stimulate miniaturized hairs to grow. It has also been shown to increase the absorption of topical products significantly. The exact mechanism of action of Microneedling is still being delineated. In this study, we aim to do a half lesional study with global photographs and hair counts done at the start of , week four and week twelve. Patients would be needled once weekly after application of topical anaesthetic (5% EMLA). If by week six there is significant regrowth (&gt;30%), then total lesional needling will be done. Patients will only be using topical 5% Minoxidil throughout the study as this will prolong the effects of the regrowth.</brief_summary>
