	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to better understand how the use of antibiotics changes micro-organisms in the intestines. The change to micro-organisms in the intestines may change the body's vaccine immune response and alter the effectiveness of the IIV (seasonal flu) vaccine. In particular, the investigators will be looking at certain markers in blood after vaccination with IIV (seasonal flu vaccine) with or without the use of antibiotics before vaccination. There will be two randomized groups. Group A will start taking antibiotic by mouth 3 days prior to vaccination and continue taking antibiotics the day of vaccination and one day after vaccination for a total of 5 days. Group B will only receive the IIV (seasonal flu vaccine) and will not take any antibiotics. The investigators hope to enroll 50 subjects at Emory.</brief_summary>
