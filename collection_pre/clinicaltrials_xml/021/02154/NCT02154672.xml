	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Screening in Men With Germline BRCA2 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cohort screening study to prospectively identify the incidence of prostate cancer in a population of BRCA2 carriers. All men identified to have a BRCA2 mutation as part of the Yale Cancer Genetic Counseling Program will be approached and offered participation in the study via our program newsletter, BRCA listserv, Facebook page and a targeted mailing. Standard of care screening at the Yale Cancer Center for men with a normal prostate cancer risk consists of a PSA test and prostate physical examination beginning at age 50 years and if either is abnormal an MRI of the prostate followed by Fusion-targeted biopsy of the prostate is performed.</detailed_description>
