	<brief_summary>Introduction: The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a single versus double dose of Prostaglandin E2 "Misoprostol, 400 microgram" during myomectomy for multiple uterine fibroids. This was a prospective randomized controlled trial comprised of 69 patients with multiple myomas undergoing myomectomy. Patients randomly allocated to either an intra-vaginal single dose of 400 microgram Misoprostol 1 hour pre-operatively (group A, 34 cases) or 2 doses, 3 and 1 hours, prior surgery (group B, 35 cases). Operation time, intra and post-operative blood loss, hemoglobin concentration, blood pressure and body's temperature were estimated and compared in both groups.</brief_summary>
