	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies how well EF5 works in measuring lack of tumor oxygen, hypoxia, in patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer. EF5 may be effective in measuring the lack of oxygen in lung tumors and may allow doctors to plan better treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EF5 in Measuring Tumor Hypoxia in Patients With Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the frequency and degree of hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. II. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with potential serum/plasma markers of hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. III. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tissue markers of hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. IV. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tumor angiogenesis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. V. Correlated hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with apoptosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. VI. Measure and characterize tumor perfusion in relationship to hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. VII. Correlate tumor perfusion to microvessel density in tumor samples in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. VIII. Determine the longevity of EF5 adducts in human lung tumors. OUTLINE: Patients receive EF5 intravenously (IV) over 1-2.5 hours. Beginning 24-55 hours later, patients undergo tumor hypoxia measurement using a polarographic needle electrode and intraoperative tumor measurement before undergoing surgical biopsy or resection. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Known or suspected nonsmall cell lung cancer; patients without histologically or cytologically documented nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) must be estimated by their physician to have at least 75% probability of having NSCLC; the probability of malignancy will be predicted on the basis of known probabilities of individual clinical characteristics using a Bayesian model Clinical or pathologic stage I to III; patients in whom presurgical staging has not definitively establish stage IV disease are eligible Tumor mass at least 1.5 cm in maximum diameter must be present on computed tomography (CT) scan and must be included in the planned surgical biopsy or resection Patient must be planning to undergo a surgical staging or treatment procedure (including mediastinoscopy, wedge resection, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy) and have the clinical and physiological status appropriate for this procedure Performance status 02 Bilirubin within normal limits Creatinine within normal limits or, if elevated, a creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min/m^2 (EF5 is primarily excreted via the kidney) White blood cell (WBC) &gt; 2000/mm^3 Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm^3 Pregnancy or breast feeding; a negative serum pregnancy test is required of any woman of childbearing potential prior to enrollment; pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with EF5 Allergy to IV contrast dye History of grade III or IV peripheral neuropathy as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTC)</criteria>
