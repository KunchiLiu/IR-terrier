	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that the use of biomarkers of invasive fungal infections would increase the percentage of early discontinuation of empirical antifungal therapy and thus reduce the duration of treatment in ICU patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fungal Biomarkers to Reduce Duration of Empirical Antifungal Therapy: a Randomized Comparative Study (STAFE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of empirical/preemptive anti fungal treatment will be based in the intervention group on biomarker results. Biomarkers of fungal disease will performed before starting anti fungal treatment and at day 4.</detailed_description>
