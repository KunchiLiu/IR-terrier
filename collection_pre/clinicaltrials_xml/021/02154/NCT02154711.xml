	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to use a new research imaging technique, a kind of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to measure important metabolic features of muscle, including mitochondrial function, in people with mitochondrial disease and in healthy individuals. (Mitochondria are tiny organelles that generate energy for the body.) It is hoped that this new strategy will help physicians to understand better the health problems of people with mitochondrial disease. Eventually, this could lead to better diagnostic and treatment approaches.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are two study-related visits. The first visit is a "screening" visit to ensure eligibility. This includes fasting blood tests. The second visit is an MRI scanning session. This also takes around 2 - 3 hours, with no more than 1.5 hours spent in the actual MRI machine. It may be possible to complete these two visits on the same day. Otherwise, the MRI session should occur within 3 months of the screening visit. In addition, an optional physical capacity visit will occur on the same day as the MRI session.</detailed_description>
