	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea is a common disorder that occurs in 3-10 % of the adult population. This disorder disrupts the architecture and quality of sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the standard treatment, but in some cases, it can not be used (patient refusal or intolerance). In these cases, treatment with mandibular advancement devices can bring an improvement in symptoms. Therefore, this study aims to compare the effectiveness of titratable versus active mandibular advancement splints in standard care environment. This will be based on the global response, which includes the apnea-hypopnea index and compliance in severe apnea patients who refused or where intolerant to CPAP. Following their severe apnea diagnosis and the assessment on the feasibility of placing a mandibular advancement device, follow-up visits will be scheduled after 3 months of treatment involving clinical monitoring by a physician and a dentist.</brief_summary>
