	<brief_title>A Self-efficacy Enhancing Stroke Self-management Program for Community-dwelling Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous systematic reviews showed that theory-based stroke self-management programs had potential benefits in improving stroke survivors' quality of life and self-efficacy. However there is a lack of evidence evaluating the effectiveness of a nurse-led theory-based stroke self-management program among community-dwelling Chinese stroke survivors. This is a parallel group, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to be held in a community center. All participants will be assessed at two time-points (baseline before randomization, and one month after program completion). Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either the control group (receiving usual care) or the intervention group (receiving the self-efficacy enhancing stroke self-management program). Participants in the intervention group will receive an additional assessment on usefulness of the program immediately after program completion.</detailed_description>
