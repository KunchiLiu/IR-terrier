	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial compares how well adding XMO2 Filgrastim (Granix) to melphalan before a stem cell transplant works in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as melphalan, are given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as XMO2 Filgrastim (Granix), may help multiple myeloma cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood where they may be more sensitive to treatment with melphalan. It is not yet known whether adding XMO2 Filgrastim (Granix) to melphalan before a stem cell transplant will work better than melphalan alone in treating multiple myeloma</brief_summary>
