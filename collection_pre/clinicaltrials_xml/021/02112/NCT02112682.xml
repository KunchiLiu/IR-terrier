	<brief_summary>STUDY AIM To decrease the number of breast cancer patients receiving overtreatment of the axilla, in order to positively influence the axillary morbidity rate and quality of life. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether omitting completion axillary treatment is not inferior to the current axillary treatment regimen in sentinel node positive breast cancer patients undergoing a mastectomy, in terms of regional recurrence rate. HYPOTHESIS Completion axillary treatment can be safely omitted in sentinel node positive breast cancer patients undergoing a mastectomy. This will lead to a decreased axillary morbidity rate and to an increased quality of life, with non-inferior regional control, distant-disease free- and overall survival rates.</brief_summary>
