	<brief_summary>Post thoracotomy pain syndrome still affects 50% of patients after a thoracic surgery. Pathogenesis is unclear but there is growing evidence that neuro inflammation may play a significant role. Dexamethasone is a very potent anti-inflammatory drug. The hypothesis of this study is that dexamethasone, given pre operatively, would help reduce the incidence of post thoracotomy pain syndrome 3 months after surgery, by reducing the inflammatory response, in patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery that includes thoracic epidural analgesia.</brief_summary>
