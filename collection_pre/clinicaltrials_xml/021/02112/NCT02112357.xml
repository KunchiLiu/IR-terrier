	<brief_summary>This study will assess the feasibility of sequencing locally advanced/metastatic gastrointestinal cancers in real-time to enable future treatment stratification by molecular characteristics. Targeted next generation sequencing of a panel of genes will be performed on tumour specimens and results will be discussed at a Sequencing Tumour Board to establish if a patient is potentially suitable for a targeted therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Locally advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal cancer (including oesophageal, oesophagogastric junction, gastric, pancreatic, biliary and colorectal cancers). 2. Histological or cytological confirmation of diagnosis of malignancy. 3. Patients must either: 1. Have received at least one line of treatment for locally advanced/metastatic disease OR 2. Be about to start/currently undergoing their first line of treatment for locally advanced/metastatic disease 4. 18 years of age and over . 5. Performance status less than or equal to 2. 6. Able to provide fully informed consent. 7. Patients must either: 1. Have an available tumour specimen (FFPE or fresh frozen) from either the primary tumour or a metastasis. Metastatic samples may be from any site with the exception of bone. OR 2. Have a site of disease which is amendable to biopsy There are no specific exclusion criteria for this study.</criteria>
