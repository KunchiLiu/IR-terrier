	<criteria>• An individual must be &gt;18 years of age Have diagnosed type 2 diabetic mellitus by one of the following criteria: o Treated with diet, diet plus oral hypoglycemic agents (for at least one year), or insulin preceded by treatment with oral agents (for at least one year). If treated with insulin, the onset of diabetes must have occurred after age of 40 and the body mass index must be &gt;25kg/m2 at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosed kidney attributed to diabetes by one of the following criteria:3 Macroalbuminuria (ACR &gt;300mg/g, or) Microalbuminuria (ACR between 30300 mg/g) or in the presence of diabetic retinopathy (although is recognized that about 1/3 of type 2 diabetics do not have retinopathy by fundoscopic exam). An elevated ACR should have been confirmed in the absence of urinary tract infections with 2 additional firstvoid specimens collected over 36 months. At least 2 of 3 samples should fall within the range of micro or macroalbuminuria. An estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of between 90 ml/min and 30 ml/min measured by (GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 186 x (Scr)1.154 x (Age)0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if AfricanAmerican) (conventional units). Individuals must be able to provide informed consent Perform walking exercise testing on a treadmill Be able to participate in a 12week supervised exercise program. • Patients are currently exercising Requiring dialysis Have an Hematocrit &lt;30% Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;200/100mmHg) Peripheral vascular disease. An inability to understand English or give consent. Other exclusion criteria are: any contraindications to exercise testing or training as indicated by the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines such as: Unstable coronary heart disease and symptomatic heart failure, exercise capacity limited by health problems such as angina, severe arthritis, or extreme dyspnea on exertion, progressive neuromuscular disease, pulmonary disease., or having undergone a coronary revascularization within the past 6 months prior to enrollment.</criteria>
