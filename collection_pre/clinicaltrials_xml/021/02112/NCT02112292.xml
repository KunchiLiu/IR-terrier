	<brief_summary>The endocannabinoid (eCB) system, a neurochemical signalling system consisting of CB-receptors and their endogenous ligands, has been found to be involved in food intake of sweet and palatable foods. Activation of the eCB system increases food intake and vice versa. The mechanism behind this effect is still unknown and the current study aims at clarifying why sweet food intake increases. It is hypothesized that sweet taste intensity increases and that sweet taste is experienced as more pleasant.</brief_summary>
