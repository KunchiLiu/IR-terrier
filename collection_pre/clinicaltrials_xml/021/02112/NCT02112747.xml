	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies website access or genetic counseling with or without patient navigators on adherence to colorectal cancer screening recommendations in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and their first degree relatives. Websites for colorectal cancer prevention and genetic counseling may be effective methods to help people learn about cancer screening. Patient navigators may improve adherence to colorectal cancer screening recommendations. It is not yet known whether website access or genetic counseling is more effective with or without patient navigators.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test the comparative-effectiveness of the interventions (i.e., website +/- navigator or genetic counseling +/- navigator) in a randomized controlled trial, using colorectal cancer (CRC) cases as the unit of randomization/analysis on adherence to individualized CRC screening recommendations. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the cost effectiveness of the interventions, assessing the effect of the interventions on subgroups (i.e., Lynch syndrome positive vs. Lynch syndrome negative; probands vs. relatives; older vs. younger patients, etc), and barriers to adherence, as well as how the navigators resolve barriers. II. Overscreening will be explored. OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 study components based on LS status. Within each component, participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. COMPONENT #1 (Lynch Negative Proband and their first degree relatives (FDRs): ARM I: Participants access a website to deliver a "personalized prescription for CRC prevention" based on age, Lynch Syndrome status, cancer history, age of 1st degree relative with CRC, and personal CRC screening history. ARM II: Participants access a website as in Arm I and receive the services of a patient navigator to address individual barriers to adhering to the "personal prescription" within 1 month. COMPONENT #2 (Lynch Positive Proband and their FDRs): ARM III (Lynch positive proband): Participants use genetic counseling to discuss medical and family history and genetic risk of CRC, including genetic factors such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair genes, autosomal dominant inheritance, cancer risks associated with LS, screening recommendations, and genetic testing. ARM IV (Lynch positive proband): Participants use genetic counseling as in Arm III and receive the services of a patient navigator to address individual barriers to adhering to the CRC screening recommendations within 1 month. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12-14 months.</detailed_description>
