	<detailed_description>CRAFT is an evidence-based intervention aiming to promote treatment entry by treatment refusing individuals suffering from addiction by coaching their Concerned Significant others (e.g., family members). The intervention is based on diverse elements such as communication training, contingency management, functional analysis of problem behaviors and strategies to improve the live of CSOs and aims to rearrange contingencies in the natural environment of the drinkers so that clean behavior is reinforced and drinking behavior is effectively discouraged. The intervention was developed for adult CSOs and usually consists of up to 12 weekly face-to-face sessions with a duration of one hour each.</detailed_description>
