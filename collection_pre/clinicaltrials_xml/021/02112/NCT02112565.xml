	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of City of Hope 29 (COH29) in treating patients with solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. COH29 may inhibit an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RNR Inhibitor COH29 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Refractory to Standard Therapy or For Which No Standard Therapy Exists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of COH29 (ribonucleotide reductase [RNR] inhibitor COH29) and recommended dose for further phase II testing. II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of COH29. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of COH29 by assessing toxicities per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. II. To characterize any clinical activity of COH29 via objective tumor response. III. To assess pharmacodynamic response of COH29 on ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). IV. To explore baseline RRM2 tumor protein expression as a potential correlative marker for COH29 response. V. To explore measurement of plasma cytokeratin 18 (CK18) as a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker of COH29 antitumor activity. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive RNR inhibitor COH29 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
