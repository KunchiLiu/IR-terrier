	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to use hyperpolarized xenon gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography to develop a new technique capable of objectively and quantitatively describing regional and structural lung abnormality. Since this is a relatively novel technique, the investigators first need to acquire imaging and clinical data from a group of participants with normal lungs. The investigators hope to generate an "atlas" of normality, which will form the foundation of future studies to compare with patients suffering from chronic respiratory disease. The investigators also aim to validate the new technique in terms of intra-subject reproducibility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Lung Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Xenon Gas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, the gold standard for assessment of lung function in chronic respiratory disease is spirometry. This is combined with anatomical imaging (chest x-ray and computed tomography) for structural assessment. Spirometry only measures global lung function. It provides no information regarding the different regions of the lung or about the supporting "framework" of the lung itself, the parenchyma. In addition, changes in lung function as measured with spirometric indices do not correlate coherently with the symptoms experienced by patients, nor reflect their decline in health. This weak relationship is probably because the lung is a complex regional organ where localized disturbances of a variety of factors including gas flow (ventilation), blood flow (perfusion) and gas transfer all combine to impair respiratory function. MRI has the advantage of being an imaging technique free from ionizing radiation making it safe and practical for diseases such as asthma and obstructive lung disease where repeated follow-up scans are necessary. Hyperpolarized xenon, in the doses given for imaging has been shown to be safe. Conventional MRI has limited use in respiratory disease, because the lung is largely composed of air spaces that do not generate an MR signal. Hyperpolarized noble gases can resolve this problem.</detailed_description>
