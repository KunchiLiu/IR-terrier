	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about whether ibuprofen can reduce pain after removal of a ureteral stent more than a placebo. Some patients experience pain after removal of a ureteral stent. The investigators plan to learn how often this occurs and whether it can be prevented. The investigators hypothesize that children who have a temporary, indwelling ureteral stent will experience a significantly less post-operative pain if given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prior to removal of the ureteral stent when compared to placebo. The investigators hypothesize that the incidence of severe post-stent removal pain is similar to an adult population.</brief_summary>
