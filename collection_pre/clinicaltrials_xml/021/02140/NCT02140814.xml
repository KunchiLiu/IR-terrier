	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of administering niacinamide to patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, to develop methods to assess the biological efficacy of niacinamide, and to perform a preliminary exploration of its clinical effect on kidney cyst growth and kidney function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uncontrolled, Open Label, Pilot and Feasibility Study of Niacinamide in Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3. Vitamin B3 is found in many foods including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, beans, and cereal grains. Recent studies in mice have shown that niacinamide, at high doses, may slow kidney cyst growth from polycystic kidney disease (PKD). By doing this study, the researchers will determine if a larger, long-term study to test whether niacinamide slows progression of PKD is justified.</detailed_description>
