	<brief_summary>RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for the potential treatment of asthma and smoking related lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD). The objective of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of RV1729 and repeat doses of RV1729 for up to 28 days.</brief_summary>
