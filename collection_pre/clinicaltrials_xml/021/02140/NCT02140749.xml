	<brief_summary>Rationale: The dietary short-chain fructooligosaccharides have been shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and fermentation metabolites which might stimulate gut motility. Therefore, these dietary non-digestible carbohydrates might relieve functional constipation. Objective: Study the effect of short-chain fructooligosaccharides on functional constipation. Study design: A 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial with intervention periods of 4 weeks with a run-in period of 4 weeks and a wash-out period of 4 weeks. Study population: Human subjects with functional constipation according to ROMEIII criteria (total n=120; male and female; 18-75 yr). Intervention: Placebo and one out of 3 dosages of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides, (Degree of Polymerisation of 3-5; 2, 4 and 8 g/day) for 4 weeks. scFOS will be given as oral chews. Main study parameters: The primary parameter is the number of complete bowel movements per day in subjects with functional constipation according to Rome III criteria. Secondary outcomes are Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale), Stool frequency, Severity of symptoms (Constipation Scoring System; CSS) and Quality of Life (Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life; PAC-QoL).</brief_summary>
