	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate Travoprost/Brinzolamide fixed combination (Trav/Brinz) administered twice daily as compared to each of its marketed components (TRAVATAN Z® solution and AZOPT® suspension) and to the unfixed combination of TRAVATAN Z® plus AZOPT® in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6-Week Proof-of-Concept Study of Travoprost/Brinzolamide Ophthalmic Suspension in Subjects With Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was divided into two phases conducted in sequence. Phase I was the Screening/Eligibility Phase, which included a Screening Visit, followed by two Eligibility Visits. Phase II was the randomized, double-masked, 6-week Treatment Phase which included on-therapy visits at Week 2 and Week 6. Travoprost was administered in 1 of 3 concentration levels (A-C), where A=lowest and C=highest.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with openangle glaucoma (including openangle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion) or ocular hypertension; IOP within the protocolspecified range at both the Eligibility 1 and 2 Visits. Mean IOP must not be &gt;36 mmHg at any time point; Able to understand and sign an informed consent form; Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply. Woman of childbearing potential who is currently pregnant, intends to become pregnant during the study period, breastfeeding, or not using adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study; Unable to discontinue all IOPlowering ocular medication(s) per the appropriate washout schedule prior to the E1 Visit; Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease; Ocular trauma within the past 6 months prior to the Screening Visit; Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 3 months prior to the Screening Visit; Clinically relevant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment; Bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (equivalent to approximately 0.60 logMAR, 20/80 Snellen, or 0.25 decimal); Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the administration of a topical prostaglandin analogue or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; Intraocular surgery within the past 6 months prior to the Screening Visit; Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months prior to the Screening Visit; Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry; Any other conditions including severe illness which would make the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study; History of hepatic or renal disease that would preclude the safe administration of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) in the opinion of the Investigator; Hypersensitivity to prostaglandin analogues, topical or oral CAIs, sulfonamide derivatives, or to any component of the study medications in the opinion of the Investigator; Recent (within 4 weeks of the Eligibility 1 Visit) use of high dose (&gt; 1 g daily) salicylate therapy; Use of any additional topical or systemic ocular hypotensive medication during the study; Concurrent use of glucocorticoids administered by any route; Less than 30 days stable dosing regimen before the Screening Visit of any medications (excluding the IOPlowering treatments) or substances administered by any route and used on a chronic basis that may affect IOP (ie, β adrenergic blocking agents); Therapy with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit; Other protocolspecified exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
