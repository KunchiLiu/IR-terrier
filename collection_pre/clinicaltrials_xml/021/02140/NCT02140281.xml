	<detailed_description>A Phase 1, Single-center, Randomized, 2-Way Cross-over, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Effect of Oral Repeated Doses of AZD1722 on the Pharmacokinetics of Oral Cefadroxil in Healthy Volunteers</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Cefadroxil</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Healthy male and female volunteers aged ≥18 years to ≤50 years (inclusive) with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture 2. Females could be of nonchildbearing potential and child bearing potential Females of nonchild bearing potential should be Postmenopausal, documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must not be lactating, using one of the following effective methods to avoid pregnancy during the treatment periods, must have an established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system, use a barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal. Male healthy volunteers with a partner of childbearing potential must agree to avoid fathering a child, and refrain from donating sperm, from the first day of dosing until at least 3 months after last dose of investigational product, and therefore be either sterile (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) or agree to use, one of the following approved methods of contraception: a male condom with spermicide; a sterile sexual partner or use by female sexual partner of an acceptable form of effective contraception (see above) 3. Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2 and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg 1.History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, may either put the healthy volunteer at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the healthy volunteer's ability to participate in the study. 2.History or presence of GI, hepatic or renal disease including GI surgery other than appendectomy or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. 3.Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of the investigational product. 3 History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the principal investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD1722 or cefadroxil. 4. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) or has participated in any other clinical study that included drug treatment within at least 30 days of the first administration of investigational product in this study. 5. Loose stools for ≥2 days in the past 7 days before investigational product administration. Use of medications that are known to affect stool consistency and/or GI motility, including fibre supplements, anti diarrheals, prokinetic drugs, enemas, probiotic medications or supplements; or salt or electrolyte supplements containing sodium, potassium, chloride, or bicarbonate formulations during the past 7 days before randomization</criteria>
