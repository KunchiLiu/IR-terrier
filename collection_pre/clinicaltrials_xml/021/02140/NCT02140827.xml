	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of colorectal disease. The success of colonoscopy depends on high-quality bowel preparation by patients. Inadequate bowel cleansing reduces the cecal intubation rate, and the polyp detection rate (PDR). It also increases costs, mostly due to repeated procedures. The quality of bowel cleansing has remained suboptimal even though numerous different products and regimens have been tested and compared in no fewer than six meta-analyses. Therefore, a completely different approach to improve bowel cleansing is welcome.
