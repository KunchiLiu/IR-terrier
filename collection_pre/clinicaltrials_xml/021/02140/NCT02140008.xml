	<brief_summary>Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are well established in pediatric anesthetic practice. The pediatric i-gel and the self-pressurised air-Q (air-Q) are new supraglottic airway devices for children. The i-gel is made of a soft, gel-like elastomer with a noninflatable cuff. The air-Q is a new single-use device that may optimise the airway seal while reducing the potential for postoperative complications such as sore throat. The overall structure of the air-Q SP is identical to the original air-Q, except with regard to the inflatable cuff. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the clinical performance of the i-gel and the air-Q SP.</brief_summary>
