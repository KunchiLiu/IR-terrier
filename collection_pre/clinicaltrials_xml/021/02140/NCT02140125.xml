	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of ASP2408 After Subcutaneous Administration to Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study will be conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending subcutaneous dose study. As shown in the table below, the study will be conducted using 3 cohorts, to which a total of 24 subjects will be randomly assigned (18 subjects receiving ASP2408 and 6 subjects receiving placebo). Each cohort will consist of 8 subjects, who will be randomly assigned to either the ASP2408 group or the placebo group at the ratio of 3 to 1. Each subject will need to be hospitalized until Day 8 (start date of study drug administration will be regarded as Day 1) and will be observed until Day 90. The investigator or subinvestigator will carefully observe each subject for any sign or symptom of adverse events.</detailed_description>
