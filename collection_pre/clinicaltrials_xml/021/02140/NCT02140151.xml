	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether quarterly injections of Ranibizumab may prevent eyes with dry age-related macular degeneration from progressing to wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Ranibizumab for Exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, prospectively randomized, masked and controlled, interventional investigator sponsored phase I/II study of subjects with high-risk nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab quarterly for prophylaxis of conversion to exudative age-related macular degeneration. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy with ranibizumab to prevent the development of exudative AMD in eyes with high-risk nonexudative AMD. In addition, baseline characteristics of high-risk eyes (fundus features, optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters and genetic profile) will be evaluated to determine their predictive value in conversion to exudative AMD. The effect of ranibizumab on the atrophic component of AMD will also be monitored.</detailed_description>

Presence of media opacity that would preclude adequate examination and/or imaging Concurrent macular conditions that would affect the study parameters (epiretinal membrane, macular hole, macular edema) or require treatment within the duration of the study Any progressive ocular condition (uncontrolled glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis) that may affect the visual acuity for the duration of the study Active ocular infection (i.e., bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal) in either eye at enrollment Presence of any advanced systemic condition that may hinder the patients participation and completion of the study Concurrent use of systemic antiVEGF therapy</criteria>
