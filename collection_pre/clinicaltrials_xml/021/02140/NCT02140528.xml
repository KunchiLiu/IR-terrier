	<detailed_description>In this study all eligible patients divided in 2 group.20 patients received allogeneic adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell in the fractured site (case group) and other patients received the placebo in the fractured site (control group) . To assess the outcomes, we will evaluate the patients at 2, 6 weeks and 3, 6 months after transplantation by: X-ray, BMD , VAS and biochemical analysis with laboratory tests.</detailed_description>
