	<brief_summary>This is an observation study of girls ages 10-16 years with type 1 diabetes and age- and race-matched controls. The investigators will be examining blood and urine hormone levels as well as measures of bone density including DXA and high-resolution peripheral quantitiative computed tomography. The investigators hypothesize that youth with type 1 diabetes will have slower bone accrual and impaired bone microarchitectural integrity compared with non-diabetic controls. The investigators hypothesize that poor bone accrual will be associated with sub-optimal glucose control as well as lower levels of insulin-like growth factor 1.</brief_summary>
