	<brief_title>Effect of Antiglaucoma Agents on Short Term Intraocular Pressure Fluctuations After Intravitreal Bevacizumab Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute intraocular pressure elevation after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab was proven.Acute intraocular pressure elevation most probably is volume related and long term intraocular pressure elevation relates to pharmacologic features of the medications which results in anatomic changes in the angle of anterior chamber.Numerous studies found an intraocular pressure elevation right after the injection and quick normalization within maximally 30 minutes.This intraocular pressure elevation which lasts about 30 minutes, can result in irreversible visual loss especially in patients with critical remaining nerve fibers in the optic nerve head, as occurs in glaucomatous patients. Is there any way to prevent or even shorten this time of intraocular pressure elevation? We tried in our study to find a suitable response for a question above, so we used several anti-glaucoma agents (Timolol, Brimonidine, Acetazolamide, Mannitol versus placebo) as a prophylaxis to prevent acute intraocular pressure elevation right after intravitreal bevacizumab injection.</detailed_description>
