	<brief_title>Erlotinib 100mg or 150mg in Treating EGFR Mutated NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In China it was confirmed that 150mg Erlotinib was effective in NSCLC patients wtih EGFR mutation, but reducing dose occurring in some patients because of the drug related side-effects. Thus, we sought to investigate that in Chinese patients with EGFR mutation whether low dose (100mg) Erlotinib had similar efficacy but lower toxcities compared with standad dose (150mg) Erlotinib.</detailed_description>
