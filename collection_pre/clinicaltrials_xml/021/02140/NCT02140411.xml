	<brief_summary>Lucentis® (ranibizumab) is a humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody fragment approved in Chile by the Instituto de Salud Pública for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion and age-related macular degeneration. Currently, there is limited epidemiologic information in Chile regarding the incidence of DME and limited experience of anti-VEGF hospital therapy. This study will evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab in Chilean DME patients, to investigate the anatomical and functional improvement following this treatment and to increase the local experience regarding the use of anti-VEGF in the treatment of diabetic macular edema.</brief_summary>
