	<brief_title>Optimal Planning of a Day 3 Cryopreserved(Frozen)-Thawed Embryo Transfer in a Natural Cycle With hCG Administration or After Spontaneous LH Peak?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For surplus embryos after fresh IVF-cycles, cryopreservation has become common medical practice. These frozen embryos are mostly replaced in an artificial cycle with exogenous estrogen and progesterone or in a natural cycle. Often, hCG is administered as an ovulation induction agent for scheduling purposes. Successful implantation requires a co-ordinated series of events allowing a timely dialogue between a receptive endometrium and the intrusive blastocyst . The period of receptivity is thought to be 3 days in human. It is suggested that blastocyst apposition begins about day LH+6 and is completed by day LH+10 In general, the aim is to transfer the embryo during the 'window of implantation', what is defined as the period during which the uterus is receptive for implantation of the free-lying blastocyst. This has been a subject of debate since many years. A prospective study by Fatemi et al. (2010) revealed a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate after transferring frozen-thawed embryos in natural cycles with a spontaneous LH peak compared with natural cycles controlled by hCG for final oocyte maturation and ovulation (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively). In this trial, FrET (frozen embryo transfer) was planned 5 days after the LH surge or 5 days after the administration of 5000IU of hCG. In order to optimize the synchronization in the hCG group, and therefore enhance the pregnancy rates, the aim is to plan a FrET 6 days after hCG administration instead of 5 days. The rationale behind is that day 3 frozen embryos are thawed the day before embryo transfer, which means they are already at day 4 of the embryonic development.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Natural cycles, in which a frozenthawed day 3 embryo is replaced. Signed informed consent. Regular cycle (i.e. between 26 and 35 days) Normal transvaginal ultrasound at screening, without evidence of clinically significant abnormality consistent with finding adequate for ART with respect to uterus and adnexa. Embryos frozen by vitrification. Single or dual embryo transfer. Known allergic reactions to progesterone products. Intake of experimental drug within 30 days prior to study start. Contraindication for pregnancy. Embryos of women above 39 years of age at the time of embryo freezing. Recipients of oocyte donation cycles</criteria>
