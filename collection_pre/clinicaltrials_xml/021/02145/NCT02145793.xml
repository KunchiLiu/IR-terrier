	<brief_summary>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects 8% of US youth. Even though evidence shows medications are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, many families experience ongoing parenting stress around parent-child interactions. Children often have ongoing impairments in functioning. ADHD is a common condition identified and managed by primary care pediatricians. However current care in the clinic is not optimal to address parents' and children's needs around ADHD chronic care. Time is the biggest barrier. Group visits are a viable option to improve pediatric ADHD care, but requires extensive study. The goal of this proposed study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the group visit model for ADHD management within pediatric primary care. This study will be a randomized feasibility study that will generate important pilot data, as well as result in an innovative, exportable pediatric ADHD group curriculum for primary care practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific research aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: Develop and test a group curriculum for parents of children (age 6 to 18 years) with ADHD to increase parental knowledge about ADHD and self-confidence in managing issues related to their child's functioning in school and home. Aim 2: Develop and test a group curriculum for children (age 6 to 18 years) with ADHD to teach social and educational skills to improve adaptive functioning at home and school. Aim 3: To assess any added benefits to the parents, children and providers (related to group visit logistics and satisfaction) the group visit model has over usual care. Aim 4: To assess whether the group visit model can be done efficiently and effectively in the setting of an actual general pediatric practice.</detailed_description>
