	<brief_summary>This open-label dose escalation phase I trial, 1280.15, is with the first administration of BI 836845 in Japanese patients with various types of advanced solid tumours. The rationale behind this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836845 in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumours as weekly intravenous administration.</brief_summary>
