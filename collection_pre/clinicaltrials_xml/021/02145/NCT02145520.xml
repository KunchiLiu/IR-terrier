	<brief_title>Efficacy of Magnesium Sulfate in the Treatment of Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- On arrival to Pediatric Emergency Center, patients will be attended by a pediatric specialist on call who will take history and perform full physical examination. Patients will be assessed for eligibility to the study based on the inclusion criteria. - Guardians of eligible patients will be approached with the study design, objectives and risks; Patients will be included after obtaining a verbal and assigned written consent. - A chest radiograph and Magnesium level in serum will be requested for all study patients upon recruitment. - The observation physician will complete the data collection sheet that will include the patient's demographics, physical examination, bronchiolitis clinical severity score,oxygen saturation, chest radiograph findings and Magnesium level. - Treatment will be delivered to enrolled patients as currently practice in PEC(Nebulized epinephrine 1:1000 1ml in 5 ml of 5% hypertonic saline, every 4 hours until discharge, for all patients and if there is history of Bronchial Asthma in mother, father or full sibling. And/or history of Eczema in the Child ,patients will start on dexamethasone 1mg/kg orally stat.(max-10 mg/dose). Then 0,6 mg/kg orally once daily starting from second day of admission for 4 days). - All patients will be randomized to receive either Magnesium sulfate intravenous single dose over 1 hour or placebo. And it will be given in the same time with currently practice treatment - Epinephrine nebulization can be given on PRN basis up to a maximum of every one hour, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (min 2.5mg/dose and max 5 mg/dose) mixed in 5 ml of 5% hypertonic saline.â€¢ - Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) will be recorded at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,20,24,36,48,60,72 hours, and on discharge. - Vital signs will be recorded at 0, 2, 4 hours and then every 4 hours from the administration of study medication. - All patients will be followed up for two weeks post discharge by a phone call asking about the general condition, relapse of symptoms, or need for readmission.</detailed_description>
