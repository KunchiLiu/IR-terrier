	<brief_title>The Effect of Cognitive Functional Therapy on Patients With Non-specific Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-centre randomised study with 6 month, 12 month and 36 month follow up will be used. Patient with non- specific chronic low back pain will be assessed for eligibility. The patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive either the individual CFT or the group classes consisting of education and exercise. Participants' pain, disability, socio-economic status, beliefs, fear, catastrophizing, self-efficacy, general health, stress levels, as well as number and cost of treatments will be evaluated using a range of outcome measures at the start and on completion of the treatment. Patients will receive another copy of the questionnaires in the post at 6 month, 12 months and 36 months after treatment to reassess clinical outcomes. If a participant does not respond to follow-up, they will be telephoned to ask if they wish to complete the questionnaires.</detailed_description>
