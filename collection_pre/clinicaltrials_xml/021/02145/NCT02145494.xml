	<brief_summary>Giving a higher dose of radiation to the dominant tumour nodule within the prostate is hypothesized to improve tumour control. This trial will assess whether this technique, delivered in 5 treatments, can be delivered without increasing side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The SPARC Trial: Stereotactic Prostate Ablative Radiotherapy Using Cyberknife</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim To assess if a focal boost can be delivered to the dominant tumour nodule alongside 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the whole prostate gland. Primary end-point: Acute toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), International prostate symptom score (IPSS)) Secondary end-points: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir and 2-year biochemical control Late toxicity (IPSS, RTOG, International index of erectile function (IIEF-5)) Quality of life (EQ5D scale) Inclusion criteria - Prostate cancer patients with any of the following: - PSA&gt;20 - Gleason grade 4+3 or higher - Stage T3a - Exclusion criteria - Nodal or metastatic disease - PSA&gt;40 - Stage T3b or higher Study interventions This is a phase II study which will recruit 20 patients. A dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions will be delivered to the whole prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost up to 47.5 Gy in 5 fractions or to the highest dose possible within dose constraints. The boost volume will be defined on the multiparametric magnetic resonance scan by the specialist radiologist.</detailed_description>
