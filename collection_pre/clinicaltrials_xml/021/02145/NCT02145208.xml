Before retrieval the subject will be asked for subjective discomfort evaluation and level of urgency in the past days after device insertion, about any AE and then the device will be retrieved. The next visits will be at 4 weeks (post device retrieval), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post implantation with an optional extension of follow up period (up to 36 months).
