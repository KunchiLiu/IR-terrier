	<brief_summary>To compare the ability of a single dose of PXVX0200 at two different dose levels, to placebo to elicit a significant antibody response 14 days after vaccination, compared to baseline. To compare the ability of a single dose of PXVX0200 to a comparator vaccine Shanchol, a two dose administration, to elicit antibody response by 14 days after vaccination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PXVX0200 (CVD103-HgR) vs Shanchol in Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently there are two licensed inactivated vibrio oral vaccines (Dukoral® [Crucell; Leiden, The Netherlands] and Shanchol™ [Shantha Biotechnics; Hyderabad, India]) that are pre-qualified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for procurement by United Nations (UN) agencies. Each of these vaccines requires a two-dose regimen which is difficult to implement in the face of explosive outbreaks of cholera in unsettled situations in developing countries. For this reason there is great interest in identifying a cholera vaccine that can provide rapid onset of protection following the ingestion of just a single oral dose. This Phase 2 randomized, observer-blinded and subject-blinded clinical trial to be conducted in Bamako, Mali will assess the immunogenicity of the 10^8 cfu versus the 10^9 cfu formulation of PaxVax-manufactured CVD 103-HgR.</detailed_description>
