	<brief_title>Open Multi-center Safety &amp; Efficacy Study of Low Frequency Magnetic Fields to Treat Unresponsive Diabetic Foot Ulcers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open multi center trial to document the systemic effects and safety of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-MF) stimulation on healing of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU). The study will be performed in two sites: Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, with patients from Medical Services of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le√≥n, and Cuernavaca, Morelos with patients from Regional General Hospital of Cuernavaca N. 1 IMSS, and Health Services of Morelos. Two ELF-MF investigational exposure systems will be used to stimulate blood at different anatomical regions to enhance wound healing upon peripheral blood mononuclear cell migration to the ulcer site. a) In Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, where DFU subjects should be exposed at either forearm with a sinusoidal oscillating magnetic field of 120 Hz with nominal ELF-MF amplitude of approximately 0.6mT-0.8mT (6-8 Gauss) RMS 2 hours/day, 2 times/week. and b) In Cuernavaca, Morelos, where DFU subjects would be exposed at the thorax with a stimulation system in a quasi-Helmholtz configuration, for 25 minutes/day, 2 times/week to a sinusoidal oscillating magnetic field of 120 Hz, with nominal ELF-MF amplitude of approximately 0.6mT-0.8mT (6-8 Gauss) RMS. Treatment period for both groups will be 14.2 weeks or upon a complete healing. In each treatment session, evolution of ulcer healing should be recorded photographically. Efficacy and adverse effects will be searched for during treatment, short-term (&lt;1 year), and long-term follow-up in both groups (up to 7 years).</detailed_description>
