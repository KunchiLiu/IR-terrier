	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Fatty Acids on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Indicators and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vegetable oils high in the specific fatty acids of interest - stearic (found in cocoa butter, meats), palmitic (found in meats, dairy and some plant oils) and stearic acid's metabolic product, oleic (found in olive and corn oil) - will be used to displace each other in a standardized diet and fed to mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women using a randomized-controlled crossover design. A critical issue remains unresolved - the relative comparability among . The findings from this research study will enable us to understand the mechanism and potential health effect of different types of fats. Each of the diet phases will be 5 weeks in length with a 2-4 week break between phases. All food and drink will be provided to study volunteers. Blood pressure and body weight will be monitored once per week and adjustments made, if necessary, to maintain a stable weight. During the 5th week of each diet phase, volunteers will come to the center on 3 consecutive days to provide fasting blood samples and a non-fasting blood sample.</detailed_description>
