	<brief_title>Impact of Exercise on Cognitive Impairment in End-Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with end stage renal disease have higher cognitive impairment than general population. They also have decreased physical and functional capacity. Exercise has shown to improve cognition in general population. This study will evaluate if exercise improves cognition in dialysis patients. It will also evaluate whether exercise affects performance in daily activities, mood or depression and inflammatory markers in the blood.</detailed_description>
