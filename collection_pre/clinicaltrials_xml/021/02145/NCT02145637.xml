	<brief_summary>This phase Ib study will investigate dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib and ruxolitinib combination therapy, based on the preclinical data that inhibition of IL-6R/JAK1 signal transmission pathway will increase sensitivity to afatinib.</brief_summary>
