	<brief_summary>According to the BCLC guidelines, surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating cirrhosis is restricted to patients with preserved liver function, single nodule without vascular invasion and with hepatic venous gradient below 10 mmHg. However, other guideline treatment, especially from eastern countries demonstrated that surgical resection is safe and feasible and provides better survival than the treatment recommended by the BCLC system for patients with similar stage. The primary goal of this study is to assess the impact of HVPG on short and long-term outcomes in HCC patients who undergo liver resection.</brief_summary>
