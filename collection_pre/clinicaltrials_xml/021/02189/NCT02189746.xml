	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis is that better adherence to Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) in combination with existing WHO thermoregulation care will reduce the incidence of moderate hypothermia (32-36 degrees C) or severe hypothermia (&lt;32.0 degrees C) in preterm infants (32-36 6/7 weeks of gestational age) when compared with routine WHO thermoregulation alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall hypothesis is that better adherence to Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) in combination with existing World Health Organization (WHO) thermoregulation care (warm delivery rooms, immediate drying after birth, KMC whenever possible, early and exclusive breastfeeding, postponement of bathing and weighing, appropriate bundling, and use of air incubator, radiant warmer, or heat mattress if the neonate develops hypothermia) will reduce the incidence of moderate hypothermia (32-36 degrees C) or severe hypothermia (&lt;32.0 degrees C) in preterm infants (32-36 6/7 weeks of gestational age) when compared with routine WHO thermoregulation alone.</detailed_description>
