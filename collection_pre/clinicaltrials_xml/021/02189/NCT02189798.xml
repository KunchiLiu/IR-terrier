	<brief_summary>The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate whether low-frequency acoustic hearing sensitivity can be preserved in newly implanted adults with partial deafness (considerable low frequency acoustic hearing profiles with severe-to-profound high frequency sensorineural hearing loss) using the HiResolution™ 90K™ Advantage cochlear implant with the HiFocus™ Mid-Scala electrode to support the development of electro-acoustic stimulation technology (EAS).</brief_summary>
