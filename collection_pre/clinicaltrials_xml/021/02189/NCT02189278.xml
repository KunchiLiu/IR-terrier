	<brief_summary>Evidence-based guidelines recommend cancer surveillance procedures for breast cancer survivors including physical examination, mammography, breast self-exam, and gynecologic follow-up. The early detection of recurrent and new cancers can best be achieved through the combined, on schedule use of these surveillance procedures. Yet, data suggest that up to 55% of breast cancer survivors do not undergo these procedures as recommended. This study tests a telephone-based psychosocial intervention aimed at improving adherence to recommended surveillance in breast cancer survivors. The psychosocial intervention for improving adherence is compared to treatment as usual.</brief_summary>
