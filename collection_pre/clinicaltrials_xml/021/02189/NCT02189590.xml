	<brief_title>Assessment of the I-gel and Air-Q Supraglottic Airways as Conduits for Tracheal Intubation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of the i-gel as a conduit for fiberoptic tracheal intubation when compared to the air-Q in children. Intubations will be performed by residents in training. The primary outcome is of time for successful tracheal intubation. The investigators hypothesize that residents will intubate the trachea faster when using the air-Q as compared to the i-gel. The ease of placement of the supraglottic airway device, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, time for device removal after intubation, and peri-operative complications will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
