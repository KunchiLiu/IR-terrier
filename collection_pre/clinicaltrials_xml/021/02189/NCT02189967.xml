	<brief_summary>In this randomized multicentric phase II study it will be investigated whether an accelerated postoperative radiotherapy (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) may improve locoregional tumour control in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in comparison to conventional fractionation (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Radiotherapy of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Accelerated vs. Conventional Fractionation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized multicentric trial. Within this study an accelerated irradiation schedule (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) will be compared with the currently used conventional fractionation schedule (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) for postoperative radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. The primary endpoint is locoregional tumour control after 36 months. Secondary endpoints are overall survival of patients, local recurrence-free and distant metastases-free survival after 36 months, acute and late toxicity as well as quality of life for both treatment methods.</detailed_description>
