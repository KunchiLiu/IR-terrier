	<brief_title>Driving Simulator Study Comparing Two Modes of Presbyopic Correction With Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this crossover study, subjects wore lotrafilcon B MV (AOAMV) and lotrafilcon B MF (AOAMF) soft contact lenses as randomized for 2 weeks each. Subjects were assessed using a standardised driving simulation for each of the two treatments. A fresh pair of lenses was dispensed for the assessment. Subjects also wore lotrafilcon B single vision distance (SVD) and comfilcon A MF contact lenses during Period 1 and Period 2 respectively for an additional same-day assessment. Habitual correction was worn for an acclimatization drive in the driving simulator during Period 1.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Presbyopia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Current soft contact lens wearers (for 1 month or more) with distance spherical power requirements of +1.00 to + 4.00 diopters (D) or 1.00 to 10.00D, and who have never tried and then failed in monovision or AOAMF. Medium to high presbyopia, i.e. spectacle add requirement of +1.50D or more. Astigmatism, if present, ≤1.00D in both eyes. Distance visual acuity (VA) correctable to 20/30 (+0.2 logMAR) in both eyes. Within the normal ranges for binocular vision for distance (8Δ exophoria, ≤8Δ esophoria), vertical phoria = 1.5Δ hypo or hyper. Full United Kingdom driving license held for at least 3 years, with at least 2000 miles driven per year. Willing to wear study lenses at least 5 days per week. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Existing AIR OPTIX® Multifocal CL user. Sphere requirement in the range +0.75 to 0.75D in both eyes. Previous refractive surgery. Ocular/systemic medical condition or medical treatment contraindicating contact lens wear or driving simulation. Participation in a clinical study within the past 30 days. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
