	<brief_summary>Study Purposes and Objectives: The objectives should be stated in such a way that the reader can determine the appropriateness of the study design. If appropriate, state the specific hypotheses being tested and/or study aims. Use lay language. Methamphetamine use is of great concern in the state of Utah because it's the primary drug of threat in the state, and is the primary drug of choice among females between the ages of 18 and 24. The primary hypothesis of the study is that eight weeks of oral creatine supplementation will result in improvements in depression rating scores in female MA users. Secondary hypotheses include the following: 1) creatine supplementation will result in a decrease in the number of positive MA screens; 2) NAA and Cr concentrations will increase after eight weeks of oral creatine supplementation; and 3) PCr/Î²-NTP levels in the frontal lobe using 31P MRS will increase after eight weeks of creatine monohydrate oral supplementation.</brief_summary>
