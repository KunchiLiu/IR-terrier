	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this investigator-initiated trial is to evaluate the treatment outcome of depression utilizing platform algorithm products that can allow rapid identification of pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) genomic variation. This new technology may have the potential to optimize treatment selection by improving response, minimizing unfavorable adverse events / side effects and increasing treatment adherence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Genetic Variation Treatment Algorithm Versus Treatment As Usual for Management Of Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment seeking depressed patients (SCID confirmed major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) to the Mayo Clinic Depression Center will be invited to participate in this study evaluating the Assurex GeneSight® platform; this new technology can rapidly assess PK and PD genetic variation that can potentially impact antidepressant, antipsychotic, and stimulant associated treatment outcomes for depression. This study will recruit treatment seeking patients with major depression with an index episode of moderate symptom severity that has been unresponsive or poorly tolerated to at least one prior antidepressant treatment. This will be an 8-week, double-blind trial where depressed patients are randomized to testing results of GeneSight® (tricolored clinical report) prior to treatment selection (n=138) vs. treatment as usual (tricolored dummy report) (n=138). All testing results will be made available after the 8-week trial.</detailed_description>

Inability to speak English 2. Inability or lack of willingness to provide informed consent 3. Axis I or II disorder other than depression (i.e., by clinical assessment) that is the primary reason for treatment 4. Psychotropic medication change (including dosage) between screening &amp; baseline visit with exception of no more than 8mg of Ativan within a 24hour period. 5. Patients who meet DSMIVTR criteria for any significant current substance use disorder other than nicotine or caffeine. Must have at least early, partial or full, remission X 3 months 6.
