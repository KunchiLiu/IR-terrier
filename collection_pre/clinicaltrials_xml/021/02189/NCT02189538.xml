	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that burn patients may benefit from low fat diets, but there is still no strong data regarding the impact of fatty acid composition used for feeding. The trial test the hypothesis that the inclusion of omega-3 PUFA in a low fat diet may improve outcome. Prospective randomised controlled trial in adult patients admitted for burns &gt; 15% body surface area (BSA), and inhalation injury requiring mechanical ventilation and enteral nutrition. On admission randomization to receive a low-fat (18% energy as fat) modular enteral diet (LF-EN) and identical with the half of fat provided by fish oil (FO-EN). Study endpoints: mechanical ventilation time, inflammation (CRP), infectious and other complications, mortality until discharge. The study is planed as 2 parts: 1) preliminary study testing the feasibility of the study, 2) the study completed with information from the preliminary phase, both phases being randomised and controlled.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomisation within the first 24 hours of admission to 2 types of enteral feeds: 1) Ï‰ 3 PUFA (FO-EN) or 2) control solution which is the hospitals standard low 18% fat containing solution. The patients are fed as long as clinically required with the initial solution.</detailed_description>
