	<brief_summary>Serum procalcitonin levels will be considerably higher, for a longer period of time, in patients who develop sepsis compared to patients with SIRS or those who have an uncomplicated post-surgical recovery. Monitoring of serum procalcitonin trends will allow for an earlier diagnosis of, and initiation of treatment for, sepsis compared to current standard ICU methods.</brief_summary>
