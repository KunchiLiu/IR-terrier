	<brief_summary>Cerebral infarction is the most common form of stroke (80% of strokes). Stroke is the first cause of acquired disability, and the 2nd cause of dementia and death. The only approved treatment in the first 4.5 hour is intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis (Actilyse ®) whose objective is recanalization of occluded artery and reperfusion of the brain parenchyma. Few patients are treated (1-5%) and they keep disability in 50-60% of cases. This handicap is mainly correlated to the final infarct size. The objective of neuroprotective treatments is to reduce the final size of the cerebral infarction. The per-conditioning remote ischemic (Per-CID) showed a neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia by reducing the final size of cerebral infarction animal models. The per-CID corresponds, in cases of cerebral ischemia, to iterative ischemia realization of a member with a cuff. In humans, the per-CID has shown a cardioprotective effect in a randomized control trial involving 250 patients within 6 first hours of myocardial infarction and candidate for primary angioplasty.</brief_summary>
