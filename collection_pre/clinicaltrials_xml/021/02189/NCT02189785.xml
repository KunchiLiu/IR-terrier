	<brief_summary>This project hypothesizes that the brain's opioid system determines rejection sensitivity, a personality trait that is a vulnerability factor and feature of several psychiatric disorders. This project will use positron emission tomography to measure the brain's opioid response to social rejection and acceptance in a nonclinical population with varying levels of rejection sensitivity. The results will provide the first major step towards understanding a neurotransmitter mechanism for rejection sensitivity, allowing for further investigation into predicting and treating its associated disorders.</brief_summary>
