	<brief_summary>This study will consist of 80 patients ages 18 to 50 at the Emory Orthopaedic and Spine Center who are undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a quadriceps tendon autograft or bone patellar tendon bone autograft by Dr. Karas or Dr. Xerogeanes. Patients will be randomized into treatment and control arms. The treatment arm will include 40 patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine intra-operatively in addition to the current standard pain control regimen. The control group will include 40 patients receiving the standard post-operative pain control regimen. Patients will be assessed to identify differences in post-operative pain, satisfaction, as well as concomitant pain medication use. Post-operative range of motion will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
