	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) results in blockages of arteries (blood vessels) in the legs and decreased blood flow to the legs. This may cause difficulty or pain with walking or other activities that use leg muscles. Exercise may help improve blood flow in the legs and improve the ability to walk. This research project is being implemented in adults with PAD to examine the effects of exercise or weight loss programs on lower extremity blood flow, health, and physical function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity To Improve Outcomes in Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study seeks to gather data on different exercise interventions in PAD. Collectively, the proposed studies will gather data on the role of novel exercise interventions in those with PAD who are receiving conservative treatment as well as those who have undergone an endovascular intervention for lower extremity arterial disease. We hypothesize that patients who undergo an exercise intervention will: A) show improved lower extremity perfusion and B) improve their functional ability, compared to a standard care control group over 6 months of follow-up. We further hypothesize that these improvements are mediated through angiogenesis and increased perfusion of the lower limb, as well as improvements in muscle strength, mass, and function.</detailed_description>
