	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to compare a new medical devices with an established medical device for lower limb rehabilitation regarding training outcome and patient comfort / patient satisfaction (primary objective) and treatment effect (exploratory objective). Primary study endpoints will be a significantly higher rated patient comfort and or patient satisfaction using the new versions, compared with the established Lokomat. Furthermore, muscle activity and kinematic movement patterns will be expected to show more involved muscle groups and a walking pattern involving more degrees of freedom during use of the new version compared with the established Lokomat. Exploratory endpoints will be a significantly stronger involvement of muscles needed for balance, more physiological walking patterns and more change on the lateral positioning of the feet due to training with the new version, compared with the established Lokomat.</brief_summary>
