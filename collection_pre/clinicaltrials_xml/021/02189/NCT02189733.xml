	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics and demonstrate bioequivalence of a reconstituted new lyophilized formulation of caplacizumab for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection as compared to an equal nominal s.c. dose of the reference liquid formulation of caplacizumab. The secondary objective of the study is to compare the safety and tolerability, and the pharmacodynamic parameters of the new formulation with those of the reference formulation.</brief_summary>
