	<brief_summary>A subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) harbor rearrangements of the MLL gene, which are detected either by cytogenetic or fluorescent in situ hybridization evaluation at the time of diagnosis. A protein called DOT1L plays an important role in the malignant process in these leukemias. EPZ-5676 is a molecule that blocks the activity of DOT1L, and is therefore being evaluated in the treatment of patients with MLL-rearranged leukemias.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expanded Cohort Study of EPZ-5676 in the Treatment of Pediatric Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Leukemias Bearing a Rearrangement of the MLL Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b study of EPZ-5676 in pediatric patients. The study will have two phases. The first phase will assess escalating doses of EPZ-5676 in order to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EPZ-5676 as a 28-day continuous IV infusion. Once the MTD and/or RP2D is established, a second phase of the study will further evaluate the safety of EPZ-5676 and assess the anti-leukemia activity.</detailed_description>

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled infection, significant graftversushostdisease (GvHD) (Grade 24), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 11. Patients who are concurrently receiving strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A 12. Patients with known history of Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome), history of congenital immunodeficiency or inherited marrow failure disorder. 13.
