	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of "OncozeneTM" Microspheres for Intra-arterial Delivery of Doxorubicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin loaded ONCOZENE microspheres chemoemobilization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The study will also describe the overall response rates of lesions with Oncozene-DEB-TACE(Trans-arterial chemoemobilization) per modified RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following Oncozene-DEB-TACE (Trans-arterial chemoemobilization)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed by at least one of the following: a) histological confirmation; b) imaging results consistent with cirrhosis and at least one solid liver lesion of &gt;2cm with early enhancement and delayed washout (AASLD criteria for diagnosis of HCC); c) Alpha fetoprotein level &gt;400ng/mL and evidence of at least one solid liver lesion &gt;2cm, regardless of specific imaging characteristics on MRI. Tumor not suitable for resection at the time of study entry. (Transplant eligible patients are allowed) Age ≥ 18 years. Performance status ECOG PS 01 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status). Child Pugh Score A only Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL (Measurement and Calibration Lab) absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelets ≥ 75,000/mcl total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)(SGOT)/ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)(SPGT) ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine ≤ 2.0 INR (International Normalized Ratio) ≤ 1.8 Albumin ≥ 2.8 Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A female of childbearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Absence of occlusive thrombus in the main portal vein Life expectancy of at least 6 months Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those with residual treatment related toxicity of greater than grade 1 not addressed in inclusion criteria. Any concurrent therapy for HCC including concurrent investigational agents. Subjects with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to doxorubicin or other agents used in study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants. ChildPugh status B or C Encephalopathy no adequately controlled medically Known cardiac ejection fraction &lt;50% Tumor involving &gt;50% of the liver Infiltrative form of HCC on imaging; If there is at least one measurable lesion per mRECIST criteria and otherwise patient is eligible for the study, the patient can be enrolled. Extensive extrahepatic spread of hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with limited metastatic disease may be enrolled as defined as lymph node disease pulmonary nodules &lt;5 mm in size 13 bone metastases Active gastrointestinal bleeding Evidence of uncontrollable bleeding diathesis Any contraindication to angiography Any known contraindication to chemoembolization according to the treating physician</criteria>
