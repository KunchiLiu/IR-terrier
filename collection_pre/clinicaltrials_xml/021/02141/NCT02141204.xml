	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two formulations (liquid vs. lyophilised) of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine when administered as two doses in healthy infants aged ≥ 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study of Two Different Formulations of Human Rotavirus Vaccine, Rotarix in Healthy Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol summary has been amended based on NDAC- Vaccines (New Drug Advisory Committee on Vaccines) of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)'s recommendation to conduct this study as a Phase IV study instead of phase III, because the Rotarix liquid file application is considered as a line extension of Rotarix Lyophilized formulation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 6 and 10 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/ Legally Acceptable Representative(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Birth weight &gt;2000 g. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days of the first dose of study vaccine with the exception for the routine childhood vaccinations. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. History of confirmed RV GE. Previous vaccination against RV. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, (including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency disorder) based on medical history and physical examination. Uncorrected congenital malformation (such as Meckel's diverticulum) of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for Intussusception or history of Intussusception. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator (warrants deferral of the vaccination). Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or medical history. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period. GE within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration.</criteria>
