	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study protocol is to collect imaging data on embryos followed to blastocyst stage (Day 5-6) and correlate Eeva parameters with array - Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) results and ongoing pregnancy rates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlating Time-Lapse Parameters With aCGH Testing in IVF Treatment (aCGH Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study was designed to determine if there is a correlation between the Eeva System parameters and aCGH testing results. Embryos will be selected for transfer based on aCGH results and morphology. The Clinical site will have no access to the Eeva analysis at the time of the transfer.</detailed_description>
