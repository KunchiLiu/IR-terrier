	<brief_summary>This is considered an investigator-initiated clinical research trial, which means that your study doctor is researching a particular medication (in this case a medication that is currently FDA- approved) for the treatment of AD/HD in individuals ages 6-17. The medication is guanfacine hydrochloride. The hypothesis is that this medication could be used in adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder who have not received satisfactory results with their current stimulant ADHD medication. The study drug is investigational for use in adults. Investigational means it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults.</brief_summary>
