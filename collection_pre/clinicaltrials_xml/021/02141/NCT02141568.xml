	<brief_title>The Effect of Clinic Intervention in Frequent Attenders Suffering From Unexplained Medical Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Somatic or "medically unexplained" symptoms and syndromes are common and are seen by physicians across almost every medical specialty. In many instances, these phenomena can cause a great deal of pain and frustration, restrict function and reduce patients' quality of life. Despite their frequency and severity, medical personnel often experience a great deal of difficulty in coping with such complaints and patients may be shuttled from specialist to specialist, often with little or no symptomatic relief and at a great deal of expense to the medical system. Many researchers now believe that these seemingly unrelated and "unexplained" conditions in fact share common psycho-physiological mechanisms, such as being catalyzed as a result of trauma or excessive stress, being mediated by the limbic system and affecting inhibitory sensory pathways. Purpose of the study: Testing the efficacy and cost-efficiency of a holistic multidisciplinary treatment methodology for medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Stages of the Study: 1. Identifying potential participants based on their frequent use of medical services and high expense rates. The process will be done using the "Clalit Health Service" database and will include 6 primary care clinic in the Be'er Sheva district. 2. Exclusion of potential candidates suffering from chronic medical illnesses, such as: cancer, long-term psychosis, dementia and dialysis patients. 3. Randomization of potential candidates into two arms. The first arm will be followed via the "Clalit Health Service" database with no intervention. 4. Members of the second arm will be asked if they would be willing to participate in the study by their family physicians in the aforementioned community clinics. 5. Participants who have agreed to join the study will then be referred to the "functional neurology" clinic at Soroka UMC where they will be further randomized into one of two equal arms (henceforth: the second and third arms of the study). 6. The second arm will be treated for 3 months by the staff of the "functional neurology" clinic at Soroka UMC. This treatment will include an initial visit to the staff neurologist and further multidisciplinary treatment as per his decision (the team includes a psychologist and a physical therapist as well). The third arm will be treated for 3 months by an internal medicine physician on staff at Soroka UMC. This treatment will include an initial visit to the physician and further treatment as per his decision. 7. Self-report measures will be collected from the second and third arms of the study at their initial randomization, at the end of treatment (3 months) and 6 months after the start of treatment. 8. Expense rates and use of medical services will be evaluated for 6 months prior to the start of the intervention and then again at the end of treatment (3 months) and 12 months after the start of treatment. Expected Results 1. A decrease in expense rates and use of medical services in the intervention group (second arm). 2. An increase in patient satisfaction amongst the intervention group (second arm). 3. An increase in patient-reported health and quality of life in the intervention group (second arm).</detailed_description>
