	<brief_summary>Primary objectives: To determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a management program for patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) carried out in primary or specialist healthcare. In the primary arm, the diagnosis and therapeutic decision will be made by means of a domiciliary nasal pressure (DNP) channel and oximetry while the specialist healthcare arm will use polysomnography (PSG) in a hospital. Patients with an intermediate-high suspicion of OSAS will be included, taking as primary variables the Epworth scale, for efficacy, and the Epworth scale and EuroQol 5D, for cost-effectiveness. Secondary objectives: efficacy of the two SAHS management programs according to the following secondary variables: a) quality-of-life tests: FOSQ questionnaire, SF36 and analogical wellbeing scale, b) adherence to and compliance with the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Nasal Pressure for Sleep Apnea Management in Primary Case</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel, non-inferiority. A total of 280 patients will be randomized for management on the basis of DNP (primary) or PSG (specialist), thereby giving rise to 4 groups: two treated and two not treated with CPAP. The former will undergo a home auto-titration. The follow-up will last 6 months and include 4 evaluations.</detailed_description>
