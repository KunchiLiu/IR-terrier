	<brief_summary>The next generation of personalized medical treatment according to the type of personal genetic information are evolving rapidly. The genome analysis needs systematic infra and database based on personal genetic information Therefore, a big data of genome-clinical information is important. To determine the feasibility of the use of tumor's molecular profiling and targeted therapies in the treatment of advanced cancer and to determine the clinical outcome(PFS, duration of response and overall survival) of patients with advanced cancer, the investigators are going to take a fresh tissue of patients and process molecular profiling and receive molecular profile directed treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Next pErsonalized Cancer tX With mulTi-omics and Preclinical Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study nickname is NEXT-1 trial(Next pErsonalized cancer tX with mulTi). A single-center, open label trial to analysis of genetic information in advanced cancer. If the target is to be confirmed by molecular profile, the subgroup is going to Umbrella trial type. defined below: NEXT 1 trial is screening and feasibility -&gt; NEXT trial is BASKET/umbrella study screening protocol(Molecular screening prolongs survival)-&gt;NEXT-1.1(gastric cancer),NEXT-1.2(colorectal cancer),NEXT-1.3(biliary tract cancer/pancreatic cancer),NEXT-1.4(Rare cancer),NEXT-1.5(genitourinary cancer)</detailed_description>
