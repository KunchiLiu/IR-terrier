	<brief_summary>Following results from the first survey that forms part of the EU RMP for Alli® (RMP survey 1; WEUSRTP3350), several amendments to the information included on the pack carton for Alli® (orlistat 60 mg) were recommended. The main finding from RMP survey 1 was that a large proportion of Alli® users had a body mass index (BMI) less than (&lt;)28 kg/m2 . (Note: the European indication for Alli® is adults 18 years and older with a BMI&lt;28 kg/m2.) The proportion of respondents overall who reported possible contraindications to Alli® use was relatively low. The following changes to the pack labeling were agreed and have been implemented: : (1) a statement, highlighting the product is only for those with a BMI of 28 or above was added to the front of the pack; (2) wording of the BMI statement on the back of the pack was strengthened; (3) contraindications were highlighted in bold text; (4) the statement that Alli® is not for use by those under 18 years of age was modified for clarity. In addition, a pharmacy reminder card was made available to retail pharmacists to improve awareness of the prescribing information for Alli®. The survey will assess whether compliance with the authorized indication and contraindications among purchasers of Alli® has been improved after one year of marketing the revised pack labeling.</brief_summary>
