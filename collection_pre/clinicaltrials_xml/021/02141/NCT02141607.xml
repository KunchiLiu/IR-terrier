	<brief_summary>The relationship between shock, ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, hemodynamic instability, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiorgan failure has been extensively investigated, but there is no consensus on the trigger mechanisms of tissue injury at the molecular level. Current therapies are targeted to reduce symptoms of shock and multiorgan damage but they are unable to act at the "beginning of the cascade", because of the lack of a model explaining the molecular basis of shock induced tissue injury and ensuing organ damage. The present observational study is aimed at identifying the molecular triggers of acute heart failure (HF) induced by shock and to identify inflammatory mediators and markers that are activated in shock, with a particular emphasis on the role of uncontrolled proteolytic activity.</brief_summary>
