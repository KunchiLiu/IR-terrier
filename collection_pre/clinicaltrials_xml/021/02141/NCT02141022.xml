	<brief_title>Computerized Exercise Training for Cognitive Remediation in Adults With Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Gilenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gilenya represents the most recent advance in MS disease-modification therapy (DMT) and shows promise for neuroprotection, a feature relevant to the progressive neurologic damage associated with the disease. Cognitive impairment accompanies MS in 40-60% of cases and when present, additional symptomatic treatment combined with DMT is required. To date no symptomatic pharmacologic therapy has shown a consistent benefit on MS associated cognitive dysfunction. However, non-pharmacologic approaches show promise. With recent technical and scientific advances, cognitive training is rapidly evolving to become the most effective intervention for the cognitive impairments associated with a wide range of neurological conditions. However, these training programs have not yet been studied in MS. This study will be a randomized open-label clinical pilot trial to compare a plasticity-based and adaptive cognitive remediation (PACR) program to an active control (ordinary computer games) in 20 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting Gilenya therapy. Primary outcome measures will be used as preliminary indicators of effect, with improvements on program task-related measures and changes in cognitive measures. Secondary outcome measures will determine the feasibility of the use of these programs in patients with MS, as indicated by compliance and patient-reported experience.</detailed_description>
