	<brief_summary>We are proposing to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of newborns in the maternal infant care areas at Tampa General Hospital. Participants who are determined eligible for the study (classified to have ankyloglossia via the HATLFF and either a Class III or IV maxillary labial frenum) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A or Group B. Group A will receive a sham procedure for intervention #1 and a lingual frenotomy procedure for intervention #2. Group B will receive a lingual frenotomy procedure for intervention #1 and a sham procedure for intervention #2. Newborns that continue to have difficulty with breastfeeding after both interventions will undergo intervention #3, a labial frenotomy, and breastfeeding will be monitored afterwards.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of Lingual Frenotomy in Newborns With Simultaneous Lip Tie for the Relief of Breastfeeding Pain.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized control studies which aims to contribute data to a previous study on the effects of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) on breastfeeding, and to also provide new information on the effects of maxillary lip-tie on breastfeeding. Participants who are determined eligible for the study (classified to have ankyloglossia via the HATLFF and either a Class III or IV maxillary labial frenum) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A or Group B. Group A will receive a sham procedure for intervention #1 and a lingual frenotomy procedure for intervention #2. Group B will receive a lingual frenotomy procedure for intervention #1 and a sham procedure for intervention #2. Newborns that continue to have difficulty with breastfeeding after both interventions will undergo intervention #3, a labial frenotomy, and breastfeeding will be monitored afterwards. These results will be analyzed to determine when lingual frenotomies, labial frenotomies, or both are necessary to improve breastfeeding pain and LATCH scores. The study aims to prove that the simple and low risk frenotomy procedure should be considered as treatment for both ankyloglossia and maxillary lip-tie, preventing breastfeeding complications as well as many other future problems such as with speech and self esteem. It is hypothesized that the use of frenotomies as treatment for ankyloglossia and maxillary lip-tie will improve breastfeeding success for breastfeeding couplets with newborns with both ankyloglossia and maxillary lip-tie. It is expected to see an increase in LATCH score to &gt;7 for breastfeeding sessions and a significant decrease in scoring on the pain scale after frenotomy intervention, while it is expected to see little change in LATCH and pain scale assessment scores after sham procedures. Overall data is not expected to vary significantly between Group A and Group B. It is also hypothesized that a lingual frenotomy alone will be sufficient to improve breastfeeding success without the need to also conduct a labial frenotomy.</detailed_description>
