	<brief_summary>Background: Women are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, which have been linked to reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an 8-week yoga program on HRV and mood in generally healthy women. The investigators hypothesized that there would be improvements in HRV and reductions in perceived stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety after the yoga intervention. Methods: Fifty-two healthy women were randomized to either a yoga group or a control group. Participants in the yoga group completed an 8-week yoga program, which comprised a 60-minute session, twice a week. Each session consisted of breathing exercises, yoga pose practice, and supine meditation/relaxation. Participants' HRV, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and state and trait anxiety were assessed at baseline and week 9.</brief_summary>
