	<detailed_description>The primary aims of this randomized controlled trial are to evaluate efficacy potential of SPEEDI at enhancing reaching and play based problem solving compared to infants receiving usual care. The secondary aim is to assess the efficacy potential of SPEEDI to impact motor and cognitive development as assessed using commonly used clinical outcome measures. The exploratory aims are to assess the impact of SPEEDI on parent child interactions and feeding skills. The findings will provide crucial initial efficacy estimates to be used in a larger definitive clinical trial of SPEEDI.</detailed_description>
