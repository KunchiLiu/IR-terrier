	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, proof of concept, study in adults with poorly controlled moderate to severe asthma. The researchers believe that by using a local anesthetic to block a certain nerve in the ear, it will improve all aspects of asthma, such as decreasing the numbers of times patients have to use a rescue inhaler, and improving asthma treatment assessment questionnaire scores, with no bad changes to lung function and inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Efficacy of CREWS01 to Decrease Usage of Rescue Inhalers in Moderate to Severe Asthmatic Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed four-week, double-blind, placebo controlled study is designed to test the hypothesis that topical auricular anesthesia of the vagus nerve decreases the need for the usage of rescue inhalers in moderate to severe asthma in adults. We anticipate that up to 50 patients will be enrolled in the trial. Particularly severe risks are not anticipated based on the prior investigational experience with this drug. This trial will be used to generate experience and data to support the design of a larger, crossover, comparator trial investigating the efficacy of antipyrine- benzocaine in reducing the need for rescue inhalers and hospital admissions in moderate to severe asthmatic adults.</detailed_description>
