Patients with a history (within 2 years prior to the Screening Visit) of drug and/or alcohol abuse that may prevent study compliance based on investigator judgment Patients unlikely to be cooperative or that can't comply with the study procedures. Patients treated with any investigational drug within 30 days (or 6 halflives, whichever is longer) prior to the Screening Visit Patients who intends to use any concomitant medication not permitted by this protocol or who have not undergone the required stabilization periods for prohibited medication Any other conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the patient to be unsuitable for the study</criteria>
