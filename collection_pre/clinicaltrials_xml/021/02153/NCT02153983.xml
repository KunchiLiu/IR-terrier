	<brief_summary>Background: - Being overweight may cause low-level inflammation. This inflammation may cause some of the medical problems of obesity, like high blood sugar (diabetes) and heart disease. This study will test whether a medication called colchicine can improve metabolism in adults who are overweight but have not yet developed diabetes. Objectives: - To learn whether colchicine improves sugar regulation and metabolism. Eligibility: - Healthy overweight adults at least 18to 100 years old. Design: - Participants must fast before each visit, including the screening visit. - Participants will be screened with blood tests,urine tests, medical history, and physical exam. They will have to drink sugar water, and have blood drawn to find out if they are healthy. - For visit 1, participants will have a medical history and physical exam and answer questions. They will have blood taken with an intravenous (IV) line, give urine sample, and give 2 stool samples.. - Also, subjects will get sugar water through one IV. Blood will be drawn from the other. This measures sugar and insulin levels. During this, participants will lie in a bed and can watch TV. - Participants will have a full-body X-ray, lying on a table while a camera passes over them. They will also have an abdominal CT scan, lying on a table that moves through a ring that takes pictures. - Participants will have a small fat tissue sample taken from their abdomen. It is like getting a mini-liposuction. - Participants will be given the study drug or placebo. They will take it twice daily for 3 months. - For visit 2, participants will have blood tests, urine tests, medical history, and physical exam. - For visit 3, participants will repeat the tests in visit 1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Colchicine in Non-Diabetic Adults With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity affects one-third of the adult U.S. population and is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Mouse models and human data suggest that obesity-induced chronic inflammation is one mechanism promoting obesity-associated comorbid conditions. In obesity, innate immunity is activated by circulating molecules such as fatty acids and cholesterol crystals bind to nucleotide-binding oligomerization (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) receptors in adipocyte tissue macrophages (ATMs). This binding stimulates NLRP3 oligomerization, inflammasome formation, and proinflammatory cytokine activation. The resultant inflammatory cascade leads to insulin resistance and decreased pancreatic beta-cell reserve. It has been proposed that the suppression of this chronic low-level inflammatory state may impede the onset of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown colchicine, a potent microtubule inhibitor commonly used for the treatment of gout and some rare inflammatory conditions, disrupts intracellular localization of NLRP3, thereby blocking inflammasome assembly. As there are limited medical therapies proven effective to improve obesity-related metabolic dysregulation, we propose to determine the efficacy of colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily in non-diabetic obese adults with metabolic syndrome. We will conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of colchicine in forty subjects. We will study changes in insulin resistance, beta-cell reserve, and systemic inflammation. Using adipose tissue obtained from biopsies, we will also study colchicine s local effects on inflammation and insulin resistance. Should results prove promising, this pilot study will allow determination of the sample size needed for an adequately powered study of the effects of colchicine in obese adults with metabolic syndrome. 5 patients with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes will be given open-label colchicine and followed as described above. We also plan to perform baseline evaluations on 40 subjects who are not eligible for the treatment protocol. This group will consist of non-obese adults, obese adults who are not insulin-resistant, and adults with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO COLCHICINE or PLACEBO:: Subjects will qualify for randomization to colchicine or placebo if they meet the following criteria: Good general health. In general subjects should take no medications. However, individuals taking medications for obesityrelated comorbid conditions, who have not had changes in dosage for more than 3 months, may be included, at the discretion of the principal investigator. Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m^2, but weight less than 450 lbs in order for subjects to undergo DualEnergy Xray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. Age greater than or equal to 18 to 100 years. Metabolic Syndrome (Any 3 of the following 5): FPG greater than or equal to 100 mg/dl, or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (Glucose greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl at 2 hours of OGTT) Triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl, or on treatment Waist Circumference: Men greater than or equal to 40 in (greater than or equal to 102 cm); Women greater than or equal to 35 in (greater than or equal to 88 cm) Reduced HDLC: Men &lt; 40 mg/dl; Women &lt; 50 mg/dl, or on treatment Hypertension: greater than or equal to 130 mmHg systolic, or greater than or equal to 85 mmHg diastolic, or on treatment HOMAIR greater than or equal to 2.6. Our goal is to enroll participants who have preexisting insulin resistance. hsCRP greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/L. We aim to recruit participants with increased baseline level of inflammation. Individuals with hsCRP above 2.0 mg/L have been shown to have an increased risk for cardiovascular events. EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO COLCHICINE OR PLACEBO: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as determined by either having: Clear clinical diagnosis of diabetes, such as a patient in a hyperglycemic crisis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL Two of the following three: Fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL Hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 6.5% An oral glucose tolerance test glucose concentration of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL at 2 hours. One of the above three criteria (bi.biii.) meeting the T2DM cutoff on two different days. If only one of the above three criteria (bi.biii.) meet the T2DM threshold during the Screening Visit, that test will be repeated on another day to determine if the subject has T2DM or not. As per ADA guidelines, The diagnosis [of T2DM] is made on the basis of the confirmed test.Moreover, because HbA1c has been shown to be higher in African Americans (AA) as compared to other races for the same glycemia, nondiabetic AA may be unfairly excluded by their HbA1c alone. Therefore, for AA subjects, if their 2 hour OGTT and fasting glucoses are in the nondiabetic range, and the HbA1c is &lt; 7.0%, we will consider them nondiabetic.
