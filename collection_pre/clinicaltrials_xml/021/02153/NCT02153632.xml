	<brief_summary>Amantadine HCl ER has been used for many years as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. It has been reported in the literature to effectively treat the motor complications of levodopa, especially dyskinesia, but it must be given 2 to 4 times a day. The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 26 week study is to compare the efficacy and safety of two different dose levels of Amantadine Extended Release Tablets to placebo for the treatment of levodopa induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. The dose will be given once a day in the morning so that amantadine concentrations are maintained throughout the day for treating the levodopa induced dyskinesia, but will be lower during the night, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep.</brief_summary>

History of alcohol or narcotic substance abuse â‰¤1 year before screening. Has dementia or another psychiatric illness that prevents provision of informed consent. Has a known hypersensitivity to the study treatment(s), based on known allergies to drugs of the same class including rimantadine HCl and memantine HCl. Has participated in other studies involving investigational drugs or surgeries within the last 30 days or investigational biologics within the last 6 months prior to screening. Plans to undergo major elective surgery during the course of the study. Received administration of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) within 2 weeks. Cognitive impairment, as evidenced by a score &lt;26 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at the screening visit.</criteria>
