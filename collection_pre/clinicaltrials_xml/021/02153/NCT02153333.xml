	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the serologic response to PCV-1 in the serum samples previously collected during initiation of vaccination series of Human Rotavirus (HRV) vaccine studies (1-2 months post Dose 2 of HRV vaccine or placebo). Additionally, pre-vaccination sera samples from any infants testing positive for PCV-1 antibodies at the post-vaccination time point will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

Subjects for whom their parents or Legally Acceptable Representatives (LARs) had agreed that their child or wards blood samples could be used for further research while giving consent for any of the primary studies listed. Subjects who have sufficient residual volume of serum samples at both pre and postvaccination time points.</criteria>
