	<brief_title>Cellular Immunotherapy Following Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or B-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous central memory T cells (Tcm) that are enriched and genetically modified to express a cluster of differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinged optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (CD19R[EQ]28zeta/truncated EGFR [EGFRt]+ Tcm) shortly following lymphodepletion for adults with recurrent/progressive/residual CD19 + B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms (stratum 1: non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], stratum 2: chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]/prolymphocytic leukemia [PLL]) and who are not eligible for or decline City of Hope (COH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) Protocol Number (No.) 13277. II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study antitumor activity of CD19R(EQ)CD28zeta/EGFRt+Tcm (e.g., detection of Tcm, B cells, and tumor burden). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells (T-cell infusion). LYMPHODEPLETING REGIMEN: Patients receive a chemotherapy regimen based on disease type and extent of disease comprising: cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3; OR bendamustine hydrochloride IV on days -4 and -3; OR fludarabine phosphate IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3; OR etoposide IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3; OR cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 followed by etoposide IV on days -5 to -3. CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-10 days later after lymphodepletion, patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells IV over 10-15 minutes on day 0. Patients with relapsed, residual or progressive disease may receive an optional second infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells &gt;= 28 days post T cell infusion. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at every 2 days for 14 days, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years</detailed_description>
