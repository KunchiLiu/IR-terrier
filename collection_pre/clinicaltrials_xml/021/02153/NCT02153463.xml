	<brief_summary>Tics are brief repetitive movements or vocalizations. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a disorder characterized by recurrent motor and vocal tics. Tourette syndrome and tic disorders affect up to 8% of children. Peak severity of tic disorders occurs between the ages of 8 to 12 years, therefore during childhood and adolescence the most significant impacts are felt. The quality of life of young people with tics is lower than their peers' and tic severity predicts lower quality of life. Studies have also shown negative social perception toward children with tics. Approximately 50% of patients with Tourette syndrome will have other diagnoses including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression. Studies have shown improvements in ADHD with physical activity. ADHD and tic disorders are thought to involve the same areas of the brain; thus it is possible that tics might also improve with physical activity. However, no studies to date have examined this. The investigators predict that by implementing a motivational physical activity program, in conjunction with physical activity counseling, the investigators will be able to increase levels of physical activity in children with tics and Tourette syndrome, with a positive impact on tic severity.</brief_summary>
