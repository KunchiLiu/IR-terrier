	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery and metformin hydrochloride in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that may be removed (borderline-resectable) or not removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes, may also kill cancer cells as demonstrated in laboratory studies. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Metformin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Borderline-Resectable or Locally-Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label pilot, single-center, non-randomized trial is designed to evaluate the tolerability and preliminary activity of the combination of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with metformin for resectable and locally-advanced pancreatic/periampullary cancers. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. determine if the addition of metformin to SBRT adds minimal additional toxicity for patients with A). borderline-resectable or B). locally-advanced pancreatic adenocarcinomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical/pathological response and resectability rates associated with these regimens. OUTLINE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily or twice daily (BID) on days -11 to -1. Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 5 days a week for 5 weeks and receive concurrent metformin hydrochloride* PO BID for 5 weeks. Patients undergo laparotomy on week 6 (or weeks 5-7). ). Systemic therapy continues as soon as it is considered feasible by the treating physicians. *NOTE: Metformin hydrochloride should be stopped 2 days before laparotomy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
