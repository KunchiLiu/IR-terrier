	<brief_summary>The Canadian Respiratory Research Network (CRRN) has recently been established to study the origins and evolution of airways disease in the population. The CRRN is funded by the Institute of Cardio-respiratory Health (ICRH), an institute of the CIHR. The Physiology platform will support the other CRRN platforms (biology, imaging, population health, knowledge transfer) by providing a comprehensive characterization of the nature and extent of physiological impairment of respiratory function in smokers at risk for airways disease and in those with early or mild airway obstruction. The planned studies of the physiology group (core sites located at Queen's University, University of British Columbia and McGill University) will initially focus on smoking-related lung injury in those at risk for COPD and in those meeting spirometric criteria for mild airway obstruction, with or without respiratory symptoms. The primary aim of this initial study is to identify and validate sensitive test(s) of peripheral airway dysfunction that may qualify as physiological biomarkers for use in future CRRN studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Stable patients with GOLD grade 1 mild COPD will be included in the study if they have: a postbronchodilator FEV1≥80 %predicted and an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7 and &lt;LLN; ≥40 years of age; and a cigarette smoking history ≥10 packyears or ≥10 years of exposure to other inhaled substances (i.e., second hand smoke and/or biomass). Symptomatic (category B) subjects will have a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) total score ≤9, a modified Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea score ≥2, or a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score ≥10. Asymptomatic (category A) subjects will have a BDI&gt;9, modified MRC&lt;2 or CAT&lt;10, no history of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms, and no history of using respiratory medications. Symptomatic current or exsmokers (&gt;10 packyear history) who do not meet criteria for COPD (e.g., postbronchodilator FEV1&lt;80%predicted and FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7, with both measurements also &lt;LLN) and who are on no respiratory medication will be included. Symptomatic will be defined as: BDI≤9, modified MRC≥2 or CAT&gt;10. Healthy, age and sexmatched, nonsmoking (&lt;2 packyear history) participants with normal spirometry will be used for comparison purposes. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: presence of clinically significant comorbidities that could contribute to dyspnea or exercise limitation (i.e., unstable heart disease, a pulmonary disease other than COPD, uncontrolled diabetes, neuromuscular or orthopedic impairment); history/clinical evidence of asthma; contraindications to exercise testing; &lt;40 years of age; body mass index &lt;18.5 or &gt;=35 kg/m2.</criteria>
