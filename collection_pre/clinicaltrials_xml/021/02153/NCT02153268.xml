	<brief_summary>Phase I/II open label first in human single center clinical study, is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill as bone filler containing the patient own (autologous) adipose tissue derived cells (HATDCs) in reconstructing the Bone Void in the maxillofacial area approximately 6 month follow up after implantation in the following two clinical indications: 1. Bone augmentation (e.g. sinus augmentation) 2. Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Filling Bone Defects/Voids With Autologous BonoFill For Maxillofacial Bone Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint: The implantation of BonoFill to the maxillary or mandible defect/void is safe under the following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no significant changes in complete blood count (CBC) and in general health. Secondary endpoint: The implantation of BonoFill to the maxillary or mandible void is efficient under the following conditions: Following BonoFill implantation, the bone regeneration in the operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids were filled with a significant amount of bone tissue.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The inclusion criteria defining the eligible subjects are divided to two groups according clinical indications: Sinus augmentation Subjects in general good health in the opinion of the investigator as determined by medical history, vital signs physical examination and safety lab tests Subjects that have a rehabilitation dentist and rehabilitation program Up to dated panoramic XRay.
