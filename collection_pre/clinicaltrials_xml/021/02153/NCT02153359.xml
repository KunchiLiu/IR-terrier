	<brief_summary>This study is about asthma and how the environment affects asthma. Scientists know that air pollution (such as cigarette smoke and other particles in the air) can make asthma symptoms worse. This research is being done to study how the health of a person with asthma responds to an air cleaner. The investigator hypothesize that an air cleaner will improve the health of persons with asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Reducing Indoor Air Pollution on the Adult Asthmatic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators seek to determine the effect of placing air cleaner devices in the homes of adults with asthma on their asthma health. To this end, the investigators aim to study 40 adults with asthma that are 18-50 years of age and live in Baltimore. They will receive either true air cleaners or sham cleaners in a blinded, randomized manner for one month, and then, after a washout period, they will cross over and receive the other intervention (sham or true cleaner). All participants will have environmental monitoring (personal and in-home) to determine their particulate matter exposure, and be followed repeatedly during the 3 month study period for markers of asthma disease, including respiratory symptoms, medication and health care utilization, pulmonary function, airway hyperresponsiveness, systemic markers of inflammation, and bronchoscopic evidence of airway inflammation or epithelial cell dysfunction. Modifying factors or factors influencing susceptibility, such as diet and nutritional status, will also be explored.</detailed_description>
