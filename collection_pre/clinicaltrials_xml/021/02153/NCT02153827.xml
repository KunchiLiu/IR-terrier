	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of eccentric exercise to the shoulder muscles for people with shoulder pain. Identifying specific exercise protocols for individuals with shoulder pain will provide evidence to help clinicians select the best interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shoulder Eccentric External Rotator Training for Subacromial Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior investigations for eccentric training of the shoulder have primarily utilized a pain provocation model for exercise progression. This method of progressing resistance training load and volume assumes that pain must be increased during the exercise movement for clinical benefit to occur. When the individual reports a reduction in pain, load is increased so that the provoking pain level returns. The contrast to this approach would be a performance based progression as utilized in the Blume et al study for shoulder eccentric training. This method progresses a patient based on ability to perform a higher number of repetitions at a given load without increasing symptoms which could be favorable in many clinical settings. Further investigation on the role of eccentric training, specifically to the shoulder external rotators, in patients with SAPS is warranted. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to compare outcomes, for individuals diagnosed with SAPS, performing a six week protocol of eccentric training to the shoulder external rotators compared to a general exercise protocol.</detailed_description>
