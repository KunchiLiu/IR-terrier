	<brief_title>Eplerenone For the Treatment of Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The goal of the study is to examine the short-term effects and safety of eplerenone, a systemic anti-aldosterone medication, in a group of patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). - There is currently no standard treatment or therapy for chronic CSCR, a potentially debilitating eye disease. - There is evidence that high blood serum corticosteroid levels can cause or worsen CSCR - Eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has been shown to be of visual and anatomic benefit in a small series of 4 patients with chronic CSCR, suggesting that decreasing mineralocorticoid action in the eye may improve signs and symptoms of CSCR - The study's aim is to evaluate a standardized dose of eplerenone in a controlled prospective fashion for chronic CSCR. - The study consists of taking a standard dose of eplerenone, 25mg once daily for a week, followed by 50mg once daily, for a total of 3 months - Patients will be monitored for efficacy and side effects from the beginning of treatment and for 6 months</detailed_description>
