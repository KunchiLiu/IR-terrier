	<brief_summary>Children with autism spectrum disorders often engage in problem behaviors such as self-injury, destruction, aggression, and stereotypy. Prior research has clearly shown that these problem behaviors may interfere with learning, daily functioning, and social participation. As such, engaging in problem behaviors has a negative impact on the health and quality of life of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families. One promising solution to reduce problem behaviors in this population is the Prevent-Teach-Reinforce (PTR) model, which relies on the evidence-based practices of positive behavior support. Although the use of PTR has been gaining considerably support in schools, the model has never been evaluated as part of a rigorous large-scale study using parents as interventionists. Thus, the purpose of the project is to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of a home-based version of the PTR model in reducing problem behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders and in improving families' quality of life. Our hypotheses are that implementing the PTR will (a) produce larger reductions in problem behaviors than participating in an individual parent training session, (b) increase engagement in prosocial behaviors, (c) decrease parental stress, and (c) improve the quality of life of the family. The results of the study will allow an examination of whether PTR is an effective and acceptable model to reduce problem behaviors at home in this population. Given that problem behaviors incur high societal costs when they persist into adolescence and adulthood, the study may potentially lead to large cost reductions in the treatment of difficulties associated with autism spectrum disorders. By reducing engagement in problem behaviors, the implementation of the model may also promote and facilitate the social participation as well as improve the quality of life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families.</brief_summary>
