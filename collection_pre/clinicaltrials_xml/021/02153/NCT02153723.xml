	<brief_summary>A phase 2 open label trial to test a potential drug treatment for Rett syndrome, the leading known genetic cause of severe neurological impairment in girls. The drug, Copaxone (generic name - Glatiramer acetate) is medication FDA approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Copaxone's high safety profile has been documented in large cohorts of patients for more than 12 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background/rationale for the study: In Rett syndrome brain cells aren't actually lost, instead poor maturation of connections between brain cells (synapses) prevents effective neurological functioning, and is the main morphological feature of the disease. The MeCP2 gene plays a major role in transcriptional regulation of other genes, one of which is the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The disease progression and severity of symptoms is directly affected by the level of BDNF expression. An increase of BDNF levels (by genetic manipulations or pharmacological agents) leads to delayed onset of Rett syndrome-like symptoms in experimental models; rescued gait/mobility, improved quality of life and increased survival rates. Copaxone treatment by subcutaneous injection caused elevation of BDNF levels. Quantitative immunofluorescence assays showed about a twofold increase in neuronal expression of BDNF following Copaxone treatment. We expect that an increase in BDNF levels with Copaxone administration will stimulate communication between brain cells (synaptic maturation), which will lead to amelioration of symptoms (motor functions/gait, cognitive functions, breathing, encephalopathy and improve quality of life) for girls with Rett syndrome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female patients with genetically confirmed RTT Age: 10 or more years old. Selection of the age is based on the available evidence of the safety of GA in this group, and the relative homogeneity/stability of the phenotype, which is not expected to spontaneously change within a 6 month period at this age Ambulatory (with our without support) Prolonged Qtc (obtained within 30 days prior to enrolment) Presence of co morbid nonRett related disease Presence of immunodeficiency requiring IVIG 3 months prior to enrollment Allergy/sensitivity to GA or mannitol Inability or unwillingness of legal guardians to give written informed consent</criteria>
