	<brief_title>An Investigation of Dexamethasone With Different Doses in the Management of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 60 adults with ITP from 7 medical centers in China. Part of the participants are randomly selected to receive dexamethasone (given at a dose of 40mg per day for 4 consecutive days) ,the others are selected to receive dexamethasone(given at a dose of 20 mg daily for 4 days). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of different dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).</detailed_description>
