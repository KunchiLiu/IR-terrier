	<brief_summary>Prolonged-release fampridine (SR-fampridine) can improving walking capacity in approximately 40% of MS patients suffering from this by overcoming partly or total conduction block due to demyelination. Resistance training has been shown to provide the same kind of benefits for patients by targeting the muscular component of the motor unit. Thus by combining the two it is likely to see an synergistic effect. This trial is designed as a double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial with subsequent cross-over. Participants in the two arms will go through the same progressive training program targets at the lower limbs. For 24 weeks one group receives SR-fampridine and the other receives placebo. in the the end there is another four weeks of training after cross-over has been performed.</brief_summary>
