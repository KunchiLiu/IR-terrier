	<brief_summary>A comparison of skin closure techniques (standard skin closure with staples versus a continuous (subcuticular) absorbable suture), to determine if this changes the rate of post operative wound infections in elective colorectal surgery patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcuticular Continuous Suture Versus Skin Staples to Reduce Surgical Site Infections in Colorectal Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In colorectal surgery, there has been a growing interest in the study of Surgical Site Infections (SSI), with an outstanding variability of reported incidence, ranging from 3% up to 30% depending on the series. Although general risk factors for infection have been identified, there is still a need to identify specific risk factors for colorectal surgery patients, to try to reduce these numbers. The technique and materials used for wound closure have been considered as interesting variables for study. Main question of our study: is subcuticular (reabsorbable, continuous) suture better than skin staples for reducing wound SSIs in colorectal surgery? The study is sponsored by the Surgical Infection Society Europe, and was awarded the SIS-E Fellowship for young investigators (2013)</detailed_description>
