	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of navitoclax when given together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with solid tumors that have returned (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Navitoclax and sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Navitoclax and Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Dose escalation cohort) II. To better characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib. (Expansion cohort) III. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in patients with metastatic cancer. (Dose escalation cohort) IV. To seek preliminary evidence of activity of this treatment combination in patients with hepatoma. (Expansion cohort) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib induces apoptosis that can be detected by peripheral blood biomarker analysis. (Dose escalation cohort) II. To assess peripheral blood biomarkers and pharmacokinetics in a more homogenous population. (Expansion cohort) III. To determine whether treatment is associated with myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) down regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Expansion cohort) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion whether pretreatment tumor cell levels of Mcl-1 predict response to this regimen through serial biopsies. (Expansion cohort) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of navitoclax. Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 1-28 course of 1 only) and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 (days 8-28 of course 1 only). Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.</detailed_description>

providers should use caution with drugs with possible increased risk for Torsades de pointes; NOTE: patient will be eligible if they can be taken off these medications prior to initiation of therapy and no less than 4 halflives of the medication Current use of certain concomitant medications due to mechanisticbased platelet toxicities from navitoclax: clopidogrel, ibuprofen, tirofiban and other anticoagulants, drugs or herbal supplements that effect platelet function;
