	<brief_summary>Denutrition and Obesity are risk factors for perioperative surgical complications. In patient with cancer, incidence of denutrition is markedly increased. Surgical resection of cancer induces a high intensity cellular stress response and catabolism reinforcing the risk for perioperative denutrition. In this study, we thought to investigate the change in body composition during the perioperative period using anthropometric measurements and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evolution of Corporeal Composition in the PeriOperative Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Body composition measurements will be performed before surgical procedure (7 days) and at day 1, day 5, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. Others data will be recorded including anthropometric measurements, nutritional intake, occurence of surgical complication, type of surgical procedure, type and stage of cancer, and CT-scan measurements of subcutaneous abdominal fat, visceral fat and peri-renal fat before surgery and at 6 months.</detailed_description>
