	<brief_summary>The main purpose is to evaluate the clinical response, safety and survival of the FDA approved drugs Dabrafenib, Trametinib in combination with Metformin. Investigators hypothesize that the combination of an FDA approved non toxic dose of oral Metformin with the B-Raf inhibitor, Dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor, Trametinib will yield little toxicity and improve clinical outcomes in terms of objective response rates and survival in metastatic melanoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Dabrafenib, Trametinib and Metformin for Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a single-arm, single center, uncontrolled phase I/II trial to estimate the safety of the combined treatments and then estimate the efficacy in terms of objective response rate in patients with stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma treated with dabrafenib/trametinib and metformin.</detailed_description>
