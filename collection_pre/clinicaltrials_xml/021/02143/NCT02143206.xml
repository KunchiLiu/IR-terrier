	<brief_summary>This study will test whether using the Biodex BioStep Semi Recumbent Elliptical for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient with arthritic limitations will improve participation in a pulmonary rehab program compared to the Nustep elliptical. The main outcome of participation will be measured by the number of exercise sessions the patient is able to complete during their pulmonary rehabilitation program. In addition, distance walked in six minutes, dyspnea score, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) score, Pain Scale Index score, and finally, the Dartmouth Quality of Life index (DQL) will be assessed in both groups. It is believed that the new machine will provide better overall outcomes compared to the traditional machine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modifying Exercise for the COPD Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Prospective cohort study of 25 COPD patients with osteoarthritis undergoing an exercise plan in a pulmonary rehab program. Patient pain level, clinical outcomes, and ultimately, quality of life outcomes will be assessed in order to assess whether future compliance for COPD arthritic patients will occur in an exercise rehabilitation program.</detailed_description>
