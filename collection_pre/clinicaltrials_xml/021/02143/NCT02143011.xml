	<brief_summary>The main objectives of this study are to test the hypotheses that: 1) consumption of beverages sweetened with sucrose will increase risk factors for cardiovascular disease to a greater extent than a naturally-sweetened fruit juice such as orange juice, and 2) chronic psychological stress may augment the adverse metabolic effects of sugar intake. The study intervention consists of 2-week's consumption of 25% of energy as sugar provided either as a sucrose-sweetened beverage or naturally-sweetened orange juice.</brief_summary>

(IDS scores are not an inclusion criteria in this group, merely a ruleout for the low stress participants). Low stress participants: PSS scores ≤ 8, Inventory for Depressive Symptom (IDS) scores ≤ 14, and the absence of any predefined chronically stressful events as assessed by the telephone screening questions. glucose intolerance Evidence of liver disorder Evidence of kidney disorder Evidence of thyroid disorder Systolic blood pressure consistently over 140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure over 90mmHg Triglycerides &gt; 200mg/dl LDLC &gt; 130mg/dl Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dl pregnant or lactating women Current, prior (within 12 months), or anticipated use of any hypolipidemic or antidiabetic agents Use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and antihypertensive medications Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, would put subject at risk Strenuous exerciser surgery for weight loss Diet exclusions: food allergies, special dietary restrictions, habitual ingest of &gt;2 alcoholic beverages/day</criteria>
