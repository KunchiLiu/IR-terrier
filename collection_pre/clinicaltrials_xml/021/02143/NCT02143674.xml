	<brief_summary>Introduction: The life expectancy and the number of people hitting the old age have increased in recent years. The aging process is accompanied by morphological and functional changes that contribute to reduced functional capacity, increase the number of falls and the appearance of physical limitations. Exercise promotes maintenance of functional autonomy, improving the physical ability of the elderly making it more independent. Objective: To evaluate the effect of a program of muscle strengthening exercises associated with global stretching on balance, fear of falling and functional capacity in elderly women. Methods: This was a non-randomized controlled trial, in which 12 volunteers aged over 60 years were divided into two groups: intervention group (IG, n = 7) submitted to muscle strengthening exercises and stretching, 2 times per week for 12 weeks, and the control group (CG, n = 5), not submitted to the protocol but were educated about physical exercises. Before and after the protocol were evaluated scores of Berg Balance Scale, the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) and Evaluation of Functional Autonomy Development Group for Latin American Maturity (GDLAM). Data were statistically analyzed within and between groups with a significance level of p &lt;0.05.</brief_summary>
