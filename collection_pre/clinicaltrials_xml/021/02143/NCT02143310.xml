These may look like conventional cigarettes but do not contain tobacco. The 'vapour' produced by such devices typically consists of humectants (propylene glycol or glycerol), nicotine, water, and flavours. This trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an e-vapour product over two years.</brief_summary>
