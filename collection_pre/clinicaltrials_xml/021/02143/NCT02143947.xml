	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of two types of in-shoe custom made orthotics in altering the motion of the foot and muscle activity of select muscles of the lower leg in individuals experiencing lower extremity symptoms of a non traumatic origin. We hypothesized that orthotics would decrease the extent of motion of the during walking and running when compared to a barefoot condition. The investigators further hypothesized that orthotics would decrease the amount of muscle activity seen during walking and running when compared to barefoot walking.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subjects must have complaints of lower extremity or foot pain of a nontraumatic, mechanical origin. Subjects must have at least 60 degrees of frontal plane forefoot on rearfoot passive range of motion (as determined by a modified Gib test in the symptomatic lower extremity. Subjects must be able to walk independently on a treadmill at a speed of 4.8 kmh. Subjects must have been referred by a health care professional for an orthosis fitting. Subjects having less than 60 degrees of forefoot on rearfoot frontal plane passive range of motion. Subjects having a history of a fracture of the foot or ankle. Subjects having any previous illness, surgery or other characteristic (e.g., cardiovascular, musculoskeletal or neuromuscular problems) that would affect their lower extremity function or ability to walk independently. Subjects having knee, lower leg or foot pain of a nonmechanical nature.</criteria>
