	<brief_summary>Lung ventilation required for lung resection surgery induces a proinflammatory response including cytokine production and recruitment of leukocytes and macrophages in the lung associated with postoperative complications, mainly acute lung injury (ALI). The lung-protective ventilation has been shown reduce this inflammatory response and play a protective role against ALI, even though it is unclear the role of intravenous and inhalational anesthetic agents in immunomodulation of the inflammatory response during lung ventilation and its possible protective role against ALI. This study aims to determine the effect of anesthetic agents on markers of lung inflammation, the mechanisms of oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion, and assess the relationship between these mediators and postoperative morbidity defined as percentage of postoperative lung complications (ALI / ARDS, pneumonia and atelectasis), length of stay in ICU, hospital stay and mortality at 30 days. The investigators hypothesis, based on results of our group in animal research, is that inhalants cause a lower proinflammatory response to intravenous agents for lung resection surgery. A clinical trial is design with two groups (propofol, sevoflurane) managed all with lung protective ventilation, in which the markers will be measured before and after one-lung ventilation in both lungs and in plasma before, during and after one-lung ventilation. postoperative lung complications, ICU and hospital stay and 30 days mortality.</brief_summary>
