	<brief_summary>Cognitive remediation (CR) therapies refer to a number of recent developments to use behavioural strategies to improve neurocognitive abilities and improve everyday functioning in mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. In this study, we aim to examine whether we can observe CR effects on measures of neuroplasticity, cognition, and functioning when using a rigorous control comparison group. We hypothesize that the active group will exhibit improvements in executive functioning composite scores, improved EEG theta-gamma frequency modulation, and increased EEG alpha power compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
