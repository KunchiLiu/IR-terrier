	<brief_title>Safety and Performance of a GLOBAL Mapping and Ablation Device for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (GLOBAL-AF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon successful enrolment, subjects will be scheduled for mapping and radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Cardiac CT imaging, echocardiography and baseline 12-lead ECG will be performed pre-procedure for screening and health assessment. During the procedure the Globe catheter will be delivered via standard femoral vein access and transseptal puncture. Anatomical and electrophysiological mapping of the left atrium (LA) will be followed by RF ablation to achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Additional lesions will be created as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Intracardiac electrogram mapping will be used to confirm PVI during the procedure. Echocardiography will be performed at discharge to assess cardiac function. Electrocardiograms by 12-lead ECG and 7-day Holter monitoring will be recorded at discharge, and 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be performed at discharge, 7 days, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, to track freedom from documented AF and adverse events. Subject-reported AF symptomology and quality of life will also be assessed during follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients indicated for ablation, with a documented history of symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation Between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive Patients who have contraindications to open heart surgery Patients from an Intensive Care Unit Patients requiring concurrent right atrial ablation or who have had previous left atrial ablation Previous cardiac procedure or known abnormalities that would interfere with device delivery, position, or treatment efficacy History of a documented thromboembolic event or bleeding abnormalities Contraindication to anticoagulation therapy Mental impairment or other conditions, which may not allow patient to understand the nature, significance and scope of the study Anatomy that would prevent safe and appropriate introduction or delivery of the Globe device into the patient</criteria>
