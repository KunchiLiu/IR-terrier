	<brief_summary>Randomized, phase 2 study to assess the impact of the multi-disciplinary STAND clinic on changes in key metabolic parameters, quality of life, and patient satisfaction among men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Standard-of-care therapy will consist of every 3-month visits comprised of review of medical history, toxicity assessment, and lifestyle modification counseling provided by a dietitian and exercise physiologist on an as-needed basis. Men randomized to participate in the multi-disciplinary STAND clinic will have, in addition to every 3-month visits with an individual health care provider, structured and individualized exercise and dietary counseling. A separate non-randomized patient cohort of 20 patients who are receiving concurrent chemohormonal therapy will be enrolled in parallel. The primary hypothesis of the study is that active participation in a multi-disciplinary clinic, as compared to current standard-of-care, will lead to lessened impact of androgen deprivation therapy on metabolic parameters and improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
