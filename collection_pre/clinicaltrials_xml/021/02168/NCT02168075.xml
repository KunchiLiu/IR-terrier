	<brief_summary>Mannitol is widely used in patients with elevated intracranial pressure. In neurosurgical field, especially in large size or with brain edema, it is necessary to decrease brain volume to facilitate surgical approach. In general, 0.25 -1.5g of mannitol per kilogram has been known to decrease ICP effectively. But there are some debates in regard to appropriate dose of mannitol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mannitol Brain Relaxation Effect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous meta-analysis reported that mannitol has dose-response relationship with intracranial pressure. Another study of Sorani showed dose-response relationship between mannitol and intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury patients. In this study, authors would investigate that mannitol increments can provide more brain relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor removal.</detailed_description>
