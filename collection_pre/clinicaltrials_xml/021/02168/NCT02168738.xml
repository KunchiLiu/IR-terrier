	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare three lipidic forms of DHA in their metabolic pathway in human by using 13C labeled molecules. The circulating form of DHA plays a major role in his cerebral incorporation. The aim of this research is to confirm that some lipidic forms are best carriers for the cerebral incorporation in studying 13C-DHA distribution in plasma lipids and blood cells.</brief_summary>
