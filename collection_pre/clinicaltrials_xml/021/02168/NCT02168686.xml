	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and primary efficacy of a gene transfer vector (drug) for the treatment of alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency. The study uses an experimental drug (ADVM-043 also known as AAVrh.10halpha1AT) to deliver a gene (gene transfer) to treat the signs and symptoms of A1AT deficiency. Unlike other drugs, this one is made of a virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV). In this study, the AAV acts as the vehicle used to carry the A1AT gene into the lung cells so it can treat the cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Gene Transfer Vector to Treat Alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2, randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the ADVM-043 gene transfer vector following intrapleural (IP) administration in patients with A1AT deficiency. As a comparator to the IP route of administration, an equal number of patients with A1AT deficiency will be administered the ADVM-043 vector by intravenous (IV) infusion.</detailed_description>
