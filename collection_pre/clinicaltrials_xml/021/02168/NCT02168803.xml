	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to measure how much of the drug gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given once a day for 12, 24, and 52 weeks to participants with abnormal amounts of cholesterol and/or fat in the blood stream. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will also evaluate how the study drug reacts in the body when given once a day for 12, 24 and 52 weeks and how the body responds and returns to normal when the treatment is complete. The relationship between study drug and the results from the how the study drug reacts in the body may be explored, if needed.</brief_summary>
