	<brief_summary>Exercise therapy increase functional capacity improving the morbidity and mortality of patients with cardiovascular disease. Moderate continuous training is the best established training modality for this patients. However, a body of evidence has begun to emerge demonstrating that high intensity interval training obtained better results in terms of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to determine the effect of two types of exercise training: moderate continuous training vs high interval training on functional capacity and quality of life as well as verify the safety in its application. We included 72 patients with coronary artery disease by assigning one of the training modality for 8 weeks. We analyzed cyclo-ergo-spirometry data, aspect related to quality of life as well as a record of adverse events.</brief_summary>
