	<brief_title>Immune Tests in Blood Samples From Children With ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is accumulating evidence that at least a subset of children diagnosed with ASD also have aberrant immune functions. This study will attempt to identify more specifically the nature of the potential immune abnormalities in children. The study will follow a case-control design. Only one blood drawing will be performed upon meeting the inclusion criteria and completing a questionnaire that includes detailed information regarding family history of immune aberrations. Five ml of venous blood will be drawn from all subjects (ASD and controls) and shall be separated into 2 vials: - 0.5 ml: for Complete Blood Count - 4.5 ml for serum separation. The serum will be aliquoted (0.5 ml vials) and frozen at -80º centigrade and sent to laboratory for detailed immune analysis. One aliquot will be sent for analysis. The others will be kept for further testing (±backup). Adverse events to blood drawing will be reported to the Data Coordinating Center using the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF). In cases of adverse effects (AE) related to the drawing of blood or performance of examination of patients in the course of standard examination procedures, the investigating team will proceed in accordance with local guidelines (to be inserted by the PI), reporting the incidents which occurred during the course of a clinical trial. Clinical data will be collected by the investigator, or a person appointed and appropriately trained by the investigator, and shall be entered into standardized CRFs and shared online with the sponsor. Source data will be retained for all data entered in the CRFs. Progress reports and the Final Report at the conclusion of the trial will be submitted to the regulatory authority and the Ethics Committee, as required.</detailed_description>
