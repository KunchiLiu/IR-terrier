	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies KeraStat Skin Therapy in treating radiation dermatitis in patients with newly diagnosed stage 0-IIIA breast cancer. Radiation dermatitis is an itchy, painful skin rash that can occur following treatment with radiation. KeraStat Skin Therapy may be a better treatment for radiation dermatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KeraStat Skin Therapy in Treating Radiation Dermatitis in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage 0-IIIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain a preliminary estimate the incidence of early adverse skin reaction (EASR) during radiation therapy (RT) and up to two months post RT after the application of the cosmetic cream KeraStat Skin Therapy during RT in breast cancer patients in a pilot study. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To associate personal characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, hormone therapy, smoking status, comorbidities, breast size) and treatment characteristics (e.g., RT dose) to incidence of EASR at any time point. OUTLINE: Patients apply KeraStat Skin Therapy topically twice daily (BID) during radiation therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.</detailed_description>
