Patients with chronic low back pain for 3 months after surgical treatment is recruited (age between 18 and 70; pain visual analysis scale (VAS) between 3 and 8). After randomization, subjects are divided into 3 groups: 1) Treatment with Analgecine (Experiment group); 2) Treatment with Neurotropin (positive control group); 3) Placebo group. Subjects will be undergone 4 measurement time points on day 0, 7, 14, and 21.
