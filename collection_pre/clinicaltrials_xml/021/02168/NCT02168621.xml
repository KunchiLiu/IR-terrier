	<brief_summary>Treatment directed towards the control of periodontal infections is to about 90% non-surgical procedures. There is evidence from a large number of randomized controlled studies that the efficacy in terms of clinical outcomes of a full-mouth ultrasonic debridement approach (FMUD) is comparable to that of traditional section-wise scaling and root planing (SRP). A hypothesis for the current effectiveness study is that comparable clinical effects will be obtained with the FMUD approach as with conventional section-wise SRP, but with significantly more favourable patient-centred and health-economic outcomes. This randomized study involves about 100 professionals (dental hygienists) and more than 1000 patients at 45 dental clinics in the Vastra Gotaland Region, Sweden. The project not only evaluate treatment effects in terms of pertinent clinical outcomes, it also has a strong focus on patient-centered measures - patient-reported experience measures (PREM) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) - as well as health-economics.</brief_summary>
