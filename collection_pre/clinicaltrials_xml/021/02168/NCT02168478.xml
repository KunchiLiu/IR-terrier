	<brief_summary>A 48 hour patch test performed in healthy volunteers to determine the presensitization (pre-existing allergy) of Neo-Synalar (neomycin sulfate 0.5%(0.35% neomycin base), fluocinolone acetonide 0.025%) Cream . Subjects also receive a positive control (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) and a negative control (Saline).
