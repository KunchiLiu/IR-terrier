	<brief_summary>This study has two main goals : - to develop the cortcial excitbality (CE) measurement methodology using coupling between transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and physiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), - to automatize these measurements using robotized TMS. Assessing CE is a preliminary and crucial step in any TMS protocol, in either fundamental or clinical research. It is an important indicator which determine the stimulation power applied on the cortical target during the TMS experiment, or during the rTMS cure (patients). CE is in general measured on the motor cortex using EMG activity as the main indicator of the system's response, whatever the real cortical target is located. The present study thus propose to generalize this measurement on other cortical areas in link with the actual targets, and using other external recordings such as EEG. Moreover, as neuronavigation systems significantly improved TMS precision in the past years, CE measurements could significantly gain to become fully automatized using robotized TMS.</brief_summary>
