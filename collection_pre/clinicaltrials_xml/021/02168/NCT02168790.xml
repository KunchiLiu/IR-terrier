	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed at developing a technique to apply amniotic membrane to a diseased ocular surface without surgical intervention (sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation). This system needs to be concordant with laws and guidelines for the use of medical and pharmaceutical products.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of a Sutureless Amniotic Membran Transplantation to Treat Ocular Surface Disorders (Expanded Access)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A ring system (AmnioClip) was developed for mounting an amniotic membrane (AM) that can be applied like a large contact lens. AM is mounted between the two rings with a special designed, accessory mounting device. The safety of the ring system AmnioClip was tested in an interventional including 7 patients with ocular surface disorders and need for AM transplantation (1, 2, 3). About similar systems was reported (3, 4).</detailed_description>
