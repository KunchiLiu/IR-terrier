	<brief_summary>Phase I: Determine the maximum tolerated dose of combination of Regorafenib with Refamentinib through a dose escalation study, all tumor types that meet certain inclusion/exclusion criteria can be entered. After the recommended dose is determined, the Phase II portion of the study will evaluate tolerability and efficacy of the combination treatment in patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, or colorectal cancer, respectively.</brief_summary>
