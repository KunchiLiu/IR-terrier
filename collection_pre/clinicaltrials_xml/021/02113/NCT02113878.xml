	<brief_title>Phase Ib Study of BKM120 With Cisplatin and XRT in High Risk Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Cancer of Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This phase Ib study is combining standard chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and BKM120 to assess tolerability of this combination in high risk patients with locally advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). The investigators will also obtain preliminary information about the efficacy of this treatment. - The participant will receive the study drug buparlisib once daily, by mouth, for 45 days. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each cycle. It will include special instructions for taking the study drug at home. - The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before and how well they have tolerated their doses. - All participants will receive weekly cisplatin injection. Cisplatin will be given intra-venously (IV) on days: (1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43) at DFCI. - All participants will receive daily radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for 7 weeks, delivered at DFCI. IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. - The investigators would like to keep track of the participant's medical condition. Follow-up will continue every 4 to 12 weeks after the end of treatment for the first year and at the investigator's discretion thereafter.</detailed_description>
