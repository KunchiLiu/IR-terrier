	<brief_summary>The Age Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the first cause of blindness in industrialized countries. The macular pigment (lutein and zeaxanthin) could play an important role in the arisen of the AMD. The food supplementation by corn with strong concentration in macular pigment could increase the density of the macular pigment. This could, in the future, represent a strategy of prevention of the AMD. The main objective of this study is to detect an increase of the macular pigment density after the consumption of this corn at healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Macular Pigment by the Consumption of Corn With Strong Content in Zeaxanthine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The age macular degeneration represents the first cause of blindness in industrialized countries if it is not treated. In France, the AMD affects 600 000 persons and this figure should continue to increase, notably because of the increase of the life expectancy. The macula is responsible of the fine vision, the vision of colours and the perception of contrasts. The macular pigment is present only at the level of the macular area. This pigment is composed of three carotenoids: lutein, zeaxanthin, meso-zeaxanthin. The first two compounds are of strictly food origin and are not produced in an endogenous way. A change of the macular pigment density and/or the quality of the macular pigment is suspected to play a role in the appearance and the evolution of the AMD. The food supplementation by corn with strong concentration in macular pigment could increase the density of the macular pigment. This could, in the future, represent a strategy of prevention of the AMD. The main objective of this study is to detect an increase of the macular pigment density after the consumption of this corn at healthy volunteers. The treatment will consist in a daily consumption of a box of 125g of corn with strong zeaxanthin content during 10 weeks. This corresponds to a daily contribution of at least 1,2 mg of lutein and 2,2 mg de zeaxanthin. After the inclusion visit, the subject will be seen 5 times (after 3, 6, 8, 10, 14 weeks of treatment). In all these visits, measures of the macular pigment will be realized. A blood sample will be realized at the inclusion visit and during the visit at 6 and 10 weeks.</detailed_description>
