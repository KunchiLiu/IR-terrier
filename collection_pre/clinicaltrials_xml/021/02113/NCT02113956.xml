	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether Guy2Guy (G2G), a text messaging-based healthy sexuality and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention program intervention for 14-18 year gay, bisexual and queer men, is associated with HIV preventive behavior (e.g., condom use) compared to an attention-matched control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Harnessing the Power of Text Messaging to Invigorate AMSM HIV Preventive Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. They account for almost 70% of HIV diagnoses among all young people and are the only risk group with an increasing number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, current HIV prevention programs focus primarily on adults and heterosexual youth. As such, there is an urgent need for evidence-based HIV prevention programs targeting AMSM. Because issues affecting sexual health decisions among AMSM are unique, intervention programs cannot be translated from heterosexually focused interventions. Instead, they need to be designed from the ground up to ensure appropriately tailored content that resonates with the target population. Evidence-based HIV prevention programs targeting AMSM are urgently needed. The Guy2Guy (G2G) intervention is a text messaging-based HIV prevention program designed for the specific needs of adolescent males who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or queer (GBQ) and are between the ages of 14-18 years. The intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial against an attention-matched control group which receives text messages about healthy lifestyle (e.g., exercise, nutrition). A total of 300 GBQ adolescent males will be into the study using an online recruitment strategy. The study is being conducted by researchers at the Center for Innovative Public Health Research and Northwestern University. The primary efficacy outcome measures are unprotected sex acts and abstinence at 3-months follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that those in the G2G intervention will be significantly more likely to be engage in HIV preventive behavior (e.g., use condoms when having vaginal/anal sex) at 3-months follow-up compared to the attention-matched control group. Secondary efficacy outcomes include unprotected sex acts and abstinence at 3-month follow-up by sexual experience groups (i.e., ever had sex versus never had sex at baseline), HIV testing rates, and unprotected sex acts and abstinence at intervention end (5 weeks post enrollment) for those in the intervention versus control groups; and for participants who were sexually experienced and inexperienced at baseline, separately. If effective, G2G has promise to be quickly and cost-effectively implemented to scale to help to curb the spread of HIV infection among AMSM long into adulthood.</detailed_description>
