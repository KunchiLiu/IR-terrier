	<brief_summary>In this prospective, randomized, clinical trial, we have investigated the effects of ketamine-based and remifentanil-based anesthetic protocol on perioperative serum cystatin-c levels, and creatinine and/or cystatin-c based eGFR equations in terms of acute kidney injury in CABG surgery.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital and all patients were informed and gave written consent. Patients scheduled for elective CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomly allocated to anesthesia with remifentanil-propofol-midazolam (RPM) group or ketamine-propofol-midazolam (KPM) group. Blood samples were obtained before induction of anesthesia (baseline), at the end of the operation, and postoperative days 1, 2, and 4.</brief_summary>
