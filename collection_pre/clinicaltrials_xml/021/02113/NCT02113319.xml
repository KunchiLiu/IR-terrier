	<brief_summary>In patients with Core Binding Factors Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, the level of Minimal Residual Disease after chemotherapy is predictive of relapse. The relapse risk is also increased in case of mutations of receptors tyrosine kinase. For patients with a high Minimal Residual Disease level at the end of consolidation or in molecular relapse, maintenance by the inhibitor dasatinib is proposed.</brief_summary>
