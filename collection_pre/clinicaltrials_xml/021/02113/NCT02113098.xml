	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the add load on non-paretic lower limb of individuals that suffer a stroke, while walking on a treadmill, is effective for restore gait symmetry of these individuals, in a subacute phase of stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Treadmill Gait Training With Loading in Individuals With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized and blinded clinical trial, in which participants are being randomly divided into experimental group and control group, in order to verify the effects of adding load on gait symmetry after stroke. 40 individuals will participate, and the calculation of sample size was performed from the ratio variable symmetry of swing time, based on previous study. Whereas about 15% of individuals could give up to participate in the study during their course (dropout rate), we determined a number of 20 participants in each group.</detailed_description>
