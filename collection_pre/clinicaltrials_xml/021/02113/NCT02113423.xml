	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of the study is to address the efficacy and toxicity profile of aforementioned four modalities for rT1-2 NPC. Characters of the patients: - list item one: 168 patients, median age 48 years (range 16-75 years） proven rT1-2 NPC were diagnosed - list item two: Treated with four different irradiation modalities(3D-CRT,IMRT, BT , BT Combined 3D-CRT or IMRT). - list item three: Median time to recurrence was 30 months (range 1-180months). The median follow-up time was 28 months (range, 4-135 months).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: Recurrent T1-2 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (rT1-2) may be salvaged by 3D - CRT（3D-Conformal Radiotherapy）, IMRT（ Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy）, Brachytherapy (BT), BT combined 3D - CRT or IMRT . The aim of this study is to address the efficacy and toxicity profile of aforementioned four modalities for rT1-2 NPC. Methods and Materials: 168 patients, median age 48 years (range 16-75 years） proven rT1-2 NPC were diagnosed and treated with four different irradiation modalities(3D-CRT,IMRT, BT , BT Combined 3D-CRT or IMRT) . Median time to recurrence was 30 months (range 1-180months). The median follow-up time was 28 months (range, 4-135 months).</detailed_description>
