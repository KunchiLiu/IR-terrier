	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to establish a clinical score panel based on clinical, molecular and genetic parameters that allow us to stratify and obtain an early detection of patients with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Score System for Prediction Risk and Early Diagnosis of HCC in HIV/HCV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transversal study design like a "proof of concept". Primary objective: The main objective is try to stablish a descriptive panel (first phase of a score system) based in the conjunction or sum of several clinical and laboratory parameters (molecular and genetic factors). The aim is to detect in a fast, early and successful way those patients that presents a high risk to develop an hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the future in a specific population: HIV and HCV coinfected patients. The establishment of this panel will allow clinicians set up a correct treatment decreasing the probability of liver cirrhosis and HCC.</detailed_description>
