	<brief_summary>Background To evaluate clinical results, insulin resistance and inflammatory response to trauma in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Sleeve gastrectomy who received either traditional preoperative care or treatment following the ACERTO protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation, Organic Response in Obesity Patients Subjected to Vertical Videolaparoscopy Gastroplasty With or Without Perioperative Cares Recommended by the Acerto Project. Randomized Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods The population of the study consisted of morbidly obese patients, who were operated on with the Sleeve procedure, from Cuiaba, MT, between April and October 2012. We studied the inflammatory response and insulin resistance by measuring levels of glucose, insulin, Homa IR, reactive C protein, albumin, pre-albumin, alpha 1 acid glicoprotein, interleukin 6 and glycosylated hemoglobin. We also studied hydration, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, and length of hospital stay.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We included patients who are between 18 and 45 years of age, from both sexes, with an initial BMI (Body Mass Index) which is equal to or greater than 40 kg/m2, candidates for the sleeve surgery procedure through laparoscopy. We excluded the patients who didn't follow the fasting protocol and also those whose laboratory exams were lost.</criteria>
