	<brief_summary>The aim of Prevent CardioKids is to evaluate to what extend disturbed vascular function markers are already present in children of different weight categories and whether these are age dependent. Also differences - and relationships - between vascular function measurements and plasma biomarkers between lean and overweight/obese children will be compared.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of Prevent CardioKids is to evaluate to what extend disturbed vascular function markers are already present in children of different weight categories and whether these are age dependent. Also differences - and relationships - between vascular function measurements and plasma biomarkers between lean and overweight/obese children will be compared.The primary endpoint is to examine the difference in micro- and macro-vasculature characteristics in children with different weight classifications (lean; overweight; obese; extreme obese; morbid obese). Secondary endpoints are differences in lipoprotein profiles, pro-inflammatory and oral glucose tolerance profiles between different age groups, between lean and overweight/obese children and in relation with the measured micro- and macro-vasculature characteristics</detailed_description>
