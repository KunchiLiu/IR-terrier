	<brief_summary>Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer of High Grade stage T1 (HGT1), has up to 20% risk of progression to invasive disease. Because the depth of substaging seems to identify two separate groups with different progression risk (HighGradeT1a and HighGradeT1b), we design a differential treatment strategy for each group. The main hypothesis is that HighGradeT1a bladder cancer can spare a second endoscopic procedure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Only cases of initial diagnosis of HighGradeT1 and with a complete transurethral endoscopic resection (TUR) of bladder tumor) can enter this protocol. HighGradeT1a will only receive standard BCG treatment (induction and maintenance). HighGradeT1b will undergo a second transurethral endoscopic resection (TUR) after the induction of Bacillus de Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and then continue mantenaince BCG and standard follow-up.</detailed_description>
