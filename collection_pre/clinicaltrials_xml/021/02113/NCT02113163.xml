	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to contrast the pharmacokinetic profiles of metformin and EPA delivered separately as co-administered products (metformin hydrochloride or Glucophage and icosapent ethyl or Vascepa) and together as the solid dose form (metformin eicosapentaenoate or TP-101) under fasted and fed conditions. A secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and repeat single doses of TP-101.</brief_summary>
