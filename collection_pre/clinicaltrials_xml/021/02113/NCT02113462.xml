	<brief_summary>The Triglycerides (TG) to High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio is a feature of insulin resistance and an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. The investigators aimed to evaluate the relationship between TG/HDL-C ratio and the endothelial functions in patients with CKD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triglyceride/High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is substantially increased in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD).The reasons for the elevated risk of CVD in patients with CKD are not fully elucidated. There is not a good prognostic tool for the prediction of increased cardiovascular risk in CKD. A simple, widely available, relatively inexpensive, and generally reproducible marker to predict the CVD risk in subjects with CKD is needed. The Triglycerides (TG) to High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio is a feature of insulin resistance and an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. No study has been performed so far, to evaluate the role of TG/HDL ratio to predict the CVD risk in patients with CKD. This study is designed to evaluate the relationship between TG/HDL-C ratio and the endothelial functions in patients with CKD.</detailed_description>
