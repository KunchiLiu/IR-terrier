	<brief_summary>Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare subset of STS (&lt;1%) harbors t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation and produces resultant ASPL-TFE3 fusion protein. Due to its nature of high expression of angiogenic factors, sunitinib and cediranib produced overall response rates of 55% and 43%, respectively. However, the efficacy of pazopanib is unknown in metastatic ASPS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib for Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pazopanib, a multi-targeted anti-angiogenesis inhibitor significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) after failure to anthracycline-based regimen (pazopanib vs placebo, 4.6 vs 1.6 months, HR=0.31, 95% CI 0.24-0.40; P &lt; .0001). Regarding sunitinib (continuous daily dose of 37.5mg), after a median duration of 10 months, median OS and PFS were 19 months and 17 months, respectively in a small retrospective study (ASPS, N=9). With regard to cediranib, 6-month PFS was over 60%. In addition, randomized phase II trial of sunitinib vs cediranib with cross-over at disease progression was recently initiated (NCT01391962). However, the efficacy of pazopanib is unknown in metastatic ASPS.</detailed_description>
