	<brief_summary>Turner Syndrome is a common genetic disorder. Seventy percent of adults with Turner Syndrome have abnormalities in glucose metabolism which can lead to diabetes. The current screening guidelines for diabetes in Turner Syndrome are not specific and involve a fasting blood sugar once a year. The objective of this study is to determine if there are abnormalities in glucose metabolism and pancreatic function in young girls with Turner Syndrome. The study hypothesis is that pancreatic dysfunction (specifically of the beta cells that make insulin) is more prevalent in girls with Turner Syndrome compared to healthy controls.</brief_summary>
