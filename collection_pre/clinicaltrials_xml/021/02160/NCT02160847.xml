	<brief_title>Development of the DRIVE Curriculum to Address Childhood Obesity Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DRIVE program (Developing Relationships that Include Values of Eating and Exercise) is a home-based parent training program with 15 sessions focused on improve family nutrition and physical activity and promoting positive parent-child interactions. The aim of this study is to pilot-test the development of a childhood obesity program that includes parenting and health information. Participants in this study will be recruited through community organizations based upon their obesity health risk. Only families whose children's BMI percentile is greater than or equal to 75 will be eligible to participate in this study These participants will be randomly assigned to either the control group, in which participants will receive health information via mail only, or the experimental group that will participate in 15 DRIVE sessions focusing on parent-child interactions, health and nutrition, and physical activity. Both groups will complete a baseline assessment, mid-point assessment, and post assessment in their home, which will measure parent and child height, weight, and waist circumference; parent attitudes towards health and nutrition; and parent and child food consumption and physical activity levels. Results from this study will provide information regarding the feasibility of implementing the DRIVE curriculum as well as its impact on parent and child body mass indexes, and parents' knowledge, and attitudes related to nutrition.</detailed_description>
