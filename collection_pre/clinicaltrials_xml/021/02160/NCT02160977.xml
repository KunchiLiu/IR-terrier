	<brief_summary>If the proprioception of the affected knee post total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can recover earlier, it will accelerate the regaining of motion control ability and motion control accuracy of the TKA patients. This study compared the proprioception difference of the post operation knees between the MIS-QS TKA group and the MIS TKA group.The differences of proprioception recovery were analyzed following the two different TKA procedures and the advantages of MIS-QS TKA in the recovery of knee. proprioception were discussed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proprioception of the Knee Post MIS TKA and MIS-QS TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were scheduled prospectively to undergo total knee arthroplasties were randomly assigned to receive either a MIS-QS TKA or a MIS TKA. Proprioception of the knee position sense was assessed by the knee angle reproduction test (10~20 degree, 30~40 degree, 80~90 degree of the knee flexion) prior operation, and 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post operation. Paired two-tailed t tests with a level of significance of p &lt; 0.05 were used to assess the effect of the different arthroplasty procedure on the postoperative knee joint proprioception for all subjects.</detailed_description>
