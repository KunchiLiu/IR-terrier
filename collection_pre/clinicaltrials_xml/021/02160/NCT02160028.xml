	<brief_summary>Information about the effectiveness of treatment has been found to reduce pain, termed placebo analgesia. In this study it will be investigated whether this finding translates to the dental clinic. It will be investigated whether information that suggested that minimal pain will be experienced during filling therapy, can reduce the pain associated with that procedure compared to a group that receives standard information. All patients will receive the same amount of anesthesia and similar procedures during filling therapy. It is predicted that extended information should reduce pain, and that the reduction in pain should be associated with a reduction in stress.</brief_summary>
