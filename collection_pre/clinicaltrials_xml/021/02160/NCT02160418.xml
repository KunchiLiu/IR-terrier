	<brief_summary>In this randomized controlled study, the investigators compare two classes of behavioral approaches to change habits and health outcomes with an application to dental health: cognitive vs. behavioral financial incentives. Under cognitive incentives subjects are paid to correctly answer health-related quizzes. Under behavioral incentives subjects earn money for making healthy choices. The investigators apply these incentives to toothbrushing, a daily health-related behavior critical to the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease, two high-burden conditions among US adults.</brief_summary>
