	<brief_summary>The objective of this proposal is to evaluate whether weaning from an incubator to a crib at lower versus higher weight, 1600g or 1800g will result in shorter length of hospital stay among moderately preterm infants. The hypothesis of this study is that length of hospital stay (from birth to discharge) will be decreased among moderate preterm infants weaned from an incubator to an open crib at a lower versus higher weight, 1600g vs. 1800g.</brief_summary>
