	<brief_summary>Since 2003, that the first retrievable IVC filter was introduced in the U.S,improvements have been made in the filter design to resolve problems of structural integrity and increase the ability to remove the filter after longer periods of time.The FDA issued a communication in August 2010 advising physicians to remove retrievable filters whenever possible and updated that letter again in May 2014 due to concerns that these retrievable IVC filters, intended for short-term placement, are not always removed once a patient's risk for PE subsides. Known long term risks associated with IVC filters include but are not limited to lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT), filter fracture, filter migration, filter embolization and IVC perforation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using a Novel Algorithm to Improve the Retrieval Rate of Inferior Vena Cava Filters (iRetrieve Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that approximately 80% to 85% of optional IVC filters are never retrieved. The successful removal of retrievable filters requires diligent patient follow-up and interdepartmental cooperation, and even so, successful removal is not always possible. American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for IVCF placement indications advocates a close, structured follow-up of retrievable IVCFs to improve filter retrieval rates. Using a retrieval algorithm and pathway program, a score will trigger a secure email and text messages sent to both physician and patient at different timelines, for follow up so as to retrieve filter placed.</detailed_description>
