	<brief_title>Dose-Response Profile of A-101 in Subjects With Seborrheic Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of two concentrations of A-101solution when applied to individual seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions (target lesions) compared with a matching A-101 Solution Vehicle. Each subject will have 4 target lesions on the trunk/extremities. A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two concentrations of A-101 solution and its matching vehicle when applied to SK target lesions on the trunk/extremities.</detailed_description>

Subject has any current skin disease (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, sun damage, etc.), or condition (e.g., sunburn, excessive hair, open wounds) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might put the subject at undue risk by study participation or interfere with the study conduct or evaluations 10. Subject has participated in an investigational drug trial in which administration of an investigational study medication occurred within 30 days prior to Visit 1.</criteria>
