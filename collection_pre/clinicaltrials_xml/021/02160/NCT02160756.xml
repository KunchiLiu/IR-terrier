	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK - the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) and relative bioavailability (the extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-56021927, when administered as 3 tablet formulations (test) compared with JNJ-54781532 softgel capsule formulation (reference) in healthy male participants under fasted conditions at a single dose of 240 milligram (mg).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioavailability Study of 3 Tablet Formulations vs. Capsule Formulation of JNJ-56021927 in Fasting Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center, 4-treatment, parallel design (a medical research study comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different interventions) study of a single dose of 240 mg JNJ-56021927. The duration of study will be approximately of 78 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening phase (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment phase (consists of 4 parallel single-dose treatments); and End-of-Study (completion of the Hour 1344 PK sampling on Day 57, or upon early withdrawal). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 possible treatments: Treatment A (240 mg dose as softgel capsule); Treatment B (240 mg dose as Tablet Formulation 1); Treatment C (240 mg dose as Tablet Formulation 2); or Treatment D (240 mg dose as Tablet Formulation 3). Participants will fast overnight from food and fluids (excluding non-carbonated water) for at least 10 hours before study drug administration on Day 1. Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and over 1,344 hours (Day 57) after dosing for the determination of JNJ-56021927 concentration and its active metabolite. Relative bioavailability of 3 tablet formulations as compared to the softgel capsule formulation of JNJ-56021927 will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
