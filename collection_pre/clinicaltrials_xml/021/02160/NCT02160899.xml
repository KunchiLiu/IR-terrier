	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ISIS-APO(a)Rx in Patients With High Lipoprotein(a)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetic variant of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in which the apolipoprotein B (apoB) -100 component of LDL is linked by a disulfide bond to apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], the distinct protein component of Lp(a) that is mainly responsible for its signature structural and functional properties. Lp(a) is now recognized as an important genetic risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke and aortic stenosis. The purpose of this study is to determine if ISIS-APO(a)Rx can reduce the production of apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a). This study will enroll 50 patients with Lipoprotein(a) ≥50 and &lt;175 mg/dL and 10 patients with Lipoprotein(a) ≥175 mg/dL.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Males or females aged 1865 inclusive Females must be nonpregnant and nonlactating, and either surgically sterile (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory involved) Males must be surgically sterile, abstinent or if engaged in sexual relations with a female of childbearing potential, the patient must be using an acceptable contraceptive method from the time of signing the informed consent form until at least 16 weeks after the last dose of Study Drug BMI ≤40 kg/m2 Lipoprotein(a) ≥50 and &lt;175 mg/dL at time of screening (Cohort A) Lipoprotein(a) ≥175 mg/dL at time of screening (Cohort B) Clinically significant abnormalities in medical history (e.g., documented previous myocardial infarction, PCI, or major surgery within 3 months of screening, planned surgery that would occur during the study) or physical examination at screening Clinically significant abnormalities in screening laboratory values that would render a patient unsuitable for inclusion Active infection requiring systemic antiviral or antimicrobial therapy that will not be completed prior to Study Day 1 Known history or positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C, or chronic hepatitis B Malignancy within 5 years, except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Recent history of, or current drug or alcohol abuse Patients with Lp(a) ≥50 and &lt;175 mg/dL may not receive concomitant niacin therapy during the period 8 weeks prior to screening through the end of the PostTreatment Evaluation Period Use of statins, ezetimibe or fibrates unless on a stable regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to dosing and will remain on a stable regimen for the duration of the study Use of lipid or Lp(a)specific apheresis within 4 weeks prior to Screening through the end of the PostTreatment Evaluation Period Use of concomitant drugs (including herbal or OTC medications other than ibuprofen, Benadryl or topical steroids) unless authorized by the Sponsor Medical Monitor Blood donation of 50499 mL within 30 days of screening or of &gt;499 mL within 8 weeks of screening Have any other conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for inclusion, or could interfere with the patient participating in or completing the study</criteria>
