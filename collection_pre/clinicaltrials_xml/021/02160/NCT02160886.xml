	<brief_summary>A randomized trial investigating if effects of a goal-directed task oriented intervention is influenced by who takes the decision and establishes the goal (the child or the parent) and whether establishing a goal per se influence performance and goal-achievement. The main hypothesis are that children's participation in the goal-setting process would positively influence goal achievement, children's self-identified goals would be achievable and that both groups would achieve goals that were the target of a goal-directed intervention.</brief_summary>
