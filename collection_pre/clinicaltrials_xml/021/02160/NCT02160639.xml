	<brief_summary>Improving diabetes social support is associated with health improvement benefits. This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of telephone-based diabetes self-management support (DSMS) compared with usual care, which includes diabetes self-management education (DSME), during a 1-year period. It will determine whether this specific model for providing on-going support to people with diabetes will better enable them to maintain the engagement in self-care behaviors, clinical improvements and diabetes-specific knowledge gained during the course of diabetes self-management education.</brief_summary>
