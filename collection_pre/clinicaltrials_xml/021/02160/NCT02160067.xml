	<brief_title>A Dose Proportionality and Bioavailability Assessment of Buprenorphine Transdermal Delivery System Second Generation Patches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to examine a new 2nd generation BTDS patch formulation at 2 strengths: 3.15 mg and 12.6 mg, compared to 1st generation patches at 2 strengths: 5 mg and 20 mg, to assess dose proportionality and relative bioavailability before proceeding to a definitive program of studies. Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 288 hours post-patch application.</detailed_description>
