	<brief_summary>The objectives of this multi-center collaborative study are to ascertain the frequency of specific copy number variants (CNVs) identified prenatally and to evaluate in detail through continued follow-up of the children the phenotypes associated with CNVs of known or uncertain clinical significance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prenatal Microarray Follow-Up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically the aims are as follows: 1. Determine the intellectual function of the children at age 3 years 2. Determine phenotypic characteristics other than intellectual function of the children at age 3 years 3. Determine the frequency of specific copy number variants discovered during routine prenatal diagnostic testing 4. Evaluate the educational, counseling and psychosocial implications of microarray testing as it is introduced as a standard prenatal diagnostic procedure.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria for Enrollment into the 3 year Followup Cohort Inclusion Criteria 1. Singleton or multifetal pregnancy with a prenatal invasive procedure resulting in a diagnosis by microarray analysis of a microdeletion/duplication less than 10 Mbs, either pathogenic or of uncertain significance, which is reported to the patient. This includes: Infants diagnosed during prenatal diagnostic studies performed at the10 prespecified prenatal diagnostic centers Infants diagnosed by analysis of microarrays performed at the collaborating laboratories Infants referred through the Prenatal Microarray Resource Center website Children less than 3 years of age who had a prenatally detected CNV &lt;10 Mbs, either pathogenic or of uncertain significance OR 2. Children whose mothers were enrolled in the initial study (through July 2011) and who met inclusion criteria for followup in that phase, referred to as the "Index cohort". This includes: CNVs of uncertain or known significance, some of which were not reported to the patient Mosaic findings by karyotype and/or microarray alone. Exclusion Criteria 1. Patient refusal to allow infant followup through the age of three 2. Patient not fluent in the English language 3. Patient under the age of 18 4. In surrogate pregnancies, the "rearing parents" are unavailable to give consent.</criteria>
