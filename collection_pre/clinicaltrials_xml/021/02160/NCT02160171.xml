	<brief_summary>A Multicentre Clinical Evaluation of a Decision Support Algorithm for Neonatal Seizure Detection: ANSeR</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ANSeR- The Algorithm for Neonatal Seizure Recognition Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre study. It will be based on routine clinical practice but will also allow for the off-line retrospective application of ANSeR to a well-defined clinical population in order to establish the potential diagnostic utility of the algorithm.</detailed_description>
