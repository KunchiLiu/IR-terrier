	<brief_summary>Greater time spent in sedentary behaviors, independent of physical activity level, can increase risk of morbidity and mortality. Objective assessments indicate that bariatric surgery patients spend large amounts of time in sedentary behaviors. The present study is the first to test whether a mobile health (mHealth) approach that employs widely adopted smartphone technology to monitor and modify sedentary behaviors as they occur is a feasible and acceptable method of reducing sedentary time in these patients and other obese populations.</brief_summary>
