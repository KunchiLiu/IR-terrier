	<detailed_description>This is a cluster randomised trial set in rural Ethiopia with kebeles (villages) as the unit of randomisation. 54 kebeles will be included. 27 will be randomly allocated to the intervention arm (Facility based care (FBC) + Community-based Rehabilitation (CBR)) and 27 randomly allocated to the control arm (FBC alone). The aim is to determine whether CBR + FBC is superior to FBC alone in reducing disability related to schizophrenia, measured by the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule version 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
