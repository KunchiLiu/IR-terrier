	<brief_summary>This is a cross-sectional study enrolling - 11 weight-stable, formerly obese female patients 1-5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass (RYGB) - 11 age- and weight-matched female subjects - 10 normal weight (Body Mass Index 19-25 kg/m2) subjects The following measurements will be performed in each participants in basal conditions (after an overnight fast) and after ingestion of a standard meal - electroencephalographic recordings of visually evoked potential after presentation of food- or non-food pictures - plasma concentration of metabolites (glucose, fatty acids), glucoregulatory hormones (insulin, glucagon), gastro-intestinal hormones (Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP), Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP1), ghrelin,Cholecystokinin (CCK), and bile acids Aims of this observational study are - to evaluate the effects of RYGB on brain perception of food related visual stimulation - to search for relationships between RYGB effects on brain responses and gastro-intestinal hormone secretion</brief_summary>
