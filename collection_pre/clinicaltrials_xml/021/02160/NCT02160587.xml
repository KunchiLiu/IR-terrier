	<brief_summary>This is a safety study to determine the skin sensitization potential of ZuraPrep™ and ZuraPrep™ without isopropyl alcohol (IPA) after repetitive patch applications to skin of human subjects. Indications of both sensitization and skin irritation will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study to Evaluate the Contact Sensitizing Potential of Topically Applied ZuraPrep™ and ZuraPrep™ Without IPA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to determine if the test product, ZuraPrep™ is a skin sensitizing agent when applied to human skin. The study, a modified Draize skin sensitization evaluation, will be conducted in three discrete phases: 1) induction, 2) rest, and 3) challenge. During the Induction Phase, skin sites are exposed to the test product repeatedly for 21 consecutive days. The Rest Phase, a 14-day period when no treatment is performed, serves to provide adequate time for the immune system to react to ZuraPrep™, given any of its components serve as antigens. During the Challenge Phase, the subjects' skin is re-exposed to the test product (ZuraPrep™) to determine if it is likely to be immunosensitizing.</detailed_description>
