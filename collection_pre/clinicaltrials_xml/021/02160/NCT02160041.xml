	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except with a primary diagnosis of Urothelial cell carcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, Endometrial cancer, and Glioblastoma multiforme) or hematologic malignancies and is in need of treatment because of progression or relapse. Patient's tumor has been evaluated and preidentified as having a tumor with a FGFR genetic alteration. The qualifying alteration must be assessed and reported by a CLIAcertified laboratory. Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and /or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated to result in a durable remission. Patient must have progressive and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. or other appropriate hematological response criteria. Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 Patient has received prior treatment with BGJ398 Patients with Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Patient has received chemotherapy or other anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycinC) prior to starting study drug. Patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis Patients with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases History and/or current evidence of extensive tissue calcification Use of medications that increase serum levels of phosphorus and/or calcium Current evidence of corneal or retinal disorder/keratopathy History and/or current evidence of renal or endocrine alterations of calcium/phosphate homeostasis Patients with another primary malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study treatment, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or other nonmelanomatous skin cancer, or insitu carcinoma of the uterine cervix</criteria>
