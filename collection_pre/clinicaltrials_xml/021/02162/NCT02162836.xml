	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-56021927 in Japanese participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC- prostate cancer that is resistant to medical [for example. hormonal] or surgical treatments).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of JNJ-56021927 in Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label (participants will know the identity of study drug received) study in participants with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). The study consists of 4 parts: Screening (28 days before study commences on Day 1), pharmacokinetic week (PK), Continuous daily dosing, Extension and Safety follow-up period. In PK week participants will receive a single oral capsule of JNJ-56021927 at a dose of 240 milligram (mg) on Day 1 and will be monitored for 1 week. After Week 1, in continuous daily dosing period, participants will receive continuous daily therapy at the same dose for 4 weeks (Cycle 1). After Cycle 1 participants, who will not meet the criteria for discontinuation listed such as progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, will continue in safety follow-up period and will receive continuous daily therapy at the same dose up to cycle 13. Primarily dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features, with metastatic disease Castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) demonstrated during continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)/post orchiectomy Maintain castrate levels of testosterone (less than [&lt;] 50 nanogram per deciliter (ng/dL) [1.72 nanomol per liter {nmol/L}]) within 4 weeks before enrollment Prostatespecific antigen (PSA) evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA level of at least greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) within 2 weeks before enrollment which has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 1 week apart. If the confirmatory PSA value is less than the last PSA value, then an additional test for rising PSA will be required to document progression Participants who received a first generation antiandrogen [for example, bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide (not approved in Japan)] as part of an initial combined androgen blockade therapy or as secondline hormonal therapy must show continuing disease progression off the antiandrogen for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug History of, or current metastases in the brain or untreated spinal cord compression Participants with progressive epidural disease Participants has a history of another malignancy within 5 years before screening Prior treatment with second generation antiandrogens ( for example, enzalutamide) or Cytochrome P450 17 (CYP 17) inhibitors [for example, abiraterone acetate, orteronel, galeterone, systemic ketoconazole (not approved in Japan, respectively)] Participants had used radiopharmaceutical agents (for example, Strontium89) or investigational immunotherapy (for example, sipuleucelT) within 12 weeks before the first dose of study drug</criteria>
