	<brief_summary>Current medication treatments for KOA aim to relieve inflammation and pain, but they do little to delay or reverse the disease progression and most medications have obvious side effects. When the conservative treatments are useless to patients and joint deformities and joint disfunction, the patients may require surgery. Although surgery of the joints can relieve the pain temporarily, long-term effect (over 10 years) is hard to achieve.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Autologous Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells (MPCs) Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (haMPCs) are obtained through a series of procedures: firstly, the fresh adipose tissue is digested with collagenase, filtered, centrifuged and then discard mature adipose cells to obtain adipose tissue-derived nuclear cells also called stromal vascular fraction cells (SVFs). In the end, haMPCs are prepared after being purified andamplified to P2-P5. When induced by specific factors, haMPCs have a potential for multilineage differentiation towards bone, cartilage and fat tissue both in vivo and in vitro. The haMPCs can secrete a number of soluble mediators to stimulate the proliferation of endogenous progenitor cells, to act as nutrients, to be immunosuppressive, to be anti-inflammatory, to prevent fibrosis and promote angiogenesis. The cytokines secreted by haMPCs play a synergic role in restoring the dynamic balance of synthesis and decompositon of cartilage tissue, and finally to repair the impaired cartilage.</detailed_description>
