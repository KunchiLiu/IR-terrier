	<brief_title>The Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Airway Complications After Deep or Awake Extubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial. 336 pediatric patients presenting to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) for adenotonsillectomy who are eligible for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited. A Clinical Pharmacy specialist, will be in charge of preparing the dexmedetomidine and placebo doses and will randomize the patients to four equally numbered groups. The anesthesiologist will receive the assignment for the extubation method in a sealed envelope from the Clinical Pharmacy specialist. Multiple parameters will be recorded in perioperative period to quantify perioperative adverse respiratory events.</detailed_description>
