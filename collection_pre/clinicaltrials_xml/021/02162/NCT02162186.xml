	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the radiographs (x-rays) of 100 patients with a TriFIT total hip at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly following surgery to see if there has been any movement or wear in the hip stem over the course of the study. The study will also record clinical data on each patient using various functional tests and questionnaires at the same intervals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes of the Corin Tri-Fit Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study will prospectively recruit 100 patients scheduled for elective total hip replacement with Corin's TriFIT Hip System at the Ottawa Hospital - General Campus. As part of their clinical care, patients routinely undergo a clinical examination and have had radiographs taken at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly following surgery. Using specialized software, radiographs from each interval will be examined to assess femoral stem migration and joint wear patterns. Femoral stem migration will be assessed using computer-assisted software. The study will also assess the rate of implant failure during the first two post-operative years. Clinical assessments and questionnaires will also be completed during each of the follow-up intervals.</detailed_description>
