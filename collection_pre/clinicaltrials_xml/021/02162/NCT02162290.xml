	<brief_summary>The research will study the differences between interval training and continuous training among cardiac patients in a cardiac rehabilitation facility. The main objectives are: 1. Functional capacity measures (VO2 max). 2. Cardiac risk factors 3. Quality of life assessments. Study hypothesis: Interval training will be more effective in improving functional capacity, cardiac risk factors and quality of life, compared to continuous training.</brief_summary>
