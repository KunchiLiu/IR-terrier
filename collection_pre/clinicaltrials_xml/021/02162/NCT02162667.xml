	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether CT-P6 and Herceptin are equivalent in patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our hypothesis is that the pathologic complete response rate will be equivalent in patients treated with neoadjuvant CT-P6 or Herceptin. Patients will receive 8 cycles of neoadjuvant systemic therapy and up to 10 cycles of therapy in the adjuvant setting.</brief_summary>
