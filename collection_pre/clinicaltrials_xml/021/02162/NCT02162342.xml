	<brief_summary>The subjet is sitting on a chair and in front of him an adjustable (height) table with a glass of water. 17 passive reflective markers are placed on his upper extremities and torso. The subject is requested to reach the glass (once with the right hand and then with the left hand) and bring it to the mouth and drink. Then the subject put the glass back at the starting position. This is performed twice for each hand. In the second part, the same trial is repeated but muscle activity is recorded with surface electromyography.</brief_summary>
