	<brief_summary>The study is a multicenter randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase II trial aiming to demonstrate an improvement of median PFS when treating locally advanced unresectable or metastatic patients suffering from an intra-hepatic or hilum (mass-forming) cholangiocarcinoma with Regorafenib as compared to placebo, and after progression after GEM-CDDP (or GEM-OX), or gemcitabine alone followed or preceded by platinum (CDDP or oxaliplatin)-based chemotherapy. The principal objective is to investigate Regorafenib efficacy by prospectively evaluating the PFS after the administration of Regorafenib combined with BSC as compared to placebo with BSC. Hypothesis is a 50% improvement in median PFS (from 6 weeks to 12 weeks in Regorafenib group).</brief_summary>
