	<brief_summary>Propeller Health is collaborating with Walgreens Pharmacies, the City of Louisville, Qualcomm Life and other local partners to carry out a focused demonstration project that will evaluate the effectiveness of the Propeller Health approach to asthma management while exploring means to use real-time data on asthma exacerbations in a public health setting. The Asthma Data Innovation Demonstration Project (ADID) will use wireless sensor technology to develop spatial and temporal data on the use of rescue inhalers by 300 study subjects with asthma in the Louisville metropolitan area. Propeller Health will process these data to support two general strategies. Asthma self management: Rescue inhaler actuation data will be compiled into individualized feedback reports to support asthma self management. Propeller Health will combine information on individual rescue inhaler actuations with evidence-based asthma management tips into real-time reports that will be provided to subjects. ADID staff will evaluate any resulting improvements in asthma control that may be based on this information. Subjects may share reports with their healthcare providers. Municipal purposes: The second strategy is to provide aggregated and de-identified, spatial and temporal asthma rescue inhaler actuation data to City personnel and authorized public health researchers in Louisville. These data will show the times and locations of the use of rescue inhalers by the 300 study subjects throughout the greater Louisville area. ADID staff will work with City personnel and researchers to investigate how this unprecedented level of detailed information on exacerbations can be used best to increase public awareness of environmental triggers while supporting public health surveillance efforts around respiratory diseases.</brief_summary>
