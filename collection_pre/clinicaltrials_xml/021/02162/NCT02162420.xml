	<brief_summary>Fludarabine-based preparative regimen followed by an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using related or unrelated donor in persons 0-70 years of age diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita or severe aplastic anemia who have bone marrow failure characterized by a requirement for red blood cell and platelet transfusions. Three different preparative regimens are included based on disease and donor type.</brief_summary>
