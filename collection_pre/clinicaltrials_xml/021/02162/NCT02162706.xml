	<brief_summary>Cortisol is a hormone critical for survival in times of stress. Currently most measurements are done with blood samples. The hypothesis of this study is cortisol measured from saliva using mass spectrometry can be used to replace measurements by blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salivary Cortisol Measurements by Mass Spectrometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cortisol levels change depending on the time of day. Salivary samples were collected from health controls at bedtime, midnight and first morning waking on two consecutive nights and salivary cortisol levels were measured using mass spectrometry. In a patients with possible endocrine disorders who were going through an adrenocortiotropin stimulation test for adrenal insufficiency, salivary cortisol was measured prior to giving cosyntropin and 30-40 minutes after cosyntropin.</detailed_description>
