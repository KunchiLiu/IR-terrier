	<brief_summary>The potential of currently available diabetes technologies could be further exploited. The investigators propose that sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy may be improved by continuous correction, i.e. continuous evaluation of the need for correction boluses. In practice, this is carried out by running the bolus calculator every 10 minutes. The glucose sensor will provide the bolus calculator with glucose input. Many times, the bolus calculator will come to the result that no insulin is needed. However, when the blood glucose is above the pre-set target value and a correction bolus is needed, an appropriate bolus is automatically delivered by the insulin pump. The investigators hypothesize that sensor-augmented continuous correction insulin pump therapy can reduce hyperglycemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
