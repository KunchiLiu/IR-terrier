	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION: An adequate zinc supplementation is essential for a good immunological function. However, zinc deficiency is seen in more than 50% of adults infected with HIV. The safety and efficiency of zinc supplements in the progression of HIV is evaluated in the short-term. HYPOTHESIS Null hypothesis: Zinc supplementation does not improve the immunological recovery of HIV patients after three months of daily consumption. Alternate hypothesis: Zinc supplementation improves the immunological recovery of HIV patients after three months of daily consumption</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Supplementation Effect on Immune Recovery in HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GOAL: To assess the effect of zinc supplementation in the natural history of HIV, emphasizing on the immunological recovery of patients in a health care provider program in Medellín in 2012. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial will be conducted. The selected group will consist of male and female patients over 18 years of age, who comply with the inclusion criteria, with digital clinical history, in an HIV/AIDS program of a health care provider in Medellín. They will receive zinc supplements for 3 months. A comparison will be made between the immunological recovery among those patients taking the zinc supplement and those who are not. The CD4 lymphocytes value will be taken as an independent variable.</detailed_description>
