	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare how well different anesthetic, or numbing, solutions injected under the skin work in reducing the discomfort associated with placing a catheter in a vein. Two different medications, lidocaine and normal saline with benzyl alcohol, have been found to be effective in reducing discomfort when injected under the skin just prior to inserting the catheter. This study compares these two solutions, and will compare the discomfort that occurs both with and without using these solutions.</brief_summary>
