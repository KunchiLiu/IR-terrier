	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a prospective, observational study to examine the ECG waveforms captured by the new medical device as compared to a traditional Holter monitor for subsequent use in visual diagnoses of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias as well as cardiac impulse and/or conduction disorders by qualified clinicians. The hypothesis is that this new medical device prototype is non-inferior to traditional Holter monitoring for capturing ECG waveforms that can be visually assessed for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias as well as disorders of cardiac impulse formation and/or conduction.</brief_summary>
