	<detailed_description>Retrospective analysis of our experience in the last 8 years with the airway management in spine surgery in prone position. A total of 358 cases were reviewed from 2008 to 2013. Airway management (need for LM repositioning, orotracheal intubation because of failed LM insertion), anticipated difficult airway, and airway complications were registered. Statistics were compared between groups with the t test or the Ï‡ test, as appropriate.</detailed_description>
