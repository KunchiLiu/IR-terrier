	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase 1/3 prospective, randomised, parallel-group, active controlled, double blind, multicentre, international study with 2 coprimary endpoints designed to demonstrate equivalence in pharmacokinetics (Part 1), as well as noninferiority in efficacy (Part 2), of CT-P10 to Rituxan when coadministered with CVP and to assess efficacy and safety in patients with advanced (stage III-IV) FL. Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will run in parallel.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient is male or female older than 18 years. 2. Patient has histologically confirmed FL according to the World Health Organization 2008 classification (Jaffe 2009); grades 1 to 3a based on local laboratory review. 3. Patient has at least 1 measurable tumour mass that has not previously been irradiated, and the mass must be: greater than 1.5 cm in the longest dimension or between 1.1 and 1.5 cm in the longest dimension and greater than 1.0 cm in the shortest axis 4. Patient has confirmed CD20+ lymphoma, as assessed by local laboratory review. (Tissue obtained within 6 months before Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be reviewed by a central independent reviewer to detect pathological type.) 5. Patient has Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease. 1. Patient has received rituximab (or a rituximab biosimilar), cyclophosphamide, or vincristine. 2. Patient has allergies or hypersensitivity to murine, chimeric, human or humanised proteins, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, or prednisone. 3. Patient has evidence of histological transformation to highgrade or diffuse large Bcell lymphoma. 4. Patient has known central nervous system involvement. 5. Patient has received previous treatment for NHL: Previous treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or surgery (except previous biopsy) All doses of corticoid therapy for treatment of NHL Corticoid therapy during the previous 4 weeks from Day 1 of Cycle 1 with prednisone &gt;20 mg per day for the treatment for any purpose</criteria>
