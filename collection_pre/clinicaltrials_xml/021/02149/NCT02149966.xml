	<brief_summary>This is a dose escalation study that will be conducted in healthy volunteers. Multiple cohorts of volunteers will receive ascending (increasingly higher) oral doses of AG-348 daily for 14 days to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of AG-348, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of AG-348, and the pharmacodynamic profile of AG-348 with specific biomarkers assessed in the blood.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy adult male or female subjects 18 60 years, in good general health who are able to understand consent and complete all study procedures. Female subjects of nonchild bearing potential (surgically sterile or postmenopausal as confirmed by age [over 50 years], amenorrhea for ≥12 consecutive months and FSH). Male subjects who are not vasectomized must agree to use contraception up to 30 days after dosing. Subjects with body weight ≥50 kg; BMI ≥18.5 and ≤32 kg/m2. Subjects who are nonsmokers and have not used nicotinecontaining products for at least 3 months prior to screening. Subjects must be willing to refrain from caffeine or xanthenecontaining products (coffee, tea, chocolate) for 48 hours prior to dosing through discharge from the clinical facility. Subjects must agree to refrain from strenuous exercise starting 72 hours prior to admission through final followup visit. Subjects must refrain from use of alcohol starting 7 days (14 days for red wine) prior to admission through final followup visit. Subjects must agree not to donate blood products for duration of study participation. Subjects who have previously received AG348. Subjects with clinically relevant screening laboratory tests. Female subjects who are not postmenopausal. Subjects with recent use of prescription, over the counter (OTC), herbal and/or dietary medications and/or supplements. Male subjects with QTcF interval ECG &gt; 450 msec,or female subjects with QTcF interval ECG &gt; 470 msec. Subjects with a history of a serious mental illness. Subjects with a clinically relevant medical history or preexisting medical condition that would interfere with the absorption, metabolism or excretion of the study drug. Subjects with a history of any primary malignancy (cancer). Exceptions are certain skin cancers, cervical cancer in situ or other cancers that have been curatively treated without evidence of disease for a minimum of 1 year. Subjects with glucose6phosphatedehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. Subjects who have undergone surgery 6 months prior to screening. Subjects who have a history of illicit drug use or alcoholism within the last year. Subjects who are participating in other concurrent clinical trial of an investigational drug, or have received another investigational agent within the last 2 months. Subjects with any conditions which would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the subject's participation in or completion of the study.</criteria>
