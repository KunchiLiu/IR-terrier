	<brief_summary>TransCon PEG treprostinil is a novel prodrug form of treprostinil, in which treprostinil is reversibly conjugated via a four-arm branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. Reversible coupling of treprostinil to PEG should allow for a modified extended pharmacokinetic profile to achieve sustained plasma concentrations of treprostinil. This will be the first investigation of TransCon PEG treprostinil in humans. This study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating single doses of a subcutaneous injection of TransCon PEG treprostinil.</brief_summary>
