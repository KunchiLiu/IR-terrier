	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies suggest that certain foods rich in flavanols, including cocoa products, red wine, and tea, are associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Dietary interventional studies have corroborated this finding and showed that flavanols can acutely and after sustained ingestion improve surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk including endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction is the key event in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. Aging is the major non-modifiable cardiovascular risk factor associated with progressive decline in endothelial function, vascular stiffening and increase in blood pressure. However, in addition to flavanols, other potentially bioactive compounds are present in cocoa, in particular methylxanthines. Little is known about the vascular effects of cocoa methylxanthines, i.e. mainly theobromine, in particular when consumed together with flavanols in cocoa products. The aim of the study is to characterize the nutrient-nutrient interaction between cocoa flavanols and cocoa methylxanthines.</brief_summary>
