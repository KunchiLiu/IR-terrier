	<brief_summary>About 90 % of vascular symptoms affecting the lower limbs consist of venous diseases. Its highest incidence occurs from the second decade of life, affecting significantly the economically active population. Chronic Venous Insufficiency treatment aims to relieve symptoms, treat and prevent complications, prevent recurrences and provide cosmetic satisfaction with minimal side effects. It's current treatment includes some classic postural measures (leg elevation), elastic stockings and bandages compression therapy and possible medication (phlebotonics). The results in the medium and long term are unfavorable, since a large number of patients do not get better or evolves with recurrence of symptoms. Nowadays many, no prospective , not randomized , international studies have shown favorable results with endovascular treatment of obstruction in the iliac vein territory in patients with advanced Chronic Venous Insufficiency . The purpose of this prospective, double-blinded randomized study is to evaluate the results obtained with endovascular treatment, through the use of angioplasty and stenting in this group of patients when compared with clinical treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CEAP 36) submitted to clinical treatment for at least 1 year with no response. Subject must be &gt; 18 and &lt; 80 years of age Willing to participate in and able to understand, read and sign the informed consent document before the planned procedure On duplex ultrasound: patent common femoral vein, and patent deep femoral vein, and/or femoral vein of the study leg Subject cannot or will not provide written informed consent Previous venous stent implantation involving the study leg or inferior vena cava Previous venovenous bypass surgery involving the study leg Known metal allergy precluding endovascular stent implantation Known reaction or sensitivity to iodinated contrast that cannot be managed with premedication Subjects who are pregnant (women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment Acute deep venous thrombosis involving either leg Known history of chronic total occlusion of the common femoral vein of the study leg. Known history of thrombophilia (e.g., protein C or S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, presence of lupus anticoagulant, etc.) Venous compression caused by tumor encasement Venous outflow obstruction caused by tumor thrombus Life expectancy of less than 6 months Lower Extremity Arterial Insufficiency Elevated baseline blood creatinine (value greater than the upper limit of the normal range) Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study; examples include but are not limited to the inability to lie supine for the index procedure (e.g., severe congestive heart failure), thrombocytopenia or other hematological disorders associated with an unacceptable risk of bleeding, implanted orthopedic hardware that precludes proper imaging, etc.</criteria>
