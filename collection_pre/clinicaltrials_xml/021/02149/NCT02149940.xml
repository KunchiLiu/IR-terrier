	<brief_summary>Heart failure therapies (e.g. beta blockers) have been successful in decreasing mortality rates, as well as diminishing hospitalizations. Also, pharmacist collaboration has been shown to have a beneficial impact on heart failure related outcomes. Regardless, a high residual event rate is to be noted. In our pilot study, we wished to document whether a clinical pharmacist could still play a role in the heart failure management of an elderly inpatient heart failure population.</brief_summary>
