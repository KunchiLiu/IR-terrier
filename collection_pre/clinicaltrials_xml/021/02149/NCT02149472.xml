	<brief_summary>Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) remains a cause of significant maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. By identifying women with a higher a priori risk of major haemorrhage during their pregnancy or early during postpartum haemorrhage extra measures to prevent MOH can be taken. In this study the investigators aim to identify haemostatic parameters that during the course of haemorrhage are responsible for the on-going towards major bleeding. By doing this, cut-off points can be defined for future interventions aiming to stop this bleeding process in an early stage. Traditional coagulation parameters are currently not useful for clinical decision making, because of long turn around times. Therefore the added value of available coagulation 'point of care' tests will be evaluated during obstetric haemorrhage.These Point-of-Care (POC) tests could lead to a goal-directed haemostatic therapy for obstetric haemorrhage. A cohort of 9.500 pregnant women will be followed during their pregnancy and delivery. From all women a bleeding score will be obtained during their pregnancy by means of a validated questionnaire. The predictive value of this bleeding score for the occurrence of major obstetric haemorrhage will be evaluated. If postpartum haemorrhage develops (blood loss) &gt; 1000 cc, blood samples will be drawn for conventional haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles. The pathway between minor bleeding and major bleeding will be elucidated. Interchangeability and comparability of conventional haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles will also be evaluated. The overall goal of the investigators is becoming more able to predict major obstetric haemorrhage in an early stage of postpartum haemorrhage and define thresholds for goal-directed hemostatic therapies.</brief_summary>
