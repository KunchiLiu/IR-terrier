	<brief_summary>Medical education was transformed from mainly didactic class before 19th century to the clerkship and internship training based on the concept of "learning by doing" in 20th century. There are new challenges for medical education in the 21th century, including knowledge explosion, the importance of communication and teamwork in clinical care, and lack of comprehensive and systemic experiential learning. Therefore, another paradigm shift of medical education in this century is necessary. This research project, through applying high-fidelity simulation, resuscitation teamwork model, and concept of flipped classroom in resuscitation training, take the innovation and reform of resuscitation training as a pilot test for paradigm shift of medical education. This research project is a 4-year project. Three innovative intervention for resuscitation training will be developed, implemented, and evaluated. There will be 4 phases in this project: 1. Development phase (1st year): establishment of structure, validity and reliability test, faculty development, and course preparation. 2. Experiment phase (2nd year): comparative studies will be conducted. 3. Implementation phase (3rd year): integration and implementation of innovative interventions. 4. Evaluation phase (4th year): effectiveness evaluation and analysis of learning retention. Through innovation, development, implementation and effectiveness evaluation in this 4 phases, this research project hope to integrate high-fidelity simulation, resuscitation teamwork model, and concept of flipped classroom, into resuscitation training successfully and appropriately. Furthermore, these experiences can provide the bases of paradigm shift in medical education in the future.</brief_summary>
