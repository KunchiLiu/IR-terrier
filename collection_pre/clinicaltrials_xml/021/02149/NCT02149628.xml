	<brief_summary>Robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy(Robot-LRP) requires pneumoperitoneum and trendelenburg position which result in oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Propofol is well known to reduce those responses during anesthesia. Therefore, we try to figure out the efficacy of propofol to reduce oxidative stress, inflammatory response and increase the nitric oxide activity during robot-LRP compared to that of desflurane. To investigate the oxidative stress, malondialdehyde will be measured. As inflammatory markers, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α will be measured. Nitric oxide will be measured as well. Secondarily, kidney protection effect of propofol over desflurane will be compared.</brief_summary>
