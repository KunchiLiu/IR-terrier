	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if Symbicort® (budesonide/formoterol) Turbuhaler® is effective in treating asthma when used 'as needed' in patients with milder asthma. The efficacy of Symbicort® 'as needed' will be compared with: 1) terbutaline Turbuhaler® 'as needed' and with 2) Pulmicort (budesonide) Turbuhaler® twice daily plus terbutaline Turbuhaler® 'as needed'.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A 52-week, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, parallel-group, Phase III study in patients 12 years and older with asthma, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Symbicort® (budesonide/formoterol) Turbuhaler® 160/4.5 μg 'as needed' compared with terbutaline Turbuhaler® 0.4 mg 'as needed' and with Pulmicort® (budesonide) Turbuhaler® 200 μg twice daily plus terbutaline Turbuhaler® 0.4 mg 'as needed'</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. For patients underage, signed informed consent from both the patient and the patient's parent/legal guardian is required 2. Male or Female, ≥12 years of age 3. Documented diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 4. Patients who are in need of Step 2 treatment according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines 5. Patients treated with 'as needed' inhaled shortacting bronchodilator(s) only should have prebronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 60 % of Predicted Normal (PN) and postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 80 % PN 6. Patients treated with low stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene antagonist in addition to 'as needed' use of inhaled shortacting bronchodilator(s) should have prebronchodilator FEV1 ≥80 % PN 7.
