	<brief_title>Closure of Skin Incision Using CO2 Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skin incisions can be closed by a variety of method which create temporary approximation of the wound edges until natural healing process ensue and reach a phase, where it is closed and can sustain the daily tensile forces. The wound closure devices include sutures, staples, tapes, tissue adhesives. The Applied Physics group at the Tel Aviv University has developed a Temperature Controlled CO2 Laser Soldering system for soft tissue bonding. This system includes features that make laser soldering suitable for clinical use. The Temperature Controlled Laser Soldering System is composed of CO2 fiberoptic laser device, Infrared fiber-optic radiometer, a computerized temperature control program, propriety grip device (Clamps) and concentrated Human Albumin as a soldering agent.</detailed_description>
