	<brief_summary>It is important that pregnant women eat an adequate amount of protein to ensure healthy growth and development of the fetus. Amino acids are the building blocks of the body's protein. Glycine is an amino acid that can be made in the body, but under certain metabolic circumstances (e.g. pregnancy) the body's needs may be higher and glycine may need to be obtained from the diet. Currently, it is not known if glycine may be needed from the diet during pregnancy. We plan to study dietary glycine requirements in healthy pregnant women, during early and late gestation. We will do this using a modern, safe and quick method. The purpose of the study is to determine the dietary glycine requirement in healthy pregnant women during mid (20 - 30 weeks) and late (31 - 40 weeks) gestation. The investigators hypothesize that there is a dietary requirement for glycine during pregnancy due to an increased metabolic demand. With increased glycine intake the investigators hypothesize to observe an increase in protein synthesis, as measured by the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method.</brief_summary>
