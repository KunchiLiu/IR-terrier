	<brief_summary>Background: Substance abusers show impaired working memory (WM) functioning. Promising findings show training WM results in an improved working memory capacity (WMC) and a decrease of clinical symptoms in a range of disorders, including alcohol addiction. Aim: To test the effect of a WM training in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) on substance use, craving, WMC, impulsivity, attention bias and psychopathology. Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a parallel group design. The WM training adapted to participants' WMC whereas the placebo training consisted of non-adaptive easy versions of these tasks. Setting: Two departments of an addiction treatment clinic in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants: 120 inpatients diagnosed with an alcohol, cannabis or cocaine dependency who were in treatment as usual . Measurements: Primary outcome measures: Substance use and craving. Secondary outcome measures: WMC, impulsivity, attention bias and psychopathology. Participants were assessed before and after 24 sessions of WM training as well as two months after the training.</brief_summary>
