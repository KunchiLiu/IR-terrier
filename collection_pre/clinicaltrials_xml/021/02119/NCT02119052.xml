	<brief_summary>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with the development of a variety of extrarenal manifestations of which polycystic liver disease is most common. The investigators aimed to assess the changes over time of liver volume in ADPKD patients and whether it is affected by the treatment with the somatostatin analogue, octreotide. 35 ADPKD patients (14 males) aged 34Â±8 years were randomly assigned to 36 month treatment with placebo (n=18) or octreotide (n=17). Clinical and liver parameters at magnetic resonance (RM) were evaluated at baseline, study end and after 24 months of drug withdrawal.</brief_summary>
