	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to study blood stem cells in diabetic patients and normal patients. We would like to better understand if these cells, called endothelial precursor cells (EPCs), are not working as expected in people with diabetes. We would like to see if the function of these cells can predict the development of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is an eye disease associated with diabetes in which the cells of the retina are damaged. It can cause blurred vision, vision loss, blindness or possible bleeding in the retina. Even with current treatments, the quality of life for people with diabetic retinopathy is much reduced.</brief_summary>
