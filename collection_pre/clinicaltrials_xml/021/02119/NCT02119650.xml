	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if ruxolitinib, in combination with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin and Pemetrexed Maintenance, is safe and effective in the treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib in Combination With Pemetrexed/Cisplatin in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of an open-label, safety run-in (consisting of 1 to 4 cohorts of 9 subjects each), to confirm the safety of ruxolitinib in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin in subjects with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent. Subjects in the safety run-in will receive open-label ruxolitinib and pemetrexed and cisplatin. In the second part of the study, subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive pemetrexed and cisplatin (open-label) and either ruxolitinib or placebo in a blinded manner. The dose of ruxolitinib administered will be determined from the data produced in the safety run-in phase. Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles. Subjects will receive infusions of pemetrexed and cisplatin on Day 1 of each cycle and ruxolitinib/placebo will be self-administered during the entire cycle. Maintenance therapy with ruxolitinib or placebo in combination with pemetrexed, based on the original treatment assignment, will be allowed for subjects eligible for maintenance therapy.</detailed_description>
