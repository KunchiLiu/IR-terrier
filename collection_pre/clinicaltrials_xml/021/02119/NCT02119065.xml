	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in finding beads after Yttrium-90 bead therapy in patients with primary liver cancer or cancer that has spread to the liver (metastatic) that can not be removed by surgery. Imaging procedures, such as PET/CT after Yttrium-90 bead therapy, may help see if the beads are present in the lung and compare the results with the pre-therapy imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Assess Lung Shunting of Yttrium-90 Microspheres Using PET/CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the absolute difference in post-therapy Yttrium-90 microsphere hepatopulmonary shunt fraction and the pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin hepatopulmonary shunt fraction in patients with unresectable primary hepatic malignancy and hepatic metastatic disease. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To quantify and compare the pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin particle sizes and post-therapy Yttrium-90 microsphere sizes. OUTLINE: Patients receive routine pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin. Patients then undergo routine radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres. Within 36 hours after radioembolization, patients undergo PET/CT imaging. Available imaging, clinical, interventional and surgical follow-up data for 2 years after completion of enrollment in the study will be obtained.</detailed_description>
