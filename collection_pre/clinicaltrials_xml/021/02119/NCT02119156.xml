	<detailed_description>This study will assess the effect of a 24-week withdrawal of belimumab followed by a 28-week reintroduction of belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care medications on immunogenicity, markers of biological activity, efficacy, and safety in subjects with stable low systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity. Additionally, this study will assess rebound phenomenon in subjects with any disease level of SLE who have permanently withdrawn from further belimumab treatment</detailed_description>

Subjects who wish to enroll in the longterm discontinuation group have voluntarily withdrawn from their continuation studies. Subjects who have developed clinical evidence of significant, unstable or uncontrolled, acute or chronic diseases not due to SLE, or experienced an adverse event (AE) in their belimumab continuation study that could, in the opinion of the principle investigator, put the subject at undue risk. Subjects who have developed any other medical diseases, laboratory abnormalities, or conditions that, in the opinion of the principle investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for the study.</criteria>
