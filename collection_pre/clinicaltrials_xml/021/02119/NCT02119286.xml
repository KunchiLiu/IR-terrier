	<brief_summary>After screening, subjects will enter a 4 week open-label run-in period with fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 mcg administered once daily via dry powder inhaler (DPI). Subjects will then be randomized to receive any one of the 3 treatments (umeclidinium bromide [UMEC] [62.5 mcg] administered once daily via a DPI; OR UMEC [125 mcg] administered once daily via a DPI; OR matching placebo administered once daily via a DPI), while continuing treatment with open label FF/VI 100/25 mcg during a 12-week treatment period. There will be a total of eight scheduled clinic visits at Pre-Screening (Visit0), Screening (Visit 1), blinded treatment Day 1(Visit2), 2(Visit3), 28 (Visit4), 56 (Visit5), 84 (Visit6) and 85 (Visit7). A follow-up phone contact will be conducted approximately 7 days after the last clinic visit. The total duration of subject participation in the study from Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 17 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type of subject: Outpatient. Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation. Age: Subjects 40 years of age or older at Visit 1. Gender: Male or female subjects. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Postmenopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy. OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to followup contact): Abstinence Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Implants of levonorgestrel Estrogenic vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria as stated in the product label Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. For this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 packyears [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack year history. Severity of Disease: A pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and a pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of &lt;=70% of predicted normal values at Visit 1 (Screening) calculated using Nutrition Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations. Dyspnea: A score of &gt;=2 on the mMRC Dyspnea Scale at Visit 1. QTc Criteria: QTc(F) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc(F) &lt;480msec for patients with QRS duration &gt;=120msec The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread. For subject eligibility and withdrawal, QTcF will be used. For purposes of data analysis, QTcF will be used as primary. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period. Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the study. Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma. Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease. Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. Contraindications: Any history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2agonist, sympathomimetic, corticosteroid (intranasal, inhaled or systemic) lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate, or a medical condition such as narrowangle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction, that, in the opinion of the study physician contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled Long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), Long acting beta agonist (LABA) or Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Lower respiratory tract infection: Subjects with lower respiratory tract infection that required the use of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1. Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1. 12Lead ECG: An abnormal and clinical significant ECG finding from the 12lead ECG conducted at Visit 1. Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. The study investigator will determine the medical significance of any ECG abnormalities. Clinically significant and abnormal laboratory finding at Screening (Visit1).

No use within 30 days or 5 half lives whichever is longer prior to Screening Visit 1 or thereafter at any time during the study: Any other investigational drug. Prior enrolment in one of the replicate studies: subjects who have previously been assigned a subject number (enrolled) in study 200110 that is a replicate study of 200109.
