	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Effects of Terlipressin and High Dose Octreotide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal variceal bleeding is one of the main causes of death in cirrhosis patients. Prevention of bleeding events, including primary and secondary prophylaxis, is very important for reducing the mortality of variceal bleeding. Terlipressin and octreotide can effectively control bleeding with few side effects, which has been recommended by Baveno V in treatment of acute variceal bleeding. Terlipressin and high dose octreotide will be administered to the patients with cirrhosis related esophageal varices when they undergo hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement. Changes from portal and systemic hemodynamics will be observed to evaluate the safety and effects of terlipressin and high dose octreotide as well as to determine wether patients respond to them. The results can be served as clinical evidence for preventing re-bleeding through long-acting terlipressin and octreotide in the future.</detailed_description>
