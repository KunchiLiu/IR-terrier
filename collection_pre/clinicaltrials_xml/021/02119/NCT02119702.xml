	<brief_summary>This is a prospective cohort study designed to define the impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on young adults with perinatal HIV infection as they transition into adulthood. A group of perinatally HIV-exposed, -uninfected (PHEU) young adults from a similar sociodemographic background and age distribution will be enrolled for comparison.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AMP Up aims to define the impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on young adults with perinatal HIV infection as they transition into adulthood. A group of perinatally HIV-exposed, -uninfected (PHEU) young adults from a similar sociodemographic background and age distribution will be enrolled for comparison. The primary objectives of this study are: - To identify infectious and non-infectious complications of HIV disease and toxicities resulting from long-term ART, including disease progression, immune dysfunction, viral resistance, end-organ disease, and mortality. - To define the impact of HIV infection and ART on the long-term clinical outcomes of young adults, including: - Metabolic abnormalities and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including glucose and lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and body composition. - Sexually transmitted infections (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, syphilis, human papillomavirus, genital warts and HSV) among males and females, and cervical HPV-associated pre-cancers and cancers and Mycoplasma genitalium and other vaginal microbiota among females. - Reproductive health, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes including mother-to-child transmission of HIV. - To define the impact of perinatal HIV infection and ART on long-term neurocognitive and behavioral health outcomes, including: - Mental health and neurocognitive functioning. - Health care behaviors, including adherence to ART, participation in health care services, and transition to adult clinical care. - Risk behaviors, including sexual behavior and substance use. - Independent living skills, and vocational and education achievement necessary for successful transition to adult functioning and quality of life.</detailed_description>
