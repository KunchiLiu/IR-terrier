	<brief_summary>During orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), respiratory system function may be severely impaired for several reasons including anaesthesia effects, hyperdynamic volume state with fluid overload and ischemia reperfusion injury. In particular, reperfusion syndrome is characterised by the release of several inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and oxygen free radicals which may contribute to alveolar endothelial barrier dysfunction. The object of this study is to investigate the respiratory system mechanics impairment in its partitioning between lung and chest wall. We hypothesize that impairment of respiratory system mechanics (of both lung and chest wall) occurs after reperfusion phase of liver. This impairment is associated with the systemic inflammatory response following liver reperfusion.</brief_summary>
