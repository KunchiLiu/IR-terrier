	<brief_title>Malaria Clinical Trials Center General Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a continuous study enrolling approximately 350 participants per year to establish preliminary eligibility for participation in ongoing or future Seattle Malaria Clinical Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) clinical research studies. Data collected may be used to support preliminary eligibility for a current or future Seattle MCTC clinical research study. In order to maximize efficiency of the screening process potential participants who contact the site will be pre-screened using an IRB-approved screening form. Potential participants who contact the site may be asked to come in for an in-person screening visit. They will be given a consent form to read and sign if they should choose to participate in the screening process. If they have any questions during this process research staff will be available. This visit includes an in-depth medical history review, travel history, physical exam, blood draw, electrocardiogram test (ECG), and a urine test. The Seattle Malaria Clinical Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) is conducting research to combat malaria. Malaria is a disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito and affects millions of people worldwide. Malaria can cause a wide range of medical problems, and may even result in death if the infection is not treated. Currently there are many medications, preventative measures and malaria vaccines being developed to fight malaria that will need to be tested before they can be made available to the general public. The Seattle MCTC is conducting clinical research studies for this purpose and is in need of healthy adult volunteers to take part in upcoming studies.</detailed_description>
