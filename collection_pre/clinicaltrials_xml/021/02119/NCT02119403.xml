	<brief_title>Hand Held Nitrous Oxide Delivery Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assesses the Hand Held Nitrous Oxide Deliver Device which is intended to be used in nitrous oxide sedation systems by delivering a limited 16 grams of nitrous oxide over a total of 120 seconds of inhalation time. The device creates short term minimal sedation by delivering a maximum 72% USP grade nitrous oxide / 28 % ambient air combination which quickly drops to under 33% nitrous oxide / 67% ambient air in 60 seconds and stays steady until all the gas is expelled.</detailed_description>
