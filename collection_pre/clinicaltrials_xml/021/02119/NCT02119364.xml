	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in childhood (2-3 per 1000 live born), and is frequently accompanied by cognitive impairments and behavioural problems. The present study is a controlled clinical trial, a multicenter-study involving three health regions, as well as the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Its primary research goal will be to evaluate the effects of computer-based cognitive training in children with CP. In addition, this study will be the first to conduct a comprehensive neuropsychological examination to improve our understanding of cognitive impairments as well as cognitive resources in CP children in Norway to aid in intervention planning.</brief_summary>
