	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the systemic availability to CHF 6001 after a single dose of CHF 6001 administered using the multi-dose NEXThaler® device or the single-dose capsule inhaler Aerolizer®. CHF 6001 is an antinflammatory drug under development for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapy. The drug is presented as dry powder for inhalation delivered by an inhaler device. Previous studies were conducted using a single-dose capsule inhaler (Aerolizer®) device. For the subsequent clinical studies a novel multi-dose NEXThaler® device will be used.</brief_summary>
