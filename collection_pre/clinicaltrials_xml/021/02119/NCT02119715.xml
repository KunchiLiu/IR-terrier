	<brief_summary>Neutropenia is one of the most frequent adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the main factor to limit the dosage and the continuation of chemotherapy. A newly pegylated rhG-CSF was independently developed by JIANGSU HENGRUI Medicine Co., Ltd, China. Phase 1a, 1b trials have shown that pegylated rhG-CSF has decreased renal clearance, increased plasma half-life, and prolonged efficacy in compare with rhG-CSF. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of pegylated rhG-CSF in preventing neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
