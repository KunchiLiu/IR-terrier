	<brief_summary>This first-in-man study is to evaluate the Drug-Coated Chocolate (DCC) Balloon for percutaneous arterial angioplasty in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The study focuses on acute device performance and peri-procedural safety and also seeks to further characterize the performance of the device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug-Coated Chocolate PTA Balloon in Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease - The ENDURE Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study. Symptomatic lower extremity Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) patients presenting for endovascular revascularization will be enrolled in the study if they meet all entry criteria. The study will include patients from New Zealand and the European Union. The endpoints were designed to establish safety of the DCC and to identify long-term clinical benefits of this technology. The patients treated in this study will be designated into the above the knee (ATK) follow-up schedule if they are treated with the DCC in the SFA or Popliteal vessels. This schedule calls for clinical visits with duplex ultrasounds at 1,6 and 12 months. Patients will be designated into the below the knee (BTK) follow-up schedule if they are treated with the DCC in the Peroneal, Anterior Tibial, Posterior Tibial or Pedal vessels. These patients will have clinical visits at 1, 3 and 6 months with duplex ultrasound at the 1 and 6 months visits only.</detailed_description>
