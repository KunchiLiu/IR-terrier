	<brief_summary>Aldosterone and its target the mineralocorticoid receptor are implied in development of cardiovascular disease such as arterial high blood pressure or cardiac failure. Serum aldosterone level is insufficient to know if the mineralocorticoid receptor is activated or not. The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers of mineralocorticoid receptor activity. The first "candidate biomarker" is Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) or "lipocalin" which being measured in blood or in the urine. According to scientific knowledge's evolution, others biomarkers could be tested later thanks to the blood or urinary samples taken during study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Search of Biomarkers of Mineralocorticoid Receiver Activity : the Value of Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL)in Serum or Urine in Human</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is broken up into 5 groups: The first is a pre-analytical study to determinate optimum conditions for lipocalin samples. The second focuses on intra-individual variations of lipocalin levels in blood and urine. The third determinate the normal values of lipocalin in blood and urine. Fourthly, we study the role of renal function on serum and urines lipocalin levels. Fifthly, we study the role of anti-aldosterone treatment on patients who suffer of primary hyperaldosteronism.</detailed_description>
