	<brief_summary>Hyperuricemia is a very common finding in patients with heart failure. It is usually related to diuretic use and deteriorated renal function. The recently evidence showed that prednisone and allopurinol may have similar effect on uric acid (UA) lowering in symptomatic heart failure patients with hyperuricemia, but prednisone may be superior over allopurinol in renal function improvement. Thus the investigators design this randomized head to head study to test their hypothesis that prednisone is superior over allopurinol in renal function improvement despite their similar effect on UA lowering in heart failure patients with hyperuricemia.</brief_summary>
