	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 (CDX-1401) and neoantigen-based melanoma-poly-ICLC vaccine (poly-ICLC) vaccine therapy work when given with or without recombinant flt3 ligand (CDX-301) in treating patients with stage IIB-IV melanoma. The cancer vaccine CDX-1401 attaches to a protein that is made in tumor cells. The vaccine helps the body recognize the tumor to fight the cancer. The CDX-301 vaccine may help the body make more of the tumor fighting cells, known as dendritic cells. The poly-ICLC vaccine stimulates the immune system and may help these dendritic cells mature so that they can recognize the tumor. It is not yet known whether CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC will work better with or without CDX-301 in treating melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CDX-1401 and Poly-ICLC Vaccine Therapy With or Without CDX-301in Treating Patients With Stage IIB-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the immune response to cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) elicited by vaccination with CDX-1401 (anti-DEC205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) is substantially increased by prior expansion in the number of circulating dendritic cells (DC) by therapy with CDX-301 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand [Flt3L]) (recombinant flt3 ligand). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on immune responses to other ongoing and nascent antitumor response antigens associated with melanoma (e.g., preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma [PRAME], melanoma antigen family A, 3 [MAGE-A3], tumor protein p53 [p53], and premelanosome protein [gp100]) as well as memory viral responses (influenza A) and chronic viral responses (cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]). II. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on the frequency and phenotypic character of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets including DCs, monocyte populations, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. III. To assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of the vaccine regimens. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive recombinant flt3 ligand subcutaneously (SC) on days -7 to -1, 1-3, and 22-28 of course 1 and on days 1-3 of course 2 only; DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 SC or intradermally (ID) on day 1; and poly-ICLC SC on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401and poly-ICLC as in Arm I. In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with fully resected stage IIb through IV melanoma, with melanoma validated by histology or cytology, who have NOT received prior therapy Patients may have had primary cutaneous, mucosal, or ocular melanoma or metastasis from an unknown primary site Tissue should be submitted for evaluation of NYESO1 expression and Tcell infiltrates; however, availability of tissue and/or positivity for NYESO1 is not mandatory Prior therapy requirements: Prior radiation, chemotherapy or biologics NOT allowed Not currently receiving any anticancer therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 01 Life expectancy of at least 6 months Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mcL Platelets &gt;= 75,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;

after the evaluation of safety in the first 6 patients, HIVpositive patients with adequate immune function as evidenced by stable cluster of differentiation (CD)4 counts &gt;= 350/mm^3 are allowed to participate if the following criteria are met: Maintained on stable antiretroviral therapy with no significant drug interactions, and No recent history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) indicator conditions (&gt;

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception before the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of CDX1401 or CDX301 administration NOTE: Subjects are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile, they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy, or they are postmenopausal;
