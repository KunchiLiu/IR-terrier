	<brief_summary>In total 50 subjects with iron deficiency anemia treated with intravenous iron are planned for inclusion in this trial. After signing an informed consent a blood sample will be obtained from each participant before iron treatment. The investigators will measure the thrombin generation in plasma assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT). patient will go face to face interview and will be asked to answer structured questionnaire which will include information on demographics, clinical data ( fever, allergies , etc.) and comorbidities Two weeks after completing intravenous iron administration additional blood samples will be taken: thrombin generation will be measured</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Purpose of the Study is to Examine Whether Iron Deficiency Anemia is Associated With Increased Production of Thrombin and Whether Correction of Anemia by Providing Iron Intravenously Causes a Significant Reduction in Production of Thrombin.</brief_title>
