	<brief_title>Web-Based Tailored Educational Program in Improving Nurse Communication With Patients About Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To develop and pilot test a theory-driven, web-based, tailored, interactive educational program (Oncology Nurse IMPACT: Improving Communication with Patients about Clinical Trials) for oncology nurses to address barriers to discussing clinical trials with patients. II. To implement Oncology Nurse IMPACT on a national level and conduct a formal program evaluation. III. To evaluate the mediators and moderators of education program effect on intentions to discuss clinical trials with patients. OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 intervention arms. ARM I: Oncology nurses watch web-based informational video clips addressing knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (barriers of discussing clinical trials with patients). They also watch role-play video clips to help improve perceived behavioral control and address attitudinal barriers. ARM II: Oncology nurses view online clinical trials educational materials developed based upon National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trials educational materials for health care providers. The educational materials contain text and tables as presented on the NCI Website. After completion of study intervention, participants are followed for 3 months.</detailed_description>
