	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is to investigate if resveratrol supplementation can improve overall and muscle-specific insulin sensitivity in first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients. As a secondary objective the investigators want to investigate whether the improved insulin sensitivity can be attributed to improved muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and a reduced intrahepatic and cardiac lipid content. Furthermore, in a subset of the participants the investigators want to investigate the effect of resveratrol on glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue.</brief_summary>

Subjects who intend to donate blood during the intervention or subjects who have donated blood less than three months before the start of the intervention. Participation in another biomedical study within 1 month before the first screening visit Any condition, disease or abnormal laboratory test result that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study outcome, affect trial participation or put the subject at undue risk Any contraindication to MRI scanning. These contraindications include patients with following devices: Central nervous system aneurysm clip Implanted neural stimulator Implanted cardiac pacemaker of defibrillator Cochlear implant Insulin pump Metal containing corpora aliena in the eye or brains</criteria>
