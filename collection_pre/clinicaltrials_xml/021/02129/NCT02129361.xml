	<brief_summary>This study is investigating one way to improve health and healthy habits after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The primary goal of this study is to determine if a brief intervention accommodated for persons with moderate or severe TBI is effective in reducing alcohol misuse during the year following injury. It is hypothesized that an adapted Screening, Education and Brief Intervention (adapted SBI) will reduce the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week over the year following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, in comparison to a Screening and Education Attention Control condition (SEA control).</brief_summary>
