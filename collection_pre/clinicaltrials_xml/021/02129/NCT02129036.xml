	<brief_summary>Clear cell carcinoma comprises 5-10% of surface epithelial ovarian cancers, and about 30-40% of the patients with clear cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the advanced stage. The investigators studied the response to chemotherapy and survival for either paclitaxel-platinum based chemotherapy or conventional platinum-based chemotherapy among all stages clear cell ovarian carcinoma. Prognostic factors for survival among the patients with pure, advanced, clear cell ovarian carcinoma were also evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Several authors have reported frequent admixtures of clear cell ovarian carcinoma with serous, mucinous, and endometrioid tumors. However, few papers addressed the difference in response to chemotherapy and survival between patients with pure and mixed-type advanced clear cell carcinoma. 2. Recent trends in the clinical management of advanced ovarian cancer include increased attention to maximal cytoreduction and general acceptance of paclitaxel-platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. 3. The introduction of paclitaxel markedly changed the postoperative management of ovarian cancer patients, but the results and value of these newer efforts and therapies applied to clear cell carcinoma are as yet undetermined. 4. Today, paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy is becoming the standard regimen for ovarian cancer worldwide. Previous research suggests a potential benefit of paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimens for stage I clear cell carcinoma. However, few papers specifically addressed the efficacy of paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced clear cell carcinoma because clear cell carcinoma occurs only rarely in Western countries.</detailed_description>
