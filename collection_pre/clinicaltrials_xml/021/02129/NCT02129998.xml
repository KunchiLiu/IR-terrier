	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to achieve a more profound understanding of the endocrine alteration in luteal progesterone level after gonadotrophin stimulated IVF/ICSI cycles and to explore the optimal progesterone level needed for securing implantation and development of early pregnancy. The second part of the project will determine the value of Preimplantation Factor (PIF) measurement in embryo culture medium as a possible tool for improved embryo selection and the use of PIF as an early pregnancy serum marker for healthy implantation and embryo development. IVF: In vitro fertilisation, ICSI: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</brief_summary>
