	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of a low glycemic load diet in patients with stage I-III colon cancer. A low glycemic load diet includes foods that have low scores on the glycemic index. The glycemic index is a scale that measures how much a certain carbohydrate causes a person's blood sugar to rise. A low glycemic load diet may help decrease the chance of cancer coming back and improve the survival in patients with colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Glycemic Load Diet in Patients With Stage I-III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of following a low or medium glycemic load diet in patients with stage I-III (local-regional) colon cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine patient-reported acceptability of diet. II. To determine nutritionist resources utilized. III. To evaluate the effect of lowering dietary glycemic load on body mass index (BMI), lipid metabolism and pro-oncogenic intermediaries of cellular metabolism. OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially enrolled in 1 of 4 possible cohorts as needed based on the feasibility of the prior cohort. COHORT 1: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention (contact with nutritionist in person every 2 weeks with phone contact on the alternating weeks) for 12 weeks. COHORT 2: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention (contact with nutritionist in person every week) for 12 weeks. COHORT 3: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention for 12 weeks. COHORT 4: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
