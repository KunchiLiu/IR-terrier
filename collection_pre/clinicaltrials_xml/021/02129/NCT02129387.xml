	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposal is to identify new predictors of smoking progression in young light smokers (YLS: 18-25 years &amp; cpd &lt; 5) using an 18-month longitudinal design and to relate these predictors of progression to the genetic profile most highly associated with smoking progression. A number of novel predictors will be assessed in 128 YLS. Predictors will include individual differences (IDs) in EEG, reward sensitivity, attentional performance, and mood during abstinence and in response to standardized and to self-selected acute nicotine doses (ANIC), as well as genetically influenced affective traits, and smoking history. The associations of a compelling genetic functional variant polymorphism, rs16969968, in the alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit will also be related to smoking progression and the novel predictors. The study is expected to provide insights into IDs in mechanisms and predictors that contribute to smoking trajectories in YLS and thereby lead to targeted pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for at-risk YLS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the proposal is to identify new biobehavioral endophenotypes that predict smoking progression in young light smokers (YLS: 18-25 years &amp; cpd &lt; 5) using an 18-month longitudinal design and to relate these endophenotypes and progression to the genetic profile most highly associated with smoking progression. A number of novel predictors will be assessed in 128 YLS. Predictors will include individual differences (IDs) in EEG, reward sensitivity, attentional performance, and mood during abstinence and in response to standardized and to self-selected acute nicotine doses (ANIC), as well as genetically influenced affective traits, and smoking history.
