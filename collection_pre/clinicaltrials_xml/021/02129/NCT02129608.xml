	<brief_summary>Currently in the United States about 97 million adults are considered obese, accounting for about 33% of the American adult population (compared to 22.9% in 1988). Obesity, defined as a body mass index of 30.0 or higher, is accountable for 44% of the diabetes, 23% of the ischemic heart disease and between 7% and 41% of certain cancers. The Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser (which will be used in this study) has been approved by the FDA (K123237) as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment which can be used by individuals intending to reduce circumference of hips, waist, and thighs. Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor agonist. The exact mechanism of action is not known, but lorcaserin is believed to promote satiety and decrease food intake by activating 5-HT(2C) receptors on anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus. Lorcaserin was approved by the FDA on June 2012 for weight management in people with a BMI of &gt; 27 kg/m2 (overweight) when accompanied by a weigh-related condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure or in people with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 (obese). The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on: 1) effectiveness of the combination of LLLT and lorcaserin for reducing abdominal subcutaneous fat in overweight/obese individuals; 2) impact of LLLT on inflammatory biomarkers, blood sugar, and cholesterol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Level Laser Treatment (LLLT) and Lorcaserin for Weight Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being done to find out how effective Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT - Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser) is compared to Lorcaserin (Belviq®) in helping overweight people reduce their weight gain - especially in the central body region. Subjects will undergo 2 screening visits in which the investigators will take their medical and weight concern histories; and if found eligible, they will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) 12 weeks of LLLT, 2) 12 weeks of Lorcaserin, and 3) 12 weeks of a combination of both Lorcaserin and LLLT. Full study participation will last approximately 6 months and consists of 10 visits- 9 clinical and 1 phone call. During this study subjects will be provided with weight prevention counseling and be asked to complete 3 additional fasting blood draws. There will be one urine pregnancy test (for females only) at the beginning of the study.</detailed_description>

These drugs can be used to treat depression and/or migraines but are contraindicated with lorcaserin; any medical condition known to affect weight levels and/or to cause bloating or swelling; diagnosis of, and/or taking medication for, irritable bowel syndrome; active infection, wound or other external trauma to the areas to be treated with the laser; known photosensitivity disorder; are allergic to lorcaserin; current active cancer or currently receiving treatment for cancer; or have a known history of any condition or factor judged by the investigator to preclude participation in the study or which might hinder adherence;</criteria>
