	<brief_summary>The overall purpose is to assess whether a community social mobilization (CSM) program focused on young men ages 18-35 years of age changes gender norms in the community. The secondary purpose is to determine if there is a combined effect of CSM and HPTN 068 (Conditional Cash Transfers) on HIV and HSV-2 incidence. The goal of the mobilization activities is to engage young men around the issues of gender norms, intimate partner violence and HIV risk and to encourage them to take action to protect young women and reduce HIV risk in their communities.</brief_summary>
