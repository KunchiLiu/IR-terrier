	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Bupropion Hydrobromide in Adolescents and Children With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change from Baseline to EOT in total CDRS-R (raw) score. - The secondary efficacy endpoints include: - Proportion of subjects characterized as responders at EOT (≥40% improvement from Baseline total CDRS-R raw score) - Proportion of subjects characterized as in remission at EOT (total CDRS-R raw score &lt;29) - Mean change from Baseline to EOT in CGI-C. Safety endpoints include: - Incidence of AEs - Change from Baseline to EOT in vital signs (blood pressure and radial pulse rate), blood and urine laboratory panel, and ECG - Treatment discontinuation due to AEs - Suicidality as assessed by the C-SSRS score - Change from Baseline to EOT in sleep as assessed by the sleep subscale of the CDRS-R.</detailed_description>
