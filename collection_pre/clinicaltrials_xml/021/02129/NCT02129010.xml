	<brief_summary>Prospective clinical study to investigate the pathogenesis of Terson syndrome and the prognostic value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-protein and amyloid-β 40 and 42 in patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our two hypotheses are as follows: 1. The incidence of Terson syndrome correlates with the initial intracranial opening pressure (measured with extra ventricular drain) 2. The CSF-biomarkers correlate with the outcome assessed at discharge, 3-, 6- and 12-months postictally using Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended (GOSE) and Euro-Qol-5 as well as with complications related to aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage such as cerebral vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia and re-bleed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this prospective clinical study the pathogenesis of Terson syndrome and the prognostic value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-proteine and amyloid-β 40 and 42 in patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage are investigated. Intracranial opening pressure will be measured in patients requiring CSF-diversion for acute hydrocephalus and correlated with the incidence of Terson syndrome tested by an opthalmologic exam (group A: Terson syndrome positive, group B: Terson syndrome negative). CSF samples from external ventricular drainages are obtained at day 0, 2 and 6 and concentration of tau-protein and amyloid-β 40 and 42 are determined and correlated to secondary outcome measures such as delayed cerebral ischemia, clinical vasospasm, re-bleed, necessity for surgical intervention secondary to raised intracranial pressure or CSF-diversion. Outcome in terms of Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended and Euro-Qol-5 will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. CSF from patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic tapping of their internal ventricles for normal pressure hydrocephalus or shunt diagnostics serve as a reference for CSF-biomarkers concentration in healthy individuals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>older than 18 years diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to an intracranial aneurysm aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage must be the principal diagnosis for hospitalization an intracranial aneurysm must be confirmed by imaging (Computed tomography, magnet resonance tomography or angiography) Patients requiring diagnostic/therapeutic tapping of their internal ventricles for CSFdiversion (shunt) for normal pressure hydrocephalus or shunt diagnostics serve as a control group informed consent younger than 18 years other diagnosis such as traumatic or perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage without an intracranial aneurysm</criteria>
