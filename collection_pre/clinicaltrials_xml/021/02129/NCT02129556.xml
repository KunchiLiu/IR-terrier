	<brief_summary>A significant amount of preclinical and correlative clinical data suggest that HER2-positive breast cancer could be amenable to immune¬therapeutic approaches. The presence of HER2-overexpression in breast cancers is associated with higher levels of proliferation, high histologic grade and higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared with HER2-negative tumors. The investigators therefore hypothesize that for HER2-positive tumors, avoidance of destruction by the host immune system must be an important mechanism contributing to tumor growth and progression. The term "immune evasion" refers to the ability of the tumor to suppress and change host anti-tumor immune reactions. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in various tumors. High expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent of PD-L2) has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various other solid tumor types. Furthermore, PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in patients with malignant melanoma. These observations suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in the tumor immune evasion and could be considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in several solid organ types. MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly-selective humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. MK-3475 strongly enhances T lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells from healthy human donors, cancer patients, and primatesMK-3475 also modulates the level of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and other cytokines. The investigators therefore propose to evaluate if the addition of an immunotherapy can reverse trastuzumab resistance and improve clinical outcomes in HER2-positive disease. In this study the investigators will determine if a monoclonal antibody targeted against PD-1, a T cell negative regulator, can reverse trastuzumab resistance in patients previously progressing on trastuzumab.</brief_summary>

Trastuzumab resitant disease, defined by: progression of disease while ontreatment with trastuzumab recurrence while on adjuvant trastuzumab or within 12 months of completing adjuvant trastuzumab Any number of prior lines of antiHER2 therapy acceptable. Patients for whom the treatment with the current firstline combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and taxanes is not an option can be considered for enrollment If a patient has received a subsequent antiHER2 therapy, she must also have progressed on the subsequent therapy. Presence of at least one measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1) LVEF ≥50% Patient agrees to submit an FFPE tumor biopsy for central confirmation of HER2 positivity and central assessment of PDL1 status. Written Informed Consent (IC) for screening procedures and trial participation must be signed and dated by the patient and the Investigator prior to screening. Written consent to biological material submission, indicating the patient has been informed of and agrees to tissue and blood material use, transfer and handling, must be signed and dated by the patient and the investigator prior to any procedures specific for this trial, including consent to translational research on FFPE and fresh frozen tumor biopsies in case the patient is enrolled into the trial. The patient has been informed of and agrees to data transfer and handling, in accordance with national data protection guidelines.

Hematopoietic status: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L, Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Hepatic status: Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). In the case of known Gilbert's syndrome, a higher serum total bilirubin (&lt; 2 × ULN) is allowed. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN; if the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST must be ≤ 5 × ULN. Renal status: Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ×ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min Proteinuria &lt;1 g/day International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulant.
