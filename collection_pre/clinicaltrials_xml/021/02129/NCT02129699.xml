	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how well the standard treatment (chemotherapy) in combination with denosumab works compared with the standard treatment alone in patients with a type of lung cancer called "non small cell lung cancer" (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigational medicinal product denosumab is a protein (monoclonal antibody) that works to slow down bone destruction caused by cancer spreading to the bone (bone metastasis). Denosumab is used in adults with cancer to prevent serious complications caused by bone metastasis (e.g. fracture, pressure on the spinal cord or the need to receive radiation therapy or surgery). Results from one study in lung cancer patients with bone metastasis suggested that adding denosumab to the standard chemotherapy may lead to a possible survival benefit. All patients will receive standard chemotherapy consisting of a combination of platinum-based agents plus gemcitabine or pemetrexed, depending on the nature of the lung cancer, every 3 weeks for about 3-4 months: Patients will be assigned to one of two groups, known as 'arms'. The treatment for each arm will be as follows: Arm A: 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy and best supportive care Arm B: 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy + denosumab 120 mg, administered subcutaneously every 3-4 weeks. Denosumab treatment may continue thereafter until 2 years after the study has been evaluated. A total of 1000 patients from centers in Europe, Switzerland and Israel are expected to be enrolled in this study over a period of 37 months.The study will take approximately 51 months to be completed</detailed_description>
