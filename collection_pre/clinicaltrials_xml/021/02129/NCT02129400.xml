	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of xenon-inhalation on erythropoetin-level in blood of healthy volunteers and to determine the efficient time of inhalation. Hypothesis: Xenon-inhalation enhances erythropoetin-levels in blood</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence on Erythropoetin-level by Xenon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Xenon-gas is an approved anesthetic by the EMEA and is used for a balanced anesthesia in combination with opioids for adults with a american society of anesthesiology classification ASA ≤ III. Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have shown a positive effect of xenon on several organ functions such as in brain, kidneys and heart. In two studies, an enhanced expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) could be shown in animal kidneys and kidney cells. Interestingly, HIF-1α leads to an enhanced formation of erythropoetin (EPO). This might result in an enhanced oxygen transport capacity and an enhanced oxygen-level after xenon-treatment. Aim of the project is to analyze the effect of xenon-inhalation on circulating erythropoetin-level in blood of healthy volunteers in a randomized controlled pilot study. Besides, other positive stimulating factors for erythropoiesis (such as HIFa stabilizing factors) and growth factors (such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mechano growth factors (MGFs), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs)) shall be analyzed.</detailed_description>
