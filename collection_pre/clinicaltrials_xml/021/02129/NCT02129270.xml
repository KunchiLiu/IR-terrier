	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to Prove that injection of 15 to 20 mL of lidocaine 1% into the fracture site (Hematoma block) is more effective in terms of pain relieving then injection of 10 mL of lidocaine 2%, and equally safe in terms of complications, for closed reduction of distal radius fractures.</brief_summary>
