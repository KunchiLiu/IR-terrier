	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition associated with balance problems and pain. It has been previously described that fibromyalgia may affect peripheral and/or central mechanisms of postural control. Balance or postural stability is a very complex task that involves the integration of multiple sensory inputs to execute appropriate neuromuscular activity needed to maintain balance. Patients with fibromyalgia have also muscle weakness. Muscle strength depends on both the cross-sectional area of the muscle and the neural activity. Range of movement and quality of life have also been reported to be affected.</detailed_description>
