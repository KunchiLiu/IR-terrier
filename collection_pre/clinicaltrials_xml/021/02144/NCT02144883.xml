	<brief_title>Telephone Counseling for Pregnant Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of low birth weight, premature delivery, fetal and infant death, and children's developmental problems. It is also associated with significant economic costs. Telephone cessation quitlines have been suggested as one good way to reach pregnant smokers. This randomized controlled trial was embedded into a free statewide telephone cessation quitline in California. The primary component of the intervention was telephone counseling using a structured protocol developed specifically for the pregnant population. The counseling consisted of nine counseling sessions. A secondary component of the intervention was the mailed materials. Following enrollment in the study all subjects (control and intervention) received a self-help quit kit for pregnant smokers and fact sheets on second-hand smoke and additional tips for quitting while pregnant. Subjects in the counseling intervention group received five additional mailings. These mailings were designed to remind them of their commitment to quitting and of the presence of counseling support if they needed help. Prior to 36 weeks gestation (in the third trimester), 2-months postpartum, and 6-months postpartum we conducted a brief telephone survey to assess smoking status. The information obtained allowed us to determine 30-day prolonged abstinence rates. Prior to 36 weeks gestation (in the third trimester), the investigators sent a kit and requested saliva samples be mailed back to biochemically verify smoking status by testing for cotinine and nicotine byproducts.</detailed_description>
