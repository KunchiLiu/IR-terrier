	<brief_summary>During the last decades, owing to the growing tendency of women to delay childbearing plans because of career and personal priorities, fertility specialists today are seeing more and more women with poor ovarian reserve and with poor ovarian response Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is considered a important factor in the success of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), enabling the recruitment of multiple oocytes and, thereby, resulting in more than one embryo. However, owing to the extreme variability in ovarian response to COH, in a subgroup of patients with poor ovarian response, this method may yield a very small number of follicles After succeeding in maximal recruitment of the follicles, the triggering of ovulation is extremely important in order to achieve, as many as, mature oocytes. Several studies have reported retrieval of more mature oocytes after GnRH agonist triggering compared to the number of oocytes retrieved after hCG. Among the possible advantages of GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation is the simultaneous induction of an FSH surge. The role of the natural mid-cycle FSH surge is not fully clear. FSH was reported to induce LH receptor formation in luteinizing granulosa cells, and to promote oocyte nuclear maturation and cumulus expansion . Another method described to trigger ovulation is the "Dual triggering"- GnRH agonist 40 h prior to ovum pickup and hCG added 6 h after the first trigger. The dual triggering was described as the treatment in cases with recurrent empty follicles. The aim of the present study is to evaluate three different methods of ovulation triggering in women with poor ovarian response</brief_summary>
