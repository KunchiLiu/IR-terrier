	<detailed_description>Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scores, assessing severity of erythema, will be obtained prior to study treatment to confirm subject eligibility. Enrolled subjects will receive up to three dual-depth treatments to affected areas of the midface (cheeks, chin, forehead, glabella and nose) each treatment provided approximately 2 weeks apart. Groups A and B will receive low-density treatment, and Groups C and D receive high-density treatment. Groups A and C will receive 2 treatments. Groups B and D will receive 3 treatments. Protocol amended Sept 2014: Groups A and C will receive 1 treatment; Groups B and D will receive 2 treatments.</detailed_description>
