	<brief_summary>Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease (OGVHD) is a serious potential complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplants. The usual treatment is topical cyclosporine but when the treatment is initiated the damage to the lacrimal glands has already taken place. The present study aims to prevent OGVHD in reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic transplants by using topical cyclosporine immediately after the engraftment has been achieved</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Ocular Graft-Versus-Host Disease With Topical Cyclosporine in Recipients of Allogeneic HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient will start using topical cyclosporine immediately after engraftment has taken place (around day 14-18 after the cell infusion) and will continue to receive it for one year. All &gt;18 year old patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants performed with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen at our center are potential candidates for the study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical cyclosporine in prevention of ocular versus graft disease when its use is indicated immediately after the engraftment has occured.</detailed_description>
