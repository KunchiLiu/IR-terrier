	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 12 weeks of WB-EMS either applicated passive in a supine resting position or active during slight movements compared with a non-training control group on body composition, muscle strength and QoL in patients with ulcerative colitis. Our main hypothesis is that active WB-EMS application is significantly more favorable to address our primary endpoints compared with passive application. Our secondary hypothesis is that passive WB-EMS application is significantly more favorable to address our primary endpoints compared with non-training control.</brief_summary>
