	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a feasibility study using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in which participants will receive the Partners in Care (PIC) diabetes self-management intervention and then be randomized to either semi-structured social support or a standard follow-up control group. Participants in the support groups will receive a culturally-tailored, semi-structured social support program delivered in a community setting by trained community peer educators and other health professionals (e.g., pharmacist). The investigators believe that the addition of a semi-structured social support component as a supplement to an evidence-based diabetes self-management intervention will improve diabetes self-care maintenance.</brief_summary>
