	<brief_summary>This study will examine the feasibility of implementing a clinician-supported patient self-managed inpatient insulin intervention. It will: assess the number of eligible patients presenting over time; assess patients' willingness to enroll; assess patients' ability to successfully complete the intervention; examine occurrences of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia; and assess patients' satisfaction with inpatient diabetes care.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) in the past 72 hours. Current HUP locations are Founders 12, Founders 14, Silverstein 11, and Rhoads 1. Age 18 years or older. Type1 or type2 diabetes mellitus requiring home basalbolus insulin therapy administered via subcutaneous injection (not pump). Patient manages own basalbolus insulin therapy at home without assistance, including measuring own blood glucose (at least at mealtimes) and administering own subcutaneous insulin. Patient is willing to use the following insulin products: rapidacting insulin aspart via insulin pen (NovoLog) and longacting insulin glargine via vial and syringe (Lantus). Most recent hemoglobin A1c was measured within past 6 months and was &lt;7.5%. Active order for inhospital basalbolus or slidingscale insulin. Patient is willing and able to record their selfmeasured blood glucose results, doses of insulin that they selfadminister, a food journal, and exercise log. Clinical care team agrees with study inclusion. Inpatient order for insulin via subcutaneous infusion (i.e., pump) or intravenous infusion (i.e., drip). Inability to perform the activities required by the trial. Primary reason for admission was hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, a psychiatric condition, acute alcohol poisoning, or acute drug ingestion. Order for a newlyprescribed or increased dose of a previouslyprescribed corticosteroid. Enteral or parenteral nutrition. Expected length of stay &lt;48h, as determined by treating physician. At risk for selfharm, as determined by 1to1 status placement. Pregnant, as recorded on medical record. Cannot understand, speak, and read English. Patient does not wish to utilize Novolog and Lantus while in the hospital. Prior enrollment in this trial. Do not resuscitate status. Inability to give written informed consent. Clinical care team disagrees with study inclusion. Patient has limited mobility such that they cannot safely access the bedside medication lockbox.</criteria>
