	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to contribute evidence towards the potential to improve cognition in HIV+ individuals experiencing cognitive decline through personalized change in antiretroviral (ARV) medication. To that end, following a comprehensive evaluation to identify confounding clinical conditions, study participants will undergo a lumbar puncture to: (i) measure viral load (at 2 copies/ml); (ii) identify Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) genotype and tropism; and (iii) measure concentration of antiretroviral agents. When indicated from the CSF analysis, a personalized change in ARV will be implemented. Cognition will be measured in all at study entry and 6 months later.</brief_summary>
