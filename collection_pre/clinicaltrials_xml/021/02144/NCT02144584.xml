	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized double blind placebo-controlled pilot study using a repeated measures design in which participants with acute ischemic stroke and upper extremity weakness are randomized to either drug or placebo, complete therapy, and complete outcomes assessments at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks post-stroke. Target enrollment will be 10 patients per group and adaptive randomization will be used to assist with equal representation of pre-stroke selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and motor severity (Fugl-Meyer score) in each arm. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to measure adverse events, drop-out rates, feasibility of trial conductance, and establishment of effect sizes in each group in order to power a larger efficacy trial at the University of Utah. An intention to treat model will be used during the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age &gt;18 years old 2. Randomization between 38 days of stroke symptom onset 3. Arm weakness severe enough to warrant inpatient or outpatient occupational therapies 4. Able to voluntarily move the wrist or a digit of the affected UE 5. Living independently prior to their stroke 6. Imageconfirmed ischemic stroke (MRI or CT) 7. Supratentorial location of stroke 8. FuglMeyer Score of 55 or less 9. Ability to swallow pills 1. Hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or other cause of symptoms other than ischemic stroke 2. Infratentorial location of stroke (brainstem or cerebellum) 3. NIH Stroke Scale &gt;20 at the time of randomization 4. History of dementia that will interfere with rehabilitation 5. Pre or poststroke use of memantine or amantadine 6. Contraindications to taking memantine in pill form 7. History of prior clinical stroke with residual symptoms on the same side as the current symptoms that would interfere with outcomes of this study 8. Documented severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt; 30 ml/min) Blood tests will be performed prior to study procedures that will ensure patients do not have renal impairment if not done as part of clinical care. 9. Moribund or not expected to live 6 months 10. Severe cognitive deficits or premorbid function causing inaccurate neurologic assessment or inability to complete the initial assessment 11. Comorbid neurologic disease that would interfere with the results including but not limited to Multiple Sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord disease, and central nervous system cancer. 12. Documented severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh score &gt; 6) or severe hepatic disease (hepatitis) 13. Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding</criteria>
