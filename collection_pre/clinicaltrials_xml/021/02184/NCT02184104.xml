	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how fast caffeine gets into your body with a product called Aeroshot™. Aeroshot™ is a lipstick sized device that you slide open and then put your mouth over the opening and inhale. A fine powder containing 100 mg of caffeine is deposited on your tongue and the inside of your mouth. Caffeine will be absorbed through the membranes in your mouth or swallowed and then absorbed in your stomach. We will compare the absorption of caffeine after using the Aeroshot™ with the absorption after drinking an energy drink by taking 15 blood samples over 8 hours and measuring the caffeine levels in your blood. You will also be asked to fill out some scales to measure the effects you feel after the caffeine dose. We hypothesize that caffeine absorption after inhalation will be faster than after an energy drink.</brief_summary>
