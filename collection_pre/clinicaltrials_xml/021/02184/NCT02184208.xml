	<brief_summary>Today, the electronic medical record, microprocessor mechanical ventilators, and physiologic monitoring are under-utilized when translating research into decision support. Current medical informatic capabilities can be leveraged to calculate trends in measured parameters to initiate a paradigm shift in critical care from reaction-based treatment to proactive and plausibly preventative care. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop baseline understanding of our practice and how data collection utilizing a newly implemented system called T3. We would like to retrospectively review mechanically ventilated patients in which we have collected continuous data to test a newly developed analytic platform. Additionally we would like to compare these results to our standards of practice established by clinical practice guidelines.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient selection will be determined by available data collected in the T3 system. We estimate 50 patients in which mechanical ventilator data has been collected utilizing the limited intellibridge modules (4 systems currently available to collect ventilator data). Patient not connected to T3 data collection system.</criteria>
