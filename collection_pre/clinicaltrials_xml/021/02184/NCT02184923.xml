	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this research is to advance our knowledge of how information from the labyrinth is brought to perception and how adaptation to vestibular imbalance influences spatial orientation. In healthy human subjects verticality perception is accurate while upright.The strategy of this research is to quantify changes in verticality perception after unilateral lesions along the central graviceptive pathways and to assess the frequency and pattern of abnormal verticality perception in patients with acute stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Our underlying hypothesis is that screening for erroneous verticality perception by use of a mobile device assessing the subjective visual vertical (SVV) during the acute phase (i.e., within 24-48 hours after symptom onset) reliably identifies those patients with defects. Early detection of deficits in verticality perception may help to initiate balance physiotherapy early.</brief_summary>
