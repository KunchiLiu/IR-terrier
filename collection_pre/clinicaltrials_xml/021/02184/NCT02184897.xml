	<brief_summary>Twenty four patients with multiple myeloma will be randomized to either AM group (administration of lenograstim at 8 am) or PM group (administration of lenograstim at 6 am ). Apheresis of hematopoietic stem cell will start at 10 am on D5 in AM group and at 8 am on D4 in PM group, respectively. Pharmacokinetic data of lenograstim will be correlated with pharmacodynamic data of CD34+ cell count, absolute neutrophil cell count and hematopoeitic progenitor cell count. In addition, the yield of stem cell collection between two arms will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
