	<brief_title>Safety Study of DWP-450 (Botulinum Purified Neurotoxin, Type A) Injection to Treat Glabellar Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three hundred and fifty subjects will be enrolled and injected with the study drug DWP-450 over the course of the 365 day study. Subjects with moderate or severe glabellar lines at maximum frown on the 4 point Glabellar Line Scale (GLS, 0=none, 1= mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), as judged by the investigator, will be eligible for injection with DWP-450. After each injection, subjects will be followed and are eligible for a repeat injection if their GLS is ≥2 at maximum frown, as judged by the Investigator. If a subject does not have a GLS≥2 they will be followed monthly until eligible for repeat treatment. Subjects may receive up to a maximum of 4 treatments and will be followed for 365 days from initial treatment.</detailed_description>
