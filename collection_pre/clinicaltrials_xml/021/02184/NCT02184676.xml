	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether early immunological markers (activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes) precede and are predictive of the appearance of autoantibodies in children born from type 1 diabetic parents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T1D Risk Assessment in Kids With Relatives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is estimated between 0.2 and 0.4% in France. The incidence in France is more than 10/105 per year, with a steady increase (~4%/year), especially in children. Infants born to parents with T1D have a 15-fold higher risk to develop T1D compared to the general population. The appearance of autoantibodies precedes and is highly predictive of the later occurrence of T1D. The activation of B lymphocytes, which produce autoantibodies, is controlled by T helper lymphocytes. Hence, biomarkers associated with initial T lymphocyte activation are likely to precede the appearance of autoantibodies. The aim of the TRAKR study is to determine whether the appearance of autoreactive T lymphocytes is predictive of the emergence of autoantibodies. The secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate whether metagenomic, metabolic, or environmental factors are associated with the appearance of autoantibodies; 2) to evaluate the incidence and the time of autoantibody appearance in a French population of genetically at-risk children; 3) to compare the incidence of autoantibodies between infants born to T1D fathers and mothers.</detailed_description>
