	<brief_summary>In this Phase I/Phase II clinical trial, 7 eligible patients with OA of the knee will receive Ampion™ 4 mL administered as three IA injections, 2 weeks apart. In the absence of serious drug-related AEs of unanticipated drug-related AEs, enrollment will be initiated in Phase II of the study. In Phase II, a total of 30 eligible patients with OA knee pain will be randomized 1:1 to receive either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo as three IA injections, 2 weeks apart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AP-007 Study to Evaluate Safety and Exploratory Efficacy of Three Intra-articular Injections of Ampion in the Knee of Adults With Pain Due to Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase I of this study, 7 eligible patients with OA knee pain will be enrolled and treated with 3 IA injections of active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) at Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4 to the knee. The Medical Monitor will conduct a safety evaluation after all 7 treated patients complete the Week 4 follow-up evaluation. Enrollment will be initiated in Phase II if no serious drug-related adverse events or unanticipated drug-related adverse events are observed. Pending safety review, these patients will continue to Week 52. In Phase II, 30 eligible patients with OA knee pain will be enrolled in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase of the study. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive three (3) IA injections of either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4 to the knee. The clinical effects of treatment on OA pain will be evaluated for all patients during in-clinic visits at Screening, Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 20, 24 and 52 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis Index 3.1, and the Patient's Global Assessment of disease severity (PGA).</detailed_description>
