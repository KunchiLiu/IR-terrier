	<brief_summary>This open label 4 month study will evaluate efficacy (blood pressure lowering effects) and safety of lisinopril in children 1-18y whose parents grant permission to participate. This dose titration study is being conducted to support the statement that personalized titration of lisinopril (based on blood pressure and renin-aldosterone ratio) can increase patient response.</brief_summary>
