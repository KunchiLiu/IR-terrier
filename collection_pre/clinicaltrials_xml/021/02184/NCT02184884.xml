	<brief_summary>The whole blood Thrombelastograph (TEG®) Platelet Mapping™ assay measures clot strength, maximal amplitude (MA), reflecting maximal platelet function, and detects the reduction in platelet function, presented as percentage inhibition, by both aspirin and clopidogrel. A study reported that the TEG® can be used as routine monitoring of the variability in ADP receptor inhibition and of antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, using TEG Platelet Mapping assay, we could find out the perioperative clopidogrel responsiveness of the patients with ACS undergoing OPCAB. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rate of the major adverse cardiac events (MACE, a combined endpoint of MI, revascularization and cardiac death) is higher in the patients with high degree of clopidogrel resistance, who are scheduled to undergo the OPCAB due to ACS.</brief_summary>
