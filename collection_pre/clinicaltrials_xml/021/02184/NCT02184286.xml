	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of nevirapine on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir-sgc and to determine the effects of saquinavir-sgc on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in combination with saquinavir-sgc compared to historical controls treated with nevirapine but without saquinavir-sgc.</brief_summary>
