	<detailed_description>Untreated trauma-related nightmares and sleep-related disorders are associated with chronic health problems, burdening both the suffering individual and the health-care system. The study implements an innovative, cost-efficient, nightmare treatment for trauma-exposed children. It is one of the first randomized clinical trials with children, adapting an efficacious adult therapy to a 5-session nightmare treatment for 8-13 year-olds. Trauma nightmares are a mechanism in development and maintenance of secondary post-trauma psychopathology, medical problems, and family dysfunction. Therefore, this treatment may prevent long-term secondary health and behavioral problems. It provides a viable health care option to Montanans, lessening long-term financial, medical, and behavioral health expenses. Scientific models currently view PTSD treatment as primary, often leaving nightmares untreated. That approach does not address the pernicious impact of trauma-nightmares in individuals with sub-threshold PTSD or whose nightmares are a primary condition. The theoretical innovation of this therapy can advance the field's understanding of the development of trauma sequelae.</detailed_description>
