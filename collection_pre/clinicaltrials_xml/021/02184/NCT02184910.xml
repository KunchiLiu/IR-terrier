	<brief_summary>It is well-known that atrophic gastritis is a major risk factor for gastric cancer, which leads to variations in the serum levels of gastrin, pepsinogen (PG) I, and PGII. We want to assess the effects of age, sex, and Helicobacter pylori status on pepsinogen (PG) level for atrophic gastritis and whether gastric atrophy based on the PG test would be improved after H. pylori eradication.</brief_summary>
