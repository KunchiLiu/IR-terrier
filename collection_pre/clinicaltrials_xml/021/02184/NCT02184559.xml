	<brief_summary>The purpose of the multimodal postoperative analgesia is to improve the quality of analgesia and reduce side effects of morphine (nausea, vomiting, sedation, urinary retention, respiratory depression ...). In the case of caesarean sections, the quality of analgesia allows one hand to improve the mother-child relationship and the quality of breastfeeding, the other to reduce the risk of postpartum depression and chronic pain . Two methods of administration of local anesthetics have been proven effective for analgesia of the abdominal wall under umbilical: The Transversus Abdominal Block Plan (TAP Block) and infiltration of the scar continues operating. The TAP block was performed under ultrasound guidance by the anesthesiologist after the intervention in a single injection of local anesthetic in the abdominal wall and has a period of limited and variable. The infiltration continues catheter is placed by the surgeon before closing the wound and allows the infusion of local anesthetics for 48 hours. The purpose of this study was to compare morphine consumption between both techniques, and the quality of analgesia and side effects of morphine</brief_summary>
