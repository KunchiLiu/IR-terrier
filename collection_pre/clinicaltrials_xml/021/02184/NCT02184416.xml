	<brief_summary>This is an international, multi-centre, prospective (partly retrospective), observational study to evaluate treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC treated with sunitinib in first line and/or receiving axitinib in second line post sunitinib. The study is designed to enroll approximately 750 patients over the course of an enrollment period of approximately 36 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of The Impact Of Inlyta In 2nd Line On The Treatment Outcomes Of mRCC Patients Treated With Sutent In 1st Line In The Real Life Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled when they start a treatment with Sutent in 1st line or Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent treatment. The possible sequences of treatment under investigation will be: - Sutent (prospective) - Inlyta - Sutent (retrospective) - Inlyta - Sutent - not further active treatment (supportive care) - Sutent - other second line treatment (Nexavar (sorafenib), Votrient (pazopanib), Afinitor (everolimus), Torisel (temsirolimus), other)) The study will enroll approximately 750 adv/mRCC patients at the 1st and 2nd line treatment level. Patients will be enrolled when they start a treatment with Sutent in 1st line or Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent treatment. Therefore for some patients there will be a retrospective Sutent data collection. The primary endpoints of this study in patients with adv/mRCC are PFS and TTF for patients receiving Inlyta in 2nd line, and the combined PFS and TTF for patients receiving the Sutent-Inlyta sequence. In this non-interventional real life study, the objective is only descriptive and the sample size will rely on the precision of the estimate.</detailed_description>
