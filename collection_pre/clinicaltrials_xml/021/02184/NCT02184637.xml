	<brief_summary>This will be a single-centre, 5-cohort, randomized open-label, parallel-group study in healthy volunteer subjects. This study aims to provide sufficient pharmacokinetic (PK) evidence to support the safe usage of Tafenoquine (TQ) in studies and markets where the Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) are the standard of care for patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria (i.e., co administration with TQ). The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TQ when co-administered with the chosen ACTs (AL and DHA + PQP), administered concomitantly in healthy subjects. Specifically, the study will evaluate whether there are drug-drug interactions between TQ and each of the ACTs and if these interactions are considered to be clinically significant. The co-primary objectives of this study are to characterize both the effects of a 300 milligram (mg) single dose of TQ on the pharmacokinetics; changes in (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to time t) AUC (0-t), AUC (0-infinity), and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of each of the two Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACT) according to their prescribed dose when co-administered as well as the effects of the ACTs on the PK of TQ. A total of 120 subjects (24 subjects in each of 5 cohorts) are planned to be enrolled in order to ensure a target sample size of at least 22 subjects completing the study per cohort. All subjects will arrive in the unit at least 24 hours prior to dosing and be discharged after 72-hour post first dose assessments have been completed. Subjects will return for outpatient visits on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 after first dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s), which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Subjects whose laboratory values are outside the normal ranges will be excluded from enrolment. Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). QTcF &lt;440 milliseconds (msec) based on averaged corrected QT interval (QTc) values of triplicate electrocardiogram (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period at screening and no history of additional risk factors for Torsades des Pointes (e.g., heart failure or family history of Long QT Syndrome). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milliinternational units per (MIU)/ millilitre (mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles (pmol)/liter [L]) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.]; Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing AND Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 56days post first dose. OR has only samesex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle. Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 18.5 to 31.0 kilogram/square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive) and body weight between &gt;=36kilogram (kg) and &lt;=100kg. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. The subject's average triplicate (at screening after approximately 5 minutes at rest in the semisupine position) systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 80140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), or diastolic blood pressure is outside the range of 4590mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of 40100 beats per minute (bpm). Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56day period. Lactating females. Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories: Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent to 8 grams (g) of alcohol: a halfpint (approximately 240 mL) of beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. History of thalassaemia; or current or past history of methemoglobinemia or methemoglobin percentage above the reference range at screening. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).
