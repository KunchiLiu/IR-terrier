	<detailed_description>The main hypothesis of this study is that the intake of lipid during hospitalization in neonatology department is associated with neurological development of preterm infants born with a GA &lt; 32 weeks. The other hypotheses are that iron intake and the duration of breastfeeding are also associated with the development of preterm infants. In the previous study EPINUTRI (NCT01486173), the development of infants was evaluated until the age of 1 year. EPINUTRI_3 is the follow-up of EPINUTRI until the age of 3 years. The aim of EPINUTRI_3 study is to determine the association between lipid intake during hospitalization in neonatology department of preterm infants born with a GA &lt; 32 weeks. The secondary objective is : - to evaluate the association between these factors and communication, developmental and social-emotional delays with the test " Ages and Stages questionnaire " (ASQ) at 3 years of age.</detailed_description>
