	<detailed_description>This survey was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term use (96 weeks) of leuprorelin acetate 3 months depot injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg Injection Kit) in prostate cancer participants in daily medical practice. For adults, 11.25 mg of leuprorelin acetate is usually administered subcutaneously once every 12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle pointed upward, allowing the entire suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the powder. The powder is then fully suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not generated.</detailed_description>
