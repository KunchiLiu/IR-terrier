	<brief_summary>the aim of the study is to determine if Spontaneous Ventilation with Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) preoxygenation allows a longer non hypoxemic apnea time during panendoscopy compared to spontaneous breathing preoxygenation. the hypothesis is PPV extends the residual functional capacity of lung so it provides more oxygen during apnea.</brief_summary>
