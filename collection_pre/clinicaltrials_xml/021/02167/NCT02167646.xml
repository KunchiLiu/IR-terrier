	<brief_summary>Sensory coverage in the finger continues to be a challenging problem. This study reports sensory reconstruction of the fingers with the bilaterally innervated dorsal digital flaps and compares the results between the dual- and single-innervated flaps.The main evaluated outcomes are static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the flap, fingertip pain and joint motion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pain was given subjectively by the patient using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS consists of a 10 cm line that was grouped into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe (7-10 cm). Tinel's sign was rated as the following: grade 1=none; grade 2=mild, slight tingle; grade 3=moderate, very uncomfortable; and grade 4=severe, patient unable to use hand because of any stimulation of the neuroma.</detailed_description>
