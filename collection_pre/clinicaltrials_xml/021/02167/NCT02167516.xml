	<brief_summary>Complementary and alternative medicine has been employed over thousands of years to relieve knee Osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Xinfeng Capsule, a patent Chinese herbal medicine, has been used in the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) Some studies involving animal subjects may explored its mechanism. However, presently, there is a lack of large-sample, multicenter, randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the effects of Xinfeng Capsule treated for KOA. Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Xinfeng Capsule in the treatment of KOA.</brief_summary>
