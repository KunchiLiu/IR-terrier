	<brief_summary>To compare Combigan BID vs Simbrinza TID in subjects currently being treated with Latanoprost for Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension. Both of these drugs are currently FDA approved as combination therapy for patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension. The purpose of this clinical trial would be to assess which treatment, if either, is superior in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). A secondary objective is to assess the tolerability of each drug.</brief_summary>
