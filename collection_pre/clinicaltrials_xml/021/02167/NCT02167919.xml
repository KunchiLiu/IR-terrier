	<brief_summary>Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and refractory lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in decreasing the volume of the prostate gland. Participants: Study participants will be recruited from UNC Urology clinics as well as referring providers. We will include 15 men who are experiencing LUTS not controlled by medication with estimated prostate gland weight between 80 and 150 grams. Procedures (methods): Enrolled patients will undergo the standard work-up for a surgical prostate procedure. In addition, the patient's arteries will be evaluated with a pelvic CT angiogram. Then, patients will undergo prostatic artery embolization. Follow up visits will be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. At the end of the follow-up period, if reduction in prostate gland size has made the patient eligible for transurethral therapy, they may proceed to such procedure or elect to undergo no further surgical procedure, depending on residual symptoms. Similarly, if insufficient gland size reduction has occurred, the patient may elect to pursue OP or no further procedure if they are no longer bothered by LUTS.</brief_summary>
