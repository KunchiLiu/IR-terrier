	<brief_summary>This study aims to test the hypothesis that jailed-balloon technique(JBT) is superior to jailed-wire technique(JWT) in non-left main coronary bifurcation percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) by lowering the risk of side branch(SB) loss and PCI related myocardial infarction, as well as 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events(MACEs).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Objective: To compare the protective effect between JBT and JWT during PCI for non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions. 2. Background: Solid evidence is scant to compare the protective effect between JBT and JWT during PCI for non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions. 3. Study design: This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study. 4. Methods 4a. Study populations: Patients with non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions(Medina 1,1,1 ), which SBs are less than 2.5mm and more than 1mm, are enrolled in this study. Patients are randomized to JBT group and JWT group. 4b. Procedure: For patients enrolled in JBT group, a monorail balloon is placed at the ostium of SB to protect the SB before the stent in main branch(MB) is deployed. Only a PTCA wire would be placed in the SB while stenting MB for patients randomized in JWT group. Only drug-eluting stent should be implanted in the target vessel.</detailed_description>
