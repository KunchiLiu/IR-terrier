	<brief_summary>The current standard treatment of inoperable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer in the liver) is chemotherapy, which is of limited efficacy. The use of selective internal radiotherapy treatment (SIRT-Y90) is proven efficacious in patients with intra-heptic tumor. Previous experience with SIRT is safe in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This study aims to study the benefits of sequential administration of SIRT followed by standard chemotherapy for treatment of inoperable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
