	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I study. The purpose of this study is to determine what is the best dose of the study drug BYL719 in combination with the study drug LJM716 and traztuzumab (Herceptin®). The study will test the safety of the combination of these three drugs, and to find out the effects, good and/or bad, that these three drugs have on the patient and breast cancer.</brief_summary>

Eligibility will not be affected by hormone receptor status. For the doseescalation phase, a PIK3CA mutation is also required. MSKCC or outside documentation is acceptable. There is no upper limit on prior chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or endocrine therapy. HER2+ patients must have received pertuzumab and TDM1 (adotrastuzumab emtansine) prior to trial enrollment. unless deemed ineligible for these therapies, and with the exceptions listed below: Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior pertuzumab are eligible if: heavily pretreated prior to FDA approval of pertuzumab (6/8/2012) for firstline treatment of HER2+ MBC Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not received adotrastuzumab emtansine are eligible if: heavily pretreated prior to FDA approval of adotrastuzumab emtansine (2/22/2013) for the treatment of patients with HER2+ MBC who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane separately or in combination For the doseescalation phase, measurable or nonmeasurable disease per RECIST criteria v1.1 is permitted.

Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 8 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

Highly effective contraception methods include: i. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception ii. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject. iv. Combination of the following methods: 1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Note: Postmenopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they are: Aged ≥60; or aged &lt; 60 and have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous, in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression) amenorrhea with and FSH and estradiol in the postmenopausal range (serum FSH &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt;10 pg/mL or according to the postmenopausal range definition for the local laboratory involved) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) For women with therapyinduced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status. NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression.</criteria>
