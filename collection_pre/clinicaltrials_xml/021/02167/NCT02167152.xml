	<brief_title>Ischemic Preconditioning to Prevent Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic preconditioning is thought to work by down-regulating pro-inflammatory gene expression and up-regulating anti-inflammatory gene expression in leukocytes. There is a local release of vasodilators, including adenosine and nitric oxide that are thought to have renal protective effects [16]. More is known regarding ischemic preconditioning in the heart, where it has been shown to decrease the adenine nucleotide pool, increase creatine phosphate and intracellular glucose, decrease ATP depletion, and lactate and H+ accumulation. This leads to sodium maintenance of the transmembrane sodium gradient that prevents intracellular edema. Ischemic preconditioning is thought to yield protection in the first minutes of reperfusion. Activation of the adenosine A1, bradykinin, and opioid receptors is thought to trigger protection. This is supported by the interference with protection if an adenosine receptor antagonist is administered. The role of reactive oxygen species as part of the protective mechanism has also been described via mitochondrial mKATP channels which lead to increased production of protective superoxide. Protein kinase C may also be involved in the protective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning, however the exact mechanism is unknown and controversial.</detailed_description>
