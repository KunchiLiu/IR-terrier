	<detailed_description>This is an observational study with retrospective and prospective parts. In retrospective part be included the Patients followed between 1992 and January 2011. In prospective part will follow the Patients will be included after the starting of study.

Number of patients include in the part retrospective : Center N°1-300adults Center N°2-90childrens Number of patients include in the part prospective : Center N°1- 90 Center N°2- 30 Duration of study is 3 years Duration of inclusion is 32 months Each patient will be followed for 4 months and for further up to 3 years from the first patient included. We envision a next circuit : obtaining consent, preoperative consultation,surgery, postoperative consultation N°1, postoperative consultation N°2, genetics consultation and monitoring of patients in 6;12;18;24 months from surgery of tumor and limited in 3 years from th 1st patient included.</detailed_description>
