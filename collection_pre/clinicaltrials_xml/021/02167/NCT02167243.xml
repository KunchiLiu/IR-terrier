	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral economic intervention to improve self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adolescents and young adults with T1D. The intervention will reinforce patients for conducting SMBG, with escalating reinforcers provided when patients achieved sustained periods of testing at least 4 times/day at appropriate intervals. A 6-month trial will be conducted in which 60 patients will be randomized to: (1) standard care or (2) standard care plus the reinforcement intervention.</brief_summary>
