	<brief_summary>Patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA) have an increase overall mortality compared to the general population, mainly due to cardiovascular diseases. OA patients without cardiovascular risk have a 10 years cardiovascular events higher of around 15-30 %. Although the molecular mechanisms are still not well known, the structure and function of the vessel wall can be affected by several inflammatory and metabolic parameters during OA.These functional and structural changes of the arterial wall leads to arterial stiffness, measured by the pulse-wave velocity (PWV). PWV is the most widely used technique to assess arterial stiffness and has been shown to have predictive value for morbidity and mortality. In our study, we planned to compare arterial stiffness in OA patients with healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
