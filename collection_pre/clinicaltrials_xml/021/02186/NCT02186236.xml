	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether gene mutations can be found in the urine or blood of lung cancer patients and urine of colorectal cancer patients. Gene mutations are when DNA in a gene is damaged in a way that changes the genetic message carried by that gene. Gene mutations can sometimes cause lung cancers. These gene mutations are only found in lung and colorectal cancer cells, not the normal cells in your body. All lung cancer tumors and colorectal cancer tumors are now tested for different gene mutations as their presence affects lung cancer treatment. Tumor samples obtained from a biopsy or surgery are typically tested for these gene mutations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Lung cancer: For patients participating in Part A (initial testing) and Part B (serial testing): Patients must have a diagnosis of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma undergoing systemic therapy. Patients must have had or intend to have EGFR mutation testing (specifically including exon 19 deletions and L858R) performed on their tumor with results available from a CLIA certified laboratory. â‰¥ 18 years of age Specific to patients participating in Part B (serial testing): Patients must be planning to receive cancer care at MemorialSloan Kettering. Patients must have a confirmed EGFR mutant lung cancer (exon 19 deletions and L858R) with molecular testing results available from a CLIA certified laboratory. Must be within 3 months of their diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer. Treatment plan should include an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but may concurrently be on a therapeutic protocol. Colorectal Cancer: For patients participating in Part A (initial testing) and Part B (serial testing): Patients must have a diagnosis of stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma undergoing systemic therapy or have recently progressed on therapy including antiEGFR based therapy. Patients must have had or intend to have RAS/RAF mutation testing on their tumor with results available from a CLIA certified laboratory. For the patients who recently progressed on antiEGFR must have tumor tissue molecular analyses preformed (prior to enrolling or a plan to test it at the time of enrollment). &gt;18 years of age Specific to patients participating in Part B (serial testing): Patients must be planning to receive cancer care at MemorialSloan Kettering. Patients must have a confirmed RAS/RAF mutant colorectal cancer with molecular testing results available from a CLIA certified laboratory. Must be within 3 months of their diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer. lung cancer and colorectal cancer Comorbidities that would prohibit or make serial urine collection difficult or impossible</criteria>
