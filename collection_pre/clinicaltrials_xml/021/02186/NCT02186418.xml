	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether transfer of a fetal hemoglobin gene using a lentivirus vector (gene transfer) into human blood making cells is safe and feasible in patients with sickle cell disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Transfer for Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose is also to determine if this kind of gene transfer works in getting the body to make red blood cells that don't sickle in patients with sickle cell disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed sickle cell disease that is severe Failed hydroxyurea therapy, were unable to tolerate hydroxyurea therapy, or, if 18 years of age or older, have actively made the choice to not take the recommended daily hydroxyurea. Patients who are unable to take hydroxyurea due to financial or safety monitoring constraints are eligible.
