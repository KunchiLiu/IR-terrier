	<mesh_term>Ceritinib</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except ALK+ NSCLC) or hematological malignancy and is in need of treatment because of radiologic progression or relapse. Patient must have been preidentified as having a tumor with an ALK or ROS1 positive mutation, translocation, rearrangement or amplification. The qualifying alteration must be assessed and reported by a CLIAcertified laboratory. ALK positivity as assessed by IHC or FISH are allowed. Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and/or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated to result in a durable remission. Patient has progressive and measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 or other appropriate hematological guidelines. Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1. Patient has received prior treatment with ceritinib. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases who are neurologically unstable or have required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to study entry to manage CNS symptoms. Patient has received chemotherapy or anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea, monoclonal antibodies or mitomycinC) prior to starting study drug.</criteria>
