	<brief_summary>Traditional standard treatments of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not perfect for fighting cancer. Many people do not respond to the standard treatments of ALL. One possible treatment is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell infusions. Third generation CAR-T which contains Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28) and Cluster of Differentiation 137 (CD137) has stronger effect of anti-tumor capacity compare with second generation CAR-T. The investigators believe that the cells with CD28 and CD137 will have a better chance of killing the lymphoma cells. In the lab, the investigators constructed a third generation CAR containing both CD28 and CD137. The investigators start Phase I study aimed to chemotherapy resistant or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of third generation CAR-T cells in patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Third generation CAR-T has stronger effect of anti-tumor capacity. While people have been able to control the clinical complications now, so conducting third generation CAR-T clinical trials has a strong demand and value. The investigators construct a third generation CAR containing both CD28 and CD137.</detailed_description>
