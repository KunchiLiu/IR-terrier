	<detailed_description>The study was designed to be an open, 5-year, prospective, multi-center clinical post-market study. The objectives of this clinical study were that industrial centrally produced 3- or 4-unit bridges of yttrium-oxide partially-stabilized (Y-TZP) zirconia (Procera Zirconia) in combination with the veneering ceramic material NobelRondo will show sufficient CDA ratings (90% R+S) and a sufficient survival rate after 1 and 5 years.</detailed_description>
