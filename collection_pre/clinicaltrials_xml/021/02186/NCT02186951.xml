	<brief_summary>Mild therapeutic hypothermia is currently recommended in management of cardiac arrests with shockable rhythm. In mechanically ventilated patients who were resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, mild therapeutic hypothermia side effects are conductive for infectious complications and especially for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite high incidence of VAP and other infectious complications, it is not currently recommended to use antibiotic prophylaxis on the responsible germs. Yet VAP incidence could be decreased if an antibiotic therapy was systematically given to patient treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia after a cardiac arrest. Several retrospective studies showed less infectious complications but also decreased morbidity and mortality related to these complications when antibiotic therapy was given early to patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>
