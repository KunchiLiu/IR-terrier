	<brief_summary>To answer the question whether a disease specific profile of breath in patients with COPD can be detected by an untargeted metabolomic study using exhaled breath analysis by mass spectrometry.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breath Analysis in Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study comparing the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath between COPD patients and matched control subjects (age, gender, smoking-state). 40 COPD patients (20 non-frequent, 20 frequent exacerbators) and 40 matched controls will be examined by SESI-MS on the composition of exhaled breath for identification of COPD specific markers.</detailed_description>
