	<brief_title>Telephone Support From Primary Care for Breastfeeding Mothers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding to infants until 6 months of age in order to achieve optimum growth. The proportion of exclusive breastfeeding mothers at 6 months is only 24.7 in Spain. The investigators believe it is important to increase the proportion of breastfeeding mothers in their population. Therefore, the investigators have developed a telephonic support protocol for mothers. The intervention will be performed by pediatric nurses in Primary Care. The main aim of this study is to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial the effectiveness of telephone-based breastfeeding support in exclusive breastfeeding. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the telephonic support in any breastfeeding. The investigators hypothesis is that this intervention will increase exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding rates. The study will be carried out in Cornell√†, a semi-urban area near Barcelona. Participants will include breastfeeding women who have full-term healthy infants. Mothers will be recruited upon their first arrival to Primary Care from hospital. Eligible mothers who consent to participate will be randomized into either the intervention group or the control group. The latter will receive standard postpartum care. The former will receive standard postpartum care, plus a weekly telephone call during the first two months and every 2 weeks thereafter between the second and the sixth month. The pediatric nurse responsible for monitoring the standard care of each and every patient will be the one responsible for contacting them via telephone. Therefore, the study is not blinded. The evolution of exclusive breastfeeding will be compared to artificial or supplemented feeding at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months. The effect of the intervention on breastfeeding supplemented with formula will also be valued. Classification into breastfeeding categories is based on 24-hour dietary recall.</detailed_description>
