	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory study on the metabolic endotoxemia associated with type 2 diabetes. The investigators will measure systemic endotoxin level and lipid level after ingestion of high fat diet to evaluate the effect of gemigliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, on metabolic endotoxemia and lipemia induced by high fat diet.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subjects will be allocated to either gemigliptin or placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of wash out period, all subjects will be switched to the opposite arm. The subjects will be tested oral fat tolerance test and adipose tissue needle biopsy(only for the subjects who agreed to participate donate adipose tissue) at 3 time points: the start of 1st treatment, end of 1st treatment and end of 2nd treatment.</detailed_description>
