	<brief_summary>Severe vitamin D deficiency can be treated with oral loading doses of cholecalciferol. Our objective was to determine how to calculate the quantity of cholecalciferol needed for supplementation by single algorithm, usable on a patient-to-patient basis. We've conducted two studies. Study 1 was done retroactively and included 88 patients treated for low vitamin D, 60 of those with a loading dose. The second study included 29 patients and aimed to test the validity of an algorithm based on data from study 1, which included patient BMI. Both studies used oral loading doses and daily supplementation of cholecalciferol.</brief_summary>
