	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this prospective, randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of chewing gum on the return of bowel function in a group of patients undergoing spinal surgery with a group of matched controls that do not receive any chewing gum. A 24-hour reduction in time to passage of first flatus will be considered an important clinical difference. The research questions are: 1. Does providing chewing gum post-operatively hasten the return of bowel function? 2. Does providing chewing gum post-operatively reduced overall length of stay? 3. Does providing chewing gum post-operatively have any associated complications? 4. Does providing chewing gum post-operatively result in higher objective outcomes scores? The secondary aims are: 1. To compare hospital length of stay between the groups with a mean of Â½ day considered clinically important. 2. To compare time until tolerating regular diet as defined as two consecutive meals with no complications with 24 hours considered statistically significant. 3. To compare incidence and nature of complications between the two groups. 4. To compare the time until completion of rehab milestones with 1 day being considered clinically important. 5. To compare the requirement for nutrition evaluations 6. To compare SF-12 scores as a marker of patient satisfaction with a difference of 10 points or more measured between the two groups upon discharge from hospital and at six-weeks after surgery.</brief_summary>
