	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test two new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) sequences to see how they compare to previously used imaging sequences as they may improve the quality of abdominal MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T2 Weighted Imaging of the Liver With Fast Spin Echo MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Approximately 50 patients undergoing routine liver MRI in our practice imaged with one of our 4 clinical scanners will undergo our standard liver MRI protocol with the addition of 2 breath-hold sequences (FSE Flex and eSSFSE) only increasing the scan time by approximately 3 minutes. - Data will be retrieved from examinations that have been performed from the patient's electronic imaging file stored in our picture archiving and communication system (PACS). - Images will be completely anonymized. No patient identifiers will be available on the images during the analysis. - Analyses will include the visual assessment of image quality, presence and severity of imaging artifact and other non-invasive imaging outcomes performed by radiologists blinded to patient information and the type of sequence performed. Data will be presented in a Likert type scale (1=poor, 2=suboptimal, 3=average, 4=above average and 5=excellent) and imaging parameters will be compared using the Wilcoxon sign rank test.</detailed_description>
