	<brief_summary>Pneumonia is the second common infection and its risk increases for elderly. In this population, it is the first cause of mortality by infections, and source of many complications. Geriatric studies had shown the high prevalence of ascorbic acid 's deficiency, especially in older hospitalized people. It is well known that vitamin C is one of the key of the immune system, it has a scavenger's role in case of aggression like sepsis. A Cochrane database published in 2013 analyzed the impact of vitamin C for preventing and treating pneumonia. Two randomized studies showed a benefit on respiratory symptoms for patients treated by vitamin C, and for one of those studies it was noted a significant reduction of mortality. The main objective of our study is first to determine the impact on respiratory symptoms of an adjuvant treatment by vitamin C for the management of pneumonia in older people hospitalized, and then evaluate its impact on functional status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is French non-comparative phase II clinical trial, double-blind randomized, with placebo, single-center. One group would be treated the placebo group, and another would receive an adjuvant treatment by vitamin C : 500 mg twice a day by intra-venous way from the first day to the second included, and then 500 mg twice a day by oral way from the third day to the seventh. For each patient, the study's duration is 7 days, which is the mean stay of hospitalization. During those 7 days, we will make clinical exams and blood tests at d0, d2, d4 and d7. The vitamin C blood level will be measured at d0 and d7.</detailed_description>
