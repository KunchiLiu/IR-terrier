	<brief_summary>The improvement in inspiratory muscle function might result in beneficial changes in breathing pattern during whole body exercise. The hypothesis is the effect of inspiratory muscle training as an adjunct to a pulmonary rehabilitation program improves the breathing pattern during an incremental cycle exercise.</brief_summary>
