	<brief_title>Physiological Intermolecular Modification Spectroscopy (PIMS) in Ulcerative Colitis With Golimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is widely appreciated that almost all proteins and other biological macromolecular in vivo exist, at least transiently, as components of structural and functional complexes. This transient interaction in simple component solutions have been studied using well established daylight light scattering (LS) method which reflects molecular oscillation (7-12). Protein association, protein unfolding, protein aggregation and cellular crowding are known to affect the normal function of cellular system (13-19). In many cases, the resulting small changes in normal protein-protein intra- and intermolecular interactions are thought to lead to a variety of human diseases (20, 21). Based on these and the acquired knowledge on LS, the cutting edge technology, PIMS has been developed. PIMS is a label free technology that is able to study protein-protein and protein-solvent interactions in multi-component solutions. It provides individual real time dynamic fingerprint of total physiological macromolecular assemblies in a tissue in presence and absence of exogenous molecules (drug or drug candidate, peptide or protein). This technology is based on dynamic molecular resonance of proteins and macromolecules. Cellular extracts in physiological conditions are frozen at -37°C. Macromolecular spectra are registered as the temperature within the sample raises from -37 to 37°C. This provides, within the organ of interest, dynamic fingerprint of an individual entire macromolecular assemblies. The present technology can therefore rapidly and specifically determine the response of a tissue or cell when an exogenous molecule is administrated. It reflects patient molecular capacity to respond to the drugs effect and allows to identifying different subpopulations within a group in response to a specific treatment. It highlights the responders from non-responders to a given treatment.</detailed_description>
