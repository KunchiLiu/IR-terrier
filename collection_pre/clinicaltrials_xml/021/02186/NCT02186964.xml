	<brief_summary>Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of intergluteal sulcus. The disease seen in between 15-35 years of age and 3-4 times more in males. The incidence of the disease is found as 8.8% in Turkish soldiers. The disorder mainly affects the quality of life. There are numerous methods in surgical treatment of Pilonidal sinus. The main difference in between those methods is the closing of the defect that occurs after the excision of the sinus tract. The defect can be closed by primary sutures or it can be left for secondary healing. Nowadays, the recurrence rate of flap procedures are lower therefore, flap procedures are commonly used. However, it has been reported that there is no difference between flap procedures and tension free primary closure. This result triggered the controversy that; if the healing side is tension free, midline suturing may have no importance. The aim of this study is to compare the results of 3 different surgical procedures used in treatment of pilonidal disease.</brief_summary>
