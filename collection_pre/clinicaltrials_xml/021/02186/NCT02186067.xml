	<brief_summary>Hypertension has become a public health concern worldwide due to its significant contribution to the global health burden and its role as a prominent risk factor for the development of a number of chronic diseases such as Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the leading cause of mortality in Pakistan and Worldwide. According to WHO, about 7.5 million deaths worldwide is attributable to hypertension i.e. about 12.8% of the total of all deaths. This accounts for 57 million disability adjusted life years (DALYS) or 3.7% of total DALYS. Studies suggest that hypertension is among the top five most common presenting complaints to private general practice clinics. Therefore, primary care physicians/Family physicians are the first line service providers and; thus it is important to manage hypertensive patients early, through lifestyle and treatment interventions that may prevent the complications such as development of CVDs etc.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Individuals aged 40 years or over visiting the selected IMS centre with known hypertension or with consistently elevated BP on two separate visits (mean of last two of three measurements of systolic pressure ≥140 mm Hg or mean diastolic pressure ≥90 mm Hg) or already receiving treatment will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Those patients who require intensive care unit or coronary care unit admissions, or are diagnosed to have cognitive impairment, are agitated due to severe pain, nonresident of Karachi, or having language barrier will be excluded from the study. A screening form will be designed for the collection of the above mentioned information. The rationale of excluding all the participants with above mentioned condition is that the participants having these health concerns will either not be able to respond to our questionnaire or their presence may confound our results.</criteria>
