	<brief_summary>Quetiapine, a second generation antipsychotic, is only available as oral tablets. However, topical and rectal formulations have been produced in compounding pharmacies. There is no data available suggesting that topical or rectal formulations provide serum levels similar to oral medication. In the clinical setting, when oral administration of quetiapine is not possible (for example, when a patient is extremely ill physically or mentally or both), clinicians and pharmacists have collaborated in such cases and have at times had to administer quetiapine compounded in other dosage formulations such as rectal or topical formulations. Despite clinical effectiveness of these &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; formulations, there are no available studies that have investigated blood levels of the drug other than the oral form. The investigators are therefore designing this pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the the systemic absorption of quetiapine in oral, rectal and topical formulations. If the investigators are able to demonstrate detectable levels from rectal and topical quetiapine formulations compared to the oral form, this knowledge will enhance clinical psychiatric practice by providing a more broad route of administration for quetiapine which is a commonly used drug for psychiatric symptoms.</brief_summary>
