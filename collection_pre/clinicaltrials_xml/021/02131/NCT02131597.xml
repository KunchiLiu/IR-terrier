	<brief_title>SGI-110 in Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive injections of SGI-110 under the skin 5 days every study cycle. Each study cycle is 4-8 weeks depending on how you tolerate the drug and how the disease responds to it. The study staff will tell you how often you should receive the drug. You will need to stay in Houston to receive the study drug, but you may return home after you have finished your dose for each cycle. When you have study visits where you are not receiving study drug (described below), the tests performed at these visits can be performed by your local doctor. Study Visits: On Day 1 of every cycle, you will have a physical exam. At Cycle 1, this will not be needed if the screening physical exam was performed within 2 days before this visit. Every week during the first cycle, and then every 2-8 weeks after that, blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. The study doctor will tell you how often you need to have these tests performed. At the end of Cycle 1 and/or 2, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease. If the disease does not appear to have gotten better by the end of Cycle 2, your next bone marrow aspirate will depend on the results of your blood tests. These samples will also be used for cytogenetic testing. Cytogenetic testing looks at how changes to cell DNA (genetic material) may affect how the disease may react to the study drug. Length of Study: You will be on study for up to 24 cycles (about 2-4 years). You will no longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Follow-up Visits: About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, and then about every 2 months after that, you will be called by a member of the study team and asked how you are feeling. Each call should last about 10 minutes. This is an investigational study. SGI-110 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug are designed to work. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with higher risk MDS (IPSS int2 or high; or &gt;/= 10% blasts as defined by WHO). No prior intensive chemotherapy or highdose cytarabine (&gt;/= 1 g/m2). Prior biologic therapies (&lt;/= 1 cycle of prior decitabine or azacitidine), targeted therapies, or single agent chemotherapy is allowed. Off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to entering this study with no toxic effects of that therapy, unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease. Hydroxyurea is permitted for control of counts prior to treatment. Hematopoietic growth factors are allowed. 2. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 3. ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2. 4. Have adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL) 5. Serum bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 6. Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN 7. Alkaline phosphatase &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN 8. Provide signed written informed consent. 9. Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the study, and able to provide valid informed consent. 10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to entering this study. 11. Women who are able to become pregnant and men who can father a child must use birth control while on study and for at least 8 weeks after your last dose of study drug(s). Acceptable birth control includes a condom or a diaphragm with spermicidal jelly; and birth control methods that are taken by mouth, injected, or implanted. If you are already using birth control, you must check with the study staff to make sure that it is considered one of the acceptable forms to use in this study. 1. Current concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy other than as specified in the protocol. 2. Use of investigational agents within 30 days or any anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to entering this study with the exception of hydroxyurea. The patient must have recovered from all acute toxicities from any previous therapy. 3. Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver, or other organ system that may place the patient at undue risk to undergo treatment. 4. Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment). 5. Pregnant or lactating patients. 6. Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up, or interpretation of study results. 7. Any concurrent malignancy (with the exception of exclusion # 8) 8. Exceptions to # 7: a) Patients with treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the diseasefree duration, are eligible for this study if definitive treatment for the condition has been completed; b) Patients with organconfined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostatespecific antigen (PSA) values are also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical prostatectomy has been performed.</criteria>
