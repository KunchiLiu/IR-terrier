	<detailed_description>Design. EPIOSA is a 5-yr non-interventional longitudinal prospective study being conducted at the Sleep Clinic of the Hospital Miguel Servet, a large teaching hospital in Zaragoza (Spain). Following a baseline visit, subjects are to be followed-up at 3 months, and then every year. Subject participation. The investigators will enroll a total 300 consecutive OSA male patients aged 20-60 yrs, with baseline apnea-hypopnea index â‰¥ 5 events per hour of sleep (AHI). In addition, 50 control subjects (AHI &lt; 5) aged 20-60 yrs and matched by body mass index (BMI) are also to be recruited. Exclusion criteria will include any comorbid condition including alcohol and tobacco use. Measurements: Routine clinical assessment, full sleep study, bilateral carotid ultrasonography, biochemistry, circulating inflammatory cytokines, T cell subsets and epigenetics studies at baseline and every year until at least 5 years of follow-up.</detailed_description>
