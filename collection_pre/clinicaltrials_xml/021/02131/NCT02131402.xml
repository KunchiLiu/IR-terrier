	<brief_summary>The aim of this non-dispensing fitting study is to evaluate the subjective comfort, lens handling, lens fitting characteristics and visual acuity of different hydrogel lens designs versus silicone hydrogel lenses</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of Hydrogel vs. Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 60-subject, double masked, randomized, contra lateral, non-dispensing fitting trial comparing different lens materials (hydrogel vs silicone hydrogel). It is anticipated that this study will involve 2 visits, for each lens pair, as follows: Visits: V1 (lens dispensing), V2 (1 hour post lens settling). Each subject will be randomized to wear the test and control lenses in a series of three short fitting comparisons.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Is between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive) Has had a selfreported visual exam in the last two years Is an adapted soft CL (Contact Lens) wearer Has a CL spherical prescription between 1.00 and 10.00 (inclusive) Has a spectacle cylinder up to 0.75D (Diopter) in each eye. Can achieve best corrected spectacle distance visual acuity of 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) or better in each eye. Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMAR) or better in each eye with the study contact lenses. Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease Has read, understood and signed the information consent letter Patient contact lens refraction should fit within the available parameters of the study lenses Is willing to comply with the wear schedule Is willing to comply with the visit schedule Has never worn contact lenses before. Currently wears rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Has a history of not achieving comfortable CL wear (5 days per week; &gt; 8 hours/day) Has a CL prescription outside the range of 1.00 to 10.00D Has a spectacle cylinder â‰¥1.00D of cylinder in either eye. Has contact lens best corrected distance vision worse than 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) in either eye. Presence of clinically significant (grade 24) anterior segment abnormalities. Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medications which might interfere with contact lens wear. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as: Pathological dry eye or associated findings Pterygium, pinguecula, or corneal scars within the visual axis Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from of the limbus Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GCP) worse than grade 1 Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present) Seborrheic eczema, Seborrheic conjunctivitis History of corneal ulcers or fungal infections Poor personal hygiene Has a known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity) Has aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea. Has Presbyopia or has dependence on spectacles for near work over the contact lenses. Has undergone corneal refractive surgery. Is participating in any other type of eye related clinical or research study.</criteria>
