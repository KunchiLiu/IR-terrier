	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to help determine if the cuff of an endotracheal tube ( ETT) ( also known as a breathing tube)can be seen by ultrasound and to determine if visualization of this tube corresponds with correct tube depth. You are being asked to participate because you will be undergoing a cardiac catherization procedure which will involve endotracheal intubation. Ultrasound is a safe technology that your doctor could possibly use to see the breathing tube. Right now, x-rays, which come with their own risks, are being used for this purpose. We are trying to see if we can avoid using x-rays. This is a local study with 1 location. The study will enroll a total of 71 people. There is no sponsor for this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you enter the study, in the cardiac catheterization lab, after the anesthesiologist has done his part (placed the breathing tube while you are asleep and obtained the x-ray), we will use the ultrasound to check the position of the breathing tube. To help us see the breathing tube better, we will put some fluid in the cuff ( the balloon at the tip of the breathing tube). The tube may be repositioned as needed based on the chest x-ray. The entire procedure is estimated to take no more than 10 minutes.</detailed_description>
