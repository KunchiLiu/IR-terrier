	<brief_summary>In this randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm study, Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) plus Perjeta (pertuzumab) will be compared to chemotherapy plus Herceptin (trastuzumab) plus Perjeta in the treatment of operable HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive either of the following neoadjuvant treatments for a total of six 3-week cycles: Arm A: Docetaxel + carboplatin + Herceptin + Perjeta Arm B: Kadcyla + Perjeta Following treatment, patients will undergo surgery. After recovery, patients will be given the following adjuvant treatment: Arm A: Herceptin + Perjeta Arm B: Kadcyla + Perjeta Treatment can be stopped due to disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Study is expected to last approximately 45 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>age &gt;/= 18 years Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor size of &gt; 2 cm HER2positive breast cancer Patients with multifocal tumors (more than one tumor confined to the same quadrant as the primary tumor) if all sampled lesions are centrally confirmed as HER2positive Stage at presentation: cT2cT4, cN0cN3, cM0 Known hormone receptor status of the primary tumor Patient agreement to undergo mastectomy or breastconserving surgery after neoadjuvant therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Baseline LVEF &gt;55% measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) Effective contraception as defined by protocol Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer Patients who have received prior anticancer therapy for breast cancer except those patients with a history of breast lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) that was surgically managed or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated exclusively with mastectomy.
