	<brief_title>Hand Hygiene Randomized Cluster Intervention to Reduce Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if a simple random cluster intervention trial to improve hand hygiene, consisting of a 3-4 minute training video, on-site posters, and hand hygiene supplies, can reduce respiratory and GI illness among those in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention was performed among employees in a Midwestern public government setting. Employees in the treatment group received a 3-4 minute training video online that was embedded in the baseline survey. Motivational posters from the USDHHS encouraging proper hand hygiene were installed in the workplace, along with hand hygiene supplies. The control group received a program called "Ask Me 3" developed by the National Patient Safety Foundation; the intervention consisted of a 3-4 minute training video to encourage clear communication with their health care providers, a brochure discussing the Ask Me 3 principles of clear communication with health care providers, and a key-ring with the Ask Me 3 communication principles to promote more effective communication with health care providers at visits out side of work. The groups were followed monthly through surveys over the Internet for an average of three months after baseline to determine if a relative reduction in self-reported respiratory / GI infections occurred in the intervention group compared to the control group.</detailed_description>
