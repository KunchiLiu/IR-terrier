	<brief_title>Efficacy of Inhalation Technique Training.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both asthma and COPD are common medical problems. Pharmacologic treatment of asthma and COPD is based mainly on inhalations. The inhalation technique is the key factor for effective management of bronchial obstruction. At the same time, a significant proportion of patients with asthma or COPD do not use inhalers properly. The aim of the study is: - to analyze the frequency and type of common mistakes in inhalation technique and - to determine the impact of short individual training of inhalation technique on the course of asthma and COPD. Fifty patients with asthma and 50 patients with COPD treated in the out-patient clinic or in the Department of Internal Medicine, Pneumonology and Allergology will be enrolled to the study. The stage of severity (COPD) and control of the disease (asthma), quality of life, proper inhaler intake will be assessed at the study onset and at a second visit after 6 months. At the second visit all patients will get a short, individual information about the etiology, course and general treatment plan of asthma / COPD. Patients will be randomized into two groups: A. group of patients trained in proper inhalation technique B. group of patients without inhalation technique training Control visits will be held 3 and 6 months after training.</detailed_description>
