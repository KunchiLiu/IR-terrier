	<brief_summary>The trial will test the effectiveness and toxicity of subcutaneous treatment with one cycle of cladribine in patients with hairy cell leukemia requiring treatment. They have to be untreated so far or may be pretreated with alpha-interferon.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy Optimisation for the Treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluation of remission status will take place 4 months after treatment. In addition, it will be tested whether patients with non-optimal response will have a benefit from a second cycle of cladribine. Non-optimal response is: patients with detectable residual disease; achievement of partial remission or detectable residual infiltration in the bone marrow.</detailed_description>
