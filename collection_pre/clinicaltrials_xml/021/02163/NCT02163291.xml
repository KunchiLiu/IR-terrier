	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer is the second cause of cancer related death and China has the most gastric cancer patients in the world. Although systemic strategies, including adjuvant chemotherapy, postoperative chemoradiotherapy, perioperative chemotherapy, have evolved and showed benefits these years, the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer is still not satisfactory. Optimal regimens and optimal method administration is still being found. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has many advantages, including downstaging the tumor, increasing R0 rate, early eradicating of micrometastasis. In previous trials, combination of paclitaxel and s-1 has showed safety and tolerance in recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer. Using liposome as a carrier, paclitaxel has a better histocompatibility and cellular affinity, resulting a improved stability and reduced toxicity. In this phase II trial, we are going to study the safety and feasibility of paclitaxel liposome plus s-1 as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
