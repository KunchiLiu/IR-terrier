	<brief_title>Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetics of Vedolizumab in Healthy Participants Following Single Subcutaneous Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to determine its bioavailability, safety, and tolerability in the body with three varying doses of vedolizumab SC compared to people who are administered vedolizumab IV. The study will enroll approximately 24 non-Japanese patients and 24 Japanese patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups: - Vedolizumab Intravenous 300 mg - Vedolizumab Subcutaneous 54 mg - Vedolizumab Subcutaneous 108 mg - Vedolizumab Subcutaneous 160 mg All participants will receive the treatment they are assigned on Day 1 of the study. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 196 days. Participants will make 10 visits to the clinic, including one 8 day period of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone at Study Day 168 (+/-3), approximately 6 months after dose for a follow-up questionnaire.</detailed_description>

A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for a minimum of 18 weeks after last dose. 6. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use acceptable methods of contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for a minimum of 18 weeks after last dose. 1. Has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to dosing of study medication or history of treatment with another monoclonal antibody within 6 months to dosing of study medication. 2. Has received vedolizumab in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or in a dependant relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant (CS) neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, immunologic, endocrine disease, or psychiatric disorder, or other abnormality, that may impact the ability of the participant or potentially confound the study results. 5. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of vedolizumab SC or vedolizumab IV. 6. Has one or more positive responses on the progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis (PML) subjective symptom checklist at screening or before dosing on Day 1. 7. Has a positive result for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or Check in (Day 1). 8. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to the Screening visit or is unwilling to agree to abstain from alcohol for 48 hrs prior to Day 1 throughout confinement and for 48 hrs prior to each clinic visit and drugs throughout the study. 9.

There is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking vedolizumab, or a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of this study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias. 12. Had a surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia within 30 days before the initial Screening Visit, or is planning to undergo a surgery that requires general anesthesia during the study period through Final Visit Day 127. 13.
