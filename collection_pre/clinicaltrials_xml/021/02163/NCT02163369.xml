	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to introduce the use of aromatherapy/essential oils to medical oncology patients at Central DuPage Hospital to assess their perceived effectiveness to relieve symptoms of nausea or vomiting and/or anxiety. Peppermint oil will be used for nausea/vomiting and lavender oil will be used for anxiety. This study will involve administration of aromatherapy to a convenience sample of patients, who will then be asked to complete a brief questionnaire. The questionnaire will involve a simple likert scale to measure efficacy (in the opinion of the patient) and simple multiple-choice questions to determine patients' likeliness to use aromatherapy again.</brief_summary>
