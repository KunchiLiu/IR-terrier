	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of KPI-121 in Subjects With Postsurgical Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase III, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses and two dosing regimens of KPI-121 ophthalmic suspension versus placebo in subjects who require treatment of postoperative anterior ocular inflammation. Approximately 500 subjects will be screened and up to 402 subjects with one study eye each will be randomized in this study at approximately 25 centers located in the United States. Subjects who experience postoperative inflammation on the first day following routine, uncomplicated, cataract surgery and who meet all other eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of four study groups (0.25% four times daily or 1.0% two times daily) or Placebo A four times daily or Placebo B two times daily. Drug product or placebo will be initiated on the day following surgery and instilled as one to two drops in the study eye according to the assigned dosing regimen for 14 days. This study will include up to 7 clinic visits (including the surgery day) over 18 to 33 days total study duration. Visit 1 (Screening) will occur between 14 to 1 day(s) prior to surgery, and subjects who meet preoperative screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. At Visit 2 (Surgery/Day 0) subjects will undergo routine cataract surgery according to the Investigator's normal procedures. Visit 3 (Randomization/Day 1) will occur on the day following surgery. Following randomization, subjects will be instructed to return to the clinic to be evaluated at Visit 4 (Day 3 +2 day), Visit 5 (Day 8 ±1 day), and Visit 6 (Day 15 ±1 day). The last dose of study product will be administered upon completion of 14 days of evaluation. Following the End of Study Product Use Visit (Visit 6; Day 15 ±1 day), subjects will be asked to return to the clinic on Day 17-19 for Visit 7 (Follow-Up) and will be released from the study.</detailed_description>
