	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) in children with a history of wheezing or asthma. BJHS is a common syndrome of joint and connective tissue laxity without any other rheumatologic disease. This assessment will be performed by using either method below depending upon if the child has a history of wheezing or severe asthma: 1. Determine the correlation, if there is an increased rate of BJHS in children with a history of wheezing as well as if there is an increased history of wheezing in children with BJHS; or 2. Determine asthma control, lung function and asthma exacerbations (a flare up or acute worsening of symptoms) in children with BJHS compared to children with asthma without BJHS, to assess if it BJHS is associated more with children with severe asthma.</brief_summary>
