	<brief_title>Study of HPV Specific Immunotherapy in Patients With HPV Associated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-3112 [6 mg of VGX-3100 (2 separate DNA plasmids respectively encoding E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 and HPV 18) and 1 mg of INO-9012 (DNA plasmid encoding human interleukin 12)] delivered by electroporation (EP) in up to 25 (twenty five) subjects with HPV positive head and neck cancer. The immunotherapy will be studied in following two groups of subjects: 1. Subjects who will receive immunotherapy before and after definitive surgery (Cohort I) 2. Subjects who will receive immunotherapy at least 2 months after chemoradiation therapy (Cohort II).</detailed_description>

Histologically confirmed HPVpositive (as assessed by p16 IHC or oncogenic HPV ISH or PCR) mucosal squamous cell head and neck cancer: For presurgical subjects, p16 positivity must be confimed prior to first dose For subjects postchemoradiation, HPV 16 and HPV 18 positivity must be confirmed prior to first dose. 4. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) ≥ 1.5x109 cell/ml, platelets ≥75,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL, concentrations of total serum bilirubin within 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), AST, ALT within 2.5x institutional ULN, CPK within 2.5 x ULN. 5. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 01. 1. Anticipated concomitant immunosuppressive therapy (excluding nonsystemic inhaled, topical skin and/or eye dropcontaining corticosteroids). 2. Any concurrent condition requiring the continued use of systemic steroids (&gt;10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) or the use of immunosuppressive agents. All other corticosteroids must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to Day 0 of treatment. 3. Administration of any vaccine within 6 weeks of enrollment.</criteria>
