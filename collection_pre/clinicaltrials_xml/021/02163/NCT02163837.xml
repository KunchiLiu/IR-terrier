	<brief_title>Effect of Rifaximine on Sleep Disorders in Patients Suffering From Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome related to chronic/acute hepatic failure. Sleep architecture is disturbed in this syndrome, and patients complain mainly of excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbances. Hypothesis to explain these symptoms is, among others, disturbed melatonin metabolism. Few studies have been conducted in order to study sleep disorders during HE, and effect of treatment is unknown. Recently, rifaximine, an oral broad spectrum antibiotic, have been proved to decrease ammoniac production in patients with HE. The purpose of our study is to assess sleep quality, quantity, sleep schemes and physical activity in patients suffering from HE, before and after a 2 weeks treatment with rifaximine.</detailed_description>
