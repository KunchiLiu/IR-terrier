	<brief_summary>This is a technical development study with the goal to develop 3D techniques for atherosclerosis plaque characterization. We hypothesize that 3D MRI is superior to 2D MRI in characterizing major plaque constituents that contribute to severe clinical events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. The major advantages of the 3D techniques to be developed will include high spatial resolution, reduced scan times, and optimized image contrast. The use of contrast injection is not needed with the new techniques, which is greatly beneficial for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.This is not a funded clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will undergo the conventional MRI protocol and the new imaging protocol using our developed techniques. They may have either non-contrast scans or contrast-enhanced scans or both depending on the stage of development. The comparison results between the two protocols will be used to evaluate the performance of the new techniques and help optimization of specific technical aspects.</detailed_description>
