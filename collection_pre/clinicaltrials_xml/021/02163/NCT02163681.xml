	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop rapid MRI techniques for imaging the lung with hyperpolarized helium-3 gas as an inhaled contrast agent. These techniques will be piloted in adults and older children before testing them in younger children and infants. The purpose is to enable imaging of non-sedated infants by imaging so fast as to freeze motion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>MRI sequence development (n=40): Healthy subjects and patients with CF, BPD, or asthma will be used in the development of the rapid imaging techniques. These subjects will be age 4 months to 65 years old. Healthy subjects can have no history of chronic respiratory disease. The subjects with CF or asthma must have a physician diagnosis of their respective disease. ProofofConcept Study (n=30): Ten healthy infants,10 infants with CF, and 10 infants with BPD age 424 months will be imaged in the proofofconcept study. Healthy infant must have had an uncomplicated term birth and have no history of chronic respiratory symptoms. The patients with CF must have a physician diagnosis of CF and be at their baseline clinical status on the day of imaging. Any condition for which a MRI procedure is contraindicated. Presence of any nonMRI compatible metallic material in the body, such as pacemakers, metallic clips, etc. Likelihood of claustrophobia Chest circumference greater than that of the helium magnetic resonance (MR) coil. Pregnancy, by report of subject. Clinically in the Department of Radiology at UVA, self report is used when screening patients for MR scans as well as CT scans and fluoroscopy studies. If the subject reports there is any chance of their being pregnant a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to any imaging.</criteria>
