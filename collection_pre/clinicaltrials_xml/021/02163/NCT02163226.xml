	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if 1 large dose of radiation therapy is better at controlling pain from cancer that has spread to the bones than 10 smaller doses of radiation. Researchers also want to learn if 1 large dose of radiation therapy can help decrease the use of drugs to control the pain, and if it can help to control the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Evaluating Rapid Delivery of Dose Escalated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Patients Diagnosed With Bone Metastases for Effective Palliation of Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. If you are in Group 1, you will receive 1 radiation treatment a day for 10 days in a row (not counting weekends or holidays). You will receive a higher total dose of radiation than Group 2. If you are in Group 2, you will receive 1 radiation treatment given on 1 day. Radiation Therapy: You will lie on a table for the radiation treatment(s). Each treatment will last about 30 minutes. Length of Treatment: You may receive 1 or 10 radiation treatments, depending on which group you are in. You will no longer be able to receive radiation therapy if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. Follow-Up Visits: At Months 3, 6, 9, 12 and every 3 to 6 months after the start of radiation therapy, you will have x-rays, a bone scan, CT scan, or MRI to check the status of the disease. At Months 3, 4, and 6 and then every 3 months after that for at least 3 years, you will complete the questionnaires about the pain, your pain relief, and your quality of life. The questionnaires can be filled out at a clinic visit or sent back in the mail. This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. It is investigational to compare the number and size of radiation doses. Up to 300 participants will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 300 participants will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
