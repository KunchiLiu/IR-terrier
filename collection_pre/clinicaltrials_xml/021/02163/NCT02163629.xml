	<brief_summary>In spite of major medical advances in heart transplant patients, psychiatric comorbidity remains very high in pre-and post-transplant phases. Anxiety and depression are especially frequent. They impact significantly morbidity and mortality. Especially because they are associated with poor therapeutic adherence and risks of infection and rejection. The inability to make beneficial therapeutic choice can be explained by the negative perception of events, associated with anxio-depressive disorders. This results in an important deterioration in quality of life of patients. The investigators assume that better management of emotions might reduce the stress of waiting situation and its psychopathological and somatic consequences pre-and post-transplant.</brief_summary>
