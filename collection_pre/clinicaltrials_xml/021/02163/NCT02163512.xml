	<criteria>Patients aged 1880 Patients previously prescribed with betablockers Any type of hepatic cirrosis that has been diagnosed by clinical, analytic and image criteria Mild to serious ascites. Classification on refractory or nonrefractory ascites depends on the patient´s response to diuretic treatment. Refractory ascites is defined by the Ascites´Board International Criteria as the lack of response, ascites recurrency or complications occurrence by diuretic drugs uptake Esophageal varicose vein in which beta blockers treatment is indicated as primary or secondary prophylaxis. Primary prophylaxis is indicated for big esophageal varicose veins, small varicose veins with red signs or varicose veins in patients with BC ChildPugh stage. Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for all those patients that have previously presented varicose bleeding. Patients giving a written consent to participate in the study after having received enough information about the design, objectives and risks. Hepatocellular carcinoma &gt;5 cm Total portal vein thrombosis or Cavernous transformation of the portal vein Insuficiencia renal (creatinina sérica &gt;3 mg/dl).
