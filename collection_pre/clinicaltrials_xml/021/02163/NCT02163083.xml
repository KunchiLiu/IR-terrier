	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether the detection of lymph nodes by means of intraoperative fluorescence lymphography as part of lymphadenectomy in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is higher than without the use of indocyanine green (ICG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Lymphnodes Using ICG During RARP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ICG is a fluorescent dye that fluoresces green bound to proteins under illumination in the near-infrared range. Using this dye allows to visualize lymphatic nodes, by being injected into the tumor or directly surrounding tissue.</detailed_description>
