	<brief_summary>Passive mobilizations of the spine are widely used by physiotherapists in the management of neuromusculoskeletal disorders. There is a nascent body of work of the mechanical properties of joint mobilizations. Treatment dose is characterized by the direction of force applied, magnitude of force applied, frequency of oscillation, amplitude of displacement, repetition and time. Although the choice of better treatment dose is based on patient complaints and clinical reasoning, the comprehension of the effects of different parameters of joint mobilization will improve the decision making process. The optimal dose of treatment, however, is not already known. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether different rates of thoracic mobilization are capable to produces hypoalgesic effects, and secondarily investigate if such effects are local or widespread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Effects of Different Rates of Thoracic Mobilization on Pressure Pain Thresholds in Asymptomatic Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers will be recruited and randomized into 3 groups. A 2Hz mobilisation group, a 0,5Hz mobilisation group and a Placebo group. The pressure pain threshold will be measured before, immediately after and 15 minutes after the intervention.</detailed_description>
