	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that 1) the secretion of mucins, antimicrobial peptides and Toll-like receptors is altered in certain patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, which makes them more susceptible to be infected by potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB); and 2) the electronic nose is able to detect patterns of specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) for patients with non-CF bronchiectasis colonized by PPB.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective, observational study, which will include 50 patients with non-CF bronchiectasis who will be followed for a period of 12 months. A follow up control will be performed every three months to all patients, consisting in medical record, lung function tests, blood and serum collection, sputum analysis and culture, and collection of exhaled air for analysis using an electronic nose. These tests will also be repeated whenever the patient has an exacerbation. At the beginning and end of the study, a high resolution chest CT will be performed.</detailed_description>
