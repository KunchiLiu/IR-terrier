	<brief_title>CT 327 in the "Atopy Patch Test" Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population will include subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD) and a positive atopy patch test (APT) test at study screening. Positive responders to the APT test will enter into a treatment period of ten days during which all subjects will have three test compounds (CT 327, Placebo or an active comparator) administered twice daily to three test fields marked on patient's back. A fourth test field will act as untreated control. A challenge with the relevant aeroallergen to which the subject is responding most strongly, as assessed at screening, will take place on Day 10. Readings of APT scores will be performed at 48 and 72 hrs after the challenge and the subjects will have a end-of-study visit 2 weeks later. Local and systemic tolerance of CT327 will be assessed during the study, in addition to its potential absorption into the systemic circulation. The effects of CT327 on modulating the immune response to aeroallergens and on the expression of immunological and inflammatory markers on biopsies of the treated areas will also be evaluated.</detailed_description>
