	<brief_summary>Compared to those of Caucasians, the plasma levels of atazanavir (ATV) may be higher in Koreans with the same dosage regimen(s). If so, even unboosted ATV could be used with tenofovir DF (TDF) which lowers the concentration of ATV. The investigators plan to investigate the pharmacokinetic features of ATV with or without TDF in healthy Korean and Caucasian volunteers and compare the ethnic differences.</brief_summary>
