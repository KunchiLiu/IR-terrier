	<detailed_description>Even though immediate and early death from severe thermal injury has reduced over the last twenty years, considerable physical and psychosocial morbidity still persists. While exercise is strongly recommended to assist recovery and overall outcome, there is limited evidence in adults to indicate whether it is effective and/or safe. This study will investigate the effect of a high intensity aerobic and resisted exercise program exercise program on safety, physical, functional and quality of life measures in adults post burn injury.</detailed_description>
