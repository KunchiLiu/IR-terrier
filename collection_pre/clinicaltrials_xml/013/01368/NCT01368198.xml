	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this investigation will be to quantify the increase in tear film break-up time (TFBUT) associated with the instillation of a single eyedrop of an Ocular Emulsion in dry eye sufferers.</brief_summary>

The subject must not have used any topical ocular drops for approximately 24 hours prior to the enrolment/screening visit 4. The subject must be classified as dry eye at enrolment/screening visit according to the following criteria: Subjects' selfassessment of dry eye status (answer of at least "some of the time" to the question, "How often have your eyes felt dry enough to want to use eye drops?"); TFBUT measured with DET ≤ 5 seconds in at least one eye; Grade 1 for meibomian gland expression in both eyes; Evidence of missing meibomian glands in both eyes. 1. History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past six months. 2. History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye within the past six months. 3.

Use of any concomitant topical ocular medications during the study period. 6. Ocular conditions such as conjunctival infections, iritis, or any other ocular condition that may preclude the safe administration of either drop under investigation. 7. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering this study.</criteria>
