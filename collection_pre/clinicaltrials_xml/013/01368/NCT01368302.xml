	<brief_summary>Patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will be randomly assigned to either Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) designed to normalize threat-related attention biases or a placebo control condition not designed to change attention patterns. Outcome measures will be Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms as measured by gold standard questionnaires and symptom counts derived from structured clinical interviews. We expect to see significant Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptom reduction in the Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) group relative to the placebo control group in which no symptomatic relief is expected.</brief_summary>
