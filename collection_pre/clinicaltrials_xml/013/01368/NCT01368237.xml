	<brief_summary>Recent advances in technology have resulted in the development of scanners that can image the heart blood vessels within 10 to 20 minutes but without the need for admission to hospital or insertion of catheters. Further advances in technology allow the visualisation of both the blood vessels and the supply of blood to the heart muscle. Here we propose to assess the latest and most powerful computed tomography scanner and compare it to magnetic resonance and conventional coronary angiography.</brief_summary>
