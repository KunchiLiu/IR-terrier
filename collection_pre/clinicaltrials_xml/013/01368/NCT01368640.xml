	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to develop prediction equations for calculating FFM, TBW, ECW and SMM based on the gold standard reference methods ADP, DXA, MRI, D2O and NaBr on the one hand and measurement data of the BIA devices on the other hand. The equations are necessary to use the device as a Body Composition Analyzer with an acceptable accuracy level for clinical practice.</brief_summary>
