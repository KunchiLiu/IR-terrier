	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and the risks of using talimogene laherparepvec in patients who already received treatment with talimogene laherparepvec in study 005/05 (NCT00769704), and to see if extended treatment with talimogene laherparepvec can destroy melanoma tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Previously participated in protocol 005/05 (NCT00769704) and: 1. received the maximum number of talimogene laherparepvec treatment injections or cycles of GMCSF allowable for that patient on study 005/05, or 2. new injectable lesion(s) appeared after previous resolution of all injectable disease while on study 005/05. New injectable lesions must have appeared within ≤ 12 months from the End of Treatment visit on the 005/05 study. 2. In the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor's medical monitor further treatment is warranted [e.g., those patients who do not have clinically relevant progressive disease (PDr)]. 3. Performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG) 0 or 1. 4. For patients randomized to talimogene laherparepvec only: Injectable disease (i.e. suitable for direct injection or through the use of ultrasound guidance) defined as at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal melanoma lesion. There is no minimum size for injection. 1. Prior Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to talimogene laherparepvec of any organ system (with the exception of injection site reactions, fever and vomiting). 2. History of Grade 3 fatigue lasting &gt; 1 week while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment. 3. History of Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgias while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment. 4. History of ≥ Grade 2 autoimmune reactions, allergic reactions or urticaria or other talimogene laherparepvec related nonhematological toxicities while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment that required a dose delay or discontinuation of talimogene laherparepvec therapy. 5. PDr while participating in study 005/05 6. Patient requested to be withdrawn from study 005/05 or was unable to comply with the demands of the 005/05 trial. 7. At the discretion of the investigator, patient was withdrawn from the 005/05 trial.</criteria>
