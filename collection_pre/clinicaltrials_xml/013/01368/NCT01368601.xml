	<brief_title>Effects of Intraoperative Continuous Airway Pressure (CPAP) on the Inflammatory Response to One-lung Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary lobectomy induces an inflammatory response of this lung caused by intraoperative atelectasis and re-expansion. This inflammatory response can be attenuated with treatment, also decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). Thus, avoiding complete atelectasis with partial insufflation of the lung during surgery could be useful to decrease inflammatory response and PPC.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults (1880 aged) with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status IIII, scheduled to undergo elective thoracic surgery with lung resection performed through thoracotomy, and requiring OLV (one lung ventilation)during surgery. Ongoing treatment with any dose of systemic or topical steroids, acute pulmonary or extrapulmonary infections (elevated Creactive protein [CRP]), history of recurrent pneumothoraces, previous thoracic surgery.</criteria>
