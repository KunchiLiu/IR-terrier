	<detailed_description>Study Procedure Infants meeting inclusion criteria were identified daily by reviewing the list of patients scheduled for a 2 or 4 month well child visit at the outpatient site. The parent or legal guardian was approached prior to vaccination by the research assistant for participation in the study. If the parent/guardian accepted to participate in the vaccine study, the consenting process was performed and patients were brought to a designated examination room. Infants of parents or guardians who consented were randomly assigned to one of four study groups using pre-sealed cards. Ten cards were assigned to each group for a total of 40 cards, which were recycled with each group of 40 infants enrolled into the study. The four groups of the study included: 1. 2 ml of water 2 minutes prior to immunization and comfort by parent or guardian after Immunization (Control Group) 2. 2 ml of 24% oral sucrose 2 minutes prior to immunization and comfort by parent or guardian after immunization (Sucrose Group) 3. 2 ml of water 2 minutes prior to immunization and physical intervention using the 5 S's by researcher after immunization (Physical Group) 4. 2 ml of 24% oral sucrose 2 minutes prior to immunization and physical intervention using the 5 S's by researcher after immunization (Physical and Sucrose Group)</detailed_description>
