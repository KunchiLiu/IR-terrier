	<detailed_description>The scientific purpose of this study is to obtain data on the use of paricalcitol iv in real-life clinical practice and the effect it has on participant health-related QoL. In this study, paricalcitol iv will be prescribed on an on-label basis in an everyday setting. The RAND 36-Item Health Survey results will be collected for a 6-month period (every 3 months) in order to assess the effect of paricalcitol iv on participant health-related QoL.</detailed_description>
