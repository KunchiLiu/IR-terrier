	<brief_title>Study to Test the Effectiveness of a New Treatment for Scalp Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a non-contagious skin disorder affecting up to 2% of the world population. It is estimated that 26 million people in the U.S. and Europe suffer from psoriasis. Forty percent (40%) of these suffer from psoriasis of the scalp. Currently, there are three primary modalities for the treatment of psoriasis: topical, phototherapy and systemic treatments. While existing treatments provide varying degrees of relief for this illness, they do not provide a long-term cure. Additionally, there is evidence that some of these existing treatments may cause significant side effect. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that DermiPsor's DPS-102 (test product) is statistically more effective for the treatment of psoriasis current topical treatment options. It is also intended to assess the safety of DPS-102.</detailed_description>
