	<brief_summary>The role of micronutrients in diabetes is not well understood. Studies have demonstrated the relationship between low chromium serum levels and insulin resistance. This study aims to evaluate the effect of chromium nicotinate on increasing insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of the Chromium Nicotinate on Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin is a hormone secreted by cells Î² of pancreatic islets in response to increased levels of glucose and serum amino acids. Insulin resistance means a decrease in the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose utilization because is disabled in the insulin receptor, decrease in concentration of receptors or failure mechanism of cell transit. Recently, the discovery of a substance called low molecular weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr), showed the ability of this substance in amplifying insulin signaling, increasing the sensitivity of insulin receptors in the plasma membrane. This way, the capacity of LMWCr in activating the insulin receptor depends on levels of serum chromium. Thus, the hypothesis that the nutritional status of individual poor chromium contributes to the decrease in glucose tolerance and consequently, for type 2 Diabetes. Thus, it becomes necessary to assess the effect of supplementation of chromium in increased insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 Diabetes. This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial, consisting of a period of three months of nutritional intervention with chromium nicotinate, biochemical and anthropometric evaluation and assessment of food profile and physical activity.</detailed_description>
