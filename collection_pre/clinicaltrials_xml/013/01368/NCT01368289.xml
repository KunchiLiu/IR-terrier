	<detailed_description>A prospective, multicentre, observational study of all patients referred for endoscopic resection of sessile colorectal polyps sized ≥20 mm conducted with intention to treat analysis. Detailed data regarding lesion characteristics (size, location, Paris classification, granular or non-granular surface morphology and Kudo pit pattern), procedural, clinical and histological outcomes and complications are noted. Multivariate analysis will be performed to identify risk factors for Endoscopic Mucosal Resection failure and adenoma recurrence at follow-up colonoscopy.</detailed_description>
