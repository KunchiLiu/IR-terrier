	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of fentanyl for reducing coughing during the perioperative period (i.e., insertion of an LMA [Laryngeal Mask Airway] device, maintenance period during surgery, and awakening [emergence] from general anesthesia) for ambulatory surgery procedures. Also to assess the effects of fentanyl on the postoperative outcomes, (e.g., pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, return of bowel function [constipation], resumption of normal activities of daily living). Fentanyl is one of the most common used anesthetic adjuncts for ambulatory surgery because of its anesthetic-sparing effects and alleged ability to reduce coughing during instrumentation of the patient's airway.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of fentanyl when administered as an adjuvant to standard anesthetic and analgesic drugs on coughing (during insertion of an LMA device, during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia) and on the postoperative adverse outcomes (i.e., side effects). All patients will receive local anesthetics and commonly used non-opioid pain relieving medications during surgery.</detailed_description>
