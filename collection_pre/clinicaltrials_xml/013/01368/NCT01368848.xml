	<brief_summary>Despite recent advances in the treatment of NSCLC overall survival within these patients remains dismal and there is yet an unmet medical need for additional treatment options. In this phase II study a combination of chemotherapy with an antibody (cisplatin, docetaxel and bevacizumab) is tested to determine the objective response rate in patients with unresectable and advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This response rate will be compared with historical data.</brief_summary>
