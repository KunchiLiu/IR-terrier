	<brief_summary>This is a prospective multicenter observational study with 20 patients to evaluate the performance of SCITECH stent for treatment of AAA. Will be enrolled the patient demographics, laboratory tests, medical history, clinical evaluation, physical examination, adverse events. The benefits and risks of the study should be explained before any specific test or procedure of the study. The written consent must be obtained from the patient. No action specifies the study should be performed while the patient has not signed the form of consent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Performance of the Modular AAA Stent-Graft System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until the 90s the treatment of AAA was exclusively surgical, presenting a significant risk of death, however, many patients could not undergo this surgery because of the invasive nature of the procedure. The mortality and comorbidity were associated with significant surgical repair of AAAs, particularly in elderly patients with multiple medical problems. Surgical complications were mainly associated with the surgical incision, comorbidity presented by the patient, changes cardiopulmonary and problems related to clotting of the patient. The postoperative complications included bleeding, renal failure, paraplegy, and the need for prolonged ventilatory support. The literature shows that mortality rates for elective surgery is 0-6.1%, with 2.7% as average. Due to the risks and complexities inherent in surgical procedures, various devices and alternative methods have been proposed to treat aneurysms. The method most used today is the implantation of stents through a delivery system. This method is defined as minimally invasive to dispense the need for opening the abdominal cavity through large incisions, and use a remote access (common femoral artery or external iliac) to introduce and deploy the device via an endovascular route. With technological progress have been developed many devices, all with similar characteristics, which are currently used in different countries. Numerous devices are currently used to treat aneurysms. Over the past 10 years, were developed and approved new stents, however, despite the advances that have represented the use of minimally invasive devices, and evidence of improvement in indices of morbidity and mortality in the first six months, there is still a need to improve results, since the long-term endovascular treatment is equal to the conventional surgical treatment. With the technological devices you can improve your long-term performance and obviate the need for dissection of the femoral vessels using thinner delivery devices that allow percutaneous introduction.</detailed_description>
