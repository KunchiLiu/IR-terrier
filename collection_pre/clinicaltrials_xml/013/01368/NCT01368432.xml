	<brief_title>Lexapro for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Depression &amp; Other Psychiatric Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite it's high prevalence, little is known about the pharmacological treatment of depression following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This is because of a lack of randomized controlled studies in the treatment of post-TBI depression. This study is designed to examine the safety and effectiveness of escitalopram in the treatment of post-TBI depression. It will also investigate metabolic changes and neural pathways associated with post-TBI depression and metabolic alterations after treatment through neuroimaging.</detailed_description>
