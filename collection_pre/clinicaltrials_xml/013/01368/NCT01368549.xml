	<brief_title>Metanx® P.L.U.S. Program (Progress Through Learning, Understanding &amp; Support)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone or online by InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program after Metanx® has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey before starting their Metanx® prescription, and then two brief follow-up surveys at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to continue taking Metanx® as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials about managing their diabetic neuropathy.</detailed_description>
