	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of the MGuardâ„¢ stent over commercially-approved bare-metal (BMS) /drug-eluting stents (DES) in achieving better myocardial reperfusion in primary angioplasty for the treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 18 years of age STsegment elevation (more than 2mm in more than contiguous leads) MI with symptom onset less than 12h The patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations Signed ICF Single de novo lesion in the target (culprit) vessel Target lesion maximum length is 33 mm (by visual estimation) Reference vessel diameter must be more than 3.0 to less than 4.0 mm by visual estimation Randomization should occur as soon as Presence of TIMI 2 or 3 before randomization Exclusion Criteria Pregnant or nursing patients Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), paced rhythm, or other Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality Impaired renal function Prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery Bleeding diathesis Contraindication to aspirin cardiopulmonary resuscitation Cardiogenic shock chronic warfarin anticoagulation LVEF less than 20% other medical illness participation in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached its primary endpoint Left main coronary artery disease with 50% stenosis Ostial target lesion Failure to visualize vessel anatomy distal to the culprit lesion Moderate to heavily calcified target lesion or vessel excessive tortuosity bifurcation with a side branch more than 2.0 mm in diameter A significant (greater than 50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion is present that cannot be covered by same single stent Diffuse disease distal to target lesion with impaired runoff Any prior stent proximal to the target lesion, or within 10 mm distal of the target lesion PCI of another lesion performed within 6 months before the index procedure Target lesion located in a saphenous vein graft</criteria>
