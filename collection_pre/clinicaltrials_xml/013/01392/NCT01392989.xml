	<brief_summary>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (transplant of blood cells from another individual) is a treatment option for patients with Myelodysplasia or Myeloproliferative Disorders. During the course of this study, we will attempt to learn whether a particular type of blood cell, called a Cytokine Induced Killer (CIK) cell may add benefit to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CIK cells are present in small quantities in the bloodstream but their numbers can be expanded after a brief period of nurturing in a laboratory.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>4.1.1 Recipient Inclusion Criteria to start ATG/TLI: Diagnosis Myelodysplastic Syndrome Criteria (A) Diagnosis of MDS classifiable by the WHO system as Refractory Anemia Refractory Cytopenia with Multilineage Dysplasia MDSunclassified Refractory Cytopenias with Multilineage Dysplasia and Ringed Sideroblasts, Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts1 Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts2 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) MDS transformed to acute leukemia. Patients with advanced MDS must have &lt; 10% marrow blasts prior to receiving conditioning with TLI/ATG. Less than 10% marrow blasts must be documented by marrow examination within 1 month of starting conditioning. If necessary, a cytoreductive regimen will be determined by referring centers. Patients with evolution to AML are required to be in a morphologic leukemia freestate with blasts &lt;5% (50). Myeloproliferative Disorders B) Myeloproliferative disorders to be included: Idiopathic Myelofibrosis Polycythemia vera Essential Thrombocythemia Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia Philadelphia chromosomenegative CML. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome Systemic Mastocytosis Patients with MPD must have &lt; 10% marrow blasts prior to receiving conditioning with TLI/ATG. Less than 10% marrow blasts must be documented by marrow examination within 1 month of starting conditioning. If necessary, a cytoreductive regimen will be determined by referring centers. Patients with evolution to AML are required to be in a morphologic leukemiafree state less than 5% in a marrow aspirate. Presence of residual dysplastic features following cytoreductive therapy is acceptable. Therapyrelated myeloid neoplasms Patients with tMDS must have &lt; 10% marrow blasts prior to receiving conditioning with TLI/ATG. Less than 10% marrow blasts must be documented by marrow examination within 1 month of starting conditioning. If necessary, a cytoreductive regimen will be determined by referring centers. Patients with tAML are required to be in a morphologic leukemia freestate with blasts &lt;5%. 2. Patient age &gt; 50 years, or for patients &lt;50 years of age but because of preexisting medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high risk for regimenrelated toxicity associated with conventional myeloablative transplants. 3. A fully HLA matched or single antigen/allele mismatched sibling or unrelated donor is available. 4.2 Donor Eligibility 4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria Related Donors 1. Donors must be HLAmatched or one allele mismatched. 2. Donor age &lt; 75 unless cleared by the Principal Investigator 3. Donor must consent to peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilization with GCSF and apheresis 4. Donor must consent to placement of a central venous catheter in the event that peripheral venous access is limited. 4.1.2 Recipient Exclusion Criteria 1. Uncontrolled CNS involvement with disease 2. Females who are pregnant 3. Organ dysfunction defined as follows: Cardiac function: ejection fraction (EF) &lt;35% or uncontrolled cardiac failure Pulmonary: DLCO &lt;40% predicted Liver function abnormalities: elevation of bilirubin to &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or AST or ALT &gt;3x the upper limit of normal Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min 4. Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &lt; 70% (Appendix F) 5. Documented fungal disease that is progressive despite treatment 6. Viral infections: HIV positive patients are not eligible for this protocol. Hepatitis B and C positive patients will be evaluated on a casebycase basis 7. Patients with prior malignancies diagnosed &gt; 5 years ago without evidence of disease are eligible. Patients with a prior malignancy treated &lt; 5 years ago but have a life expectancy of &gt; 5 years for that malignancy are eligible. 4.1.3 Recipient Exclusion Criteria to proceed to CIK infusion 1. Uncontrolled infection 2. Evidence of disease relapse 3. Grade 2 or above GVHD (Grade 1 GVHD to be evaluated by Principal Investigator) 4. Does not meet release criteria for CIK cells .2.2 Exclusion Criteria Related Donor 1. Identical twin 2. Pregnant or lactating females 3. Prior malignancy within the preceding five years, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancers. 4. HIV seropositivity 4.2.3 Unrelated Donor Inclusion Criteria 1. Donors must be HLAmatched or one allele or antigen mismatched. 2. Donor must consent to PBSC mobilization with GCSF and apheresis as well as collection and donation of plasma. Bone marrow unrelated donors are not eligible for this protocol.</criteria>
