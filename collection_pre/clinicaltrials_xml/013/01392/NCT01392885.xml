	<brief_summary>To determine the effects of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volumes and severity of psychotic symptoms in a population of psychosis patients compared to healthy age/gender matched volunteers. Psychosis patients often suffer from a number of cognitive difficulties, including poor memory function, poor problem-solving capacity and difficulties with attention and concentration. These problems are not well addressed by current clinical treatments. Evidence from aging research strongly suggests that increased cardiovascular fitness may provide numerous cognitive benefits by promoting brain growth, particularly in the frontal lobes and the hippocampi. The current study will measure the effects of aerobic exercise on brain volumes in a population of chronic psychosis patients to determine if 1) hippocampal volumes increase in response to exercise and 2) if parallel improvements in cognitive functioning occur.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a 12-week, randomized trial with two parallel groups. Throughout the trial, subjects will be treated on their prescribed dose of medication. Once informed consent is obtained, subjects and healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to either an aerobic or a resistance exercise program (N = 24 per diagnostic group in each of two exercise conditions). Patients will continue to receive their antipsychotics and other prescribed medications. Healthy volunteer data will be used to establish normal exercise-induced neuroplasticity in a non-psychiatric, non-medicated population. All training will be conducted at the Riverview Hospital fitness facilities and at dedicated exercise training facilities at the University of British Columbia. All exercise sessions will be monitored by trained research assistants (RAs) under the guidance of the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology-Certified Exercise Physiologists (CSEP-CEPs). The RAs will receive pre-study exercise training from the CSEP-CEPs. During the course of the study, the training intensity will be changed according to the individual participant's response and needs via the CSEP-CEPs and RAs.</detailed_description>
