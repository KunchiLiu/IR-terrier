	<brief_title>Recurrent ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae Bacteremia: Risk Factor, Molecular Character and Susceptibility Change</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To characterize the genotypes of the pathogens isolated from recurrent ESBL-EK bacteremia versus non-recurrent ESBL-EK bacteremia to differentiate relapse from reinfection - recurrent versus non-recurrent - relapse versus reinfection 2. To correlate the patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, severity of illness (the modified Pitt bacteremia score), diagnosis of deep-site infection, co-morbid conditions (including diabetes mellitus, hepatic and renal dysfunction), length of stay in ICU/hospitalization, the presence of invasive procedures, source of pathogen (community acquired or nosocomial infection), antimicrobial regimen (i.e carbapenems versus non-carbapenems(flomoxef or quinolones), microbiological characteristics (E coli and Kleb. pneumoniae) and outcome endpoints (clinical outcome and mortality) with ESBL recurrence and genotypes</detailed_description>
