	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand more about why some patients choose to have surgery to treat their papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) and others choose to have their papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) regularly watched by their doctor to see if and when they may need surgery (referred to as "active surveillance"). The investigators also hope learn more about what patients and their family members worry about or feel they will gain from surgery or active surveillance.</brief_summary>
