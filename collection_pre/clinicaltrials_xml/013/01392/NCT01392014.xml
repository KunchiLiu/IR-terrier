	<brief_summary>Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been known to be controversial for stopping malaria transmission.The addition of primaquine (PQ) - the only drug commercially available that kills mature transmission stage - to such treatments might be necessary to eliminate this stage. A study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) regimens with or without PQ on the sexual and asexual stages of P. falciparum in Sumatra, Indonesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and Primaquine for Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted in Hanura Primary Health Center, Padang Cermin district, Lampung province (105°45'-103°48'E and 3°45'-6°45'S) located at the southern end of Sumatra island. The study subjects received either 3 day doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with or without 1 day of primaquine according to their body weight. Patients with fever or history of fever within the past 24 hours were screened by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick blood films to detect P. falciparum infection. All subjects were allocated by open-label randomization to receive DHP alone (on Day 0 to Day 2) or DHP plus a single dose of PQ (Day 3). The procedures of drug administration in the study were as follows:</detailed_description>
