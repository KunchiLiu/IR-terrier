	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of INC424 as assessed by reduction in spleen volume in patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF), post-polycythemia vera (PV) MF, or post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) MF. The safety and tolerability of INC424 and the effects of INC424 on patient reported outcomes and the duration of response as assessed by reduction in spleen volume will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
