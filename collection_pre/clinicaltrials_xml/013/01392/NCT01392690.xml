	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Primary Prevention Program for Anxiety Disorders Using Story Books</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study reports the results of a study evaluating a book-supported prevention program "Dominique's Handy Tricks" for anxiety disorders in children aged 9 to 12 years of age. This cognitive-behavioural program is delivered using a combination of story-based books and workshop sessions. The originality of the program comes from the use of story books that were not developed for anxiety management specifically. Every session is based on a story describing characters facing common stressors in childhood and how they managed to cope with their daily problems. In our randomized control trial with 46 children, participation in the program lead to a significant improvement in coping skills, self-efficacy, anxiety sensitivity, signs of anxiety and phobic avoidance. The theoretical and practical elements underlying the delivery of this primary prevention programs are described. It is suggested that such an approach, without any labelling specific to anxiety disorders, can be useful in universal primary prevention programs.</detailed_description>
