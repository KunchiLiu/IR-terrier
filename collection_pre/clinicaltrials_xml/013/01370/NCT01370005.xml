	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of BI 10773 in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Since hyperglycaemia and hypertension are key risk factors for both micro- and macrovascular complications, assessment of both glucose and blood pressure lowering effects of BI 10773 in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes could provide clinically highly relevant, new information for the use of BI 10773</brief_summary>
