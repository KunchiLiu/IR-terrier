	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of MK-8808 in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP), and as a single agent, for participants with B-lymphocyte antigen cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20)-positive follicular lymphoma who have had no prior chemotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that MK-8808 will be safe and well tolerated in combination with CVP and as a single agent.</brief_summary>
