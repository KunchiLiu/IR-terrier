	<brief_summary>Bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic and recurrent illness, that affects nearly the 5% of the population. Recent research point at the relevance and persistence of cognitive dysfunctions in bipolar patients even beyond the acute phases, although cognitive impairment has been classically associated with schizophrenia and not bipolar disorder. Current findings suggest that some intervention is needed in order to improve not only affective symptoms but also cognitive dysfunctions, so that patients could benefit from cognitive remediation techniques to improve cognitive impairment and the functional outcome. There is no previous research on the efficacy of cognitive remediation programs on bipolar disorder.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The method consists of a randomized clinical trial with 3 arms: 1) one group (n=66) will receive a cognitive rehabilitation program + pharmacological treatment, 2) another group (n=66) will receive a psychoeducation program + pharmacological treatment, and 3) a control group (n=66) will only receive pharmacological treatment. A psychopathological, neuropsychological and functional assessment will be administered pre and post-intervention and a 12-month follow-up to assess the long term effects of the intervention.</detailed_description>
