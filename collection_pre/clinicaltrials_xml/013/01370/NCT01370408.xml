	<brief_summary>In this study, patients will receive ondansetron 8mg and dexamethasone 10mg intravenously 30 minutes prior to myeloablative preparative chemotherapy until the last day of chemotherapy. On the final day of chemotherapy, palonosetron 0.25mg and dexamethasone 10mg will be administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to the chemotherapy. If the chemotherapy regimen is only 1 day of the chemotherapy then only palonosetron and dexamethasone will be administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Dexamethasone 8mg once daily will be given orally for 2 days following chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palonosetron, Ondansetron, and Dexamethasone for Delayed Nausea and Vomiting in Autologous Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to decrease this delayed CINV, the investigators have developed a unique schedule of antiemetics that takes advantage of palonosetron's long elimination half-life (40 hours). In this study, patients will receive ondansetron 8mg and dexamethasone 10mg intravenously 30 minutes prior to myeloablative preparative chemotherapy until the last day of chemotherapy. On the final day of chemotherapy, palonosetron 0.25mg and dexamethasone 10mg will be administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to the chemotherapy. If the chemotherapy regimen is only 1 day of the chemotherapy then only palonosetron and dexamethasone will be administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Dexamethasone 8mg once daily will be given orally for 2 days following chemotherapy. The investigators hypothesize that this antiemetic schedule will significantly reduce the delayed CINV compared to historical controls</detailed_description>
