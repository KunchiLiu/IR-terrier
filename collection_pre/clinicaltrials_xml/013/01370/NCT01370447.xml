Presence of caregiver to ensure study compliance 9. Abstention from use of all pillform dietary supplements and nonprescribed medications (except as allowed by the investigator) 10. Abstention from foods or beverages or bars fortified with Coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, superfortified "functional" foods or beverages 11. Abstention from use of idebenone 12. Clinically staged with a Mitochondrial Disease Scale such as the Newcastle Score Exclusion criteria: 1. Allergy to EPI743, vitamin E or sesame oil 2. Clinical history of bleeding or abnormal PT/PTT (excluding anticoagulation Rx) 3. Hepatic insufficiency with LFTs greater than two times normal 4. Renal insufficiency requiring dialysis 5. Fat malabsorption syndromes precluding drug absorption 6. Any other concurrent inborn errors of metabolism 7. Severe endorgan hypoperfusion syndrome secondary to cardiac failure resulting in lactic acidosis 8. Pregnancy</criteria>
