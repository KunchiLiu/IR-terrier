	<brief_summary>Polyneuropathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus which leads to decreased sensation in arms and legs. This in turn can lead to the development of (infected) foot ulcers. Charcot's disease can also be a consequence of polyneuropathy. Patients with Charcot's disease suddenly develop a red, warm and swollen foot, like an infection. Charcot's disease leads to foot fractures. After these fractures have healed, the shape of the foot can be dramatically altered. This altered shape of the foot increases the risk of developing foot ulcers. Nerves are important in regulating the inflammatory response. This study aims to investigate whether the inflammatory response is different in patients with polyneuropathy with and without a history of Charcot's disease.</brief_summary>
