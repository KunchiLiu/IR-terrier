	<brief_summary>Post-operative pain will be measured using a pain diary for one week post-surgery. The purpose is to test the assumption that the arthroscopic technique leads to less post-operative pain and results in shorter hospital stays when compared to the open technique. It is believed that the arthroscopic technique will result in minimal pain when compared to the open technique, allowing this procedure to be performed as day surgery.</brief_summary>
