	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vaniprevir given in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) versus treatment with peg-IFN and RBV alone in Japanese treatment-naïve participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype (GT)1. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks after completion of all study therapy (SVR24) in at least one of the vaniprevir arms is superior to the percentage of participants achieving SVR24 in the control arm.</brief_summary>
