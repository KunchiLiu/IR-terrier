	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect on reflux parameters of SPD557 tablets (0.5 mg t.i.d., on top of PPI treatment) in patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with persistent symptoms despite taking a stable dose of proton pump inhibitors. Additionally the effect on symptoms will be explored and safety and tolerability will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
