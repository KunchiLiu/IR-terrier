	<brief_summary>This study compared ertapenem sodium to piperacillin/tazobactam sodium for the treatment of moderate to severe diabetic foot infections. The primary hypothesis was that treatment with ertapenem sodium is non-inferior to treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam sodium, in achieving clinical improvement or cure.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant is Chinese with: Type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or Type II diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) treated with diet and/or medication Clinically or bacteriologicallydocumented moderatetosevere (non lifethreatening) diabetic foot infection that requires treatment with IV antibiotics Wound site or lesion with purulent drainage from the primary site of infection OR at least 3 of the following: fever, white blood count (WBC) &gt;10,000 with &gt;5% immature neutrophils, local periwound erythema (redness) extending &gt;1 cm away from the wound edge or abscess cavity, localized periwound edema (swelling), localized tenderness or pain, localized fluctuance, lymphangitis associated with a skin lesion, localized warmth, and localized induration (limb brawny edema) Negative skin test result for allergy to penicillin Pregnant, breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant or father a child during the course of the study Presence of uncomplicated skin infection such as the following: simple abscesses, impetigo, furunculosis, carbunculosis, or folliculitis in normal hosts; infected burn wound; necrotizing fasciitis; suspected osteomyelitis contiguous with the skin or skin structure infection for which removal of the infected bone is not likely to occur within 2 days of initiation of IV study therapy; wound infection that contains concomitant gangrene that cannot be adequately removed with debridement; infection likely to require a belowtheknee amputation (BKA); infection involving prosthetic material; or evidence of indwelling foreign material (such as prosthetic or surgical hardware) near the infected site that cannot be removed by surgical debridement Treatment within 3 days prior to the eligibility screening with &gt;24 hours of systemic antibiotic therapy known to be effective against the presumed or documented etiologic pathogen(s) History of serious allergy, hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis), or any serious reaction to carbapenem antibiotics (such as ertapenem sodium, imipenem cilastatin, meropenem, or doripenem) piperacillin/tazobactam sodium, amoxicillin/clavulanate, any penicillins, any cephalosporins, or any other βlactam agents Need for concomitant systemic antibacterial(s) in addition to those designated in the 2 study groups (with the exception of the addition of vancomycin for Enterococcus ssp. or methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) Insufficient vascular perfusion to the affected limb Rapidly progressive or terminal illness Requirement or anticipation of need for dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration) Acute hepatitis or acute decompensation of chronic hepatitis Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive with a clinical diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt;1000 cells/mm^3 Immunosuppression Participation in any other clinical study involving the administration of an investigational medication within 30 days Participation in any other clinical study involving ertapenem sodium (INVANZ™)</criteria>
