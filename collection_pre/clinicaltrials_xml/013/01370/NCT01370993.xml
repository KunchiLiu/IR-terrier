	<brief_title>The Prediction Model of Hypoxemia for Safe Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, diverse sedatives and analgesic methods are used during fiberoptic bronchoscopy for reducing patients' discomfort and facilities of procedures as British Thoracic Society recommendation. MAC anesthesia, one of the widely used sedative method during bronchoscopy, have many advantages, occurrence of respiratory depression, hypoxemia are not uncommon during the procedures. The investigators try to find out risk factors and develop the prediction model for hypoxemia during bronchoscopy under MAC anesthesia.</detailed_description>
