	<brief_summary>Proliferative ischemic retinopathies lead to a formation of abnormal vessels on the iris surface induced by an increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In progressive stages fibrovascular membranes occlude the anterior chamber angle which inhibits aqueous outflow resulting in neovascular glaucoma. The increased intraocular pressure is often difficult to control and frequently results in loss of vision. The aim of this study is to analyze the short- and long-term outcome after adjuvant intraocular Ranibizumab application in patients with neovascular glaucoma and rubeosis and to analyze the role of ranibizumab within a holistic treatment regime.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. neovascular glaucoma or rubeosis definition of neovascular glaucoma: patient with iris neovascularization with intraocular pressure elevation (exceeding 21 mmHg) definition of rubeosis: patient with iris neovascularization without intraocular pressure elevation (≤21 mmHg) 2. an available followup of 12 months 3. written informed consent 4. visual acuity of light perception or better. 1. history or evidence of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA functional class III or IV) 2. clinical or medical history of unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or revascularization with 6 months 3. ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring ongoing treatment 4. History or evidence clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, such as intermittent claudication or prior amputation 5. Clinically significant impaired renal or hepatic function 6. Stroke within 12 month before trial entry. 7. Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye use in angiography 8. Known contraindications to the components of Lucentis® formulation. Ocular concomitant conditions/ diseases 1. Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in either eye 2. Any active infection (e.g. conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) in either eye 3. History of uveitis in either eye 4. Treatment with antiangiogenic drugs (pegaptanib sodium, anecortave acetate,bevacizumab, ranibizumab, etc.) or intravitreal corticosteroids in either eye within 4 months prior to inclusion 5. Angle block glaucoma 6. Phthisis 7. Intraocular Pressure &lt;10mmHg Compliance/ Administrative 1. Previous participation in any clinical studies of investigational drugs (excluding vitamins and minerals) within 1 month (or a period corresponding to 5 halflives of the investigational drug, whatever is longer) prior to inclusion 2. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control methods. The two methods can be a double barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method. Adequate barrier methods of contraception include: diaphragm, condom (by the partner), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal), sponge or spermicide. Hormonal contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that includes an estrogen and/or a progestational agent. 3. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women 4. Inability to comply with study or followup procedures. 5. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the past 60 days for any condition.</criteria>
