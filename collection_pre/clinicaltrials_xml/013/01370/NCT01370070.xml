	<criteria>Aged &gt; 18 year, able to give written informed consent. History of histologically or cytologically confirmed nonkeratinizing NPC that has recurred at locoregional and/or distant sites, and is not amenable to potentially curative radiotherapy or surgery. Patients must have progressed within 24 months of receiving one or two prior line of chemotherapy for recurrent disease, of which at least one line must contain platinum drugs such as Cisplatin, Carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Adequate organ reserve: neutrophils &gt;1.5x109/L, platelets ≥100 x109/L, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT&lt; 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases, serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN. Presence of measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST ver 1.1). Chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except to bone metastases) or investigational treatment within 4 weeks of enrollment. Patients with diabetes or in risk for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials with MK2206, but the hyperglycemia should be well controlled before the patient enters the trial. Cardiovascular: baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt;470 msec (female) Left bundle branch block, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, bifascicular block, sick sinus syndrome, WolffParkinsonwhite syndrome, significant sinus bradycardia (&lt; 50bpm) . However, patients with asymptomatic right bundle branch block or 1st degree AV block, in the absence of known cardiac disease (e.g. coronary, valvular) are NOT excluded.. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
