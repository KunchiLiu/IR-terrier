	<brief_summary>The investigators want to compare the efficacy of plasma exchange treatment with using two different citrates ( 4% and 15% ) as anticoagulants in plasma exchange treatment. The efficacy of plasma exchange treatment is better with using 15% trisodium citrate as anticoagulant during the plasma exchange procedure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To compare the elimination rate of immunoglobulins in plasma exchange treatment by using two differently concentrated citrates for anticoagulation during plasma exchange procedure. At the same time we want to compare acid-base , electrolyte status and anticoagulation protocol in two citrate groups.</detailed_description>
