	<brief_summary>Hypospadias is a congenital abnormality of the penis that is caused by incomplete development of the anterior urethra. This pathology is one of the most common genital anomalies in paediatric urology .The incidence is reported to be 1 out of 250 live male births and is increasing regularly. The hypospadias surgeries present a high risk of post operative complications requiring re-interventions. A great part of the post operative complications is related to imperfect healing issues. If androgen stimulation seems to be deleterious, at the opposite, oestrogen could impact positively on the skin healing process. This point leads to the hypothesis that local transcutaneous oestrogen stimulation on the ventral and dorsal penile faces decreases the number of skin healing post-operative defects. The objective of the study is to assess the effect of oestrogen (applied once daily for 2 months prior to surgery) on the post-operative complications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Severe hypospadias with a division of the corpus spongiosum behind the midshaft of the penis and for which repair requires a urethral substitution by onlay urethroplasty.

Surgery performed by a surgeon with at least 5 years of practical experience in the hypospadias surgery.
