	<brief_summary>Recently, there is evidence that endothelial activation and dysfunction are associated with migraine, especially in female migraineurs with aura. Our objectives were to determine whether novel endothelial function markers are altered in female migraineurs with aura compared to age-matched controls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our objectives were to determine whether novel endothelial function methods and novel markers of endothelial activation are associated with migraine in female migraineurs with aura. Migraine is an independent risk factor for stroke, especially in young women with aura symptoms. Endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies suggest that there is a link between migraine with aura and endothelial activation, dysfunction and impaired vascular reactivity. In this case-control study the investigators examine several novel biomarkers of endothelial function such as endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial microparticles as well as novel methods such as reactive hyperemic peripheral arterial tonometry in female migraineurs with aura and age-matched controls.</detailed_description>
