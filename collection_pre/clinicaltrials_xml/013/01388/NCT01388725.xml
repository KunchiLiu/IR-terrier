	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the value of serum sTREM (soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells)-1, sCD163, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, white blood cell (WBC) count and SOFA score during sepsis and their clinical informative value in predicting outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators enrolled 130 subjects admitted to an ICU: 30 cases with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 36 cases with sepsis, 35 cases with and 29 with septic shock. Results for sTREM (soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells)-1, sCD163, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, white blood cell (WBC) count and SOFA score were recorded on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14.</detailed_description>
