	<criteria>Diagnosis of COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria: post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)&lt;70%) confirmed with spirometry in stable clinical conditions. For patients recruited during an exacerbation, the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed in stable conditions. Current or exsmokers with a smoking history equivalent to at least 10 pack years. Able to read and write and to use electronic devices and physical activity monitor. Orthopaedic, neurological or other complaints that significantly impair normal biomechanical movement patterns, as judged by the investigator. Respiratory diseases other than COPD (e.g. asthma). Cognitive impairment, as judged by the investigator</criteria>
