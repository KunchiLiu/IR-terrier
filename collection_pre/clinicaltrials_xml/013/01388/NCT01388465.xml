	<brief_title>Text-message Support to Improve Oral Antibiotic Adherence After ED Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Short course, oral antibiotics are frequently prescribed to patients treated/discharged from the Emergency Department. Medication adherence involves the patient taking the proper daily dosing of prescribed medication for the entire length of time it is prescribed. Previous studies have shown that prescription non-filling rates range from 5 to 20%. Other studies have shown that even if patients fill their prescription, as low as 30-40% will properly take the medication. The purpose of this study is to determine if the proportion of patients discharged from the Emergency Department that are adherent with antibiotics is higher in patients that are provided TM support using self-report.</detailed_description>
