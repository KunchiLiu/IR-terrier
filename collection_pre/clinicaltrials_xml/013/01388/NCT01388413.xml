	<brief_summary>Symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the main causes of morbidity and the main cause of re-hospitalization in subjects with neurogenic bladder. Long-term antibiotic therapy increases the risk of multi-resistant bacterial infections, without reducing the rate of symptomatic UTIs. Our non-comparative preliminary study has shown that Weekly Oral Cyclic Antibiotic Programme (single, weekly dose of antibiotic X on even weeks, and antibiotic Y on odd weeks) seem to drastically reduce both the number of symptomatic UTIs and the number of hospitalizations in patients with neurogenic bladder, without affecting bacterial ecology. The objective of this study is to validate this preliminary work with a large-scale randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study.</brief_summary>
