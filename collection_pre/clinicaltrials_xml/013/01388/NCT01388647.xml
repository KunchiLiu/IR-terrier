	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of eribulin in combination with carboplatin and trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting in subjects who are human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 positive and are clinically stage IIA to IIIB. The study regimen will be administered every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles followed by definitive surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Neoadjuvant Carboplatin, Eribulin and Trastuzumab for Operable HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Phase I, the eribulin dose will be assigned upon study enrollment. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in Phase I will be the dose used for Phase II. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 6 will be administered IV over 15 to 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Trastuzumab will be administered as an IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab will be administered over 90 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1. Then, a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg of trastuzumab will be administered over 30 to 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 2 - 6. eribulin: During Phase I, the eribulin dose will be assigned upon study enrollment. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in Phase I will be the dose used for Phase II. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. carboplatin: Carboplatin area under the curve</detailed_description>
