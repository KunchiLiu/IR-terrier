	<brief_summary>Ischemic stroke (IS) causes high mortality and severe disability. To improve outcome it's very important to choose the right way of the management of the patient and an appropriate drugs. There is a large number of the so-called neuroprotective drugs, which were effective in laboratory, but didn't show positive results in clinical studies with using traditional clinical scales scores as a primary outcome measures. Specialists suggest, that the investigators could receive better results if the investigators change design of the studies, particularly if the investigators select more precise and sensitive method of assessment. Aim of this study: to determine the role of navigated brain stimulation (NBS) for evaluation of the changes in the motor centers and motor tracts after administration of different cerebroprotective drugs. (The substances won't be compared to each other).</brief_summary>
