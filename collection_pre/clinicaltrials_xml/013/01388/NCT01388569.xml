	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients treated with sargramostim in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the effects of sargramostim on cells. It may also help doctors understand how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in blood samples from patients with stage IV melanoma previously treated with sargramostim.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To correlate circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and Treg frequencies with clinical outcome. Secondary - To correlate circulating anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF) antibody levels with clinical outcome. OUTLINE: Archived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples are analyzed for circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Treg (CD3+/CD4+/CD25hi/FOXP3+) frequency, and anti-sargramostim (anti-GM-CSF) antibody levels by flow cytometry and anti-GM-CSF neutralizing antibody assay.</detailed_description>
