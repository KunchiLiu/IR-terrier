	<brief_summary>Beta 1 Adrenergic antagonists (beta blockers) have major role in the treatment of CHF, IHD and hypertension. However, there is large interindividual variability in the response to beta blockers. The hypothesis underlying this study is that genetic differences between individuals will determine the individual response to esmolol, a betablocker that is administered intravenously. Esmolol will be administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, and the effects on heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored. In addition, we will measure plasma renin activity and plasma levels of norepinephrine.</brief_summary>
