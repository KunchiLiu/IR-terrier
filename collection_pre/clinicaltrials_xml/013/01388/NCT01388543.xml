	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the blood levels of atazanavir according to a genetic makeup for CYP3A5 (cytochrome P450 3A5, an enzyme that metabolizes atazanavir). The hypothesis was that people with a slow-metabolizing genotype would have higher blood levels of atazanavir compared to people with the normal metabolizing genotype.</brief_summary>
