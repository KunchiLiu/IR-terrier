Two groups of patients will be considered for treatment. Group A: Patients with evaluable minimal tumor mass, Group B: Patients with complete response and abnormal B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2) status. Patients will receive MabThera/Rituxan 375 mg/m2 intravenously once every week. The anticipated time on study treatment is 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
