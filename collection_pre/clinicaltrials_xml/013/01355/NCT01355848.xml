	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to refine, elaborate, and pilot a brief intervention for adult patients following a suicide attempt provided during hospitalization in an acute medical setting, and will be addressed with a sample of cases (N = 40) from Harborview. The participants will be randomized into one of two groups: those that receive the intervention and those that do not. All participants will complete a battery of assessments The intervention is based on the theory of teachable moments, wherein timing in proximity to injury and appropriate treatment setting provide a unique opportunity to create patient behavioral change. The brief intervention consists of engaging the patient in conversation regarding suicidal ambivalence (desire to live vs. desire to die), collaborative discovery of primary and secondary drivers of suicidality, and safety planning. A guide to delivering the intervention has been completed and may undergo changes throughout the study. Adherence measures will be developed in order to assess the degree to which the clinician accurately provided the brief intervention without including additional therapeutic elements or leaving out elements required in the intervention guide. Best methods for integrating the brief intervention into services provided on medical and surgical units will be determined, as well.</detailed_description>
