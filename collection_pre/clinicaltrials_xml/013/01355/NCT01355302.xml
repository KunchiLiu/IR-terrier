	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the following: 1. Find the maximum tolerated dose of E7050 when given in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine in patients with advance or metastatic solid tumors, and 2) Whether E7050 in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine is more effective in patients with previously untreated gastric cancer versus cisplatin and capecitabine alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E7050 in Combination With Cisplatin and Capecitabine Versus Cisplatin and Capecitabine Alone in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors and Previously Untreated Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of 2 phases: Phase Ib: a safety run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with fixed doses of Cisplatin and Capecitabine. This phase will enroll approximately 10 to 15 patients. - Phase II: a randomized 2-arm design which will enroll 80 patients. In the phase II portion, Patients will receive study treatment , E7050 in combination with Cisplatin and Capecitabine versus Cisplatin and Capecitabine Alone) for approximately six 21-day cycles (18 weeks). Beyond 18 weeks, patients who are experiencing clinical benefit may continue E7050, with or without Capecitabine (Arm 1), or may continue Capecitabine alone (Arm 2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm. Patients will continue treatment for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated, until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or withdrawal by investigator, whichever occurs first. Patients will participate in either phase Ib or phase II.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Histologically confirmed, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (Phase II). For the Phase Ib portion, any unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor; ECOG PS of 01; Blood pressure must be wellcontrolled. Patients must have no history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy; Adequate end organ function Exclusion Criteria Gastric cancer patients who have had a complete gastrectomy; Patients with known HER2 overexpressing advanced or metastatic gastric cancer; Previously received E7050, its chemical derivatives, anticMet, antiangiogenic therapy, (prior antiangiogenic therapy is permitted in Phase Ib only). For Phase Ib prior systemic therapy is allowed as long as PS and end organ function meet entry criteria; For Phase II no prior palliative chemotherapy is permitted. Adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is permitted if less than 12 months have elapsed between the end of adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy and first recurrence; Known central nervous system lesions, except for asymptomatic nonprogressing, treated brain metastases. Treatment for brain mets, but have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 Palliative radiotherapy is not permitted throughout the study period. Prior palliative radiotherapy within 30 days prior to commencing study treatment; Clinically significant hemoptysis; Patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency; Patients with clinically significant hearing loss that may be further diminished by treatment with cisplatin plus capecitabine (significance of hearing loss to be determined by the Investigator; Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or active bone fracture; Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within the 21 days prior to commencing study treatment; Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months prior to first dose.</criteria>
