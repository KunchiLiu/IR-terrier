	<brief_title>Silk-Like Fabric for the Prevention of Pressure Sores in a Long Term Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Additional objectives of this research study are: - To evaluate healing of pressure ulcers already present or pressure ulcers that develop during the study. - To evaluate the effectiveness of DermaTherapy® bedding and alternative diapers to reduce the potential for bacterial contamination associated with patients' bed linens, underpads, gowns and pajamas, and thereby help reduce the incidence of facility-acquired infections. Study nurses will assess the skin of the subjects once or twice a week for the presence of pressure ulcers and measure the size of the pressure ulcers if they are present. Study nurses will also obtain bacterial culture swabs of the bedding weekly for the first eight weeks of the study from five participants in each group.</detailed_description>
