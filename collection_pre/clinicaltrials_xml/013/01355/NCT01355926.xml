	<criteria>Biopsy proven diagnosis or clinical diagnosis of any benign oral cavity lesion. Presurgical biopsy will not be required if lesion is suspected to be benign. Biopsy proven diagnosis or clinical diagnosis of premalignant oral cavity lesions (leukoplakia, erythroplakia, lichen planus, dysplasia)Presurgical biopsy will not be required if lesion is suspected to be benign. Biopsy proven diagnosis of small superficial oral cavity SCC (stage T1N0) requiring resection without the need for neck dissection. All pathology will be reviewed at MSK to confirm diagnosis. The lesion plus the resection margin should not exceed 4.0 cm circumferentially. Planned to undergo surgical treatment by resection without flap reconstruction and without neck dissection. All patients age 18 years of age and older. Karnofsky performance score over 60. Patients on blood thinners (aspirin or Coumadin) will be asked to stop medications 7 days prior to surgery. In the case of Coumadin, patients are switched to lovenox 7 days prior to surgery and this is stopped the day before surgery. Following surgery aspirin or Coumadin are recommenced 48 hours postop. Patients with previous Head and Neck radiation Pregnant or lactating female patients. Patients with oral cavity squamous cell cancer requiring neck dissection</criteria>
