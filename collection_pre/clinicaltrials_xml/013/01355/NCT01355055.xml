	<brief_summary>Primary hypothesis: Catheter-based renal denervation reduces central sympathetic activation in patients with refractory hypertension. Secondary hypotheses: 1. The magnitude of the individual depressor response after catheter-based renal denervation depends on the extent of sympathoinhibition. 2. Both, the reduction in arterial pressure and in central sympathetic activation are sustained over time up to 24±3 months after catheter-based renal denervation. 3. Catheter-based renal denervation resets the sympathetic baroreflex to lower blood pressure values.</brief_summary>
