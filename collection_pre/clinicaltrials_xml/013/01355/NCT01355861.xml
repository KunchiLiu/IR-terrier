	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits of negative work progressive resistance exercise (PRE) for the conservative management of sarcopenia in older male Veterans at the DC VAMC. Efficacy will be assessed by examining post-exercise changes in metabolic and inflammatory markers, muscle morphology, strength, and functional status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Exercise for the Prevention of Age-related Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The chief aim of this protocol is to determine the efficacy of negative work progressive resistance exercise (PRE) in the management of sarcopenia in older male Veterans at the DC VAMC. This proposed study is a randomized clinical trial using a single-arm, delayed cross-over design with repeated measures. This method is a patient-first approach to clinical research that permits all participants to receive the intervention while allowing the investigators to conduct both within subjects and between subjects comparisons with a modest study enrollment. During the "pre-treatment period" we will recruit, screen, and consent 30 older men with sarcopenia. The participants will be randomized into two groups: active treatment and delayed treatment. The initial "active treatment" and "delayed treatment" periods will last 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the participants in the delayed treatment group will crossover (without a washout period) and start 12 weeks of intervention. All participants will detrain and be monitored for follow up during their respective 12-week "post treatment" period. Outcome measures include post-exercise changes in metabolic and inflammatory markers, muscle morphology, strength, and functional status.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult, ambulatory males &gt; 60 years old (n=30) will be recruited for this proposed study. Participant inclusion criteria also includes having clinically significant sarcopenia based on the body composition assessment showing an aLM that is &lt; 2 SD below the mean values of a young adult reference group using DEXA scanning. Exclusion criteria include BMI scores &gt; 30 or a MiniMental Status exam score of &lt; 22. The second tier of screening will include the following blood tests, obtained between 89 AM, following a 12hour overnight fast: CBC, routine chemistry profile (e.g., glucose, kidney and liver function tests). Veterans with an elevated fasting blood glucose by WHO criteria (FBG &gt;110 mg/dl), triglyceride levels &gt; 200 mg/dL, and/or known DM, or abnormalities of other routine blood tests (i.e., &gt; 2 SD beyond normal) will be excluded from the study. Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, nonambulatory status, evidence of a major disease exacerbation over the last six months, and current participation in a supervised exercise program (minimum of three months, twice per week) would also preclude participation in this study.</criteria>
