	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better comprehend the benefits and efficacy of portal triad clamping with infrahepatic IVC clamping during complex hepatectomy. A randomized comparative trial was performed to compare PTC(pringle triad clamping) with either infrahepatic IVC clamping or low central venous pressure in complex liver resections.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To better comprehend the benefits and efficacy of portal triad clamping with infrahepatic IVC clamping during complex hepatectomy. A randomized comparative trial was performed to compare PTC with either infrahepatic IVC clamping or low central venous pressure in complex liver resections. 192 consecutive patients were involved in this study and allocated equally to two groups. Preoperative demographic and clinical data, details of surgical procedure, pathologic diagnosis, postoperative course and complications were collected prospectively.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. patients who were assessed by preoperative medical imagings to have a high risk of backflow bleeding from the major hepatic veins and the IVC, based on the size and location of the tumor. The tumors were ≥5 cm in diameter and they involved the liver segments 7, 8 and/or the cranial portion of segment 4. These tumors were in close proximity or were compressing, but had not actually invaded, the major hepatic veins or IVC 2. PughChild Grade A 3. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) &lt; 10%; 4. acceptable clotting profile (platelet count ≥ 50 ×109/L and prothrombin activity ≥ 60%) 5. no previous liver resection. 1. extrahepatic metastases in patients with malignancy; 2. patients who refused to take part in this study.</criteria>
