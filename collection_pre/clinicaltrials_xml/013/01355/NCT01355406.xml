	<brief_summary>This is a clinical study of a new self-expanding stent (FlexStent®) designed specifically to cope with the extreme demands of the superficial femoral artery (SFA)/proximal popliteal artery. The arteries are often abbreviated as femoropopliteal. The intent of this study is to demonstrate that the FlexStent® Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding Stent System is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Specifically, the FlexStent® shall meet or exceed the proposed safety and efficacy performance goals established for Femoropopliteal bare nitinol stents in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subjects must meet the following criteria: 1. Subjects, male or female, must be at least 35 years of age at the time of consent. A female of childbearing potential may be enrolled, provided she has a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of screening. 2. Subjects must give written informed consent prior to participation in the study and must understand the purpose of this study and be willing to adhere to the study procedures described in this protocol. 3. Rutherford Classification Category 24 4. De novo lesion in the Femoropopliteal artery, including the entire extent of the superficial femoral artery and the proximal portion of the popliteal artery extending to the medial condyle 3 cm above the knee joint 5. Disease segment length ≤ 180 mm 6. &gt;70% diameter stenosis and/or occlusion based on sitedetermined visual angiography 7. Patent ipsilateral iliac artery 8. Patency of ipsilateral mid/distal popliteal artery and at least 1 tibial artery with no planned intervention 9. Target reference vessel diameter 3.57.5 mm. 10. Projected life expectancy of 12 months or greater 11. Patient is available for followup for 36 months and is willing and able to comply with all followup requirements 12. Patient is willing and able to provide signed informed consent Any subject meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study. 1. Target vessel previously treated with a stent 2. Target lesion within 1.5 cm of the ostium of the SFA 3. Rutherford Classification Category 0,1,5 or 6 4. Inability to tolerate antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapies 5. Pregnancy (female of childbearing age confirmed pregnant) 6. Other comorbidity risks which in the opinion of the investigator limit longevity or likelihood of complying with protocol follow up. 7. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL 8. Myocardial infarction or stroke within 30 days of treatment date 9. Known hypercoagulable state 10. Known bleeding diathesis 11. Untreated angiographicallyevident thrombus in target vessel 12. Patients currently enrolled in any other clinical trial</criteria>
