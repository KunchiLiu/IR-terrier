	<brief_title>Non-invasive Ventilation System in Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the Breathe Technologies Ventilator System with regard to subject acceptability, comfort, and effect on exercise and activities of daily living tolerance. Primary Hypothesis: 1. When using the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System during simulated activities of daily living (ADL), Subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD will be comfortable and report acceptability. Secondary Hypotheses: 2. When using the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System during simulated ADLs, Subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD will experience tolerable dyspnea as measured using the Borg Dyspnea Score (BDS) and a visual analog Comfort Scale (VACS). 3. Subjects will prefer using the Breathe Technologies Ventilation System over standard oxygen therapy during exertion and during ADLs after using the ventilator therapy for five days.</detailed_description>

Report or have evidence of LVEF &lt; 30 % Have a BMI &gt; 40 Have a history of thoracotomy, sternotomy, major cardiopulmonary intervention (e.g., lung resection, open heart surgery), or any procedure 6 months before study entry likely to cause instability of pulmonary status. Have a history of lung disease unrelated to smoking that affects oxygenation or survival. Is participating in another intervention study or have participated within 90 days of enrollment. Have endobronchial valves or other bronchial tree implants such as stents. Have a disease or condition expected to cause death, inability to perform procedures for the trial, or inability to comply with the therapy.
