	<brief_summary>Different strategies of tourniquet application during elective primary total knee arthroplasty are thought to be associated with different outcomes. In that context, the study investigates different tactics in the search of optimal application of the tourniquet and the related fluid management during 24 perioperative hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Tourniquet Application Methods in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal application of tourniquet should reduce perioperative blood loss, create bloodless operative field, improve cementing technique and shorten surgery time. Meanwhile, inadequate application may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. Previous attempts to compare the tourniquet strategies in respect to the perioperative blood loss did not show significant difference. The investigators use the volume loading test aiming to optimize the fluid status and obtain the hemoglobin concentration in the conditions of standardized plasma dilution. The test is deployed just before the surgery and after postoperative 24 hrs in ICU. Functional outcomes and possible length of hospital stay is also evaluated.</detailed_description>
