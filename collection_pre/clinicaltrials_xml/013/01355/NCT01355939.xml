	<brief_summary>The proposed study will compare the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of intraperitoneal barrier-coated and non-barrier coated ventral hernia repair (VHR) mesh in reducing adhesions, adhesion-related complications, and adhesiolysis sequelae in actual patient subpopulations and clinical circumstances. A subset of the data will be analyzed to compare the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of the laparoscopic and open approaches to adhesiolysis. A comprehensive array of health-related risk factors and patient-centered outcomes will be assessed in the investigators diverse patient population for proper multivariate data analysis. Specific Aim I: To evaluate and compare the adhesion characteristics of intraperitoneal barrier-coated versus non-barrier-coated mesh during abdominal re-exploration after prior ventral hernia repair. Specific Aim II: To evaluate and compare the adhesion-related complications and adhesiolysis-related complications of intraperitoneal barrier-coated versus non-barrier-coated mesh during abdominal re-exploration after prior ventral hernia repair. Specific Aim III: To determine the comparative effectiveness of intraperitoneal barrier-coated versus non-barrier-coated ventral hernia repair mesh in reducing adhesions, adhesion-related complications, and adhesiolysis sequelae in actual patient subpopulations and clinical circumstances. Specific Aim IV: To evaluate and compare the adhesiolysis-related complications of the laparoscopic and open approaches to adhesiolysis during abdominal re-exploration after prior ventral hernia repair. Specific Aim V: To determine the comparative effectiveness of the laparoscopic and open approaches to adhesiolysis during abdominal re-exploration after prior ventral hernia repair.</brief_summary>
