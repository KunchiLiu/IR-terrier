	<brief_summary>Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a noninvasive circulatory assist device that has been as a treatment option for refractory angina in left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Recently, its potential role in heart failure management has been shown. However, although the concept of EECP was introduced almost four decades ago, and despite growing evidence supporting the clinical benefit and safety of this therapeutic modality, little is firmly established regarding the mechanisms responsible for the benefit of EECP include improvement in endothelial function, promotion of coronary collateralization, enhancement of ventricular function, and peripheral effects. Therefore, the major aim of this study is to provide an alternative treatment, EECP, for those unsuitable for standard procedures, especially for patients whose heart failure was caused by repeated myocardial infarction, called ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP), and to evaluate the clinical outcome and the endothelial function before and after 35 hours of EECP treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% by means of left ventricular angiography and symptomatic mildtomoderate heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IIIII). The patient was included if there is no suitable target for either percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical bypass grafting. IF he/she has moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR), history of deep vein thrombosis, or significant arrhythmia.</criteria>
