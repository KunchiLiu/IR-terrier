	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of TachoSil® compared to current practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. The efficacy of the dura mater sealing must be evaluated post-operatively. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of TachoSil® as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. The trial population will consist of 726 randomised (1:1) patients elected for skull base surgery. The trial duration consists of screening, surgery, efficacy follow-up after 7±1 weeks and safety follow-up 28±2 weeks after surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Inclusion Criteria (Positive response): • Is the surgical approach/procedure consistent with skull base surgery? I.e. one of the following: Lateral approach to the foramen magnum: Far lateral, extreme lateral, anterolateral, posterolateral Approach to the jugular foramen: Infratemporal, juxta condylar, transjugular Approach to the cerebello pontine (CP) angle and petrous apex retrosigmoid Approach to the middle fossa: Subtemporal (+/ petrous apex drilling), pterional approach (any fronto temporal approach +/ orbitozygomatic deposition) Approach to the anterior fossa: Subfrontal (uni or bilateral) Approach to the midline posterior fossa Main Exclusion Criteria (Negative response): Has the patient been subject to neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater within the last 3 months? Is the patient anticipated to undergo any additional neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater which may affect the efficacy evaluation (e.g. reoperation or anticipation to undergo several neurosurgeries) before the Efficacy Followup Week 7±1 week? Is the patient anticipated to undergo any additional neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater which may affect the safety evaluation (e.g. reoperation or anticipation to undergo several neurosurgeries) before the Safety Followup Week 28±2 weeks? The surgical approach/procedure is consistent with any transcranial or transfacial or combination of transcranial transfacial approaches with wide defect in the skull base? I.e. any of the following: Trans basal approach Total petrosectomy Trans facial approach Trans sphenoidal approach Endoscopic procedures Trans oral approach (and any extension: Le Fort, mandibulotomy) The surgical approach is consistent with one of the following approaches? Translabyrinthine approach Retrolabyrinthine approach Transcochlear (limited transpetrosal) approach Did the arachnoid membrane and the CSF containing system remain intact during surgery? Does the patient have more than one dura opening (not including dura openings from extraventricular or lumbar drains)? Has TachoSil, fibrin or polymer sealants been used during the current surgery prior to randomization?</criteria>
