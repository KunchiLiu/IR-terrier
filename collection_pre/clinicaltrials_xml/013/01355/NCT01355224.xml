	<brief_summary>This study will examine the impact of providing genetic risk information for obesity on people's attitudes and beliefs about obesity, health behaviors and weight outcomes. Specifically, this study will examine the feasibility of using genetic information to motivate efforts to reduce obesity among individuals recruited to the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (CPMC), see below for description of CPMC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Communicating Risk Information for Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled feasibility trial to examine the short-term impact of personalized risk feedback for obesity. This study is uniquely situated to provide important data on how individuals interpret various sources of risk information and how they arrive at an overall perception of risk for a condition. Taken altogether, study findings will be used to serve as an overall model for future intervention efforts to effectively communicate obesity risk information with the goal of improving weight management and overall population health. CPMC-The CPMC is an ongoing evidence-based longitudinal research study designed to determine the utility of using personal genome information in health management and clinical decision-making. They collect saliva samples, perform genetic analysis and provide genetic risk feedback for several disease conditions including coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. The present study will build upon the existing genetic testing and web feedback infrastructure at Coriell to conduct behavioral science research to address critical public health questions.</detailed_description>
