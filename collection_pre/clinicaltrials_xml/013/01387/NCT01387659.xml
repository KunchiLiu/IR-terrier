	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the tolerability of Myfortic®/Simulect® combination in diabetic patients in a steroid free regimen. Due to the diverse ethnicity of our transplant recipient population, our study will determine any different responses, including autoimmunity, between Hispanic, and Caucasian, patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Tolerability of Myfortic®/Simulect® and Tacrolimus Without Steroids in Three Patient Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myfortic® is an enteric-coated formulation of the sodium salt derivative of mycophenolic acid (MPA) that is administered to control kidney graft rejection. Myfortic® was developed to improve MPA-related upper gastrointestinal (GI) side effects by delaying the release of MPA until it reaches the large surface of the small bowel. Approximately half of all the kidney transplant recipients in the United States have diabetes mellitus. A recent analysis of approximately 30,000 kidney transplant recipients included in the U.S. Renal Data System showed that 42% of patients had pre-transplant diabetes (1). Moreover, 15% to 20% of patients develop diabetes after transplantation, a condition that is commonly known as post-diabetes mellitus (1-3). It was previously shown that the rate and extent of MPA absorption is minimally affected by diabetes (4). Limited data is available in the current literature on Myfortic® and Simulect® based therapy in diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
