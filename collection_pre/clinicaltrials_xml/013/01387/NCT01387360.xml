	<brief_title>Presbyopic Supracor Treatment for Near Myopic/Hyperopic Pseudophakic Eyes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study has been planned to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SUPRACOR presbyopic excimer laser treatment algorithm for near myopic and near hyperopic indications, with or without astigmatism, when performed on the cornea of pseudophakic eyes implanted with a monofocal IOL.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must be at least 45 years old Subjects must read, understand, and sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled followup examinations through 6 months after surgery. Subjects must have undergone previous uncomplicated cataract surgery with monofocal IOL implant in the study eye at least 3 months prior to study enrollment. Subjects must have up to +/ 2.0 (D) of absolute spherical myopia or hyperopia (not spherical equivalent), with up to +/ 2.0 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction. The spherical equivalent must be no more than +/ 2.0 D. Subjects who have be screened successfully for acceptance of the SUPRACOR simulation Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of remaining corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively. Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested computersimulated treatment plan (e.G. Keratoconus).</criteria>
