	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to explore safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of ASP015K, establish the maximum tolerated dose, and determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ASP015K</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be confined to the clinical research unit for five days. Some subjects will participate in two confinement periods. Subjects will receive a follow-up phone call to assess safety seven days after the administration of the single dose of study drug. Subjects will be assigned to one of nine sequential groups A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, or I. In each group, 6 subjects will be randomized to ASP015K and 2 subjects will be randomized to placebo. Subjects in group F will participate in two treatment periods. Subjects in the first treatment period of group F will have a single study drug dose administered in the fasted state. Subjects in the second treatment period of group F will have a single study drug dose administered immediately following a standard FDA recommended high-fat breakfast.</detailed_description>
