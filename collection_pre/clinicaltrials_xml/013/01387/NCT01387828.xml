	<brief_title>Comparison Between Open and Laparoscopic Splenic Aneurysms Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopy has not spread into vascular surgery as it has in other surgical branches and still remains in the hands of a minority of surgeons. Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is an exception to the rule: an easy-to-reach position and relatively safe control favour the progressive diffusion of laparoscopic techniques. An increasing number of cases is managed by minimally invasive surgery originating a number of case reports and small series published in recent literature. These papers are unanimous in signalling the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic technique as well as its appreciation by patients -often young females- who harbour the disease. However, perplexities still remain concerning the real potential of laparoscopy in this specific field, in particular considering the spectrum of technical solutions to be performed, the splenectomy rate and the feasibility and results of reconstructive surgery. The low incidence of the disease justifies the low number of published laparoscopic series enrolling an adequate number of patients and, in particular, the absence of papers comparing open and laparoscopic techniques. This study reports the first prospective randomized comparison of the different surgical techniques.</detailed_description>
