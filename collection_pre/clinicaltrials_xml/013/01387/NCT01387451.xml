	<brief_summary>Retrospective studies have combined positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) to identify adipose tissue with a high rate of uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose(18F-FDG) as active brown adipose tissue(BAT). In addition, biopsy specimens and immunohistochemical staining with a UCP1-specific antiserum were used to indicate that normal adults were able to have BAT. However,these studies only chose few subjects and limited to the neck tissue. Therefore, the investigators intend to test BAT in different parts of adults and analyse the clinical factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Detection and Factors of Brown Adipose Tissue in Different Locations of Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will promote the cross-sectional study from 2010 to 2013 in Shanghai. Data on demographic statistics, medical history,physical examination and fasting blood sample will be collected for all patients. Adipose tissue of adults will be collected from different regions, such as cervical, perirenal, along the large blood vessels and trachea, because they are included in the range of surgical therapy and are the major locations of BAT. Adipose tissue samples will be used to immunohistochemical stain, to detect the expression of BAT related genes.</detailed_description>
