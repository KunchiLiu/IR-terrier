	<brief_summary>A single center trial to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and acceptability of Oxygenated Glycerol Triesters (OGT) mentholated cream on acute musculoskeletal pain in normal healthy adult volunteers suffering from a recent inflammation of muscles and joints. Patient who met eligibility requirements were instructed to identify one area on their body where they were experiencing the most acute musculoskeletal pain/discomfort. Patients were provided with visual analog scales in order to quantify their pain. Patients either received mentholated cream with or without OGT and instructed to rub on the identified site 3 times a day for 7 days. Pain and other observations were written in a diary for each day.</brief_summary>
