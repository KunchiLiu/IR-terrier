	<brief_summary>This study compares the effects of Individualized Scheduled Telephone Support (ISTS) and Usual Care (UC) for service members with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). A total of 400 service members will participate in this study. ISTS is a telephone intervention that provides injury-related education, training in problem solving, and focused behavioral strategies for problems (e.g. anxiety, depression) that commonly co-occur with MTBI. ISTS also includes access to usual care and web-based and printed educational material. The 12 phone calls included in ISTS will be administered over a 6-month period. UC is the usual care provided to service members attending the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Clinics at Madigan Army Medical Center and Womack Army Medical Center, plus web-based education and 12 mailings of educational materials over a 6-month period. Subjects will complete major assessments at study entry and then 6 months and 12 months later. The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of ISTS and UC on post-concussive symptoms and emotional distress at the 6-month assessment. The investigators predict that participants who receive ISTS will report lower levels of post-concussive symptoms and emotional distress at the 6-month assessment. Secondary aims include comparing the longer term effects of ISTS and UC at the 12-month assessment, as well as comparing their effects on other outcomes such as post-traumatic stress symptoms, quality of life, resilience, and work activity.</brief_summary>
