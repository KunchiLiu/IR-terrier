	<brief_summary>This is a phase II trial evaluating intra-hepatic chemotherapy with oxaliplatin every second week in combination with systemic capecitabine and in patients with a HER2-positive tumour in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in patient with non-resectable liver metastases from breast cancer. Only patients with limited extrahepatic disease are included.</brief_summary>
