	<criteria>KEY Diagnosis of primary HCC by tissue biopsy (histological/cytological diagnosis), or clinical diagnosis Previously treated with sorafenib for ≥ 14 days and has discontinued sorafenib treatment at least 14 days prior to randomization due to either intolerance or radiographic progression NOTE: Sorafenib is NOT required to be the most recent treatment received for HCC ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 ChildPugh Class A; or ChildPugh Class B7 without clinically significant ascites Hematocrit ≥30% or Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL Tumor status: Measurable viable tumor in the liver and injectable under imagingguidance; At least one tumor in the liver that has not received prior localregional treatment OR that has exhibited &gt;25% growth in viable tumor size since prior localregional treatment. KEY Received sorafenib within 14 days prior to randomization Received systemic anticancer therapy other than sorafenib within 28 days of randomization Prior treatment with JX594 Platelet count &lt; 50,000 PLT/ mm3 Total white blood cell count &lt; 2,000 cells/mm3 Prior or planned organ transplant Known significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and/or medication Severe or unstable cardiac disease Viable CNS malignancy associated with clinical symptoms Pregnant or nursing an infant History of inflammatory skin condition (e.g., eczema requiring previous treatment, atopic dermatitis)</criteria>
