	<brief_title>Cell Therapy in Diabetic Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction(STEMI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stem cells are capable of the important properties of self-renewal and differentiation plasticity. Human autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) contain CD34+ haematopoietic and CD34- mesenchymal stem cells. Both of these cell types may contribute to heart muscle repair in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In recent years, a variety of clinical trials have explored the hypothesis that BMMNC transplantation may enhance the recovery of left ventricular function after AMI. The use of BMMNC is clinically justified and ethically unquestionable because no severe side effects have been reported and immunosuppressive therapy is unnecessary. More over, our previous work showed that patients without diabetes may benefit more from BMMNC transplantation. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) transplantation for diabetic and non-diabetic patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)who have undergone PCI.</detailed_description>
