	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Cryoablation for Metastatic Lung Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECLIPSE is a treatment, Phase 1 multicenter, prospective, single arm study with patients serving as their own control. This study is to enroll patients who will undergo cryoablation of at least 1 metastatic pulmonary tumor that is less than or equal to 3.5 cm. Patients will be followed to 5 years post their cryoablation procedure. Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of extremely cold temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool in the fields of general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery (including lung), Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology (colon/rectal) and urology (kidney).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient must be at least 18 years old. Patient presents with Stage 4 pulmonary metastatic disease with metastatic disease previously confirmed by prior biopsy or confirmed on imaging with known primary disease. Patient has up to 3 local metastases unilaterally targeted by cryoablation. Maximum of 5 total pulmonary tumors bilaterally. Targeted tumor(s) defined as intra pulmonary or pleural with a maximum size of 3.5 cm. The target tumor is determined to be in a location where cryoablation is technically achievable. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 02. Karnofsky Performance Scale score â‰¥60. Platelet count &gt;50,000/mm3. INR less than 1.5. Patient's primary cancer is lung cancer. Patient has had chemotherapy with neutropenia to levels as confirmed by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1000 that produce increase risk for the cryoablation procedure. Patient has evidence of active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection.</criteria>
