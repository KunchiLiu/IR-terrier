	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study was to assess whether the protection afforded by Epaxal vaccine co-administered with diphtheria, tetanus, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and inactivated polio vaccine(DTPaHibIPV), oral polio vaccine (OPV) and (measles mumps and rubella) MMR vaccines against hepatitis A was not inferior to the protection afforded by Epaxal administered alone. The aim of the follow-up phase is to obtain information on the long term protection afforded by Epaxal, and to compare this with an alternative hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Original study: Written informed consent obtained from the parent/legal guardian of the subject. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and/or clinical examination before entering the study. At least 8 kg of body weight at age of 12 months. Followup phase: Subjects enrolled and randomised in the original study and having received two doses of the hepatitis A study vaccines. Original study: Children not having received 3 documented doses of DTPaHib and polio vaccines during infancy Children having received a documented dose of MMR during infancy Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period and the 30 days safety followup after the last dose. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Administration of systemic corticosteroids (inhaled and topical steroids are allowed). Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study vaccine. Previous vaccination against hepatitis A. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Followup phase: Children who had received a hepatitis A antigen containing vaccine since the last visit</criteria>
