	<brief_title>Web-Based Weight Loss &amp; Weight Maintenance Intervention for Older Rural Women, Also Known as Women Weigh-in for Wellness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the National Institutes of Health, "obesity is one of the most daunting health challenges of the 21st century". Approximately 2/3 of all adults are overweight or obese. Efforts to abate the growing prevalence of obesity have not been successful. The Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research proposes preventing and treating obesity through lifestyle modification. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention framed within the Health Promotion Model (HPM) in facilitating weight loss and maintenance through promotion of healthy eating and physical activity among an underserved, vulnerable population of overweight or obese rural women aged 40-69. During these years, women experience increases in peri- and post-menopausal health risks that are magnified if they are overweight or obese. Weight loss will reduce risks and enhance functional status as they age. Maintenance of weight loss will be emphasized. The Internet offers a way to reach isolated rural women who have limited options for weight loss guidance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is recognized as a major and growing public health problem. While many weight loss programs have been successful in the short term, they have not been successful in helping to maintain weight loss.</detailed_description>
