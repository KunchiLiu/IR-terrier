	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cell growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether rituximab is more effective when given alone or together with lenalidomide in treating patients with follicular lymphoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying rituximab to see how well it works compared with giving rituximab together with lenalidomide in treating patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab With or Without Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the activity of rituximab in combination with lenalidomide versus rituximab alone in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma in need of therapy. Secondary - To determine the safety of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to grade of disease (grades 1 or 2 vs 3a), presence of bulky disease (defined as masses ≥ 6 cm) (yes vs no), Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score (1 or 2 vs ≥ 3), and participating centers. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm A: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and weeks 12, 13, 14, 15 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm B: Patients receive rituximab IV as in arm A. Patients also receive oral lenalidomide once daily, starting 14 days before first rituximab administration and last until 14 days after the last rituximab administration, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients undergo restaging at week 10. Patients who show less than a minimal response (i.e., reduction of more than 25% in sum of product of diameters [SPD]) are off study treatment and transferred to the follow-up phase. Patients undergo a second restaging in week 23. Some patients may undergo biopsies and blood and bone marrow sample collection periodically for biomarker studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 20 years.</detailed_description>
