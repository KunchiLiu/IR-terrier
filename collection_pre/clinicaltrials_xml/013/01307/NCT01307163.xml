	<brief_summary>Saliva is used nowadays as a significant diagnostic tool due to the latest technological developments. The research compares two experimental groups; children after liver transplantation and a control group. Our objective is to identify from all the parameters that are evaluated, the ones that differ between the two groups. If such parameters will be found and differ statistically, it will be possible to create a non invasive medical examination protocol, which will probably be much more complaint, and being so would help locate individuals in risk groups with the tendency to develop an end-organ liver disease.</brief_summary>
