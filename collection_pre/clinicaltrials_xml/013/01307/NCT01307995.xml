	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the reduced incretin effect observed in patients with T2DM in relation to reversibility. The incretin effect will be measured by means of OGTT and iIVGTT in 12 women with GDM during pregnancy (third trimester), and again 2-3 months post partum. It is anticipated that the incretin effect in patients with GDM is reduced - like in patients with other forms of DM. The investigators estimate that approximately 90 % of the patients with GDM re-establish a NGT 2-3 months post partum. This particular group of patients provides a unique possibility for demonstrating the reversibility of the reduced incretin effect in relation to optimal glycaemic control.</brief_summary>
