	<brief_summary>In 2010, the sponsor conducted an observational study, entitled as "Nationwide Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Blood Pressure, Blood Lipid, and Blood Glucose, in Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes - 3B Study " which was to evaluate the level of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factor control and its regional difference in China. As a continuation, this extension of the 3B Study is designed to assess the incidence of cardiovascular events, cardio-renal events, and other microvascular complications, in 1, 2 and 3 years in patients with type 2 diabetes and with high risk of (CVD) with or without existing or history of coronary artery diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comprehensive Longitudinal Cohort Study in Type 2 Diabetes With High Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limited by its cross sectional design, 3B study was not be able to provide any information on how various patterns of treatment and prescribing behaviors would impact the outcomes of prevention of cardiovascular and cardio-renal diseases in type 2 diabetes longitudinally. This information, however, would be crucial in better guiding the real world medical practice and maximizing the effectiveness of medical treatment for better controlling cardiovascular risk factors. The 3B Extension study is thus designed to extend the 3B study by continuing to follow up on enrolled patients for 3 years. The 3B Extension study is expected to demonstrate the clinical outcomes of nationally representative type 2 diabetes patients who are treated by endocrinologists, cardiologists and nephrologists separately in all tiers of hospitals, as measured by diabetes progression, incidence of cardiovascular complications, and incidence of microvascular complications. It will be the first study of this scale in China based on its exclusivity, extensiveness, and the level of government and national thought leaders' support. It will be conducted in collaboration with the advisory board of China Cardiometabolic Registries (CCMR).</detailed_description>
