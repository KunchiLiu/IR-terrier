	<brief_title>Zimmer Continuum Metal on Polyethylene (MoP) PostMarket Clinical Followup (PMCF) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and performance of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System will be confirmed by the assessment of survival and outcome data. Assessments will include standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records. Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility, and survivorship of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular system in primary total hip arthroplasty. Metal ion (cobalt, chromium and titanium) and renal function (BUN, Creatinine and GFR) levels will be analyzed for a subset of the enrolled study subjects.</detailed_description>
