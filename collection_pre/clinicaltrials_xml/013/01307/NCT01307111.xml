	<brief_title>Misoprostol Prior to Intrauterine Device (IUD) Insertion in Nulliparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Intrauterine Device (IUD) is an excellent contraceptive option because of its ease of use, long term duration (5-10 years), low side-effect profile, and the immediate return to fertility after IUD removal. Despite advantages associated with the IUD, the smaller cervical diameter of nulliparous patients may lead to a more difficult and uncomfortable insertion. Some providers have started pre-medicating nulliparous patients with misoprostol prior to IUD insertion because of the drug's known effect as a cervical ripening agent. Limited evidence is available addressing the effect of misoprostol on patient comfort and provider ease of IUD insertion in nulliparous women. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether using misoprostol as a cervical ripening agent in nulliparous patients eases IUD insertion and decreases pain.</detailed_description>
