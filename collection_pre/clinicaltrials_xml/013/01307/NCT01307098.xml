	<brief_summary>This is the first clinical study of SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa) for the treatment of LAL Deficiency. It is an open label dose escalation study in adult patients with liver dysfunction due to Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency and will examine three doses of SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa). The targeted number for this study is 9 evaluable subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD) is the late onset phenotype for Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency, a Lysosomal Storage Disorder, which also has an early onset phenotype known as Wolman Disease that primarily affects infants. CESD can present in childhood but often goes unrecognized until adulthood when the underlying pathology is advanced. Many of the signs and symptoms are common to patients with other liver conditions. CESD is an autosomal recessive genetic condition and is characterized by hepatomegaly, persistently abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and type II hyperlipidemia. Splenomegaly and evidence of mild hypersplenism may affect some patients. Untreated, CESD may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Disease Risk In Families: - 25 per million incidence - Autosomal recessive disorder, LAL deficiency is carried on chromosome 10 - Parents with an affected son or daughter have a 1 in 4 chance of having another affected child</detailed_description>
