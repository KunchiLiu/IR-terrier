	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center registry of 75 patients treated with the Over and Under/Aneugraft Pericardium Covered Stent (PCS) (IGTI, Israel). The registry will involve the collection of demographic, clinical, and angiographic data on the treated patient population, including in-hospital, 30 day, 6-month, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years clinical follow-up data.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient is older than 18 years Patient must be available for followup Patient must be fully informed, provided with the patient information sheet and sign the Informed Consent Form prior to the procedure. The lesion to be treated should be suitable for treatment with a PCS in that: A. A suitable length and diameter PCS should be available B. For SVG disease a single or multiple PCS may be used C. For native coronary artery aneurysms the operator should be confident that the aneurysm may be excluded by the implantation of a single PCS Significant comorbidity precluding clinical followup. Pregnancy; pregnancy test negative in women with child bearing potential Acute STelevation myocardial infarction within the preceding 48 hours Previous stent implantation in the target vessel Left main coronary artery disease Contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy. Planned surgery which will lead to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/mm3) Ejection fraction &lt;30%.
