	<detailed_description>This study will be a 2 arm controlled clinical trial (CCT) comparing usual care to usual care plus MBSR. Participants will be residents of a local inpatient treatment facility for adolescents with serious mental health issues. Outcomes the investigators will measure include mental health status as well as mindfulness. The investigators will also conduct qualitative interviews to assess the personal impact of the intervention on the patients and their families. In order to map and measure cognitive changes during MBSR the investigators will conduct brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Event-Related Potential (ERP) recordings. Through this study the investigators will determine if MBSR is helpful to our population.</detailed_description>
