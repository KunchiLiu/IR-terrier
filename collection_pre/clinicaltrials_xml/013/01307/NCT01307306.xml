	<brief_summary>The central aim of this application is to determine whether improved outcomes with tight euglycemic control are due to insulin-specific responses. The investigators hypothesize that improving insulin resistance will lead to decreased inflammatory and hypermetabolic responses, as well as restored glucose metabolism, and so result in improved clinical outcome of severely burned patients.</brief_summary>
