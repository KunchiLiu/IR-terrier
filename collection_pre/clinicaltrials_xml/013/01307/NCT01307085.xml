	<brief_title>Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Lung Injury After Pulmonary Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Remote ischemic preconditioning is an intervention in which brief ischemia of one tissue or organ protects remote organs from a sustained episode of ischemia. It is known that one-lung ventilation in patients undergoing pulmonary resection, which may cause acute lung injury. The investigators did a single-blinded randomised controlled study to establish whether remote ischemic preconditioning reduces lung injury in these patients.</detailed_description>
