	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty is amongst the most painful procedures postoperatively, and pain management can be a challenge. Different measures have been introduced to manage severe postoperative pain int hese patients. Previous studies have investigated gabapentin in acute postoperative pain and demonstrated reducted pain, postoperative morphine consumption, morphine related side effects, and postoperative pain scores. To date, this analgesia adjunct has yet to be investigated in total joint arthroplasty patients.</brief_summary>
