	<brief_title>Impact of a High-fat Meal on Assessment of Clopidogrel-induced Platelet Inhibition in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of a high-fat meal on assessment of clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition in healthy people using platelet function assays. Twelve healthy adult subjects will be recruited to take part in this research study. After consent is obtained, subjects will be asked to present to the clinical research center after a 12 hour fast. A baseline blood sample will be drawn at 8 am, and subjects will then be administered a 600 mg dose of clopidogrel. At 12 noon, another blood sample will be drawn to evaluate the extent of maximum platelet inhibition in the fasting state. Subjects will then be provided a standardized high-fat meal with an additional blood sample at 2 pm to evaluate the impact of the high-fat on platelet function assessment.</detailed_description>
