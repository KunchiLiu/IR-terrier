	<brief_title>Exercise Training Program for Cerebellar Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cerebellum is important for coordination of movement and for motor learning. No medications systematically improve cerebellar ataxia, and little is known about the effectiveness of rehabilitation exercises, which are often the only treatment option. Here, we ask whether a person's ability to adapt (i.e. short term motor learning) predicts their ability to benefit from physical therapy exercises. This pilot-clinical trial will test a subject's ability to adaptively learn a new walking pattern in a single session, and then any improvement of walking and balance over a 13 week time period during which they participate in a specialized home exercise training program. Our prediction is that those individuals with some preserved adaptive learning ability will be the best rehabilitation candidates.</detailed_description>
