	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest form of joint disease, characterized by articular cartilage degradation with an accompanying periarticular bone response and a synovial membrane inflammation. Clinical manifestations of OA in the knee include pain in and around the joint, stiffness of the joint after rest, crepitus on motion and limited joint. MM-II medical device was designed to reduce wear and lower friction in knees of osteoarthritis patients by creating a lubricating layer onto cartilage surfaces upon injection. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medical device MM-II is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, in direct comparison with an approved hyaluronic acid preparation.</detailed_description>
