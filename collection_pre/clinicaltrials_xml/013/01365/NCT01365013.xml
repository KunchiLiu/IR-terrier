	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Translation of the DE-PLAN Program for the Primary Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Routine Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DE-PLANЄ program for the primary prevention of type-II diabetes in high-risk population seen in primary care centers (Osakidetza) in which such intervention is implemented, compared to usual care control centers. DESIGN AND METHODS: A phase IV cluster randomized prospective clinical trial, conducted in 14 primary care centers from Osakidetza, which will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group, that will collect a sample of 2534 followed for two years, aged 45 to 70 years without diabetes but with high risk of developing it (FINDRISC scale&gt; 14), identified by a screening system. Nurses in intervention centers (GI) will implement DEPLANЄ for 12 months, a structured educational intervention on healthy lifestyles (diet and physical activity), while patients of the control centers will receive standard care for the prevention and treatment of type-II diabetes. ANALYSIS: The feasibility will be reported as the reach, adoption and implementation of the program. The attributable effectiveness of the program will be determined by comparing the changes in the incidence and risk of developing diabetes in healthy habits quality of life, observed in patients exposed to DE-PLANЄ intervention and of patients from control centers. The incremental cost-utility of DE-PLANЄ program will be also analysed.</detailed_description>
