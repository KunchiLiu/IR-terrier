	<brief_summary>This study had an open-label, single-dose design. All subjects received a single dose of 30 mg of intranasal ketorolac. Blood samples for determination of ketorolac plasma levels were obtained pre-dose and at specified time points over 24 hours post-dose. The primary objective of this trial was to compare the pharmacokinetics of intranasal ketorolac between elderly and nonelderly adult subjects. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety profile of intranasal ketorolac in elderly subjects.</brief_summary>
