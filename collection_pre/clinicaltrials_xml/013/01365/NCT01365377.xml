	<brief_summary>Anxiety and depression are symptoms frequently met in ICU patients and relatives. Risk factors are known: disease severity, age, gender. Another risk factor is lack of information from the medical staff and nurses. Anxiety and depression can be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Other scales are used in the psychiatric field : the Impact Event Score - Revisited (IES-R) is relevant to detect Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is an assessment of life quality. In the following study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of a "brochure" as complement of oral information on Anxiety developed by relatives and family of ICU patients. The medical and surgical ICU is composed by two different units (different medical and nurse team, different location in the same hospital) of 12 beds on one side, 14 beds on the other side. During a year, in the first unit, the investigators will use the booklet as support and complement of oral information : "booklet arm". The information process will be as usual in the other unit : "control arm". During the second year, the booklet will be used in the second unit while the first unit will return to the usual oral information (cross-over). For each included patient, one relative or family member is pointed to be the referring family member or "referent". This "referent" receives the HADS questionnaire at Day 3 after admission, at day of discharge if the patient is alive, at one month after discharge. The IES-R questionnaire is delivered at discharge of the living patient and at day 30. The SF-36 questionnaire is given to the "referent" and the living patient at day 30. The day 30 questionnaires are send by mail at the "referent" address.</brief_summary>
