	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lower doses of primaquine compared to the dose recommended by the WHO for reducing P. falciparum gametocytes in the infected human host to prevent transmission of falciparum malaria to the anopheles mosquito vector.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Gametocytocidal Efficacy and Safety of Primaquine in Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria in Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single dose of 0.75mg/kg primaquine base is recommended by the WHO to block transmission of falciparum malaria from infected humans to mosquitoes by clearing gametocytes. However, the optimal dose for safety and efficacy has not been evaluated. Dose-finding data is important because primaquine has a dose-dependent risk of causing haemolysis (destruction of blood cells) in pre-disposed individuals, such as those with G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in malaria-endemic areas. Therefore, it is essential that data on primaquine's safety is available in such areas. The investigators hypothesise that lower doses of primaquine have a lower risk of adverse effects compared to the WHO-recommended dose, but retain the transmission-blocking efficacy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a four-arm clinical trial with a non-inferiority design to evaluate the efficacy and a superiority design to evaluate the safety of the WHO dose (0.75mg/kg) and lower doses of primaquine for clearance of P. falciparum gametocytes in children in Uganda. The study will include a pharmacokinetic analysis.</detailed_description>
