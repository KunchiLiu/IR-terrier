	<brief_summary>To date, no study has prospectively compared open versus robotic radical prostatectomy in a randomized fashion for patients with prostate cancer. For patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who choose surgical management, the choice of surgical approach is often limited to surgeon preference and experience. This study will prospectively randomize patients with localized prostate cancer who are candidates for surgical management to open versus robotic radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
