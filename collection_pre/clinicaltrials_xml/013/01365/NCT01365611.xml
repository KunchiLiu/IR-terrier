A single intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine was administered to all subjects on Days 1 and 6; in addition, subjects received a daily intranasal dose of 200 Âµg fluticasone propionate on Days 2-6. Subjects remained resident in the Clinical Unit from the evening of Day 1 until the morning of Day 2 and from the evening of Day 5 until the morning of Day 7, and made ambulatory visits to the Clinical Unit on the morning of Days 3-5.
