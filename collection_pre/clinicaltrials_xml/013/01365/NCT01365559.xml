	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study for patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) who will receive treatment with carfilzomib in place of bortezomib using the same bortezomib-containing combination regimen to which a MM patient has progressed while receiving. This study will enroll 45 patients total. These patients will be resistant to bortezomib as demonstrated by progressive disease while on bortezomib or have relapsed within 12 weeks of the last dose of bortezomib in a combination regimen. Patients will be sub-divided into 2 groups in this study, treatments containing (Group A) or not containing immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (Group B). Thirty patient will be enrolled into Group A and 15 patients into Group B for a total of 45 patients. Patients must have received 4 doses of a minimum of 1.0 mg/m^2 of bortezomib in no more than 4 weeks per cycle. Patients must have received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown progressive disease to be considered eligible. Patients who have been refractory to or relapsed within 12 weeks of the last dose of bortezomib in their most recent bortezomib-containing regimen that does not include either thalidomide or lenalidomide are eligible regardless of when patients received that regimen, as long as they meet the above criteria. Carfilzomib will subsequently replace bortezomib using the patient's most recent bortezomib-containing regimen to which the patient progressed while receiving. Patients will be eligible if they progressed from bortezomib with an alkylating agent (melphalan or cyclophosphamide), an anthracycline (doxorubicin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and/or a glucocorticosteroid (prednisone, dexamethasone or medrol)and IMiD (thalidomide or lenalidomide). The study will consist of a screening period, followed by up to eight open label treatment cycles, a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle, a follow-up period and maintenance cycles of single agent carfilzomib. Patient who complete the combination treatment period without progressive disease will be eligible for maintenance therapy with single-agent carfilzomib. During maintenance therapy carfilzomib will be administered at the same dose given during the last cycle of combination treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion: Diseaserelated: 1. Have a diagnosis of MM based on standard criteria 2. Currently has MM with measurable disease, defined as a monoclonal immunoglobulin spike on serum electrophoresis of at least 0.5 gm/dL and/or urine monoclonal immunoglobulin amount of at least 200 mg/24 hours. 3. Have relapsed within 12 weeks of receiving or is refractory to their most recent bortezomibcontaining regimen as long as they meet the following criteria: Progressed from bortezomibcontaining regimen either as a single agent or in combination with an alkylating agent (melphalan or cyclophosphamide), an anthracycline (doxorubicin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), IMiDs (thalidomide or lenalidomide), and/or a glucocorticosteroid (prednisone, dexamethasone or medrol) Bortezomib must have been administered at 4 doses of a minimum of 1.0 mg/m2 in no more than 28 days per cycle. Subjects must have received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown progressive disease to be considered eligible. Subject who have been refractory to their most recent bortezomibcontaining regimen are eligible regardless of when the subject received that regimen, as long as they meet the above criteria and have been off the treatment for &gt; 3 weeks. Definition of refractory disease: patients who meet criteria for progressive disease while currently receiving treatment. Demographics: 4. Age ≥ 18 years 5. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months 6. ECOG performance status 02 at study entry Laboratory tests (within 14 days prior to drug dosing on Cycle 1, Day 1) 7. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L; if the bone marrow is extensively infiltrated (&gt; 70% plasma cells) then 1.0 x 109/L 8. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (subjects may be receiving red blood cell [RBC] transfusions in accordance with institutional guidelines) 9. Platelet count ≥ 75 × 109/L; if the bone marrow is extensively infiltrated (&gt; 70% plasma cells) then 50 x 10^9/L 10. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/minute either measured or calculated. Subject with a creatinine &gt; 15mL/min and &lt; 30 mL/min due to significant myelomatous involvement of the kidneys may be enrolled in the study after receipt of approval from Oncotherapeutics. 11. Adequate hepatic function, with AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present and serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 12.
