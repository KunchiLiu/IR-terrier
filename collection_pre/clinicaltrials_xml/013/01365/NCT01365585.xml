	<brief_summary>The objective of this observational study is to gain clinical insight on the actual use of sildenafil citrate (Revatio™) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The primary objective is to assess effectiveness and safety of sildenafil at doses ≥20mg three times daily for the treatment of PAH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate The Clinical Effectiveness, Safety And Tolerability Of Sildenafil Used In Doses ≥20mg TID For The Treatment Of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design proposed is a retrospective chart review going back five years (01 April 2006 estimate) from the time of study initiation (31 March 2011 estimate). Within this five-year period, study index will occur the first time an adult patient begins sildenafil for the treatment of PAH for a period of at least three months. The patient has to be taking sildenafil at doses ≥ 20mg tid for the treatment of PAH.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be at least 18 years of age at study index; Patients must have a diagnosis of PAH. PAH is conventionally defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of &gt; 25 mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≤ 15 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 240 dynes/s/cm5 at right heart catheterization; Patients must have initiated sildenafil for the treatment of their PAH; at dose ≥ 20 mg tid within 5 years prior to study initiation Patient has known contraindications to sildenafil at study index; Patient participated in an investigational study of sildenafil treatment for PAH during the period beginning 6 months prior to study index</criteria>
