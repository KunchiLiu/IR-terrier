	<brief_title>Tiotropium in Patients With Tuberculosis (TB) Destroyed Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis can cause lung parenchymal destruction, volume loss, secondary bronchiectasis. Patients with TB destroyed lung complain chronic respiratory symptoms, such as chronic cough, sputum, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and acute exacerbations. Some of them have chronic airflow obstructions on pulmonary function tests, similar to those of smokers. Previous large randomized controlled trials, targeting patients with smoking related moderate to severe COPD,demonstrated that tiotropium improved quality of life and respiratory symptom with tolerable long-term safety. The investigators want to evaluate whether tiotropium can improve chronic respiratory symptom,an lung function in patients with COPD due to TB destroyed lung.</detailed_description>
