	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine and quantify the degree of surface insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) expression in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) tumor tissue. - To assess the feasibility and validity of a mass spectrometry assay for IGF-IR expression on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue slides are analyzed for insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R) expression by mass spectrometry and correlated with the results obtained by IHC assay.</detailed_description>
