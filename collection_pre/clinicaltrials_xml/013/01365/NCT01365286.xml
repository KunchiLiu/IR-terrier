	<brief_title>HR-lowering Efficacy and Respiratory Safety of Ivabradine in Patients With Obstructive Airway Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 asthmatics and 20 COPD patients received ivabradine 7,5 mg b.i.d. and placebo for 5 days in crossover manner. HR in ECG holter monitoring, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), symptoms, rescue medication consumption and AEs were evaluated in both periods of treatment.</detailed_description>
