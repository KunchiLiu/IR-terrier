	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia and North America. The aim of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) once daily in insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus when using two different titration algorithms (dose individually adjusted) as add-on to subject's ongoing treatment with metformin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed clinically) for 24 weeks or longer prior to randomisation (visit 2) Insulin naïve subjects (Allowed are: Previous short term insulin treatment no longer than or equal to 14 days in total; Treatment during hospitalisation or during gestational diabetes is allowed for periods longer than 14 days in total) Current treatment: Metformin alone or metformin in any combination of 1 or 2 additional OADs (oral antidiabetic drug) including an insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea or glinide), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors, alphaglucosidase inhibitors or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) all with unchanged dosing for at least 12 weeks prior to randomisation (visit 2). Metformin dose, alone or in combination (including fixed combination), must be at least 1000 mg daily HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) 7.010.0% (both inclusive) BMI (Body Mass Index) below or equal to 45 kg/m^2 Ability and willingness to adhere to the protocol including self measurement of plasma glucose Treatment with GLP1 (glucagon like peptide) receptor agonists within the last 12 weeks prior to randomisation (visit 2) Recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (more than one severe hypoglycaemic event during the last 12 months) or hypoglycaemic unawareness as judged by the Investigator (trial physician) Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised. Rescreening is allowed once during the recruitment period Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial products or related products The receipt of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to randomisation (visit 2) Anticipated significant lifestyle changes during the study, e.g. shift work (including permanent night/evening shift workers) as well as highly variable eating habits</criteria>
