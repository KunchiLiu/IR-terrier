	<brief_summary>The current standard for pain relief during prostate biopsy is the injection of local anesthetic agents into or around the prostate at various sites including apex, base, lateral aspects and into the prostate itself. Despite such anesthetic injection, some men still experience severe pain and often at the base of the penis. The study audits current practices comparing the degree of pain relief provided by injection at basal versus basal+apical sites. All these injection sites are standard practice at our hospital.</brief_summary>
