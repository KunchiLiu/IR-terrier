	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate work in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate together with combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib and Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without high allelic ratio fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3)/internal tandem duplications (ITD)+ mutations who are randomized to standard therapy versus bortezomib/standard combination therapy. II. To determine the feasibility of combining bortezomib with standard chemotherapy in patients with de novo AML. III. To compare the OS and EFS of high-risk patients treated with intensive Induction II with historical controls from AAML03P1 and AAML0531. IV. To determine the feasibility of administering sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) with standard chemotherapy and in a one year maintenance phase in patients with de novo high allelic ratio FLT3/ITD+ AML. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the anti-leukemic activity of sorafenib in patients with de novo high allelic ratio FLT3/ITD+ AML. II. To compare the percentage of patients converting from positive minimal residual disease (MRD) to negative MRD after Intensive Induction II with historical controls from AAML03P1 and AAML0531. III. To compare OS, disease-free survival (DFS), cumulative incidence of relapse, and treatment-related mortality from end of Intensification I between patients allocated to best allogenic donor stem cell transplant (SCT) and comparable patients on AAML0531 who did not receive allogenic donor SCT. IV. To compare OS, DFS, cumulative incidence of relapse, treatment-related mortality, and severe toxicity between patients allocated to matched family donor SCT on AAML1031 and AAML0531. V. To assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients treated with chemotherapy and stem cell transplant (SCT) for AML. VI. To evaluate bortezomib pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients receiving the combination regimen. VII. To obtain sorafenib and metabolite steady state pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data in subjects with FLT3/ITD receiving sorafenib. VIII. To compare the changes in shortening fraction/ejection fraction over time between patients treated with and without dexrazoxane. IX. To refine the use of minimal-residual disease (MRD) detection with 4-color flow cytometry. X. To evaluate the prognostic significance of molecular MRD and its contribution to risk identification with multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF)-based MRD in patients with translocations amenable to quantitative real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (e.g., t[8;21], inv[16], t[9;11], Wilms tumor 1 [WT1] expression). XI. To determine the leukemic involvement of the hematopoietic early progenitor cell and its role in defining response to therapy. XII. To define the leukemic stem cell population in patients with AML. XIII. To determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of molecular abnormalities of WT1, runt-related transcription factor (RUNX)1, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-partial tandem duplication (PTD), tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), Cbl proto-oncogene, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (c-CBL), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT), and other novel AML-associated genes in pediatric AML. XIV. Correlate the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)74 antigen as well as proteasome beta 5-subunit (PSMB5) gene expression and mutation with response to bortezomib. XV. To evaluate the changes in protein expression and unfolded protein response (UPR) in patients with AML. XVI. To determine the expression level of wild-type FLT3, and correlate with outcome and in vitro sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition. XVII. To collect biology specimens at diagnosis, treatment time points, and relapse for future biology studies XVIII. To create a pediatric-specific algorithm to predict the occurrence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prior to its clinical manifestations using a combination of pre-transplant clinical variables and serum GVHD biomarker concentrations in the first weeks after SCT. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms or offered treatment on 1 of 2 arms. (Arms A and B are closed to new patient enrollment as of 02/04/2016) INDUCTION I: ARM A: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1 and ADE chemotherapy comprising cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 1-30 minutes on days 1-10; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5; and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. ARM B: Patients receive cytarabine IT and ADE chemotherapy as in Induction I, Arm A. Patients also receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, and 8. ARM C (high-risk [HR] FLT3/ITD+ disease): Patients receive cytarabine IT and ADE chemotherapy as in Induction I, Arm A and sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) on days 11-28. ARM D (unknown FLT3/ITD status prior to study enrollment): Patients receive cytarabine IT and ADE chemotherapy as in Induction I, Arm A. If patients are determined to be HR FLT3/ITD+ no later than the end of Induction I they will be eligible to participate in Arm C. INDUCTION II: Patients without HR FLT3/ITD+ disease begin Induction II administration on day 29. ARM A (low-risk [LR] patients): Patients receive cytarabine IT and ADE chemotherapy as in Induction I Arm A. ARM A (HR patients): Patients receive cytarabine IT on day 1 and MA chemotherapy comprising high-dose cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-4, and mitoxantrone IV over 15-30 minutes on days 3-6. ARM B (LR patients): Patients receive cytarabine IT, ADE chemotherapy, and bortezomib as in Induction I Arm B. ARM B (HR patients): Patients receive cytarabine IT and MA chemotherapy as in Induction II, Arm A (HR patients) and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, and 8. ARM C (patients with HR FLT3/ITD+ disease, cohort 3): Patients receive cytarabine IT on day 1, cytarabine IV over 1-30 minutes on days 1-8, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, and sorafenib tosylate PO on days 9-36.

GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or PO beginning on day -2 and continuing until day 98 (matched sibling donor) or day 180 (with taper) (other related/unrelated donors or cord blood) and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, and 6 (matched sibling/cord blood donors) or days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (other related/unrelated donors). Patients with unrelated donors also receive antithymocyte globulin IV over 6-8 hours on days -3 to -1. MAINTENANCE: Patients in Arm C receive sorafenib tosylate PO starting on day 40-100 after completion of intensification II or SCT for one year. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter.</detailed_description>
