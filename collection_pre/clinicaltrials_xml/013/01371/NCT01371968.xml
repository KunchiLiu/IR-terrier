	<brief_title>Optimal Dose of Alfentanil for Removal of Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway During Emergence From Desflurane Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The removal of LMA may be associated with coughing, biting, agitation and airway complication such as laryngospasm. Thus it is advisable to remove the LMA when the patient is breathing spontaneously and when the airway reflexes are still depressed. A number of techniques have been used to prevent this adverse emergence phenomenon, such as removing the tube while the patient is in deep plane of anaesthesia or administration of local anaesthetic and intravenous opioids The administration of intravenous opioids before emergence may be useful for preventing cough, agitation and hemodynamic response. Alfentanyl is proven to suppress cough and agitation during the endotracheal tube emergence. However, its use in suppressing cough in LMA patient has not been evaluated.</detailed_description>
