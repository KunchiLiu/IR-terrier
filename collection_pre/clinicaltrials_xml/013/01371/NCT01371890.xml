	<detailed_description>Specific Aim #1 To determine in a crossover study of 15 maintenance hemodialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension whether standard dialysis with ultrafiltration (dialysate Na of 140), dialysis without ultrafiltration (dialysate Na of 140), or ultrafiltration alone (no dialysate) is associated with the an increase in systolic blood pressure during hemodialysis Specific Aim #2 To determine in a crossover study of 15 maintenance hemodialysis with intradialytic hypertension whether standard dialysis with ultrafiltration, dialysis without ultrafiltration, or ultrafiltration alone is associated with change in either endothelin-1 or nitric oxide during hemodialysis SUBSTUDY AIMS Specific Aim #1 To determine in a randomized 3-week, 2 period crossover study of 15 maintenance hemodialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension whether high vs low dialysate-to-serum Na gradients impairs release of NO, increases ET-1 or causes an acute intradialytic increase in systolic BP,. Specific Aim #2 TO determine in a randomized 16-week, 2-period crossover study of 30 hemodialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension the effects of 8 weeks of high dialysate-to-plasma Na gradients to 8-weeks of low Na gradients on EC function (FMD and ADMA) and 44 hour ambulatory BP.</detailed_description>
