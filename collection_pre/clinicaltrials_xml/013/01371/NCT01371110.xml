	<brief_summary>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder and a leading cause of worldwide disability that presents a significant public health problem. Treatment options are limited and many OCD patients fail to respond completely or quickly to standard treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. At this time, patients who fail to respond to treatment with serotonergic drugs, augmenting antipsychotic agents, and behavioral therapy, have few additional treatment options aside from deep brain stimulation. Therefore, despite advances in current pharmacological and behavioral treatments, and the utility of serotonergic drugs, it is likely that other neurotransmitter systems are involved and that targeting these systems may increase treatment efficacy. Despite little evidence for serotonergic dysfunction in OCD, there is significant evidence that glutamatergic dysregulation may contribute to the development and progression of the disorder. Also, preliminary studies suggest that glutamatergic modulators (i.e. riluzole and d-cycloserine), particularly agents acting at the NMDA receptor (i.e. memantine), may be useful in OCD. The NMDA antagonist, ketamine, has demonstrated rapid effects when delivered as a single intravenous (IV) dose in depressed patients. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of IV ketamine in treatment-resistant OCD.</brief_summary>

Prior to study entry, proscribed psychotropics are tapered, and subjects must be on the same SSRI for at least 8 weeks with no change in dose for at least 4 weeks and throughout the study. However, subjects will be allowed to use benzodiazepines as needed throughout the study.) History of a failure to respond to at least two (2) adequate pharmacotherapy trials and CBT for OCD Subjects must have scored â‰¥ 21 on the YBOCS at Screening, and to not be in remission on Treatment Day #1, and Treatment Day #2 Each subject must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and examinations required by the protocol and must sign an informed consent document Subjects must be able to identify a family member, physician, or friend who will participate in the Treatment Contract and serve as an emergency contact.
