	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation of a New Daily Disposable Silicone Hydrogel Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 of the study involved bilateral wear of three different types of marketed contact lenses. Each type of lens was worn for three consecutive days of daily disposable wear. Participants had been previously identified as symptomatic lens wearers or asymptomatic lens wearers, based upon their responses to a screening questionnaire. Participants wore each lens type for as long as they were comfortable during the day, but lenses were removed before sleep. After completion of Part 1, participants began Part 2, which included dispensing of the investigational study lens for up to one week of bilateral wear, with a single follow-up visit at the end of that period.</detailed_description>
