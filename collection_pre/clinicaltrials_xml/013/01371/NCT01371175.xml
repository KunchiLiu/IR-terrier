	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of plasmid DNA and recombinant MVA (Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara) in a prime-boost regimen. Approximately 111 volunteers (90 vaccine recipients/21 placebo recipients) will be enrolled at two sites. Approximately 56 volunteers will be enrolled at each site. An over-enrolment of up to 10% (approximately 10 additional volunteers) will be permitted in the study.</brief_summary>

Any of the following abnormal laboratory parameters that are moderate, severe, or very severe: haematology (haemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count absolute lymphocyte count , absolute CD4 count, platelets); urinalysis, biochemistries (total bilirubin, creatinine, AST, ALT). Volunteers with mild laboratory abnormalities which are judged by the principal investigator or designee to be not clinically significant may be enrolled. 4. If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy within 4 months after last vaccination or lactating; 5. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 60 days or other vaccine within 14 days of enrolment; 6.
