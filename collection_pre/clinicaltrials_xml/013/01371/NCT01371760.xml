	<brief_summary>To assess in a double blinded randomized control trial (RCT) study design safety and effectiveness of balloon angioplasty of the main extracranial and extravertebral veins in multiple sclerosis (MS) associated to chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). Mean follow-up 1 year. 5-8 Italian centres 360 relapsing remitting (RR) MS patients will be randomized, with expanded disability disease scale (EDSS) ranging 2-5.5, age 18-65.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Safety will be assessed by measuring serious and minor adverse effects related to treatment. Effectiveness will be assessed by measuring 2 primary endpoints: 1. Clinical parameters will be expressed in an integrated functional measure leading to the score, respectively, of improved, stable, worsened. Functional assessment is performed by tools permitting a quantification and will be made by a team of independent assessors. Clinical instrumental evaluation will be performed at baseline, and subsequently on 3 months basis. The outcome parameters leading to the composite functional measure are instrumental parameters, less assessor dependent, singularly validated for measuring the disability in MS. They are the followings: A) Dynamic Balance Assessment: Balance Master Limits of Stability (LOS). In static platform, swinging to reach the set position of center of pressure. B) Walking Function: The subject walks spontaneously for 10 meters with chronometric measure of time counting the number of steps. The test calculates the walk ratio i.e. ratio between length and step frequency. C) Manual dexterity. Box &amp; Block test, moving wooden cubes. D) Sphincter control: Post-voiding residual by ultrasounds. F) Visual acuity: Low-contrast visual acuity Sloan Letter Chart. 2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) outcome measures: T1Gad active lesion.T2 lesion volume MRI evaluation at baseline, 6, 12 months. Secondary endpoints are: EDSS, chronic fatigue, cognitive function, rate of restenosis, annualized relapse rate.</detailed_description>
