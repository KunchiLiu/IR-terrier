	<brief_summary>A majority of patients with multiple sclerosis initially presents with a single demyelinating event, e.g. in the optic nerves, brain, brainstem or spinal cord, referred to as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Not all patients with CIS get a relapse and develop multiple sclerosis but in those patients who do, irreversible damage of the central nervous system, e.g. axonal damage, is already detectable in that early stage of disease. Early initiation of immunomodulatory therapy is crucial for patients with clinically isolated syndrome who are at high risk for the development of multiple sclerosis. Vice versa identification of low risk patients could help to avoid an unnecessary therapy. In this prospective observational study we want to follow up patients with CIS and early multiple sclerosis over a period of four years and obtain clinical, laboratory and MRI - data in order to identify risk factors for relapses, prognostic factors and therapy response markers.</brief_summary>
