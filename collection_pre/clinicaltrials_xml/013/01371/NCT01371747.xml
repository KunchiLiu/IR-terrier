	<brief_summary>This study determined the optimal starting dose of patiromer in treating hyperkalemia in participants with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy who were already receiving ACEI and/or ARB drugs, with or without spironolactone. This study also evaluated the efficacy and safety of patiromer and the long term use of patiromer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patiromer in the Treatment of Hyperkalemia in Patients With Hypertension and Diabetic Nephropathy (AMETHYST-DN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RLY5016-205 was an open-label, randomized, dose ranging study to determine the optimal starting dose, efficacy and safety of patiromer in treating hyperkalemia in hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were already receiving Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) and/or Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) drugs, with or without spironolactone. The study consisted of the following periods: - Screening: Up to 10 days (1 visit) - Run-in for those who were not hyperkalemic at screening (Cohorts 1 and 2): up to 4 weeks (1 to 4 visits) - Patiromer Treatment Initiation: first 8 weeks of patiromer treatment (a minimum of 10 visits) - Patiromer Long-Term Maintenance: additional 44 weeks of patiromer treatment up to a total of one year (minimum of 11 additional visits) - Follow-up (after patiromer discontinuation): 1 week (2 visits) OR 4 weeks (5 visits) depending on the final serum potassium level</detailed_description>

Central lab serum magnesium &lt; 1.4 mg/dL (&lt; 0.58 mmol/L) at screening (Cohort 3 participants will be evaluated based on local lab serum magnesium measurement) 6. Central lab urine ACR ≥ 10000 mg/g at screening (except for Cohort 3 participants who are hyperkalemic at S1) 7. Confirmed diagnosis or history of renal artery stenosis (unilateral or bilateral) 8.
