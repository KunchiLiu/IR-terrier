	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare: the standard pediatric intubation instrument (Miller blade) used as direct laryngoscopy during tracheal intubation to the VideoMiller device (the standard pediatric blade with a camera attached, giving indirect view of the vocal cords in the screen). This intubation device is used to place the tube in the trachea to keep the patient breathing during the surgery procedure. The anesthesiologist obtains a better view of the vocal cords looking at the screen provided by the VideoMiller.</brief_summary>
