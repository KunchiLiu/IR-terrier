	<brief_title>Online Wound Electronic Medical Record (OWEMR) to Decrease Amputations in Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Online Wound Electronic Medical Record (OWEMR) is a medical informatics tool that synthesizes data about complex wound problems from multiple sources and is innovative in its capability to performing these critical tasks: i) identification of the information needed to make treatment decisions at the point of care in real time ii) use intelligent search and report features to identify patients who require emergency interventions, and iii) provide evidence-based clinical decision support to clinicians. Use of the OWEMR includes digital photography as an objective measurement of wound healing rates.</detailed_description>
