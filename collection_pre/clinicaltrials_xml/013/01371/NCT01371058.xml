	<brief_summary>Thrombotic event is one of the most serious complications of coronary artery disease, which often result in myocardial infarction and even death. Even according to the standard guidelines for antiplatelet therapy, there are still 6% to 15% of patients occur thrombotic events, in high-risk patients, the proportion is higher, this phenomenon is called anti-platelet drug resistance in clinical practice The aim of this multicenter prospective, randomized, controlled study is to observed policosanol on aspirin or clopidogrel resistance in patients with platelet aggregation after Percutaneous Coronary Stent Implantation (PCI) and occurrence of platelet aggregation and short-term prognosis to find new ways to the prevention of platelet aggregation .</brief_summary>
