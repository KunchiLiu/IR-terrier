	<detailed_description>Emergency department patients receiving opioid pain medicine such as morphine, fentanyl, or Dilaudid are eligible. After receiving the pain medication, a small soft plastic tube will be placed between the upper lip and nose. This tube is used to measure the amount of carbon dioxide the patient is breathing out. It can also be used to deliver oxygen if the provider feels the patient needs it. The carbon dioxide breathed out is measured and collected. Other information collected are height, weight, and vital signs. Patient participation time is approximately 2 hours during the emergency department visit.</detailed_description>
