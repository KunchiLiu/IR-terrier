	<brief_summary>Psychostimulant dependence is a major public health problem and no medications have been shown to be very effective in treating this disorder. Thus, the investigators wish to study whether a blood pressure drug thought to reduce drug craving through its interaction at particular adrenergic receptors - doxazosin - can dredge cocaine use relative to placebo in psychostimulant dependent participants enrolled in an 8-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled outpatient clinical trial. Our hypothesis is that doxazosin will reduce cocaine use relative to placebo in psychostimulant dependent participants.</brief_summary>
