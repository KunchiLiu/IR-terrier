	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a worksite intervention for reducing daily sedentary time and improving risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (e.g., measures of adiposity, anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory fitness) among sedentary, overweight, full-time working adults as compared to a waitlist control. A secondary aim will be to test pedal time at work as a measure of compliance with the intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent research indicates prolonged sedentary behaviors such as computer use and workplace sitting are particularly damaging resulting in increased risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Few interventions have been tested with the specific purpose of reducing sedentary time to improve risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a worksite intervention for reducing daily sedentary time and improving risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (e.g., measures of adiposity, anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory fitness) among sedentary, overweight, full-time working adults as compared to a waitlist control. A secondary aim will be to test pedal time at work as a measure of compliance with the intervention. Participants will be followed for 12 weeks and randomized to either a treatment or wait list control group which will have the option to crossover into the intervention after 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
