	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, repeat-dose, intra-subject dose escalation study of SBC-102 (USAN: sebelipase alfa) in children with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency. Eligible subjects will receive once-weekly (qw) infusions of sebelipase alfa for up to 5 years</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SurVival of Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL-D) Infants Treated With SebelipAse aLfa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder that is caused by a marked decrease or almost complete absence of LAL, leading to the accumulation of lipids, predominately cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in various tissues and cell types. In the liver, accumulation of lipids leads to hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and hepatic failure. Although a single disease, LAL Deficiency presents as a clinical continuum with two major phenotypes, Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD) and Wolman Disease. Early Onset LAL Deficiency (Wolman Disease) is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of less than 2 lives per million. It is characterized by profound malabsorption, growth failure, and hepatic failure, and is usually fatal in the first year of life. There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of LAL Deficiency.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject's parent or legal guardian provides written informed consent/permission prior to any study procedures. Male or female child with documented decreased LAL activity relative to the normal range of the lab performing the assay or documented result of molecular genetic testing (2 mutations) confirming a diagnosis. Growth failure with onset before 6 months of age. Clinically important concurrent disease. Has received an investigational product other than sebelipase alfa within 14 days prior to the first dose. Subject is older than 24 months of age. Myeloablative preparation, or other systemic pretransplant conditioning, for hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplant. Previous hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplant. Known hypersensitivity to eggs.</criteria>
