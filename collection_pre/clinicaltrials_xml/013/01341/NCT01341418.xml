	<brief_summary>This study compares two techniques for the fixation of tibial fractures. The techniques are the suprapatellar (above knee)or infrapatellar (below knee) approach to tibial intramedullary nailing. Null hypothesis: There is no difference in 1) residual post-operative pain levels, 2)knee function, 3) healing and alignment of the tibia, or 4) trochlear changes in the patello-femoral cartilage between patients who are randomized to receive tibial nail insertion through either a suprapatellar nail entry portal or a standard patellar tendon approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suprapatellar Versus Infrapatellar Nailing in Tibial Fractures: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing tibial fracture repair will be consented and randomized into one of the two techniques, with arthroscopic photos taken before and after nail insertion to study the condition of the patello-femoral cartilage. Enrolled patients will be followed for one year in clinic.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Tibial shaft fractures amenable and indicated for repair with intramedullary nails, with or without the use of reaming Acute tibial fractures within 4 weeks of injury Closed or open tibial fractures after appropriate irrigation and debridement Fractures must be within metaphyseal/diaphyseal junctures defined as middle 3/5 of tibia Skeletally mature patient Age 18 and above.
