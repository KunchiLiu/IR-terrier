	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes have become a major global health problem. Currently, metformin is used as first-line therapy in combination with lifestyle changes, and sitagliptin can be added to metformin in case of insufficient glycemic control by metformin alone, and fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin and metformin is available. In clinical practice, inter-individual variations in response to sitagliptin and metformin treatment are commonly found, which may reflect inter-patient differences in disposition of these medications. Sitagliptin and metformin are known as substrates of some transporters (P-gp, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2) and some functional variations of these transporters were reported. This study is designed to clarify the effect of these transporter variants on response to sitagliptin and metformin in type 2 DM patients.</brief_summary>
