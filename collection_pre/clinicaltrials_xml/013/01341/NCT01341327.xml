	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to observe clinical courses for long-term in patients with unprotected LMCA disease and to evaluate comparative results of medical treatment, coronary stenting with drug-eluting stents, and CABG for the treatment of an unprotected LMCA stenosis in the "real world" daily practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter, large clinical registry to evaluate comparative outcomes of medical therapy, PCI with DES, or CABG for patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis in the Asia-Pacific, as recorded in the MAIN-IRIS Registry. Data will be prospectively collected on approximately 5000 subjects who diagnosed LM disease (&gt;50% by visual estimation) at approximately 65 centers in Korea and Asia-Pacific region. Brief study design is as depicted in the following figure</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Significant unprotected left main stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimation) The LMCA is considered unprotected if there are no patent coronary artery bypass grafts to the left anterior descending artery or the left circumflex artery. No limitation of clinical or lesion characteristics Age &gt;18 years The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site.
