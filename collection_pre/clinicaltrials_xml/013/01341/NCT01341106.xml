	<brief_title>Induction of Fibrosis Regression on Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection and relevant liver fibrosis will be treated with entecavir during 5 years or until anti-HBs seroconversion or 6-12 months after anti-HBe seroconversion and HBeAg loss. There are 9 visits during treatment for each patient. At all visits, each patient will consent to give 20 ml blood sample for study examination and 40 ml blood sample for research purposes.</detailed_description>
