	<brief_summary>Background: It is becoming increasingly clear that individuals from all corners of the globe use probiotic dietary approaches to enhance health. More recently, probiotics have shown promise in treating a variety of disease states, due to improved strain selection, stability and delivery technologies. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the lipid lowering efficacy of a probiotic supplement capsule containing Lactobacillus reuteri Cardioviva™, taken twice per day over 9 weeks, in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Design: The study design is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm, multi-centre study. The study will last a total of 13 weeks, including a 2-week wash-out period, a 2-week run-in period and a 9 week treatment period.</brief_summary>
