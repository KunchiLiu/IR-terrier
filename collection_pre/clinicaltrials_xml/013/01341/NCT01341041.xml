	<brief_summary>This research is being done because the investigators are trying to examine the safety and effectiveness of this wound cleaning liquid, CACD (chlorine dioxide). The investigators are trying to see if this liquid has the ability to decrease infection rates and decrease the scarring effects from the healing process. In animal studies, CACD has been shown to decrease scar formation and decrease the risk of wound infections. CACD is also used for the treatment of burns to decrease infection rates and improve wound healing. CACD is not FDA approved for this specific use, but it is FDA and USDA approved for reducing bacterial contamination on meat and food products for human consumption. In addition, an investigational drug (IND) application has been submitted to the FDA for this study. The FDA has approved the use of this solution for this study.</brief_summary>
