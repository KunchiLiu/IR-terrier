	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this study is that a radiotherapy dose of 36Gy in 12 fractions, which equates to a BED of 48.6Gy, increases the response rates of symptom relief compared to historical controls. (Tey et al.) With this dose fractionation is used for bleeding, there is an increase in response rates from 55%(historical) to 75%for pain, there is an increase in response rates from 25% (historical) to 45% for obstruction, there is an increase in response rates from 25% (historical) to 45%</detailed_description>
