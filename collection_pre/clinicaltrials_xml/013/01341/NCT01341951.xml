	<brief_title>Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) in Acute Liver Failure and Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study 4 groups have been taken. Two groups of cases including Alcoholic patients and acute liver failure which are given G-CSF therapy and two groups of controls given standard therapy. Primary end point is to see the mobilization of CD-34 hematopoietic cells and survival. Secondary end point is to see the clinical and biochemical improvement in liver functions.</detailed_description>
