	<brief_title>Immunogenicity of Hepatitis A Vaccine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spread of hepatitis A has prompted the need for vaccination against this virus. It is uncertain that IBD patients can achieve a truly protective response after vaccination. The efficacy and safety of hepatitis A vaccination have not been evaluated in this population of patients. We would like to estimate the efficacy and safety of vaccination against hepatitis A in patients with IBD.</detailed_description>
