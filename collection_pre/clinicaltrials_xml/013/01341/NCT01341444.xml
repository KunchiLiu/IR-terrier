	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to see how safe and effective the Prevena Incision Management System "Prevena" is when placed over a renal transplantation incision. Prevena provides negative pressure (suction) wound therapy. Prevena will be tested while applied during the time each subject is hospitalized and up to 5 days after the surgery. Prevena is a small portable negative pressure device which consists of a therapy unit that delivers negative pressure. It also includes a dressing system that is intended for use over closed incisions after surgery. The intent of this study is to evaluate Prevena versus the standard care that a doctor would use normally after a kidney transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of the Prevena Incision Management System (PIMS) on Closed Incisions in Renal Transplant Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, single-center, comparative interventional study looking at the effect of Prevena™ on renal transplant surgical Subjects compared to a control arm treated with the standard-of-care wound dressing. The prospective, post-marketing clinical study described in this protocol will assess the effectiveness and functional performance of PrevenaTM in this clinical indication.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Preoperative Inclusion Criteria The Subject: 1. is an adult ≥ 18 years old of either gender 2. is able to provide their own informed consent Protocol: AHS.2012.Prevena.Cooper.01 v 4.0 Confidential/Property of KCI USA, Inc. Page 6 of 71 3. will undergo open renal transplant surgery within the next 30 days 4. will require a surgical incision able to be covered completely by the PIMS dressing 5. is preoperatively assessed to undergo a procedure with a CDC Wound Classification of: 1. Class I (Clean): An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tract is not entered OR 2. Class II (Clean Contaminated): An operative wound in which the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tract are entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination 6. is willing and able to return for all scheduled and required study visits 7. if female, must test negative on serum pregnancy test 8. if a female of childbearing potential, must be willing to utilize an acceptable method of birth control (e.g., birth control pills, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, implants, IUD, injections, vaginal rings, hormonal skin patch, etc.) for the duration of study participation 9. is not concurrently enrolled in a clinical trial which may impact subject health or the surgical incision site Intraoperative Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet the following intraoperative inclusion criteria to be eligible for randomization. The Subject: 1. continues to meet all preoperative inclusion criteria 2. has undergone a Class I or II CDC Wound Classification procedure resulting in a closed surgical incision able to be covered completely by the PIMS dressing Preoperative Exclusion Criteria The Subject: 1. has a BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2 and &gt; 40 kg/m2 2. has a systemic infection at the time of open renal transplant surgery 3. has a remotesite skin infection at the time of open renal transplant surgery 4. is preoperatively assessed to undergo a procedure with a CDC Wound Classification of: 1. Class III (Contaminated): Open, fresh, accidental wounds, and/or major breaks in sterile technique or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract OR 2. Class IV (DirtyInfected): Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera 5. has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to silver, or drape materials that contain acrylic adhesives IntraOperative Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following intraoperative exclusion criteria are considered screen failures and are not eligible for randomization. The Subject: 1. is found to meet any of the preoperative exclusion criteria 2. has obvious contamination of the surgical incision 3. requires external surgical drains that will be covered by the PIMS dressing 4. is determined to have a CDC Wound Classification of: 1. Class III (Contaminated): Open, fresh, accidental wounds, and/or major breaks in sterile technique or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract OR 2. Class IV (DirtyInfected): Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera Protocol: AHS.2012.Prevena.Cooper.01 v 4.0 Confidential/Property of KCI USA, Inc. Page 8 of 71 5. requires a transfusion, has disseminatedintravascular coagulopathy (DIC) or other medical or surgical conditions during open renal transplant surgery deemed by the Investigator to pose a prohibitively high risk for surgical reexploration 6. is deemed unable to continue in the study by the Investigator as the Subject's safety or wellbeing may be jeopardized.</criteria>
