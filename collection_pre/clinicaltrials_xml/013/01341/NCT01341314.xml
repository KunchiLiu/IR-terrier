	<brief_summary>Research has shown that early aggressive use of medicines may stop rheumatoid arthritis (RA)or slow its damage. The key to this is to find people with early symptoms which could be RA and have them get a diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. This study will recruit persons who've gone to the internet looking for information about their symptoms. After answering a screening survey, the person with possible symptoms will be linked to the study website for a more detailed symptom questionnaire. After completing that questionnaire the person will receive information about the second part of the study which includes an examination with a rheumatologist (arthritis doctor)and laboratory tests. Based on the joint examination and laboratory tests, the rheumatologist will tell the person the likelihood of having RA, and make recommendations and if needed a referral for care and treatment. Treatment is not a part of this study. This study will also compare the information on the subject's questionnaires to the doctor's joint examination and the laboratory tests with the hope of developing a simple inexpensive case finding questionnaire.</brief_summary>
