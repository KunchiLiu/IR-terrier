	<brief_summary>Background: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been shown by randomized trials to be associated with better short-term clinical outcomes when compared with open surgery. However, in a traditional perioperative care setting, the reduction in hospital stay following laparoscopic surgery in these trials was modest. Fast-track perioperative programs have been introduced in the West to optimize perioperative factors to reduce the physiological/psychological stress of open colorectal surgery. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of fast-track programs on the outcomes after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Objective: To compare the clinical and immunological outcomes of Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with a "traditional" vs. a "fast-track" perioperative program. Design: Prospective randomized trial. Subjects: One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection of non-metastatic colonic and upper rectal cancer will be recruited. Interventions: Patients will be randomized to a "traditional" or a "fast-track" perioperative program. Outcome measures: Primary outcome: total postoperative hospital stay, including hospital stay of patients who are readmitted within 30 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes: immunological parameters (including systemic cytokine response and cell-mediated immune function), morbidity and mortality, quality of life, and medical costs.</brief_summary>
