	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate Completion of local therapy by surgery and/or ablative radiation therapy at least 3 months prior to entry, with removal or ablation of all visible disease, including seminal vesical and/or local lymph node involvement Rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels without scan evidence of metastatic disease Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and life expectancy of at least 4 months Small cell or other variant prostate cancer histology Evidence of immunosuppression Prior treatment with androgen deprivation except if given neoadjuvantly or adjuvantly with radiation therapy or at time of prostatectomy. In this situation, no more than 24 months of androgen deprivation must have been given and treatment must not have been within 12 months prior to screening for this study. Serum testosterone at screening &lt; 50 ng/dL Known bone metastases or lymph node involvement as determined by bone scan or computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis within 4 weeks of study entry Prior vaccine therapy for prostate cancer Known allergic reactions to granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF) Severe intercurrent medical conditions or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the Medical Monitor, excess risk associated with study participation or study agent administration</criteria>
