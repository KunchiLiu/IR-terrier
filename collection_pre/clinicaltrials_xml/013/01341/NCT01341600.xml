	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) is used commonly in patients to prevent heart attacks and conditions caused by blood clots. Although clopidogrel works in many individuals, some people do not respond as well to this drug. The variation in treatment response may be linked to genetics. This study will examine the effects of clopidogrel in a population whose genes are well known in order to determine the role that genes play in the response to various clopidogrel maintenance doses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel is a prodrug with high inter-individual response variability. Clopidogrel is converted to an active drug through an enzyme encoded by the gene named CYP2C19. Individuals with genetically-impaired CYP2C19 metabolism have lower capacity to convert the prodrug to its active form. Consequently, these individuals have lower blood levels of the activated form of clopidogrel, diminished antiplatelet responses, and higher rates of cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis. Increasing doses of clopidogrel in such patients represents a possible approach to managing the gene-drug interaction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increasing the dose of clopidogrel increases antiplatelet responses and active metabolite exposure in individuals with genetically reduced CYP2C19 metabolism relative to those with normal CYP2C19 metabolism. The primary objective is to assess changes in clopidogrel response and exposure at three clopidogrel dose levels and with coadministration of omeprazole.</detailed_description>
