	<brief_summary>This study is a comparison of the efficacy and safety of paricalcitol injection with maxacalcitol injection in adult Japanese chronic kidney disease patients receiving hemodialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of paricalcitol injection in reducing levels of parathyroid hormone without clinically significant hypercalcemia, compared to maxacalcitol injection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 patients undergoing dialysis with stable dialysate calcium and phosphate binders On three times weekly hemodialysis for at least 3 months prior with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) greater than or equal to 300 pg/mL, adjusted normalized serum total calcium (Ca) greater than or equal to 8.4 to less than 10.2 mg/dL, serum phosphorus (P) less than or equal to 6.5 mg/dL. Patients with a recent history of severe cardiovascular or hepatic disease, uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes Patients who have received a parathyroidectomy or ethanol infusion within the prior year Patients taking drugs that affect iPTH, calcium or bone metabolism Patients who will need to take chronic doses (greater than or equal to 2 consecutive weeks) of cytochrome P450 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, grapefruit products) or inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin) Female patients who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, wish to become pregnant, or participate in breastfeeding during the study period.</criteria>
