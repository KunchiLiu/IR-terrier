	<brief_title>Prognostic Influence of Light Rheography Measurement of Patients With Secondary Raynaud Syndrome With Ulcers on Hands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Digital Ulcers (DU) belong to one of the most prevalent complications of systemic scleroses, leading in course to considerable impairment in everyday and professional life. The aetiology of the emergence of DU in patients with systemic scleroses (SSc) is complex, whereas the disease itself is primarily characterized by a vasculopathy of the small arterial vessels. In the course of the disease this chronic infection leads to fibrotic intimal hyperplasia, adventitial fibrosis, and thus to a significant lumen narrowing. So far, a number of independent risk factors have been identified, such as male gender, chronic infections of the esophagus, pulmonary-arterial hypertension, evidence of specific antibodies (e.g. anti-Scl70) in the blood, or the a previous manifestation of a Raynoud Syndrom.</detailed_description>
