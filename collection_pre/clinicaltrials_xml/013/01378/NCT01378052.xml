	<brief_summary>Many studies previously showed the significant association between urinary arsenic profiles and urothelial carcinoma (UC) risk and observed the increased UC risk in people with lower plasma folate and higher homocysteine than those with higher plasma folate and lower homocysteine. The investigators would expect to explore the interactions among global DNA methylation, one-carbon metabolic pathway factors, urinary arsenic profiles and UC.</brief_summary>
