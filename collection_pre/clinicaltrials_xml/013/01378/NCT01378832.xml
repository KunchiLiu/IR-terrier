	<brief_title>Effect of Peritoneal Lavage With Clindamycin-gentamicin Solution on Postoperative Colorectal Cancer Infection in Elective Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, randomized study was performed between January and December 2010. Patient inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms and plans to undergo an elective curative surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (intra-abdominal irrigation with normal saline) and Group 2 (intraperitoneal irrigation with a solution of 240 mg gentamicin and 600 mg clindamycin). The occurrence of wound infections and intra-abdominal abscesses were investigated. Following the anastomosis, a microbiological sample of the peritoneal surface was obtained (sample 1). A second sample was collected following an irrigation with normal saline (sample 2). Finally, the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with a gentamicin-clindamycin solution and a third sample was obtained (sample 3).</detailed_description>
