	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will be a multicenter phase II fixed-dose trial in which a minimum of 10 patients with immunophenotypically confirmed ATL with at least 50% of the blasts expressing CD25 as measured by flow cytometry at relapse, will receive Imtox-25. Patients are eligible for repeat courses of treatment every two weeks if they do not experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) as defined in Section 5.2 and do not have a HAMA/HARA level &gt; 1 μg/ml. The treatment will be administered in the in-patient setting. If no response is observed among the initial 9 patients, the study would be terminated early and declared negative; if at least one response is observed, accrual would continue to a total of 17 evaluable patients (total study size=19 to account for 10% of the patients being unevaluable for any reason).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Of Imtox-25 In Adults With Refractory/Relapsed Cd25 Positive Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL) is a lymphoproliferative disease associated with HTLV-1 infection, characterized by circulating malignant cells expressing the IL-2 receptor (CD25). Prognosis for patients with ATL remains poor despite advances in chemotherapy, with survival in leukemic patients ranging from six months to less than one year. Novel agents that are potent and specific for the tumor cells are urgently needed to improve overall survival and decrease toxicity in this dismal disease. One therapeutic approach would be to use immunotoxins (ITs). ITs utilize a potent toxin linked to a targeting moiety designed to maximize drug delivery to the tumor cells, thus avoiding the nonspecific toxicity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Imtox-25 is constructed using the RFT5 murine monoclonal antibody (Mab) coupled to deglycosylated ricin-A chain (dgA) via the heterobifunctional, thiol-containing crosslinker, 4[(succinimidyloxy) carbonyl]-ƒÑ-methyl-ƒÑ-(2 pyridyldithio) toluene (SMPT). Phase I and II clinical studies with Imtox-25 (RFT5.dGA) have been shown safety and efficacy in adult patients with Hodgkin¡¦s disease and a recommended Phase II dose has been established.. In vitro experiments using ATL cell lines and in vivo studies in a murine xenograft model have demonstrated significant activity of Imtox-25 in this disease. Based on these results, the investigators propose to conduct a phase II trial utilizing Imtox-25 in adults with relapsed or refractory ATL.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 17 years inclusive at the time of original diagnosis of HTLV1 associated ATL. Histologic verification of ATL and HTLV1 seropositivity at diagnosis and either evidence of relapse/refractory disease based on a Bone Marrow/Peripheral Blood examination or evidence by flow cytometry. Disease refractory to conventional CHOP based therapy or transplantation or deemed ineligible for salvage by transplantation. Presence of CD25 on at least 50% of the lymphoblasts obtained via BMA or peripheral blood as determined by flow cytometry. ECOG performance status 2. Life expectancy of &gt; 2 months. Patients must have recovered from effects of prior therapy. At least 2 weeks should have elapsed since the last dose of chemotherapy (4 weeks in the case of nitrosoureacontaining therapy). Steroids are considered as chemotherapy. However, if the patient has recovered from the side effects of prior therapy and has had a &gt; 50% rise in peripheral blast count, they are immediately eligible. The 50% rise in peripheral blast count must be calculated as follows. The sample for the baseline peripheral blast count must have been taken at least 24 hours after the end of chemotherapy. The sample for the peripheral blast count that is increased by 50% of the baseline peripheral blast count may be taken at any subsequent time. A second peripheral blast count confirming the 50% rise is recommended. No hematopoietic limitations as patients with relapsed leukemia routinely have pancytopenia and ITs have not demonstrated hematopoietic toxicity. Adequate renal function defined as a serum creatinine 1.5 x normal range. Adequate liver function defined as a total bilirubin 1.5 x normal range and SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) 1.5 x normal range. Adequate cardiac function defined as a shortening fraction of 27% by echocardiogram, or ejection fraction of 3540% by MUGA scan. Adequate pulmonary function defined as no evidence of dyspnea at rest. Normal neurological exam. Patient and/or legal guardian must sign a written informed consent. All institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human studies must be met. Presence of leukemic or infectious pulmonary parenchymal disease or presence of a pulmonary effusion by chest xray. Presence of CNS involvement with leukemia. History of documented seizure disorder or abnormal neurological examination. Human antimouse (HAMA) levels of &lt; 1 μg/ml.</criteria>
