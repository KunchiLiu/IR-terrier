	<brief_summary>Interstitial cystitis is a condition where a defect in the protective lining of the bladder causes the urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency and pain/burning on urination. One way to help ease the symptoms of this disease is to fill the bladder full of water every 4 to 6 months. Since this is a painful procedure an anesthesiologist will give you a drug that will make you unconscious for the procedure. General anesthesia can be given to you through an IV tube that is placed in a vein in your arm. There are only a few agents that induce sedation and these agents have certain disadvantages such as waking up slowly, low blood pressure, and pain at the injection site and a prolonged time to consciousness. This study will be comparing doses of a new IV sedation induction agent drug to put you to sleep called fospropofol (Lusedra®).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female outpatients &gt; 1865 years of age, weight 6090 kg, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of P1 to P3 are eligible for enrollment. Female patients of child bearing age will have a negative urine pregnancy test result and have used an acceptable method of birth control for &gt;1 month prior to study enrollment. Patients will be NPO &gt;6 hours and scheduled for outpatient urological hydrodilation under general anesthesia. Patients also will not be enrolled in another study or have received an experimental drug in the prior 30 days. Exclusion criteria are: hypersensitivity or allergy to any anesthesia, opioids, benzodiazepines or any drugs used in the study, failure to meet NPO status or an abnormal, clinically significant ECG finding. Another exclusion is the presence of a difficult airway that would prevent use of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or successful LMA insertion. Women who are breast feeding would also be excluded from participation.</criteria>
