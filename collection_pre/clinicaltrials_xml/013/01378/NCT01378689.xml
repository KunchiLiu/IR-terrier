	<brief_summary>This quality improvement project is aimed at improving health care by identifying low cost strategies to get Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients to more effectively communicate with their physicians about osteoporosis prevention and treatment (improving doctor-patient communication). The investigators will implement a direct to patient intervention to the population of interest (patients on chronic glucocorticoids) via story-telling, using an Internet based video. The target audience is people on chronic glucocorticoids not already receiving bones-specific osteoporosis medications to determine differences in post-intervention rates of osteoporosis care, and the rates of prescription anti-osteoporosis therapies.</brief_summary>
