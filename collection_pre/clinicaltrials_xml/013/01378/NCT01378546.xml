	<brief_summary>Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is rare neurological disorder that results in muscle weakness and limited reflex activity. More than half of LEMS cases are associated with a malignancy, usually small cell lung cancer, and tend to progress more quickly than cases not coupled with malignant cells. 3,4diaminopyridine (3,4DAP)is a drug that has been demonstrated to be effective in treating the weakness associated with LEMS as it increases strength and improves autonomic symptoms in LEMS patients. It is not currently approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The investigators plan to use 3,4DAP to treat patients with LEMS here at the Columbia University MDA/ALS Research Center.</brief_summary>
