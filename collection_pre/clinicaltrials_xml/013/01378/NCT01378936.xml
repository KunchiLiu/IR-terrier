	<detailed_description>This project imports social-personality theory and research on moral emotions and cognitions to the applied problems of crime, substance abuse, and HIV risk behavior. The primary aim of this study, a Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) of the restorative justice-inspired Impact of Crime (IOC) group intervention, is to examine the efficacy of treatment and to determine if changes in moral emotions and cognitions serve as mechanisms of action, explaining the impact of treatment involvement on reductions in post-release recidivism, substance abuse, and HIV risk behavior.</detailed_description>
