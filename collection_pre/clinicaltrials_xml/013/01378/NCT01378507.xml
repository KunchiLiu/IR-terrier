	<brief_summary>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a newly developed technique in the field of endoscopic treatment for GI neoplasms, because of its high rate of en bloc resection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for GI neoplasms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is widely accepted as a minimally invasive treatment for GI neoplasms.However, one disadvantage of EMR is that lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter must be removed in pieces, which may result in a high recurrence rate of residual tumor tissue. In addition, in most patients, pathological assessment cannot be conducted after the procedure. ESD can overcome the disadvantages of EMR. However, it is difficult to perform ESD for GI neoplasms because of the high rate of complications.</detailed_description>
