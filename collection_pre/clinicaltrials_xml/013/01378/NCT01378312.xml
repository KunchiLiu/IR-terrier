	<brief_summary>This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult subjects who are HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. The study will be conducted at one clinical research site in India. The available live tuberculosis vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), provides incomplete protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. For unknown reasons, a BCG revaccination or "booster", while not toxic, does not provide much additional protection. AERAS-402 presents tuberculosis antigens in the setting of a new, live, replication-deficient adenovirus vaccine that may increase T cell-mediated immunity and thus protection from tuberculosis. Since BCG-vaccinated individuals are the population for which AERAS-402 might be indicated, AERAS-402 will be administered to individuals already vaccinated with BCG.</brief_summary>
