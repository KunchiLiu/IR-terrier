	<brief_summary>A clinical trial to study the effects of dosage, infusion methods and complications of unfractionated heparin (UFH) treating acute progressive cerebral infraction was conducted. In this study, we observed the effects of four UFH treatments on 480 acute progressive cerebral infraction patients during from the 6th and the 72nd hour after the attack. It was concluded that the ultra-slow continuous intravenous infusion of UFH can significantly reduce the neurological deficit score of patients with progressive cerebral infarction, increase the cure rate, decrease the recurrence rate, and improve long-term quality of daily life. It is more effective than the treatment of intravenous infusion of low- molecular- weight UFH at once a day, and the risk of bleeding may not necessarily be increased.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment' effectiveness rates of the four groups were 95.80%, 85.22%, 85.47%, and 87.72% respectively. The result of Group A was significantly different from those of Group B, C, and D (p &lt;0.05). The adverse complication occurrence rates of the four groups were 5.88%, 3.48%, 4.27% and 3.51%.</detailed_description>
