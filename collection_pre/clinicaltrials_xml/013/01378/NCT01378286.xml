	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response at Day 28 of Artesunate Amodiaquine (ASAQ) versus chloroquine Secondary Objectives: - To assess the non inferiority on the same way as the main criteria: - at Day 28 before corrected cure rate - at Day 14 and Day 42 before and after corrected cure rate - To compare the two groups of treatment in terms of: - Efficacy: - Proportion of aparasitaemic patients at 24, 48 an 72 hours - Proportion of afebrile patients at 24, 48 and 72 hours - Percentage of gametocyte carriers during follow-up - Evolution of the mean of gametocytes during the 42 days of follow-up - Evolution of haemoglobin value between Day 0 and Day 7, Day 0 and Day 28 - Clinical and biological tolerability: - Proportion of any adverse event - Biological safety: haematology (Red blood cells, Haemoglobin, White Blood Cells, neutrophils, platelets), biochemistry (creatinine, transaminases (alanine amino transferase/ALT), bilirubins) - ECG (electro encephalogram) (Day 0, Day 3,Day 28) only for patients 10 years old and above</brief_summary>
