	<brief_title>Health Benefits of a 21-day Daniel Fast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the main purposes of the this investigation was to determine if krill oil supplementation (two grams per day for 21 days) enhances the effects of a 21-day Daniel Fast, particularly in regards to blood lipids and lipid peroxidation. The investigators were also interested in determining if adiponectin and/or resistin change in response to the fast, as these adipokines could potentially mediate the favorable glucoregulatory changes the investigators observed in our initial investigation of a 21-day Daniel Fast. Finally, the investigators sought to determine the changes in macronutrient and micronutrient intake during a Daniel Fast, and how these dietary changes affect our selected hemodynamic, anthropometric, blood lipid, glucoregulatory, oxidative stress, inflammatory, renal, and hepatic biomarkers.</detailed_description>
