	<brief_title>100% VS 80% Of Pegasys In Koreans With Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The virologic response of Koreans to combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C is similar to non-Asians; however, dose modification occurs more frequently in Koreans. -When we evaluated the rates of peginterferon α-2a and ribavirin dose modifications and their effect on the virologic response in Koreans, we suggested that using at least 80% of the peginterferon α-2a dose in Koreans not only maintains SVR but also reduces drug side effects during the entire treatment period and a lower dose of ribavirin may be as efficacious as a standard dose(Korean J Intern Med 2009;24:203-211). So we investigate whether the group of 80% use dosage of peginterferon alfa-2a did not show inferior response rather than that of 100 % use dosage group and minimize the adverse events. There are recently reports that Koreans have favorable IL28B SNP for CHC treatment. -We investigate the IL28B polymorphism in Koreans with CHC and this result can effect on the SVR depending on the dosage of peginterferon alfa 2a</detailed_description>
