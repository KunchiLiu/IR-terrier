	<brief_summary>A psoas compartment block has been used with good results for postoperative pain relief after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, case reports describing serious complications after the use of this block, have been reported. The fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) has been shown to be a reliable block for postoperative pain relief for procedures and injuries involving the hip. The investigators have not found any literature that has compared these two blocks. This study will compare the two blocks when used for post-operative pain relief after THA.</brief_summary>
