	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to determine if individuals who had a stroke more than one year before entering the study and whose ankles remain substantially impaired are able to sense and move the affected leg better after 9-13 weeks of treatment with a robotic therapy device (AMES).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMES Treatment of the Impaired Leg in Chronic Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our research objective is to develop procedures to rehabilitate those stroke patients who, through conventional therapies, are not brought to a level of maximal recovery. The aims of the proposed project are to obtain a set of data from a total of 20 chronic stroke subjects, all with severe lower extremity disability, between the ages of 18-85, using a robotic therapeutic device placed in a rehabilitation clinic. This data will allow us to quantify the extent to which a combination of robotic-assisted exercise and tendon vibration from the AMES beta device induces secondary recovery from the effects of stroke on the lower extremity.</detailed_description>
