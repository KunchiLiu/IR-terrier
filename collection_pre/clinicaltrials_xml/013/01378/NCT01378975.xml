	<brief_summary>This open-label, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety in participants with metastatic melanoma who developed brain metastases. Participants may or may not have received prior systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma [except treatment with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors]. Participants will receive oral doses of 960 mg vemurafenib twice daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult participants, &gt;/= 18 years of age Histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (Stage IV, American Joint Committee on Cancer) with BRAF V600 mutation (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) Measurable brain metastases, defined as lesions that were accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥0.5 cm in the brain MRI with contrast, treated or untreated Participants may or may not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma and either a) have received no prior treatment for brain metastases or b) have received prior treatment for brain metastases and have progressed Participants may or may not have symptoms related to their brain metastases Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01 Participants must have recovered from all side effects of their most recent systemic or local treatment for metastatic melanoma Increasing corticosteroid dose during the 7 days prior to first dose of study drug Leptomeningeal involvement in participants with no prior treatment for brain metastases Previous malignancy requiring active treatment within the past 2 years, except for treated and controlled basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma insitu of the cervix Concurrent administration of any anticancer therapies other than those administered in the study Treatment with any cytotoxic, investigational drug or targeted therapy 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. Radiation therapy ≤1 week prior to first administration of vemurafenib; and stereotactic radiotherapy ≤1 day prior to prior to first administration of vemurafenib Prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors Clinically significant cardiovascular disease or event within the 6 months prior to first dose of study drug</criteria>
