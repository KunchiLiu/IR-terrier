	<brief_title>Multicenter Study of Family Nursing to Treat Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quality of life is impaired among patients with heart failure and their next of kin compared to other patients with chronic diseases. Besides, there are still a number of patients who misunderstand or have difficulties remembering the counseling they are provided during the course of illness. International guidelines recommend that the patient's relatives are involved in patient education as well as the treatment. Family interventions might contribute to improvement in quality of life, enhanced illness-management and delayed readmission and mortality among patients with heart failure. However, up till today, only two observational studies have investigated the effect of family intervention on outcomes of treatment for heart failure.</detailed_description>
