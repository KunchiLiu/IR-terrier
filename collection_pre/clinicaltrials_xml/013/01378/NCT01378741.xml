	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery in the elderly patient. This proposal is a clinical trial designed to reduce delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery by replacing standard postoperative sedation protocols (propofol, midazolam, opioids) with a new alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist (dexmedetomidine) possessing sedative, analgesic, and antinociceptive properties. Resource utilization analysis will be performed to determine cost effectiveness of the new treatment modality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, open label study comparing multimodal protocols for postoperative sedation after cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomly allocated to either dexmedetomidine or propofol (control) groups according to a computer generated randomization code in predetermined size blocks of four.</detailed_description>
