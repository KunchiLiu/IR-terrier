Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study medications or components of the inhalation powder. Subject has a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates the subject's participation will also be excluded. Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years prior to Screening Subjects who are medically unable to withhold albuterol, ipratropium for 4 hrs and/or theophylline for 12 hrs prior to spirometry testing.
