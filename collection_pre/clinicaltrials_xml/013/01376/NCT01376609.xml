	<brief_summary>Previous research has shown there wasn't inevitable relationship between mismatch area and infarct growth according to Volumetric-subtraction mismatch volume.The recently published on Stroke paper has proposed Coregistration mismatch to calculate the mismatch to replace ischaemic penumbra, and it reignites hope for clinical application of the PWI/DWI mismatch. But the correlation between the mismatch, calculated by Coregistration mismatch method,and the clinical outcome of the patients with acute ischemic stroke is still unknown. so the investigators plan to conduct a prospective observational cohort study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Correlation Between Outcome and Infarct Growth in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NIHSS,mRS and MR PWI/DWI/MRA are performed within 48 hours of stroke onset and final MR T2/flair image at â‰ˆ1 month. And then,Volumetric-subtraction mismatch and Coregistered mismatch will be calculated,respectively.finally,we will assess and compare the Volumetric-subtraction mismatch and Coregistered mismatch, and to clarify which method match the clinical outcome more better.</detailed_description>
