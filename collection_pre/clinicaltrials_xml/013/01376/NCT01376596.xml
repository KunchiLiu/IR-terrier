	<brief_summary>This study will explore the helpfulness of a short psychological group treatment called cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT. CBT is a form of therapy that is very structured and it aims to improve difficulties that are related to behaviors and emotions by first working on identifying and changing negative inaccurate thoughts. The main goal of this intervention is to see if group CBT reduces the symptoms of social anxiety in people with schizophrenia so that they can improve their social functioning and help their psychotic symptoms. The study compares the usefulness of adding CBT to standard services.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Group Cognitive-behavioral Intervention for Social Anxiety in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Social anxiety is highly prevalent in people with schizophrenia and represents a major obstacle to positive functional outcomes. Social anxiety is a treatable condition but has, in the context of psychosis, received only scant attention thus far. Current existing manualized treatment for social anxiety may not be optimal for people with schizophrenia for a number of reasons described above. An adapted CBT intervention for schizophrenia must target the stigma attached to the illness, the presence of poor social skills, the presence of delusional and persecutory ideas, possible limited reading abilities, and associated cognitive deficits. The investigators propose to develop and test an adapted group CBT for social anxiety. The main objective of this research proposal is to contrast the impact of a CBT intervention for the treatment of social anxiety in schizophrenia with standard care (care as usual) on reducing symptoms of social anxiety. Considering the relationship between certain characteristics of social anxiety (e.g. social withdrawal) with diminished quality of life and poor functional outcome, a secondary objective is to examine the impact of reduced social anxiety on functional outcome.</detailed_description>
