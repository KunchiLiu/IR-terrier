	<brief_summary>Immunological effects of radiotherapy have been described before, but not evaluated in a time-dependant manner. In order to identify a possible time frame for combination therapies, white blood cells are isolated of samples taken at different time points before during and after standard radiotherapy in patients with localised prostate cancer. The overall activity of the T-cell-system as well as tumor-specific T-cell-response are evaluated.</brief_summary>
