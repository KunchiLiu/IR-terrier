	<brief_title>H. Pylori Testing for Patients With Non-specific Upper Abdominal Pain in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major goal is to study the prevalence of H. pylori using the 13C Urea Breath Test (UBT) in emergency department (ED) patients with non-specific abdominal pain. The investigators plan to enroll 250 patients during the pilot stage of this study. This T2 translational trial aims to apply recommended guidelines for the investigation and management of NSAP and dyspepsia into the practical arena of ED clinical care. The "test-and-treat" approach to symptomatic H. pylori infection has been endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Patients who test positive for H. pylori by UBT will be treated with clarithromycin-based triple medication therapy as recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) at the discretion of the treating physician. The rationale is that successful identification of H. pylori in the ED and initiation of treatment may reduce future risk of gastritis, gastric lymphoma, and gastric cancer, and is cost-effective through reduction of future healthcare costs and symptom severity. Study subjects will be followed for medication compliance, resolution of symptoms, and ability to obtain outpatient follow-up. As part of this study, the investigators will be collecting important information on the ED evaluation of abdominal pain.</detailed_description>
