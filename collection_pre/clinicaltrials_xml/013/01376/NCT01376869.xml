	<brief_summary>Hops have been used for many years for their supposed sedative and anxiety reducing properties and can be found in many natural remedies for stress, anxiety and sleeping that are already available to buy. However, human trials investigating the effects of hops have so far been limited to the effects of the combination of hops and valerian in relation to sleep. Such studies have identified that a valerian-hops mixture can result in improved sleep but Valerian alone has no effect. The current study aims to investigate the effect of hops alone in healthy human participants aged 18-35 years.</brief_summary>
