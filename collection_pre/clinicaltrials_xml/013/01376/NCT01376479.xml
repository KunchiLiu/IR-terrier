	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of an Inactivated Vaccine Against Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease Caused by Enterovirus 71</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by Enterovirus 71 (EV71) can be severely debilitating for some children with a risk of paralysis and death. The most susceptible age group is the 1 to 5 year olds, and the disease is spread via the oral-fecal route. Currently, there is no antiviral therapy nor there is a vaccine available to prevent HFMD. In this study, an inactivated vaccine (INV21) based on the EV71 antigen will be evaluated in terms of safety and immune response that is generated after two doses of the vaccine are given to healthy adults. Safety assessments include the frequency and severity of systemic adverse events as well as local reactions. Immune response will be assessed by measurement of EV71 neutralizing antibody levels at specified time points throughout the study.</detailed_description>
