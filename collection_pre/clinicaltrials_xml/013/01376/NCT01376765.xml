	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation SARS-CoV Recombinant S Protein, With and Without Adjuvant, Vaccine Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1,multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, outpatient study in healthy male and nonpregnant female subjects 18 to 40 years of age, inclusive. Three dosing cohorts to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Recombinant S protein Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) vaccine, with and without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant manufactured by Protein Sciences Corporation, administered intramuscularly on Days 0 and 28 at a dose of 5, 15, or 45 mcg; controls will receive the diluents/placebo without vaccine. Approximately 84 subjects are expected to be enrolled. All subjects will receive 2 doses of their assigned treatment via IM injection approximately 28 days apart, followed by assessments at 6, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months after the second dose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or nonpregnant females between the ages of 18 and 40 years, inclusive. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or who have not been postmenopausal for &gt;/=1 year) must agree to practice adequate contraception for the 30day period before vaccination through 90 days after the second vaccination. Acceptable birth control methods for the purposes of this study may include, but are not limited to, abstinence, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner, barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragms, spermicides, and intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods. In good health, as judged by the investigator and determined by vital signs [temperature &lt; 38 degrees C, heart rate &lt;/= 100 bpm and &gt; 50 bpm, systolic blood pressure &lt;/= 140 mmHg and &gt; 89 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;/= 90 mmHg and &gt;/= 60 mm Hg, respiratory rate &gt;/= 12 breath per minute and &lt; 17 breaths per minutes (see toxicity table in Section 9.1.2)], medical history and a targeted physical examination, as indicated, based on medical history. Screening laboratory values must be within normal limits. These include blood hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, eosinophils, platelets, absolute eosinophil, neutrophil, and lymphocyte cell counts, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin (total), glucose (random), and urinalysis (proteinuria and hematuria). See toxicity table in Section 9.1.3.2. Note: creatinine values lower than the normal are acceptable. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures. Willing to be available for all studyrequired procedures, visits and calls for the duration of the study. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures and be available for all study visits. Negative for IgG antibodies to S protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) measured by ELISA. Negative for antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus and for hepatitis B surface antigen. Negative for IgG antibodies to S protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) measured by ELISA. Negative for antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus and for hepatitis B surface antigen. A known allergy to components of the vaccine. A positive serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hr prior to vaccination (if female of childbearing potential as defined in Inclusion Criterion 2), women who are planning to become pregnant from 30 days prior to entering the study until 90 days after the final study vaccination, or women who are breastfeeding. Immunosuppression as result of underlying illness or treatment or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within the preceding 36 months. An active neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer or prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any hematologic malignancy. Nonactive neoplastic disease is defined as no neoplastic disease or treatment for neoplastic disease within the past 5 years. A history of autoimmune disease (systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, polyarteritis, thyroiditis, etc). Used an immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drug such as &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day or &gt;/=20 mg total dose/day of prednisone orally or &gt;800 mcg of inhaled beclomethasone for 2 or more consecutive weeks within 6 months prior to the 1st vaccination. (Nasal and topical steroids are allowed.) A known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or active hepatitis B, or hepatitis C virus infection. A diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or other major psychiatric diagnosis in the past 3 years. Hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or confinement for danger to self or others in the past 3 years. Receiving psychiatric drugs listed below*. Subjects who are receiving a single antidepressant drug and are stable for at least 3 months prior to enrollment, without decompensating symptoms will be allowed to be enrolled in the study. *aripiprazole, clozapine, ziprasidone, haloperidol, molindone, loxapine, thioridazine, thiothixene, pimozide, fluphenazine, risperidone, mesoridazine, quetiapine, trifluoperazine, trifluopromazine, chlorprothixene, chlorpromazine, perphenazine, olanzapine, carbamazepine, divalproex sodium, lithium carbonate, or lithium citrate.

A history of severe reactions following immunization with vaccines. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) within 1 month before vaccination in this study or expect to receive an experimental agent during the 24month study period. Any condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place them at an unacceptable risk of injury, render them unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or that may interfere with successful completion of the study. A history of alcohol or drug abuse during the previous 1 year; for example, daily excessive alcohol use or frequent binge drinking as determined by the investigator, or chronic marijuana abuse or any other illicit drug use.
