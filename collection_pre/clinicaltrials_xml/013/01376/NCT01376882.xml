	<brief_title>Cognitive and Cerebral Blood Flow Effects of 2-week Caffeine Abstinence or Maintenance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel groups study aims to explore the behavioural effects of 2-weeks caffeine abstinence as well as establishing the role of abstinence in the effects of caffeine administration by administering caffeine or placebo to those in a state of chronic and acute abstinence. This research also aims to explore, in a subset of participants, the cerebral blood flow effects of caffeine abstinence and caffeine administration using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Cerebral blood flow will be measured both at rest and during performance of cognitive tasks.</detailed_description>
