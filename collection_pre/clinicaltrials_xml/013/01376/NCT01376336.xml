	<brief_summary>Environmental health-related pathogens include faecal-oral, diarrhoeagenic microbes that may be transmitted via drinking water and are related to sanitation and hygiene. Previous research has suggested that safeguarding household drinking water against recontamination may be a critical intervention that can reduce risks of diarrheal diseases and may be especially important for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and other vulnerable populations (Clasen et al. 2007). The investigators propose here a randomised, controlled trial of a household safe storage container for drinking water in a well defined, HIV-impacted population in peri-urban Lusaka, Zambia. After a baseline data collection period (9 months) half of all households (150 households) will be given a safe water storage container specifically designed to prevent recontamination of water in household use. All households will be followed for an additional 9 months. Results of this study will help determine whether this promising water quality intervention can reduce diarrhoea and related outcomes in this and similar vulnerable populations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Safe Water Storage Among People Living With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim #1: To assess environmental health-related risk and outcomes in a low income peri-urban area of Zambia with a high percentage of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) (longitudinal observational cohort study and baseline) (Year 1). We will assemble a rich dataset on environmental health-related risk factors in a well defined population, with a focus on household drinking water quality and other water, sanitation, and hygiene (WSH) exposures. Specific Aim #2: To quantify the WSH-related disease burden among PLWHA, compared with those without HIV/AIDS (individual and household level stratification) (conclusion of baseline). After nine months of data collection, we will perform an initial analysis to determine WSH-related risk by HIV status. Specific Aim #3: To assess the impact of a water quality intervention on the longitudinal prevalence of Highly Credible Gastrointestinal Illness (HCGI) among PLWHA (randomized controlled trial, year 2). We will conduct a randomised, controlled trial of a safe water storage intervention. We will assess the health impacts of this intervention, with particular focus on the high-risk groups of PLWHA and children under 5 years of age.</detailed_description>
