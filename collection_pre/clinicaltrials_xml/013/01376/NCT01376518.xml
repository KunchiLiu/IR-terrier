	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to characterize the influence of an elevated positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury on the cerebrovascular autoregulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Positive End-expiratory Pressure on Autoregulation in Patients With Respiratory Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral blood flow velocity will be measured using transcranial Doppler sonography and then correlate with the invasive arterial blood pressure curve to calculate the index of cerebrovascular autoregulation Mx (Mx&gt;0.3 indicates impaired AR). The index of cerebrovascular autoregulation Mx was measured during baseline positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and after lung recruitment with higher level of PEEP. The equality between this two PEEP levels was estimated and calculated with one side Wilcoxon test.</detailed_description>
