	<brief_summary>We propose to examine a population of Native Americans who have had little or no dental care, and to determine if periodontal disease is associated with early signs of vascular dysfunction or systemic inflammation. We then propose to treat the periodontitis and re-evaluate vascular function. We will determine if gingivitis or mild/moderate periodontitis is associated with detectable vascular dysfunction. Microbial metagenomics will be correlated with vascular function.</brief_summary>
