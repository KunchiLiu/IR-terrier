	<brief_summary>Despite continuing advances in iron chelation therapy, iron toxicity of endocrine glands, particularly the pituitary gland, remains common in patients with transfusion dependent anemias. We would like to establish accurate population norms of pituitary R2 and volume and understand the progression of pituitary iron in transfused patients on Deferasirox.</brief_summary>
