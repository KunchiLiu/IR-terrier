	<brief_summary>Previous studies have indicated that patient expectations, beliefs and preferences may have an impact on treatment outcomes. The KIVIS study was primarily designed to compare two effective treatments for knee osteoarthritis (tidal irrigation (medical washout of the knee) or intra-articular corticosteroid injection). At study entry any preference expressed by the patient for each of the treatment interventions was recorded. This study assessed the effects of two treatments given at a single time-point and hence the effects of patient preference could be assessed independently of any compliance issues.</brief_summary>
