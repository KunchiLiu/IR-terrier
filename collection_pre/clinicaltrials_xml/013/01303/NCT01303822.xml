	<brief_summary>Emotional and mental symptoms are common consequences of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Coping with these symptoms seems to be influenced by interpretation of illness, locus of health control and spiritual attitudes in dealing with illness. Mindfulness-based stress reduction has been shown to reduce physical and mental symptoms in cancer patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a mindfulness-based day-care clinic group program on quality of life, anxiety and depression in cancer patients and to evaluate the association with coping styles, spiritual attitudes in dealing with illness, mindfulness and interpretation of illness.</brief_summary>
