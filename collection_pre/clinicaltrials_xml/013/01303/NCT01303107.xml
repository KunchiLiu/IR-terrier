	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the mixture of enantiomers of bupivacaine (bupivacaine S75:R25) dos not represent inferiority efficacy and safety compare to the racemic mixture of enantiomers of bupivacaine (bupivacaine S50:R50).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The enantiomeric mixture of bupivacaine S75:R25 (75% levobupivacaine and 25% bupivacaine) was develop to be a safety regional anesthetic in substitution to racemic bupivacaine (S50:R50).</detailed_description>
