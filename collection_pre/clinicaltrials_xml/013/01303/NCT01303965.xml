	<brief_summary>One of the complications that can occur after a stem cell transplant is called graft versus host disease (GVHD). Another complication is that multiple myeloma may come back (relapse). In this study, a drug called lenalidomide will be started 1-2 months after a transplant, or possibly later depending on recovery of your side effects. Lenalidomide and sirolimus have been shown to work together against multiple myeloma. Therefore, lenalidomide will be combined with sirolimus with the hope that this will help prolong the amount of time the disease is in remission. Researchers hope these steps will help prolong the amount of time the multiple myeloma is in remission and will decrease the chance of GvHD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Recipient 1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form. 2. Age 1870 years at the time of signing the informed consent form. 3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 4. Previously documented multiple myeloma (MM) with measurable monoclonal protein by either serum/urine protein electrophoresis or serum free light chains, or measurable plasmacytomas. 5. ECOG performance status of 02 at study entry (see Appendix 2). 6. Acceptable organ function as outlined in the protocol. 7. Otherwise fitting institutional criteria for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 8. Presence of an HLAmatched (5/6 or 6/6 matched for HLAA, B, and DR) sibling donor, or a HLAmatched (matched for at least HLAA, B, C, and DRB1) unrelated donor by highresolution testing. 9. Disease free of prior malignancies for &gt;/= 5 years with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "insitu" of the cervix or breast. 10. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®. 11. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test Recipient 1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. 2. Pregnant or breast feeding females. 3. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 4. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or Lenalidomide. 5. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. 6. Known seropositive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine or prior infection to which they are now immune (i.e., not carriers) are eligible. Donor The following categories of donor will be acceptable: 1. HLAmatched related donor (5/6 or 6/6 match): Minimal typing necessary is serologic typing for class I (A, B) and molecular typing for class II (DRB1). 2. HLAmatched Unrelated Donor (MUD): Molecular identity at least at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 and DQB1 (8/10 match) by high resolution typing is required. 3. Syngeneic donors are not eligible. 4. The donor must be healthy and must be an acceptable donor as per institutional standards for marrow or stem cell donation. 5. Age ≥ 18 years</criteria>
