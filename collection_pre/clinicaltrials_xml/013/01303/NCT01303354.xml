	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of dexamethasone for transforaminal epidural steroid injection. A secondary aim of this study is to obtain data on the lowest most effective dose of dexamethasone for this treatment and the effective duration of effect.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) have been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for radicular pain. Over the last decade, rare but serious complications have been reported following transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI). Recent research indicates that certain types of corticosteroids containing microscopic particles may be responsible for these adverse events. Dexamethasone (DXM) is a non-particulate cortico-steroid that has not been implicated in these adverse events. However, there is inadequate evidence up to date to support the use of Dexamethasone (DXM) for transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI). This study aims to bridge that gap.</detailed_description>
