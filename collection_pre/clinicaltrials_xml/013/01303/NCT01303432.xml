	<brief_title>Effect of Yogurts Supplemented With Mobilee on Joint Function in Healthy Individuals With Joint Discomfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of low intensity gonalgia is relatively high in western population. The purpose of the present intervention study is to determine whether the daily consumption of a yogurt supplemented with Mobile is effective in improving joint function and quality of life of individuals with low intensity gonalgia. Previous research using in vitro and animal models have demonstrated the efficacy of Mobilee in reducing inflammation and promoting anabolic responses in joint tissues. In addition, in two previous human intervention trials, the effects of Mobilee in joint function had been assessed using isokinetic tests. The present trial aims to confirm those previous results.</detailed_description>
