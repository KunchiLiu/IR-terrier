	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether R-FC is more beneficial that R-CVP in the treatment of older patients (aged 60 or over) with Follicular Lymphoma (FL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Looking at Rituximab and Chemotherapy as a Treatment for Follicular Lymphoma in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FL predominantly affects the elderly, yet the optimum treatment for older patients with the disease has not been defined. The present study aims to address this question by comparing the drug combination that is currently considered the gold-standard (R-CVP) with a newer combination (R-FC) that might be more effective without being significantly more toxic. In order to take into account the balance between efficacy and toxicity, a dual primary endpoint has been employed: progression-free survival and toxicity in the form of grade 3-4 infection.</detailed_description>
