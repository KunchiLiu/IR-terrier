	<brief_summary>Oxygen desaturation (SO2 &lt; 88-90%) during walking is a common clinical feature of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. By a predicted analysis our study is aimed to evaluate anthropometric and functional characteristics of COPD patients correlated with oxygen desaturation during Six-minute walking test (6MWT).</brief_summary>
