	<brief_summary>Part 1.Comparison of manual pressure titration in laboratory of sleep disorders with Autoset T APAP device from Resmed. Hypothesis: There is no difference in efficiency between manual and automatical titration. Part 2. Comparison of CPAP and APAP therapy in the home while 3 month by Questionaire and device data. Hypothesis: There is a difference in compliance and efficiency between CPAP and APAP mode.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autoset T Versus CPAP Therapy, a Comparison of Titration and Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cross over, simple blind study design has been created for a controlled trial to compare pressure titration and therapy with the Autoset T device. Part 1: After a baseline polysomnography (PSG) a selected group of patients with obstructive sleep apnea will be titrated in two more nights in a sleep lab under APAP mode and CPAP mode. We compare the sleep quality and the AHI, oxygen saturation, leakage. Part 2: Over a time range of 12 weeks the patients got two kinds of therapy modes at home: CPAP and APAP (each six weeks. We compare the objective and subjective therapy by compliance, device data, Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, german version).</detailed_description>
