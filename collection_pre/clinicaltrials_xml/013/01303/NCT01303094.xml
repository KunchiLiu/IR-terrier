	<brief_summary>This randomization discontinuation trial will allow for concomitant evaluation of the following: - Side effects and benefits of immediate continuation of Trabectedin after the sixth cycle - Side effects and benefits of a drug holiday</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuing vs Intermittent Trabectedin in Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selection part (220 patients): Trabectedin (depending on dose reductions : between 1.5 and 1 mg/m²/3 weeks; over 24 hour administration) until progression, intolerance or 6 cycles (according to the SPC of Trabectedin) Randomized part (50 patients): After the 6 first cycles, if there is not progression or unacceptable toxicity, the patients will be randomly assigned to continuous or "intermittent/holiday" therapy with CT-scan evaluation every 6 weeks in both arms - Arm A Continuation of Trabectedin (between 1.5 and 1 mg/m²/3 weeks; over 24 hour administration) until progression or intolerance - Arm B "Intermittent/holiday" therapy. Rechallenge of Trabectedin will be implemented in the event of progression; in this case administration of Trabectedin will occur until the second progression or intolerance</detailed_description>
