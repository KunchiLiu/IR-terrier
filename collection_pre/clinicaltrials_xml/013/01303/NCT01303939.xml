	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if glaucoma is associated with neurodegenerative changes in areas of the brain other than the occipital lobe. This will help guide the direction of further research in the use of neuroprotective agents in preventing or controlling such changes. The final goal is to improve the quality of life for patients with glaucoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Glaucoma Cause Loss of Brain Function?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Death of retinal ganglion cells causes loss of neurons in areas other than just the visual cortex. These neurodegenerative changes decrease the patient's ability to perform the activities of daily living. Tensor-based morphometry analysis of MRI brain scans will reveal areas of cortical degeneration in glaucoma patients, and the extent of damage in these areas will correlate with their ability to perform vision-dependent tasks, as measured by the Assessment of Ability Related to Vision (AARV). Patients with glaucoma who were outliers in Assessment of Ability Related to Vision (AARV) Study or Assessment of Disability related to vision (ADREV) Study, in that they have poor performance-based measure scores despite having midrange visual field scores. Mini-Mental State Exam and T-1 weighted MRI brain scan and will be performed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with glaucoma who were outliers in Assessment of Ability Related to Vision (AARV) or Assessment of Disability related to vision (ADREV), in that they have poor performancebased measure scores (â‰¤ 40s) despite having midrange visual field scores (mean deviation of 6 to 20). Age, gender and racematched controls who do not have glaucoma, and who do not have loss of vision for any reason other than cataract or refractive error. 1. Patients with any type of neurological disease. 2. Patients with a cognitive deficit which would affect visual functioning, as revealed by the neuroophthalmologic examination.</criteria>
