	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess safety and ability of the endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probe (ENDOHPB) to produce an improvement in the management of cancer of the bile duct or the pancreatic duct. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumour growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby, allowing increased periods between the need for intervention and further stent deployment. The study will look to see if the ENDOHPB is able to keep the stent open longer and perhaps decrease the number of invasive procedures for occluded (blocked) stents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Bipolar Radiofrequency Probe (ENDOHPB) in the Management of Unresectable Bile Duct and Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer are suitable for surgical resection. As the cancer grows, it blocks the drainage of the bile ducts that carry digestive juices from the gall bladder and pancreas to the small intestine. Blocked drainage causes abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is often prescribed. ERCP with stent placement is the standard medical procedure for people with bile duct and pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess safety and ability of the endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probe (ENDOHPB) to produce an improvement in the management of cancer of the bile duct or the pancreatic duct. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumour growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby, allowing increased periods between the need for intervention and further stent deployment. The study will look to see if the ENDOHPB is able to keep the stent open longer and perhaps decrease the number of invasive procedures for occluded (blocked) stents. The objectives are: â€¢ To assess assess the safety and effectiveness of an endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency catheter (EndoHPB) in the management of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer</detailed_description>
