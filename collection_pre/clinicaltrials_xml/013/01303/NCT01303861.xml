	<brief_summary>This study focuses on the first step in developing an algorithm for maximizing quit-smoking success based on an adaptive approach, which changes treatment from the initial nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) when that treatment alone may not be sufficient. These NRT "non-responders" are switched (in double-blind fashion) before the quit date to receive either varenicline alone or varenicline paired with bupropion. Some participants who would otherwise have failed at their quit smoking attempt could be "rescued" by switching to alternative pharmacotherapies. The proposed study will evaluate the combination treatment against varenicline alone in an adaptive trial design</brief_summary>
