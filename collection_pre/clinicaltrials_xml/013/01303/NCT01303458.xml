	<brief_summary>This research project is aimed to address low-income families' basic social needs (housing, food, employment, education, childcare, utilities) within the context of pediatric primary care. This project builds upon the PI's prior study at Hopkins which demonstrated a positive impact of a similar intervention on pediatric residents' screening and referral to community agencies. This study will specifically test whether a further strengthened intervention--Basic Needs Surveillance (BNS) protocol-- can lead to greater maternal enrollment in community resources and receipt of eligible benefits. In addition, we will measure the intervention's impact on maternal well-being, and compliance with well-child care (WCC) visits. The project will take place at eight community health centers in the Greater Boston Area. The centers will be randomized to either an intervention or control site. Mothers who bring their infant in for a WCC visit from birth to 6 months will be eligible. They will be followed until their child is one year of age. Study subjects will complete two self-administered surveys (baseline, follow-up), and one brief telephone interview (when their infant is 9 months old). Pediatric providers will also be subjects; and will fill out a demographic questionnaire at the time of enrollment. The BNS intervention will consist of 4 components: 1) WE CARE survey which mothers will fill out in the waiting room prior to their child's WCC visits; 2) Family Resource book containing 1-page information sheets on resources, that providers will have access to in exam rooms; 3) a Community Resource Coordinator who will assist families link to available resources, and update providers; 4) Training Session which will provide a 1 hr overview of the intervention to providers. Families attending the control health centers will receive standard of care. Enrolled mothers will be offered the intervention at the end of the 12-month follow-up interview. When follow-up data collection is complete, the PI will offer the control sites the opportunity to implement the BNS protocol.</brief_summary>
