	<brief_title>Efficacity of Weekly Paclitaxel in Association or Not With Bevacizumab in Metastatic or Locally Advanced Angiosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization is stratified : - angiosarcoma in irradiated region : yes / no - visceral angiosarcoma : yes / no All patient will received a maximum of 6 cycles of weekly Paclitaxel (Arm A and B) in association or not with Bevacizumab (ArmB). 1 cycle = 28 days Treatment by Bevacizumab is to continue beyond the 6th cycle, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Arm A and B: Day 1, D8 and D15 Paclitaxel : 90 mg/m², IV weekly with premedication Arm B : Day 1 and D15 Bevacizumab : 10 mg/kg and then, Bevacizumab : 15 mg/kg/3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity</detailed_description>
