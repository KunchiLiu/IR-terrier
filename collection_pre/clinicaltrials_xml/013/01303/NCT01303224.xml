	<brief_title>Ibodutant for Relief of Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhoea (IBS-D)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of three doses of ibodutant, given once daily for 8 weeks versus placebo in IBS-D patients. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of overall symptom relief and abdominal pain/discomfort relief after 8 weeks of treatment. The clinical phase of the study comprises a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free),an 8-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week treatment withdrawal period, resulting in a 10-week overall duration of the study for each patient. Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in an electronic diary (web-and telephone based)during all periods of the study.</detailed_description>
