	<brief_summary>Enrolled women will undergo a bilateral 2-view DE-CEDM examination after administration of an iodinated contrast agent. Separate readers on-site will evaluate DE-CEDM+MX (standard mammography) and CE-BMRI+MX to determine the extent of disease. An integrated reading of both sets of images will be performed either by one or the two readers. DE-CEDM will not be used to change the diagnosis. Lesions that are confirmed as suspicious by MX, CE-BMRI, or follow-up breast ultrasound (US) will undergo biopsy. Truth about extent of disease will be based on histologic analysis of surgical specimens along with follow-up MX 10-15 months after the study exam. A randomized, blinded image evaluation will be done with 11 to 15 radiologist readers to compare DE-CEDM+MX and CE-BMRI+MX for assessment of disease extent.</brief_summary>
