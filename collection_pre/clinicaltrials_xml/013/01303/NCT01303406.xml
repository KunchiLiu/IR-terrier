	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IIIb Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study. The aim is to further investigate the effects of idebenone in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. The objective of the PROTI study is to establish whether patients can correctly determine which treatment assignment (placebo or idebenone) they received during the randomised phase of the trial, and identify any potential changes on symptoms or activities.</brief_summary>
