	<brief_summary>To assess the TANTALUS therapy in type 2 diabetic patients who can not tolerate GLP-1 agonist due to unacceptable side effects; and to assess the TANTALUS therapy in type 2 diabetic patients who do not sufficiently benefit from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TANTALUS Therapy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Intolerant or Inadequately Responsive to GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present protocol will address whether the effects of the TANTALUS treatment are complimentary to GLP-1 treatment which is only partially effective or whether it can replace GLP-1 treatment in individuals who cannot tolerate GLP-1 agonists because of unacceptable side effects. This investigation will be a 3 arm multicenter study which will enroll in a Run-In Period up to 400 with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This Run-In Period will facilitate screening the patients with the aim to have a maximum of 30 patients in each arm complete the Evaluation Period of 6 months. The study aims at evaluating the TANTALUS therapy compared to GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy by evaluating improvement in glycemic control and weight after 6 months of treatment in each of the 3 study groups, which are: - Group A: subjects on GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy only - Group B: subjects on GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and TANTALUS therapy - Group C: subjects on TANTALUS therapy only</detailed_description>

Women with childbearing potential (i.e., not postmenopausal or surgically sterilized) must agree to use adequate birth control methods 9. If subject is taking lipidlowering medication, the treatment must be stable for at least one month prior to enrollment 10. If subject is taking antihypertensive medication, the treatment must be stable for at least one month prior to enrollment 11. If subject is taking antidepressant medication, the treatment must be stable for at least one month prior to enrollment 12. Willingness to refrain from using prescription, over the counter, or herbal weight loss products for the duration of the trial 13. Ability and willingness to perform required study and data collection procedures and adhere to operating requirements of the TANTALUSÂ® System 14.

Use of active medical devices (either implantable or external) such as ICD, drug infusion device, or neurostimulator (either implanted or worn). Subjects using an external active device who are able and willing to avoid use of the device during the study may be enrolled. 20.

A history of lifethreatening disease within 5 years of enrollment 23. Any additional condition(s) that in the Investigator's opinion would warrant exclusion from the study or prevent the subject from completing the study</criteria>
