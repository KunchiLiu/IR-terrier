	<brief_title>Mirtazapine Treatment of Anxiety in Children and Adolescents With Pervasive Developmental Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the areas receiving very little attention in Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) is that of anxiety. Anxiety is common in PDD, but has not yet been fully characterized. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a preliminary placebo-controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety associated with PDDs. We hypothesize that mirtazapine will be safe and well tolerated.</detailed_description>
