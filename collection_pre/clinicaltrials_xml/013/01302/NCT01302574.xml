	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the functional significance of sweet taste receptors in the secretion of gastrointestinal (GI) satiation peptides by using a specific sweet taste receptor antagonist to block sweet taste perception in the gastrointestinal tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of the Gut Sweet Taste Receptor in the Secretion of Satiation Peptides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is strong evidence that taste signaling mechanisms identified in the oral epithelium also operate in the gut. It is suggested that open-type enteroendocrine cells directly sense nutrient via alpha-gustducin coupled taste receptors to modulate the secretion of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Several nutrient responsive G-protein coupled receptors have been identified in the human gut, including the sweet taste responsive T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer, the amino acid/umami responsive T1R1/T1R3 as well as GPR120 for unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids. The functional significance of sweet taste receptors in mixed liquid meal-stimulated secretion of GLP-1 and PYY will be determined by intragastric infusion of a 500 mL mixed liquid meal with or without lactisole (450 ppm)in a double blind, 2-way crossover trial including 16 healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
