	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of losartan potassium 50 mg (L50) + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (H12.5) + amlodipine besylate 5 mg (A5) (MK-0954E). The primary hypothesis is that L50/H12.5/A5 is more effective in lowering mean trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment compared to L50+A5 in Japanese participants with essential hypertension who are not adequately controlled following an 8-week treatment with filter period study drug (L50+A5).</brief_summary>
