	<brief_summary>Gait rehabilitation with treadmill has been reported to be useful in patients with Parkinson's disease. In the last years, interest in robotic devices for gait training has grew up for patients with different neurological disorders, since they minimize demands on physical therapists and may provide a more reliable and constant treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate if robotic gait training with LokomatÂ® can improve walking more than conventional gait training with treadmill in patients affected by Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
