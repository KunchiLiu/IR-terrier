	<brief_title>Cinnamon Bark, Water-Soluble Cinnamon Extract, and Metformin for Treatment of Type 2 DM.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are studying whether or not cinnamon bark or water-soluble cinnamon could be an effective nutraceutical for the initial treatment of diabetes when compared to standard therapy of metformin 1000 mg (extended-release). This study will enroll 309 subjects type 2 diabetics (using American Diabetes Association criteria) on no hypoglycemic medications. Subjects will be randomized into one of three groups, group 1 will receive oral extended-release Metformin 1000mg, group 2 will receive Cinnamon Bark 1000mg, group 3 will receive cinnulin PF 500mg. Subjects will be instructed to take their study pills once a day for 90 days.After 90 days of treatment, each subject will again have hemoglobin A1C, lipid panel, height, weight, blood pressure and waist circumference measured. Analysis described above using intention-to-treat principles for any missing data will be used (we will use the carry-forward method to impute missing data). Subjects will bring in any remaining medication to determine adherence rates to the study protocol.</detailed_description>
