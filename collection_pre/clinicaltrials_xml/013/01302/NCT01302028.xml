	<criteria>Patient with stable type 2 diabetes mellitus or healthy subject Subject must have predose estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values (Modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) method) at screening of: &gt;90 (normal renal function) 6090 (mild renal impairment) 3060 (moderate renal impairment) 1530 (severe renal impairment) BMI between 25.040.0 kg/m2, inclusive Fasted plasma glucose (FPG) &lt;11.5 mmol/l (type 2 DM patients) or &gt;5.6 mmol/l (Healthy volunteers) Patients with Type 1 diabetes Pulse &lt;40 or &gt;90; SBP &gt;160 mmHg; DBP &gt; 100 mmHg T2DM patients who are not on a stable regimen for their current medication (1 month or 5 half lives, whichever is longer) to control their disease Healthy Volunteers: Any of the liver function tests above the upper limit of normal T2DM: The liver function tests should be within the following ranges: AST/ALT: &lt;2 x ULN Bilirubin: &lt;1.5 x ULN Alk Phos: &lt; 1.5 x ULN Patients with renal impairment who have a history of a clinically significant illness (other than renal diseases and T2DM and associated clinical symptoms), medical condition, or laboratory abnormality within 3 months prior to screening Patients with renal impairment who have not been on a stable dose of concomitant medications for at least 2 weeks for at least 2 weeks (or 5 halflives, whichever is longer) and/or for whom dose changes are likely to occur during the study Patients with T2DM treated with a diet only T2DM patients with recent evidence (e.g within the last 6 months) of severe hypoglycemia, for example plasma glucose &lt; 3mmol/l (&lt;55 mg/dl), help from others to resolve the hypo or requiring hospitalization T2DM patients with a Hemoglobin value &lt; 9 g/dl (5.6 mmol/l)</criteria>
