	<brief_summary>There are strong indications that (combinations of) polyphenols may be attractive candidates in the prevention of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes through modulation of pathways of fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that the combination of specific polyphenols, with partly distinct mechanisms of action, may have physiologically significant effects on fat oxidation through additive or synergistic effects, thereby improving body composition, insulin sensitivity and preventing type 2 diabetes. The following objective will be addressed in the current study: (1) to test short term (3 day) effects of combinations of polyphenols (supplements of EGCG either in combination with resveratrol or with resveratrol and genistein) to affect systemic lipolysis and fat oxidation during overnight fasted conditions and after ingestion of a high fat meal in overweight subjects</brief_summary>
