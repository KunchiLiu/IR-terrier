	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Olesoxime (TRO19622) in 3-25 Years SMA Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, adaptive, parallel groups, placebo controlled 3-stage study in patients with SMA type 2 or non ambulant type 3. Stage 1 DMC 3-month safety assessment: An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)will assess the safety of olesoxime every 3 months. Stage 2 Efficacy/futility analyses at one year: A first interim efficacy analysis will be performed after all patients have been treated for one year (52 weeks) in order to assess the need to continue the study to reach the planned objective. In the event of positive and significant results in favor of olesoxime, the study will be considered as successful and all patients will be switched to olesoxime to allow the assessment of the sustainability of the treatment effect and safety. If the results are significantly in favor of placebo, the study will be discontinued for failure (futility). Stage 3 Efficacy and safety analysis at two years: The expected study duration is of 2 years (104 weeks) to show efficacy. If the study is not discontinued for futility or medication regimen is changed due to success, the study will therefore continue until planned completion i.e. 104 weeks.</detailed_description>

Subjects who use a nebulizer or require an inhaler to steroids will be allowed in the study; however oral use of steroids is prohibited. The oral use of salbutamol is permitted with the following restrictions: patients should have been on salbutamol for at least 6 months before inclusion in the trial, with good tolerance. The dose of salbutamol should remain constant for the duration of the trial. The use of inhaled betaagonists (for the treatment of asthma crisis for example) is allowed. Spinal rod or fixation for scoliosis within the past 6 months or anticipated need of rod or fixation within 6 months of enrolment. Inability to meet study visit requirements or cooperate reliably with functional testing Coexisting medical conditions that contraindicate travel, testing or study medications Olesoxime is contraindicated in subjects/patients who develop drug hypersensitivity to it or one of the formulation excipients including hypersensitivity to sesame oil. Patients with hemostasis disorders Patients with known biliary tract obstruction Current or planned pregnancy or nursing period For Women: Failure to use one of the following safe methods of contraception: 1. Female condoms, diaphragm or coil, each used in combination with spermicides 2. Intrauterine device 3. Hormonal contraception in combination with a mechanical method of contraception Participation in any other investigational drug or therapy study within the previous 3 months.</criteria>
