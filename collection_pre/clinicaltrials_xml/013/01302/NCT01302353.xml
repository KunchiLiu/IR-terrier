	<brief_summary>In this trial, our primary goal is to investigate the safety of intravenous infusion of emulsified isoflurane. In order to protect volunteers, the investigators adopt the modified Fibonacci dose-escalation, starting from a very low dose which is derived from the 1/600 of acute LD50 in pre-clinic study. The trial will be terminated if half of volunteers develop severe adverse event in any dose group or any volunteer develop fatal adverse event in any group.</brief_summary>
