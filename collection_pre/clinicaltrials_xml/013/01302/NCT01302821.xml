	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research project is to create images of where and how the amino acid (the building blocks of proteins)Tryptophan is processed in normal and abnormal tissue in the patient's body. Tryptophan is a normal building block of proteins in the body. Sometimes in the case of cancer and other diseases, Tryptophan is processed abnormally, and possible treatments for this abnormality are of great interest because of the potential to improve cancer care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>C11 AMT Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in Patients With Metastatic Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coordinating Center: Southeast Phase 2 Consortium (SEP2C), Moffitt Cancer Center. Research participation involves up to three experimental imaging examination visits in radiology: a baseline before the patient starts a cancer treatment, a follow-up a few days later, and a later follow up to see how the treatment may affect normal or abnormal processing of Tryptophan. The research imaging results will be linked with other evidence of the patient's disease, but will not effect their care.</detailed_description>
