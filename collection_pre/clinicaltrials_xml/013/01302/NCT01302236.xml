	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether eplerenone is effective in the treatment of blood pressure, heart function, renal function in elderly hypertensive stage1 (eGFR&gt;=90ml/min/1.73m2) and stage2 (eGFR 60-89ml/min/1.73m2) chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Eplerenone in Elderly Hypertensive Early Stage Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was reported to be affecting 11% of the all population. This number is much higher in the elderly population and may be as high as 30%. CKD is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is called "Cardio-renal Continuum". The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays pivotal roles in both cardiovascular and renal functions. The increased oxidative stress by activated RAS on vascular endothelium is one of important factor to development of Cardio-renal Continuum. The blockade of RAS by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been reported to ameliorate the renal disease and CVD; however,they do not completely suppress RAS and may induce aldosterone breakthrough that plays important roles for the development of CVD. Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, is effective against essential hypertension; however, little is known about the effects of eplerenone on heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive CKD patients. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of eplerenone on heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive early stage (stage1 (eGFR&gt;=90ml/min/1.73m2) and stage2 (eGFR 60-89ml/min/1.73m2)) CKD patients.</detailed_description>
