	<brief_summary>Wolfram syndrome, also referred to as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness) is a genetic syndrome characterized by beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis leading to diabetes, neurodegeneration and psychiatric illness. Accumulating evidence indicates that beta-cell failure and neuronal cell dysfunction in Wolfram's syndrome results from a high level of ER stress in affected cells. The current treatment of Wolfram syndrome is insulin, which fails to prevent the progression of beta-cell failure. Several studies showed that GLP-1 analogs are very effective in protecting beta-cells from ER stress. Herein, the investigators suggest studying the impact of GLP-1 analogs in the treatment of patients with Wolfram syndrome. The investigators will Study the effects of GLP-1 analog (Exanatide) on beta-cell function and glycemic control of patients with Wolfram syndrome. Evaluation of beta cell function will be done by performing meal test and IVGTT test before starting GLP-1 therapy, and after 3 month of treatment.</brief_summary>
