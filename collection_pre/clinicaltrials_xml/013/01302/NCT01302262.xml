	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate effects of smoking on the dopaminergic system by using PET tomography with new radioligand, [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Our primary hypothesis is that smoking a cigarette will produce dopamine release and this release can be measured using PET imaging and the [11C]-(+)-PHNO radiotracer. The secondary hypothesis is that this smoking induced dopamine release will be correlated with subjective craving and anxiety ratings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking-induced Dopamine Release: a [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET Study in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a within-subjects study in healthy male and female smokers. There will be one within factor condition: Smoking and Non Smoking. Therefore, there will be a repeated measure of PET scans using [11C]-(+)-PHNO under two different conditions. Ten subjects (n=5 male and n=5 female) included in the study will come on two different days and will have a Smoking or Non smoking session performed just before the PET study. Subjective assessments will be conducted at each experimental condition.</detailed_description>
