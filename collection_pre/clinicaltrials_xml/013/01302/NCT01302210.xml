	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis for the DERAIL MRSA program is that one can safely remove the colonization risk from nearly all residents (patients) in a way that does not interfere with the desired life-style for persons in these facilities and thereby reduce the risk of infection and lower the cost of care by avoiding preventable disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection, Education, Research and Decolonization Without Isolation in Long-term Care Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint will be measuring the reduction in MRSA colonization prevalence (rate) in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. One secondary endpoint is to compare the rate of MRSA disease in the intervention and control arms. The other secondary endpoint is to determine the cost of MRSA screening and decolonization and compare it to the cost of MRSA disease treatment (both medication cost and the expense of any needed hospitalization for therapy of MRSA infection therapy) in the control arm. Achieving our primary goal of MRSA control will also demonstrate two secondary goals wthe investigators aim to achieve: one being that a scientific, planned approach to the issue of specific healthcare-associated infection in LTCFs can solve these problems and the other that a partnership between acute and long-term care is beneficial in dealing with patient safety and quality practices across the United Sates Healthcare continuum.</detailed_description>
