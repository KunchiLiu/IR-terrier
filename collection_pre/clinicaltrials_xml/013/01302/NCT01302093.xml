	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess bioequivalence between two products used for treatment of acute diarrhea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Between a Racecadotril Capsule and Film-Coated Tablet (FCT) to Treat Diarrhea in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a single dose, randomized, two-way crossover study in 40 healthy subjects, with equal numbers of males and females (minimum of 18 of either gender). Drop-outs will not be replaced. The two doses of medication given in the study (a single dose in each of the two study periods) will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 calendar days. In each study period, twenty (20) blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis and, for the first 8 male and 8 female subjects included in the study (total of 16 subjects), seven (7) blood samples for pharmacodynamic analysis will be taken over 24 hours. Blood samples will be centrifuged and concentrations of thiorphan in plasma will be measured using a validated chromatographic assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from plasma concentration data. The rate and extent of absorption of the formulations will be compared.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects (equal numbers of males and females) Volunteers aged of at least 18 years but not older than 55 years Subjects will have a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 18.5 and below 30 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg Non or exsmokers; an exsmoker being defined as someone who completely stopped smoking for at least 12 months before day 1 of this study. Clinical laboratory values within the laboratory's stated normal range; if not within this range, they must be without any clinical significance Have no clinically significant diseases captured in the medical history or evidence of clinically significant findings on physical examination and/or clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, biochemistry, ECG and urinalysis) Has signed and dated the informed consent document, indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures Seated pulse rate below 45 bpm or higher than 90 bpm at screening Seated blood pressure below 90/60 mmHg or higher than 140/90 mmHg at screening Relationship to persons involved directly with the conduct of the study (i.e., principal investigator; subinvestigators; study coordinators; other study personnel; employees or contractors of the sponsor or Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiaries; and the families of each) Females who are pregnant or are lactating Females of childbearing potential or males with a female partner of childbearing potential who refuse to use an acceptable contraceptive regimen throughout the entire duration of the study History of significant hypersensitivity to racecadotril or any related products (including excipients of the formulations) as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to any drugs Use of certain drugs/medications within protocolspecified timeframes Medical history or condition that may, per protocol or in the opinion of the investigator, adversely affect the safety of the study subject or compromise study results.</criteria>
