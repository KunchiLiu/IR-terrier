	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized clinical trial of low back pain exercise programs is to determine if trunk control can be changed by core stabilization exercises. The proposed mechanism of pain reduction and functional improvement of core stabilization exercises is that it enhances trunk movement and muscle control. This study will provide preliminary evidence of the link between patient outcomes and treatment mechanisms. The investigators hypothesize that: - both treatment groups will demonstrate significant improvements in pain and function; - only subjects in the core stabilization group will demonstrate significant improvements in trunk movement and muscle control.</brief_summary>
