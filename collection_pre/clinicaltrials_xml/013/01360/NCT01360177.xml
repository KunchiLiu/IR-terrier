	<brief_summary>This is a treatment protocol designed to accompany the ongoing institutional 124I PET/CT pilot imaging study for patients with invasive breast cancer. Women whose tumors express NIS [Na+I- symporter, sodium iodide symporter] and demonstrate radioiodide uptake on 124I PET/CT scans will be eligible for 131I treatment if, (1) tumor dosimetry calculations yield a cumulative radiation dose of at least 30Gy in target tumor, (2) estimated cumulative thyroid irradiation is less than 500 cGy and, (3) the therapeutic dose of 131I is in the range of 25 to 100 mCi.</brief_summary>
