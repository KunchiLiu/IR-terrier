	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that using methylnaltrexone in addition to pain killer narcotics (opiates) in patients will result in increased tube feeding rates with more frequent nutrition at goal calorie rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Methylnaltrexone (Relistor) on Digestion and Tolerance to Tube Feeding in Patients Treated With Opiates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tube feeding rates and tube feeding residual volumes will be measured and followed blinded to the treatment arm (methylnaltrexone vs. placebo) to evaluate if patients (who prior to study entry did not tolerate goal rates tube feeds) can get closer to tube feeding goal with the treatment arm.</detailed_description>
