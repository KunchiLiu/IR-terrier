	<brief_summary>The Hereditary Ataxias are a group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive incoordination of gait and often associated with poor coordination of hands, speech, and eye movements. Current treatments for Hereditary Ataxias are mainly pharmacological, rehabilitative, or psychological treatments，while no effective treatment available. Stem Cell therapy is a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for Hereditary Ataxias treatment. In this study, the safety and efficacy of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells transplantation will be evaluated in patients with Hereditary Ataxias.</brief_summary>
