	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center cohort study in which the Real-time Tissue Elastography® measurements will predict prospectively the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, the incidence and severity of gastroesophageal varices ascites and decompensated cirrhosis in hepatitis B or C patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction of Incidence of Liver Cancer by Use of Real-time Tissue Elastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to validate the predictive value of Real-time Tissue Elastography® by comparison with serum marker or FibroScan® in chronic hepatitis B or C patients. Every year and for three years, we performed Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling, gastrointestinal endoscopy. If in the hospital they can perform FibroScan®, FobroScan® also be performed. Subjects were also performed ultrasonography (US), computed sonography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evry four or six months. The time between the Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling, gastrointestinal endoscopy and FiroScan® must not exceed four weeks.</detailed_description>
