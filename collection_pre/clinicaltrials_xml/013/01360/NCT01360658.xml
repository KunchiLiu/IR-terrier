	<brief_summary>Solar urticaria is a rare but debilitating disease that can severely impact the quality of life, restricting outdoor activities.Treatment, based on sun protection and anti-histaminic drugs, is efficacious in 2 patients out of 3. In refractory patients, photodesensitization or immunosuppressive treatments such as cyclosporin A can be proposed. As in idiopathic urticaria, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG)have been shown, in a retrospective study of 7 patients, to dramatically improve 71% of patients. In an open-label prospective multicenter study, we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of a single IVIG administration (2g/kg) in 10 patients affected with severe and refractory solar urticaria.</brief_summary>
