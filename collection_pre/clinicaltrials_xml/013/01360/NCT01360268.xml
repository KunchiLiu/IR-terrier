	<brief_summary>Rationale for this study: Correction of hypocholesteremia and insulin resistance after successful eradication of HCV by combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin has been shown in several studies. The majority of these studies examined genotype 1 and some genotype 3 patients, but it is not clear if the same results can be achieved in other genotypes of HCV. Moreover, clinical data of the relationships between different adipocytokines, metabolic profiles, and HCV and treatment is of value to further understand the mechanisms for HCVrelated metabolic alterations. The present proposal is designed to address the paradox of HCV-related metabolic alterations/adipocytokine alterations and to determine how BMI influences the HCV-related metabolic alteration/adipocytokine aterations by collecting and analyzing the samples from humans with HCV infection prior to and after combination of peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin For metabolic alternations: Lipid profile: After treatment, responders in both genotype I and II will experience more increase of cholesterol levels and LDL levels than nonresponders/ relapseres. Insulin resistance: After treatment, responders with both genotype I and II will experience more decrease of HOMA-IR than nonresponders/ relapseres; higher percentage of responders will achieve HOMA-IR &lt; 2 than nonresponders/ relapseres B. For adipocytokine alternation, this study is more of exploratory propose as there is still little well established consensus.</brief_summary>
