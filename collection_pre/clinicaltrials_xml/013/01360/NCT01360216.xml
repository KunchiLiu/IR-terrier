	<brief_title>Cluster, Randomized Trial on Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) Education and Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unintended pregnancy is extremely high in the United States among young women, and use of contraceptives with top-tier effectiveness, intrauterine contraception and implants, is low. Contraceptive providers in the US have low knowledge of current scientific evidence on LARC methods, and do not routinely include these methods in counseling patients at highest risk of unintended pregnancy. This intervention provides evidence-based education and hands-on training to clinicians and contraceptive educators in Planned Parenthood affiliated Title X clinics throughout the US on LARC methods.</detailed_description>
