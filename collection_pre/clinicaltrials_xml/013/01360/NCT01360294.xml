	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to develop a patient reported outcome tool specific to small airways disease, which assesses symptoms and signs of small airways disease and may help in addition to FEF50% to discriminate between asthmatic patients with and without small airways disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of Small Airway Disease Questionnaire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammation of the small airways contributes to the severity of the disease and affects the quality of life of patients with asthma. However, the exact role and relevance of small airways disease in asthma is still unclear. This is partly due to the difficulty of measuring small airways pathology with a sensitive and specific parameter. The most commonly used variable as an indicator of small airway obstruction is the FEF50%. Currently, it is not known which clinical symptoms are associated with small airways disease and how a patient will perceive small airway abnormalities. This knowledge is important to assess small airways disease in patients with asthma and adjust therapy to improve quality of life.The primary purpose of this study is to develop a questionnaire for patients with asthma with and without small airways disease for general and specialist practice.</detailed_description>
