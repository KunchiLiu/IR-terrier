	<brief_summary>Recent studies demonstrated that radiofrequency isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVI) is a superior alternative to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with symptomatical paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). A substantial proportion of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery also suffer from atrial fibrillation. No evidence exists if epicardial PVI is beneficial in patients with a history of AF undergoing coronary bypass surgery (CABG) for the concomitant treatment of AF. The investigators aim to establish the effectiveness of incorporating epicardial pulmonary vein isolation into elective cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
