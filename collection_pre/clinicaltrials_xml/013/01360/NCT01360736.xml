	<brief_title>A Brief Intervention to Reduce Suicide Risk in Military Service Members and Veterans - Study 2 (SAFEMIL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Mental health related hospitalizations and suicide are both significant public health problems within the United States Department of Defense (DoD). There are limited evidence-based suicide prevention interventions that have been developed for military personnel and veterans who are experiencing suicide ideation or who have made a suicide attempt. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the Safety Planning for Military (SAFE MIL) on suicide ideation, suicide-related coping, and attitudes toward help seeking for hospitalized military personnel at high suicide risk. Methodology: To test the efficacy of the adapted intervention, the investigators will randomize 186 patients to one of two conditions: Safety Planning for Military (SAFE MIL) or Enhanced Usual Care (E-CARE). The SAFE MIL condition (intervention) will consist of the Safety Planning Intervention to help the suicidal individual with a collaboratively generated personal plan to mitigate or prevent a future suicidal crisis. The E-Care will consist of the usual care patients receive at an inpatient facility during their hospitalization in addition to assessment services provided by independent evaluators who work directly with our research team. Primary outcomes include suicide ideation, suicide-related coping, and attitudes toward help-seeking [acceptability and initiation of services]. Patients in both conditions will be assessed on the dependent measures at the time of hospital admission (i.e., baseline), at the time discharge (Follow-Up Interval 1 [FU-1]), at 1-month (Follow-Up Interval 2 [FU-2]) and at 6-month (Follow-Up Interval 3 [FU-3]).</detailed_description>
