	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of EMD 1201081, a novel immunomodulatory agent that is an agonist of TLR9, in combination with 5-FU/cisplatin and cetuximab in first line treatment of patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) among the dose levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN, not suitable for local therapy. At least 1 measurable lesion either by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (according to RECIST 1.0). Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≥ 70 / Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 at trial entry. Prior systemic chemotherapy, except if given as part of a multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease which was completed more than 2 months prior to trial entry. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Medical history of diagnosed interstitial lung disease. Known hypersensitivity against any of the components of the trial treatment. Previous treatment with experimental or nonapproved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting therapy or experimental or nonapproved EGFR signal transduction inhibitors (prior treatment with cetuximab is allowed). Relevant cardiovascular comorbidities. Concomitant chronic systemic immune therapy, or hormonal therapy as cancer therapy, steroid use ≥ 10 mg prednisone equivalent. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, active hepatitis C, or active hepatitis B.</criteria>
