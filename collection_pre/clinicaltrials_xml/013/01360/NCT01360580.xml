	<brief_summary>Epidemiology study for evaluation of incidence of swallowing disorders (SD) after prolonged invasive ventilation (more than seven days), using a clinical statement. All consecutive patients are screened, and clinical evaluation is performed during 48h after patient's extubation. If a SD exist, a new evaluation is realized 48h after. Three groups will be created (1.no SD, 2.transitory SD and 3.persistent SD (eg persistent after 48h)). Data complementary are notified at day 28 (pneumonia? nutritional status?)</brief_summary>
