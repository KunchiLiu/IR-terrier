	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate two methods of starting basal insulin to see which method may achieve a faster-to-goal titration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Two Initial Dosing Formulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current recommended starting dose of basal insulin in type 2 diabetes is either a fixed dose, e.g. 10 U, or a weight-based formulas, 0.1-0.2 U/kg. The estimate of eventual titration dose to attempt to reach a fasting glucose goal is 0.49 U/kg. Those many weeks of dosage upward titration are required. The investigators propose to compare the current recommended weight based, 0.1 U/kg to a correction factor derived formula. Starting with an insulin tolerance test estimation of basal dose, one would arrive at the eventual titrated basal insulin dose in significantly less days than starting at a starting dose estimate of 0.1 U/kg. Further, there would be no significant increase in overall reported hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
