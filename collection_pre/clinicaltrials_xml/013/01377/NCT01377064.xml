	<brief_summary>Because of advances in drug treatment, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are living longer, but are also at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Exercise and increased physical activity can reduce the risk factors for these diseases in PLWHA, but no studies have tested an at-home exercise program that would benefit low income people and others who do not have access to exercise facilities. This study will test the feasibility of an at-home exercise program for PLWHA and prepare for a full-scale intervention study, which may lead to a reduction in CVD risk among PLWHA.</brief_summary>
