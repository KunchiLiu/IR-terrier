	<brief_summary>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) undergo multiple painful procedures such as Botulinum toxin (BTX) injections that are administered several times a year. While clown care reduces preoperative anxiety, its effect on painful procedures has not been assessed. We hypothesized that medical clowning reduces pain and anxiety during BTX injections.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty five children with CP (mean age 7.4±4.8 years; 19 boys), enrolled in this randomized controlled study underwent BTX injections (3±1.7 muscles per procedure). Prior to treatment each child was assigned to receive either medical clown intervention (study) or standard care (control). Outcome measure was the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as reported by the child (n =14) or parent (n =11) prior and subsequent to each procedure.</detailed_description>
