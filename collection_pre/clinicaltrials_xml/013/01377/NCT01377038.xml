	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relative efficacy of a centrally-acting analgesic (duloxetine) versus a peripherally acting analgesic (topical diclofenac) for pain and associated symptom management in knee osteoarthritis. Secondary objectives include the determination of which self-report and experimental pain measures best differentiate those who respond better to duloxetine than diclofenac.</brief_summary>
