	<brief_summary>The core and extension studies assessed the safety and efficacy of secukinumab when added to a background therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are intolerant to or have had an inadequate response to anti-TNF-α agents. Patients received either secukinumab, placebo. The core study was completed. However, the extension study was terminated early (unrelated to safety) due to the results of study AIN457F2309, which indicated the efficacy of AIN457 was not comparable to the currently available RA treatment, abatacept, thus leading to closing of the AIN457 RA program.</brief_summary>
