	<brief_title>COMMunication and Education for the New CPAP Experience</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but adherence is poor. CPAP adherence interventions to date have been met with limited success. Intervention strategies would be optimized by added support for patients and alternative strategies for intervention delivery. Significant others (SO) are likely to exert positive and negative effects on the patient's adoption and use of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and are frequently described as the greatest source of social support for patients with chronic illness. Beginning the intervention before PAP initiation would capitalize on the teachable moment shortly following diagnosis when education and social support may be most essential. The aims of the research plan are to examine the effects of a couple-oriented education and support intervention on patient- and partner-reported outcomes as compared to a patient-oriented education and support intervention and usual care and to examine the relationship between PAP adherence and patients' and partners' sleep quality and daytime functioning. Patients in the pilot study will be randomized to the couple-oriented intervention, patient-oriented intervention, or standard clinical care group.</detailed_description>
