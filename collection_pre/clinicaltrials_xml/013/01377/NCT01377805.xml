	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis patients commonly develop generalized ventricular dilation with or without cerebral atrophy over time. Case studies in the literature have noted some multiple sclerosis patients develop the typical "normal pressure hydrocephalus" triad of dementia, gait disturbance and incontinence which were responsive to shunts. Many patients with connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) develop Multiple Sclerosis and studies indicate that in the Multiple Sclerosis population, there exists over 10% more Ehlers-Danlos patients than in the normal population. Because studies are indicating a form of external communicating hydrocephalus in the Ehlers-Danlos population, the author hypothesizes the same type of hydrocephalus may occur in the Multiple Sclerosis population. To evaluate this hypothesis, investigators will retroactively evaluate the head circumference of Multiple Sclerosis patients between birth and 15 months (before the skull sutures have closed).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis patients commonly develop generalized ventricular dilation with or without cerebral atrophy over time. Case studies in the literature have noted some multiple sclerosis patients develop the typical "normal pressure hydrocephalus" triad of dementia, gait disturbance and incontinence which were responsive to shunts. Many patients with connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) develop Multiple Sclerosis and studies indicate that in the Multiple Sclerosis population, there exists over 10% more Ehlers-Danlos patients than in the normal population. Because studies are indicating a form of external communicating hydrocephalus in the Ehlers-Danlos population, the author hypothesizes the same type of hydrocephalus may occur in the Multiple Sclerosis population. To evaluate this hypothesis, investigators will retroactively evaluate the head circumference of Multiple Sclerosis patients between birth and 15 months (before the skull sutures have closed). High pressure on the brain (even if subtle) could be evidence of congenital CCSVI (cerebrospinal venous insufficiency), increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, the poor drainage of cerebral spinal fluid, or a combination of all. Retrospective examination of skull expansion is a necessary step to ascertain these possibilities, allowing for early treatment and the hope of avoidance of the neurological symptoms, and often disabling effects. It is the author's belief that "Benign External Hydrocephalus" is not a benign condition.</detailed_description>
