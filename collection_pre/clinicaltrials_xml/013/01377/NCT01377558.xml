	<brief_summary>The purposes of the study are - to determine which kind of supervised exercise intervention (aerobic endurance training versus strength endurance training versus combined aerobic endurance and strength endurance training) is more effective in improving the metabolic parameters in typ 2 diabetes patients - to investigate what kind of intervention is more successful in reduction of concomitant diseases and improving quality of life - to assess what kind of intervention induces highest effects in long term persistence of these positive changes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Different Types of Exercise Interventions in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meta-analyses which evaluated the effects of structured exercise programs in patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrate that regular physical activity improves glycosylated haemoglobin (König et al.: Resistance Exercise and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Deutsche Zeitschrift für Sportmedizin Jahrgang 62, Nr. 1 (2011): 5-9). Sigal et al. proved that either aerobic or resistance training alone improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, but the improvements are greatest with combined aerobic and resistance training (Sigal, RJ, et al.: Effects of Aerobic Training, Resistance Training, or Both on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes, Ann Intern Med. 2007 Sep 18;147(6):357-69). Therefore, aim of the current study is to compare the effects of aerobic endurance training or resistance endurance training or the combination of aerobic endurance training and resistance endurance training in diabetes type 2 patients without any other lifestyle or dietary interventions.</detailed_description>
