	<brief_summary>This study will recruit 159 HIV-infected men with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Men will be randomized to receive either oral naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol use disorder or placebo. Men with acute, recent or established HIV infection will receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) and be randomized to oral naltrexone or placebo. The purpose of this study is to see whether use of oral naltrexone improves medication compliance, and therefore HIV viral load suppression, among men with alcohol use disorder. The study will also assess the impact of oral naltrexone on alcohol use behaviors in this population.</brief_summary>
