	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether indacaterol maleate 300 micrograms (mcg) is effective in the acute treatment of COPD and in particular on reducing lung hyperinflation and dynamic volumes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Indacaterol Maleate in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) on Lung Volume and Related Dyspnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled patients: COPD of any disease severity in stable conditions. 48 hours of inhalatory drugs wash out. Evaluation: Plethysmographic test, blood gas analysis, blood pressure, cardiac frequency and Borg scale evaluation in basal condition and after 60 minutes of indacaterol maleate 300 mcg inhalation.</detailed_description>
