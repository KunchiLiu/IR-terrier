	<brief_summary>Citrate anticoagulation is associated with metabolic side effects which are linked to a portion of citrate reaching systemic circulation. Data on significance of systemic gain of citrate and its relationship to method configuration are missing. Patient might also receive certain dose of lactate as a buffer and a dose of glucose if acid-citrate-dextrose solution is used. The authors test variable methods of indirect estimate of systemic dose of citrate which would allow to quantify the metabolic input without mostly unavailable measurements of citrate levels.</brief_summary>
