	<brief_summary>This is a study that seeks to characterize data obtained from patients with a variety of lung diseases using ultrasound signals obtained from the lung tissue. A standard ultrasound instrument in the doppler mode (not the imaging mode used in examination of pregnant women for instance) is placed on the chest wall and the unique software the investigators have developed analyzes the signal reflected back from within the lung. On the basis of pilot studies performed previously the investigators expect to receive different signals from different diseases. The investigators seek to further characterize these signals to enable accurate diagnosis of different lung diseases using our technology.</brief_summary>
