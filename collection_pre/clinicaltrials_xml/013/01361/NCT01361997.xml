	<brief_title>Isopropyl Alcohol Against Chlorhexidine - Isopropyl Alcohol as Antiseptics to Prevent Hemoculture's Contamination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The develop of contaminants in blood cultures is a problem of great impact to health institutions and patients, as they represent a waste of resources, and additionally increases the patient's hospital stay. The principal source of contaminant is the bacteria in the skin flora, so the greatest way to improve the sensibility of this test is to do an optimal skin antisepsis. It has been reported that 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol is superior that other skin disinfectants, and that 70% isopropyl alcohol has a high efficacy reducing the presence of bacteria on the skin, so both antiseptics are good options for skin antisepsis.</detailed_description>
