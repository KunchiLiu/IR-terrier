	<brief_summary>The Pilot Clinical Investigation planned is a prospective, unblinded randomized pilot trial comparing sedation management using a protocol based on responsiveness with standard sedation management. The hypothesis is that responsiveness will improve a range of patient-based and economic outcomes, including the duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of coma in the ICU. The purpose of the pilot study is to gather information for designing a full study that might show the validity of the outcome hypothesis.</brief_summary>
