	<brief_summary>Recent studies on molar surgery have shown that a combination of a glucocorticoid and NSAID or COX-2 selective inhibitor gives better pain relief than either of the drugs used separately. The investigators group has also shown that adding dexamethasone on top of a regimen of paracetamol, NSAID and local anesthesia resulted in 45% painfree patients at rest after ambulatory breast cancer surgery. The goal of this study is to test the NSAID + glucocorticoid concept in ACl repair. The investigators want to evaluate whether a selective COX-2 selective inhibitor or a glucocorticoid or a combination of both drugs, as part of a multimodal analgesic regime, can provide improved pain relief and shorter hospital stay in patients undergoing outpatient ACL surgery.</brief_summary>
