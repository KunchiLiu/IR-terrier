	<brief_summary>Obesity is an epidemic in Western society and is the biggest risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The investigators have preliminary evidence showing that hyperbaric oxygen therapy rapidly increases insulin sensitivity in humans. This requires confirmation in a larger population, and with this study the investigators will also test for mechanisms how this occurs. The investigators suspect that modulation of hypoxia and stress response proteins following changes in tissue oxygenation may contribute to these improvements. This study has the potential to yield new and important insights into the insulin resistance in obesity.</brief_summary>
