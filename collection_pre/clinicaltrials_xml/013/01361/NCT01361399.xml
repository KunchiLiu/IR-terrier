	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the analgesic efficacy of a single dose of a fixed combination of 500 mg Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid) and 4 mg Lidocaine in adult patients with sore throat associated with a common cold in comparison to a single treatment with 500 mg Aspirin or 4 mg Lidocaine alone as well a Placebo (treatment without any active ingredient). The combination of Aspirin and Lidocaine in a single lozenge is expected to provide relief from sore throat pain by sequential action. A very fast inset of action will be achieved by the locally acting Lidocaine and a long duration of action will be achieved by the systemically acting Aspirin.</brief_summary>
