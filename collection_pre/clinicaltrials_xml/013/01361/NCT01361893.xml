	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this investigation is to better understand factors contributing to the high incidence of prone sleep positioning in African-American infants. In addition, the investigators are interested in investigating other races and ethinicities to understand their beliefs and perceptions and determine differences socioeconomically and socioculturally within and between groups. The investigators will address the following specific aims: (-) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in parents of higher and lower SES. (-) To identify risk factors for non-use of recommended supine sleep position in families with higher and lower SES (-) to develop a phenomenologic understanding of the decisions made by parents of higher SES and lower SES who do nt use recommended supine sleep position, using qualitative techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated prone position to be a major risk factor for SIDS. Studies have consistently demonstrated an increased rate of prone positioning in African American infants, but very little is known about the reasons why African American parents use the prone position more often than other racial groups. Furthermore, no studies have taken advantage of the observed socioeconomic status associated variablility in SIDS and prone sleeping within the African American community. By examing within-group differences, it is possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions (i.e. comparisions of white and African American) to identification of potentially modifiable factors that might respond to culturally acceptable interventions within a disadvantaged group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parents who are 18 years old wth children less than 6 months old are eligible to participate if they selfidentify as African American, with parents born in the United States. If the parent is male, not the custodial parent of the child, unable to complet the interview in English or if their child has a chronis illness that would preclude use of the supine sleep position, severe gastroesophageal reflux or recent spinal surgery.</criteria>
