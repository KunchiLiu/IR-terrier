	<brief_summary>We plan to analyze the data to meet the primary objective of the study: To characterize the change in bone mineral density (BMD), as measured by lumbar spine DEXA, during and following treatment with tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children. In addition, we plan to analyze the data to meet 2 secondary objectives of the study: 1. To study and monitor markers of bone metabolism - calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D levels, bone resorption markers (urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide and free deoxypyridinoline), bone formation markers (bone specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) - in HIV-infected children treated with tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral therapy. 2. To study immunologic, virologic and clinical effects of tenofovir DF administered to HIV-infected children in combination with other antiretroviral therapies.</brief_summary>
