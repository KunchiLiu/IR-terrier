	<brief_summary>There is an increasing number of patients with a coronary anatomy that does not allow additional revascularization procedures, while the patients suffer from angina pectoris at rest or at minimal exercise levels despite optimised medical therapy. There is a lack of therapeutic options for this group of so called "no-option patients". Goal of the project is to implement the shockwave therapy for no-option coronary artery disease patients and to evaluate its potential benefit on regional myocardial perfusion, on regional myocardial function and on the potential improvement in symptoms and quality of life.</brief_summary>
