	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether acupuncture can help to decrease the number and severity of headaches in people who have Traumatic Brain Injury. The aim of this study is to compare two different types of acupuncture—either Traditional Chinese Acupuncture or ear acupuncture—to a group that receives no acupuncture at all. Acupuncture has been demonstrated to reduce pain, improve health-related quality of life, prevent migraine headaches, and improve tension and chronic daily headaches.</brief_summary>
