	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a common, costly condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetes self-management education, the process of teaching individuals to manage their diabetes, has been considered an important part. The intensive education has the capacity to deliver effective interventions to a large number of people. The investigators may be able to redirect our efforts to diabetes care and education strategies that will have a positive impact on the optimization of glycemic control and the prevention of long-term complications of diabetes, reducing the subsequent human and health care costs.</brief_summary>
