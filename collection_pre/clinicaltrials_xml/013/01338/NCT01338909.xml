	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated, pharmacological study with a parallel design. Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention and presenting high platelet reactivity as assessed with the Verify Now P2Y12 assay-Accumetrics(Platelet Reactivity Units -PRU≥235) at 2 hours post-clopidogrel 600mg LD (Day 0), as assessed with the Verify Now P2Y12 assay, will be randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: Group Α: Clopidogrel 150mg per day,starting from Day 1 until Day 5 (5 days after randomization) Group Β: Prasugrel 60 mg immediate loading (on Day 0) followed by 10mg/day starting from Day 1 until Day 5 (5 days after randomization). Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed 2 hours after randomization (Day 0), 24 h after randomization (Day 1) and on Day 5. Documentation of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure with PCI or CABG)and serious adverse events (bleeding, other adverse events)will be performed until Day 5.</brief_summary>

History of gastrointestinal bleeding, genitourinary bleeding or other site abnormal bleeding within the previous 6 months. 12. Other bleeding diathesis, or considered by investigator to be at high risk for bleeding on thienopyridine therapy. 13. Any previous history of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage or disease (neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm). 14. Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100.000 / μL) at randomization 15. Anaemia (Hct &lt;30%) at randomization 16. Polycythaemia (Hct &gt; 52%) at randomization 17. Periprocedural IIb/IIIa inhibitors administration 18.
