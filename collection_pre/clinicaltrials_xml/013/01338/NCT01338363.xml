	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is 1. To describe patient characteristics and drug usage among children that are prescribed esomeprazole for the first time and to compare them with patients who are prescribed other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists for the first time. 2. To ascertain all incident hospitalized cases of angioneurotic oedema, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, failure to thrive, convulsions/seizures, acute interstitial nephritis and thrombocytopenia among new users in the three cohorts of esomeprazole, other PPIs and H2-receptor antagonists.</brief_summary>
