	<brief_summary>The study main objective is to assess the changes in the ventricular repolarization (measure by the delta QTcf) after drug induced stimulation, compare to placebo, in order to identify subjects with extreme responses and collecting their skin and blood samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selections of Subjects With Important Changes in Their Cardiac Repolarization Parameters for the Procurement of Skin and Blood Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An ECG is performed after a dose of sotalol on about 100 healthy subjects in order to identify about 20 extreme responders (10 high responders and 10 non responders) assessed as Delta QTcf compare to baseline. The ECG will be measured and the delta QTcf will be calculated on the 20 selected subjects in a second part of the clinical trial, cross over erythromycin/placebo.</detailed_description>
