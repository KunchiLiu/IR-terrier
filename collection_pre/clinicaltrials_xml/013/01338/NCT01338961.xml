	<brief_summary>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been used successfully for cardiac surgery for over half a century. Hypothermia became a ubiquitous practice for adult patients undergoing CPB. To date, most studies have been conducted in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients with conflicting results. Current evidence does not support one temperature management strategy for all patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of normothermic versus hypothermic CPB in valvular surgery patients.</brief_summary>
