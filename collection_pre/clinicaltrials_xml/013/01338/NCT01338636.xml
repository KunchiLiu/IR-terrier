	<detailed_description>Exercised Induce Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (EIPAH) population: These patients may provide a unique window into the pathogenesis of PAH. Our data suggest that these patients may represent an early phase of PAH with an abnormal vascular response. The study includes an assessment of the potential impact of ambrisentan on exercise capacity Advanced Level-3 CPET, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class.</detailed_description>
