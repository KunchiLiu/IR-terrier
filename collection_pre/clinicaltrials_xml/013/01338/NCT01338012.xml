	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to examine the immune response generated by sipuleucel-T in subjects previously treated with sipuleucel-T in the androgen dependent setting. The study will also assess the safety of receiving up to 3 additional infusions of sipuleucel-T. This is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study, conducted in up to 14 clinical trial sites. The anticipated duration of the study is approximately 6 years.</brief_summary>
