	<brief_summary>Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with gonadotropins is an integral part of the various stimulation protocols for patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The hormonal control of multiple follicular growth and maturation is a critical part of ART procedures since it maximizes the yield of embryos to be transferred, thus increasing the cumulative pregnancy rate. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of myo-inositol (MI) supplementation as a simple and highly effective treatment in order to improve oocyte quality in patients undergoing IVF. Indeed, it was previously shown that MI follicular fluid (FF) concentration is a reliable predictor of oocyte quality. High MI concentration in the FF directly correlates with high oocyte and embryo quality. Another stereoisomer of Inositol was successfully used into clinical practice D-chiro-inositol (DCI). In particular, DCI supplementation was used to restore ovulation in hyperglycemic PCOS patients. In the present study we aim to compare MI versus DCI supplementation on oocyte quality of women undergoing IVF-ET</brief_summary>
