	<detailed_description>In a randomized treatment design, we will compare offenders receiving skills-based intervention (TARGET) and those receiving a similar amount of supportive intervention (SGT). We will assess the efficacy of treatment by determining if those receiving the TARGET skills training show an improvement in functionality, as compared to those receiving only supportive intervention. We will measure this by analyzing PTSD symptoms, psychological distress, psychosocial functioning, and social/legal adjustment and services using structured interviews, self-report questionnaires and qualitative questions. Questionnaires are listed below in the outcome measure's section. We will collect follow-up data on program participants who successfully finish the program at York. For those offenders who discharge into the community directly from York, we will collect follow-up data on program participants through CDOC Parole or Probation records. Statistically we anticipate a medium effect size difference between the treatment conditions.</detailed_description>
