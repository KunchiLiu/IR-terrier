	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine may stop the growth of tumor cells by disrupting blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of NG-nitro-L-arginine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NG-Nitro-L-Arginine in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine if there is a differential effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) on tumor and normal tissue vasculature (blood flow/volume) in patients with advanced solid tumors in order to propose a safe recommended dose range for further evaluation. Secondary - To determine the correlation between plasma concentration of L-NNA and toxicity and vascular effects. - To further determine the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition on tumor tissue vasculature. - To determine the pharmacokinetics of L-NNA. - To determine the safety profile of L-NNA. Tertiary - To evaluate the potential pharmacodynamic effect of NOS inhibition on angiogenesis. - To evaluate the effect of L-NNA on circulating NOS levels. - To evaluate the correlation between expression levels of iNOS and eNOS and vasoconstrictive effects of L-NNA in tumor tissue (where available). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive a single dose of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) IV over 10 minutes on day 1. All patients undergo up to 6 dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT). Patients enrolled in the expanded cohort study undergo 4 additional scans of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as well as DCE-CT scans. Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and biomarker studies. Samples are analyzed for L-NNA levels via a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, NOS inhibition via cGMP analysis, and VEGF-A and osteopontin levels. Previously collected biopsy samples are analyzed for iNOS and eNOS expression. After completion of study treatment and one week assessments, patients are followed up once a week for 28 days and then monthly thereafter (if required).
