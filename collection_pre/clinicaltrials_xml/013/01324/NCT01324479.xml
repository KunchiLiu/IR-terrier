	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of INC280 in patients with solid tumors that are refractory to current treatment or for which there is not a current standard of care and whose tumors have dysregulation of the c-MET pathway.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of INC280 in Patients With c-MET Dependent Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Must have evidence of cMET dysregulation from either local data or the results of molecular prescreening evaluations. Confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor. Measureable lesion. Refractory to currently available treatment or no therapies available. 18 years or older. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Obtained written informed consent. Additional inclusion criteria for NSCLC patients EGFRwt with high cMET expression: Written documentation of EGFRwt NSCLC. Written documentation of cMET positivity. Patients should not have received more than three prior lines of antineoplastic therapy for NSCLC. Presence of at least one measurable lesion as determined by modified RECIST version 1.1 HCC with liver dysfunction greater than ChildPugh A. Previous treatment with a cMET inhibitor or HGFtargeting therapy. Symptomatic CNS metastases that are neurologically unstable or requiring increasing doses of steroids to control their CNS disease. Any CNS deficits. For patients with GBM, CNS symptoms grade 2 or greater. Subjects with significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or acute coronary syndrome) within 6 months of starting study treatment or heart attack within 12 months of starting study treatment. Receiving antiepileptic drugs that are known to be strong inducers of CYP3A4. Prior or current antiangiogenic therapy for patients with GBM. Radiation therapy within ≤ 4 weeks (&lt; 12 for GBM) prior to the first dose of study drug or limited field radiotherapy within ≤ 2 weeks (&lt; 12 weeks GBM) prior to the start of study treatment. Any persistent side effect of prior radiotherapy must be resolved to ≤ Grade 1 prior to the first dose of study drug. Additional exclusion criteria for NSCLC patients EGFRwt with high cMET expression: Patients who have received more than three prior lines of antineoplastic therapies Any unresolved toxicity (CTCAE grade &gt; 1) from previous anticancer therapy or radiotherapy, except alopecia Patients have received anticancer therapies within the following time frames prior to the first dose of study treatment: Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy: ≤4 weeks (≤6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycinC) Biologic therapy (e.g., antibodies): ≤4 weeks Noncytotoxic small molecule therapeutics: ≤5 halflives or ≤2 weeks (whichever is longer) Other investigational agents: ≤4 weeks Radiation therapy (palliative setting is allowed.): ≤4 weeks Major surgery: ≤2 weeks Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
