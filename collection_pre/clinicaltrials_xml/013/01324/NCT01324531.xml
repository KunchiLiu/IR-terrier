	<brief_title>Arthroscopic Bankart Repair With and Without Remplissage in Anterior Shoulder Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant osseous defects of the glenohumeral joint can often lead to failure of arthroscopic shoulder stabilization procedures. The best treatment in the setting of shoulder instability with significant glenoid and/or humeral defects remains controversial. Several open procedures have been suggested, but arthroscopic methods have started to garner some attention in the literature. In patients with an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion without significant glenoid bone loss, arthroscopic remplissage consisting of arthroscopic posterior capsulodesis and infraspinatus tenodesis to fill the Hill-Sachs lesion has been proposed as a novel treatment method. The authors believe it is scientifically necessary to investigate the role of addition of arthroscopic infraspinatus remplissage to the conventional arthroscopic Bankart repair. As more surgeons are trained in the technique, it will be performed more frequently. Increased patient awareness continues to lead to increasing demand for minimally invasive approaches. Arthroscopic remplissage brings with it an increase in operative time, with a theorized risk of reduction in dislocation risk. For these reasons, the authors believe that it is scientifically and fiscally necessary to determine the difference in outcome between arthroscopic Bankart repair with and without arthroscopic infraspinatus remplissage for patients with anterior shoulder instability and a Hill-Sachs defect in the framework of a prospective, randomized controlled study.</detailed_description>
