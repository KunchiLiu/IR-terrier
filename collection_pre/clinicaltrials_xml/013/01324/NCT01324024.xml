	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication called VyvanseÂ® (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) has an impact on cognitive functioning, specifically measures of sustained attention, verbal encoding and recall and working memory, in menopausal aged women. LDX is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The cognitive difficulties that menopausal women report experiencing are typical of adults who are diagnosed with ADHD. The investigators will assess whether or not LDX is effective in alleviating those cognitive disruptions when compared to a placebo.</brief_summary>
