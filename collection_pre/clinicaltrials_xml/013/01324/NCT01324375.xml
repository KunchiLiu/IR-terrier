	<brief_title>Prediction of Pain in Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The preoperative heat stimulation consists of short and long tonic heat stimulation. Pain response is evaluated with an electronic visual analog scale. Furthermore the investigators evaluate other factors possibly predictable for acute and subacute postoperative pain after total hip arthroplasty - demographic factors, preoperative pain related factors, psychosocial factors (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Pain Catastrophizing Scale).</detailed_description>
