	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of prokinetics versus antibiotics versus a combination of antibiotics plus prokinetics in the eradication of Small-Intestinal Bacterial Over-Growth Syndrome (SIBO) in those with and without a positive D-xylose Breath Test. Hypothesis: Patients with SIBO treated with a combination of prokinetics and in particular octreotide and antibiotics will have reduced recurrence rates of SIBO than either therapy given alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We want to determine whether treatment with prokinetics such as Octreotide, Azithromycin, Erythromycin or Tegaserod alone, versus antibiotics alone, or combination of antibiotics plus prokinetics results in symptomatic improvement in patients with SIBO (defined by a positive D xylose Breath test).</detailed_description>
