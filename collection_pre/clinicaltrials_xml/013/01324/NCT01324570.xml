	<brief_title>Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Efficacy of Buprenorphine Transdermal System (BTDS) in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study of safety, PK, and efficacy of BTDS in patients of ages 7 to 16 years, inclusive, who require continuous opioid analgesia for moderate to severe pain.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Buprenorphine</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria include: Male and female patients, 7 to 16 years of age, inclusive, with malignant and/or nonmalignant moderate to severe pain requiring or anticipated to require continuous, aroundtheclock, opioid treatment for at least 2 weeks (based on the investigator's judgment); Patients must have written informed consent provided by the parent or legal guardian and assent provided by the patient, when appropriate; Patients on incoming opioids must be taking ≤ 80 mg morphine or equivalent if aged 12 to 16 years or ≤ 40 mg morphine or equivalent if aged 7 to 11 years prior to initiation with BTDS treatment; Patients must be able to understand and complete the age appropriate scale to rate pain intensity, ie, patients must not have a cognitive developmental delay or any other condition that would preclude them from completing age appropriate pain scale; Patients with malignant and/or nonmalignant medical conditions causing moderate to severe pain requiring continuous, aroundtheclock opioid analgesic therapy such as cancer, sicklecell disease (eg, resulting in persistent body pain, persistent limb pain, avascular necrosis, persistent abdominal pain), persistent orthopedic pain (eg, spinal injury, spinal disc herniation, persistent limb/stump pain, major trauma), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (pain not controlled by therapy treating the underlying disease), and cystic fibrosis resulting in persistent chest pain; Patients must have a parent/caregiver who is willing and able to be compliant with the protocol, capable of patient evaluation, able to read and understand questionnaires, willing and able to use a diary, and able to read, understand, and sign the written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria include: Patients who are allergic to buprenorphine or have a history of allergies to other opioids (this criterion does not include patients who have experienced common opioid side effects [eg, nausea, constipation]); Patients who have allergies or other contraindications to transdermal delivery systems or patch adhesives; Patients with a dermatological disorder at any relevant patch application site that would preclude proper placement and/or rotation of BTDS patches; Patients with evidence of impaired renal function; Patients with hepatic impairment; Patients with history of seizures; Patients who have a history of sleep apnea within the past year; Patients with unstable respiratory disease; Patients with structural heart disease or a pacemaker; Patients with clinically unstable cardiac disease; Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unsuitable to participate in this study for any reason; Patients who receive or anticipate to receive investigational medication/therapy during study drug treatment period. Other protocolspecific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
