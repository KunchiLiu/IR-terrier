	<brief_summary>The pattern of organism causing diabetic foot infection are presumed to vary from location to location depending on the antibiotic prescription practice, geographical locations, environmental variations and therapeutic interventions for various patients. Our hypothesis is look to finding out common similarities with diversified subgroups spread across various geographical locations of eastern part of India, thus to create a data base for treating patient with diabetic foot infections.The sensitivity pattern is anticipated to be different from institution to institutions and place to place but the gross sensitivity data of local pathogen could guide physician for choosing right empirical antibiotic. Practice guideline could be postulated from the collated data of distribution of pathogens, their sensitivity pattern as well as co-morbid conditions of the sufferers.</brief_summary>
