	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Docetaxel and Oxaliplatin in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent therapeutic developments, such as the introduction of new cytotoxic agents (taxanes, platinum, liposomal anthracyclines, etc) have resulted in constant improvements in treatment efficacy and consequently in recurrent or metastatic outcome. This single arm, multicenter phase II study was designed to evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free survival of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with recurrence or metastatic breast cancer.</detailed_description>
