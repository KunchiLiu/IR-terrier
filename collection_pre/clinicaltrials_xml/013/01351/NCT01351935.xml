	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVL-292 as monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Escalating Dose Study in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is non-receptor tyrosine kinase with restricted cellular expression largely limited to B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and mast cells or basophils. Btk is a critical component of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling network and is crucial for B cell development. Investigation has revealed that some B cell lymphomas and CLL depend on BCR signaling, suggesting that interruption of such signaling could be a promising therapeutic opportunity in B-NHL, CLL and WM.</detailed_description>
