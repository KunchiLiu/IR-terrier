	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects who have undergone major surgery. Each subject's study participation consisted of a screening visit, a 2-day treatment period, and a follow-up visit. Following surgery, subjects were randomly assigned to receive intranasally (IN) ketorolac 10 mg, IN ketorolac 30 mg, or placebo when the pain intensity (PI) rating equaled at least 40 on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Thereafter, subjects received study drug every 8 hours, with the last dose given at 40 hours. For pain not relieved by the study drug, the subjects had access to morphine sulfate (MS) administered via patient controlled analgesia (PCA). The primary objective was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of multiple intranasal (IN) doses of ketorolac over 2 days. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this dosing regimen.</brief_summary>
