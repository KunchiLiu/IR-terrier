	<brief_summary>Flexible nasendoscopy involves passing a soft, thin, endoscope through the nose. This diagnostic procedure is often essential for assessment of a child by an Otolaryngologist in outpatients. The purpose of this randomized controlled double-blind study is to determine whether there is a difference in the degree of discomfort experienced by children undergoing flexible nasendoscopy, after receiving one of three different intranasal sprays: (A) placebo (isotonic saline solution), (B) decongestant (0.05% xylometazoline hydrochloride), or (C) decongestant with local anesthetic (0.05% xylometazoline hydrochloride with 1% lidocaine hydrochloride). Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the degree of reported discomfort experienced (using a validated pediatric pain score) by children undergoing flexible nasendoscopy, after receiving either intra-nasal topical placebo, decongestant, or decongestant with local anesthetic.</brief_summary>
