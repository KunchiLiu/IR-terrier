	<brief_title>A Multicenter Access and Distribution Protocol for Unlicensed Cryopreserved Cord Blood Units (CBUs)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Principal Investigators: The principal investigators (PIs) will be transplant physicians at all participating U.S. transplant centers. Study Design: This study is an access and distribution protocol for unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood units (CBUs) in pediatric and adult patients with hematologic malignancies and other indications. Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to examine the incidence of neutrophil recovery of â‰¥500/mm3 after cord blood transplantation in a multi-institution setting using CBUs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed. Secondary Objectives: In patients receiving a non-licensed CBU: - Assess incidence of transmission of infection - Assess incidence of serious infusion reaction - Determine 1 year overall survival after cord blood transplantation - Assess cumulative incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and grades III to IV - Assess cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD - Determine platelet engraftment of &gt;20,000 mcL and &gt;50,000 mcL</detailed_description>
