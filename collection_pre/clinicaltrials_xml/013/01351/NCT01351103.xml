	<criteria>Diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic cancer that has progressed despite standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy exists and histological confirmation of one of the following diseases indicated below: Single Agent Dose escalation part:documented BRAF mutant colorectal cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, tumors of any histological origin with documented genetic alterations upstream in the Wnt signaling pathway are eligible with prior agreement with Novartis. Single Agent Dose expansion part: documented BRAF mutant colorectal cancer with documented RNF43 mutation and/or RSPO fusion or pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented RNF43 mutation. In addition, patients with tumors of any histological origin with documented genetic alterations upstream in the Wnt signaling pathway (e.g. RNF43 or RSPO fusion) are eligible with prior agreement with Novartis LGK974 with PDR001: Dose escalation: melanoma patients primary refractory to antiPD1 inhibitor. Dose expansion: patients with pancreatic cancer, or TNBC, or melanoma, or head and neck cancer. Impaired cardiac function Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral LGK974 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection) Brain metastases that have not been adequately treated Malignant disease other than that being treated in this study Laboratory abnormalities as specified in the protocol Osteoporosis, severe or untreated osteopenia Bone fractures within the past year Pathologic bone fracture Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease or severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
