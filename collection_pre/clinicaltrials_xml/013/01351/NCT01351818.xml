	<brief_summary>To assess the influence of exogenous GH (growth hormone) administration on adipocyte endocrine function (leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and on ghrelin secretion in children with delayed growth due to GH deficiency. Study hypothesis: hormones produced by the adipocyte (leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and ghrelin may exert a certain control on production of GH and IGF-I, and GH may in turn have a regulatory effect on such hormones.</brief_summary>
