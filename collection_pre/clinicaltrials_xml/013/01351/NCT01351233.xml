	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Rotational Stability of The AcrySof Toric Intraocular Lens in the Capsular Bag in High Myopic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to numerous estimations, 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have≥1.5 diopters (D) of refractive astigmatism. New toric IOL designs (Acrysof © toric IOL; Alcon), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the end of 2005, have been found to be more stable and safety in the capsular bag in subjects with normal axis length of eye. Then,this study aims at the confirmation of the stability of The AcrySof Toric intraocular lens in the bag in high myopic subjects.Then we may find a more effective treatment for the high myopic patients with complicated cataract and sever cornea astigmatism .</detailed_description>
