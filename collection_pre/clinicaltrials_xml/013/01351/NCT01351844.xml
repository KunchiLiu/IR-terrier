	<brief_summary>Patients have been asked to participate in the CEASE study because their treating oncologist has recommended that they start an aromatase inhibitor medication. These medications are associated with joint complaints. The purpose of this study is to see whether a computer-based educational module is a feasible intervention to help address these symptoms. If the patients agree to participate, a research coordinator will test their grip strength and give them a computer log-on code. They will be shown how to log-on to complete the educational module and a few simple questionnaires. Patients have the option to do this from home if they wish. In 3 months time, the investigators will ask patients to return to the clinic and have another grip strength evaluation and complete some additional questionnaires. The computer module and the follow up visit will each take about 30 minutes of time.</brief_summary>
