	<brief_summary>Underinflation and overinflation of tracheal cuff are common in intubated patients, including those intubated with polyurethane-cuffed tubes. The aim of this study is to determine the efficiency of a pneumatic device in controlling cuff pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Control of Polyurethane Tracheal-cuff Pressure: Efficiency of a Pneumatic Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Underinflation and overinflation of tracheal cuff are associated with severe complications such as microaspiration of contaminated secretions, and tracheal ischemia. Efficient control of cuff pressure would probably allow reducing complications related to variations in cuff pressure.</detailed_description>
