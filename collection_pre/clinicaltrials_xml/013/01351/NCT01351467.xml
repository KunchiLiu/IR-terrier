	<detailed_description>23andMe has created a web-based Parkinson's research initiative to understand the genetic associations found between Parkinson's patients' DNA and their disease. To learn more, visit: https://www.23andme.com/pd/. You can participate in this research initiative without leaving home. If you are eligible to participate, we will send you an in-home 23andMe DNA kit at no cost. We will ask you short online surveys (15-20) about your Parkinson's journey, symptoms, and response to treatment. Enrollment is on-going and open to individuals who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and are residents of the U.S. Participants receive access to ancestry information and uninterpreted genetic data. Participants will also receive regular updates on our research efforts and findings.</detailed_description>
