	<brief_summary>A trial to improve the quality of life of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by evaluating the symptomatic improvements in lung cancer patients receiving external radiation with or without high dose internal radiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Evaluate the Improvement in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation With or Without Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with advanced NSCLC to compare the added benefit of High Dose Rate Intraluminal Brachytherapy (HDRIB) with External Beam Radiation (EBR). Benefit will be assessed by measuring the proportion of patients who achieve symptomatic improvement in lung cancer symptoms.</detailed_description>
