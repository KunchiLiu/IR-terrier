	<brief_summary>This study aims to explore the effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on breast cancer-related lymphedema when utilized in conjunction with Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) when compared to CDT treatment alone. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of LLLT to CDT will result in statistically significant improvements and greater long-term benefits as measured by changes in arm volume and girth, pain levels, tissue texture, symptoms experienced, and quality of life when compared to the benefits of CDT alone for the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.</brief_summary>
