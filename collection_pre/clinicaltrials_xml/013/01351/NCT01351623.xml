	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called carfilzomib. It is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor. Proteasome breaks down proteins that are no longer useful to the cell. When the proteasome is turned off by a drug (like carfilzomib), useless proteins cannot be broken down. Instead the proteins build up and cause the cell to die. Myeloma cells make a lot of protein and are especially in need of a functional proteasome to survive. Carfilzomib is not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration to treat myeloma. It is considered an experimental drug. Previous studies have shown that carfilzomib is safe to use. This study will look at what the effects, good and/or bad, carfilzomib has on myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in this study. Patients meeting the criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma that has relapsed or is refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy. Previous therapy with bortezomib. Previous therapy with thalidomide or lenalidomide. Patients must have measurable disease and therefore must have at least one of the following: Serum Mprotein ≥1 gm/dL (≥10 gm/L) Urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 hr Serum FLC assay: involved FLC ≥10 mg/dL (≥100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal. Age ≥ 18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Adequate hepatic function, with serum ALT ≤ 3.5 times the upper limit of normal and serum direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (34 µmol/L) within 14 days prior to enrollment Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L within 14 days prior to enrollment Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (80 g/L) within 14 days prior to enrollment (participants may be receiving red blood cell [RBC] transfusions in accordance with institutional guidelines) Platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L (≥ 30 × 109/L if thought to be secondary to myeloma involvement of the bone marrow ) within 14 days prior to enrollment (platelet transfusions are allowed) Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 15 mL/minute within 14 days prior to enrollment, either estimated or calculated using a standard formula (eg, Cockcroft and Gault) Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing and to practice contraception. Male participants must agree to practice contraception. Prior treatment with carfilzomib.

Concurrent malignancies, except for treated nonmelanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ. Significant neuropathy (Grades 34, ) within 14 days prior to enrollment Known history of allergy to Captisol® (a cyclodextrin derivative used to solubilize carfilzomib) Contraindication to any of the required concomitant drugs or supportive treatments, including options, antiviral drugs, or intolerance to hydration due to preexisting pulmonary or cardiac impairment Concurrent therapy with any other anticancer therapeutic with activity against multiple myeloma Concurrent therapy with investigative agents (e.g., antibiotics or antiemetics)</criteria>
