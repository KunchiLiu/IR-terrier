	<brief_summary>Following arthroscopic shoulder surgery a small but significant number of people suffer severe postoperative pain. This study aims to predict which patients are at risk of developing severe post operative pain so that they may be targeted with a more aggressive post operative pain regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction Of Post Operative Pain Following Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presenting for elective (day case) arthroscopic shoulder surgery for either Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression (ASD Group) or Rotator Cuff Repair (RCR Group) are recruited. Using a Cefar PainMatcher, a pain and sensory threshold assessment tool, consenting patients will have their preoperative pain thresholds recorded. The patients will then have a standard anaesthetic administered with TIVA (propofol/remifentanil) and either a subacromial injection (ASD Group) or interscalene block (RCR Group). Four days following surgery a telephone questionnaire will be completed by the patients recording their worst pain score since surgery.</detailed_description>
