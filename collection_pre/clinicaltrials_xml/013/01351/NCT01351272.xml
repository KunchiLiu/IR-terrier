	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will measure the functional brain activity of adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients, genotyped according to the COMT genotype, during a Working Memory Paradigm, before and after a placebo controlled treatment with MPH for 6 WEEKS. Within this design, the investigators will be able to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MPH treatment on cognitive functions.</brief_summary>
