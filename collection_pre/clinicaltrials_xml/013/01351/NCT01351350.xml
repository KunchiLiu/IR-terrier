	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of MLN0128 in Combination With Paclitaxel, With/Without Trastuzumab, in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label study consisting of a dose escalation phase in advanced solid malignancies to determine the MTD of oral administration of MLN0128 in 1 or more dosing schedules, combined with paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, followed by an expansion phase for further safety and preliminary efficacy. Once the MTD is determined for each of the dosing schedules evaluated, a dose and schedule will be selected for the expansion phase, which may enroll subjects into 2 arms in parallel: - Arm A will consist of HER2-/unknown cancer subjects receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel - Arm B will consist of HER2+ cancer subjects receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel plus weekly trastuzumab</detailed_description>
