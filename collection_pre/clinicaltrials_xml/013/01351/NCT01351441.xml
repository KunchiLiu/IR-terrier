	<brief_summary>It has been shown that patients can improve their safety through informed choice, safe medication use, and complication reporting. This includes not only the potential problems that occur from prescription medication use but also issues that may arise through the improper use of over-the-counter medications. The willingness of a patient to take on safety action is known to be complicated by an unwillingness to behave in a manner that might challenge a physician's judgment or actions. Community pharmacists are in the unique position to provide perspective on the physician's recommendation and act as an advocate to facilitate necessary change. Through supportive and repeated interaction with their community pharmacist patients will develop assertiveness toward their own health care, an increased frequency and quality of interaction with their physician, and thus a minimized risk of harm and maximized opportunity to optimize clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimizing Risk and Maximizing Outcomes in Geriatric Patients Through Integrated Clinical Pharmacy Services in an Innovative Model of Community Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, observational study to determine if geriatric patients who are on five or more chronic medications will have a difference in clinical, humanistic, and/or economic outcome through an integrated clinical pharmacy service intervention. The primary efficacy objective will be assessed through a single cohort, paired research design measuring the change from baseline in the adherence rate, number of medication related problems, and Beers criteria medications. The primary economic objective will be assessed through prescription revenue to validate the employment of a 0.5-1.0 Full-time equivalent (FTE). Secondary efficacy objectives will be assessed through a single cohort, paired research design measuring the change from baseline in the health literacy, optimization in the anthropometrics, and health related quality of life (HRQOL).</detailed_description>
