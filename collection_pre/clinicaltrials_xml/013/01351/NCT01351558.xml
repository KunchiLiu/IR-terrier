	<brief_summary>There is ample evidence that exercise therapy is beneficial with respect to pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the pain relieving mechanisms are unknown. To enhance the efficacy of exercise therapy a deeper understanding of the involved mechanisms is needed. Different exercise types may affect the pain sensitivity differently. It is hypothesized that non-specific exercises (i.e. exercises that does not involve the knee) reduces the processing of pain in the central nervous system (central sensitivity) to knee joint pain in healthy subjects. It is also hypothesized that exercises that involve the knee (i.e. specific knee exercises) reduce the sensitivity of pain receptors in the knee (peripheral sensitivity) in healthy subjects. Healthy volunteers are recruited and randomised to one of four interventions: 1: Muscle strengthening exercises involving the thigh muscles; 2: Muscle strengthening exercises involving the shoulder muscles; 3: Cardio-vascular fitness exercises; or 4: Control (no exercises). The active interventions include exercises three times per week for 12 weeks. Pain sensitivity and a range of explanatory variables is measured before the interventions, after 4 weeks and after 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
