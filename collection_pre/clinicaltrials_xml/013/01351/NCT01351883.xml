	<brief_title>Enteric Immune-nutrition Formula (ANOM®) for Patients Receiving Major Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Perioperative usage of immunonutrition can attenuate the pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce postoperative infectious complications and length of hospital stay after major upper gastrointestinal surgery. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of immunomodulating diets, ANOM®, on surgical outcome in elective major upper gastrointestinal tract operations. Material and Methods: Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Participants: Seventy upper gastrointestinal tract cancer patients planned to undergo major upper gastrointestinal surgery in eesophagus、stomach、pancreas or duodenum, Interventions: Patients will be divided randomly into two groups to receive ANOM® or standard diet. Before surgery, 800ml ANOM® or standard diet (SEN) will be given for 5 days by mouth. After operation, 5% Distill water (D5W) combined with ANOM® or standard diet since the 2nd post-operation day (POD2) until day 14 (POD14) or until discharged day by enteric route using nasogastric tube(NG) tube or jejunostomy. Postoperative parenteral nutrition will be given to maintain adequate nutrition. Clinical Assessment: The preoperative and postoperative immunological parameters, infection complications, and hospital stay will be compared.</detailed_description>
