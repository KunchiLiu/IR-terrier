	<brief_summary>Primary Aim 1: Examine effectiveness of the Oh Happy Day Class (OHDC) compared to the Coping With Depression (CWD)in increasing retention, adherence, engagement, satisfaction, and treatment-seeking. The investigators hypothesize the OHDC compared to the CWD will result in greater increases in: 1a. retention, 1b. adherence, 1c. engagement, and 1d. satisfaction at the middle and end of the intervention, and 2.e. greater increase in treatment-seeking 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12- months post-intervention. Outcome measures: logs: attendance, homework completion, class-participation level; Client Satisfaction Inventory; and Cornell Service Index. Primary Aim 2: Examine effectiveness of the OHDC in reducing symptoms of depression at the middle and immediate end of the intervention, and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12- months post-intervention. The investigators hypothesize the OHDC will result in greater reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the CWD at 3-months post-intervention. Outcome measures: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms. Secondary Aim 3: Examine the effectiveness of the OHDC in improving self-reports of mental and physical health status and reducing self-reports of perceived disability. The investigators hypothesize the OHDC compared to the CWD will result in greater self-report of: 3a. improved mental and physical health status, and 3b. reduced self-report of disability at the immediate end of the intervention and 3-,6-, 9-, 12- months post-intervention. Outcome measures: SF-12 Health Survey, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Public Health Impact: Based on CAI research, the OHDC has the potential to be four times more effective than the CWD. If our hypotheses are proven, the OHDC will be the first evidence-based culturally adapted depression intervention designed specifically for African American men and women between the ages of 30-60.</brief_summary>

Selfidentified AfricanAmerican men and women, between the ages of 30 to 60, with symptoms of depression as evidenced by data from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 (CIDI). Although age of inclusion is broad, our pilot studies have shown positive outcomes with mixed aged groups Exclusion criteria. Individuals will be excluded from the study if they have: (1) selfreported alcohol or other drug abuse/dependence, (2) major psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia as evidenced by results of the CIDI, (3) selfreported changes in antidepressants (dosage or type) less than 6 weeks prior to participating in the study, (4) selfreport of current psychotherapy treatment, or (5) selfreport of current suicidal ideations (our psychiatrist will conduct additional suicide risk assessment and facilitate referral for appropriate care.</criteria>
