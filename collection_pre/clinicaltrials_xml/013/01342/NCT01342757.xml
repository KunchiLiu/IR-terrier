	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is studying magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in predicting response in patients to vorinostat and temozolomide in patients with recurrent, progressive, or newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vorinostat may also help temozolomide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Imaging procedures, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, may help measure the patient's response to vorinostat and temozolomide and allow doctors to plan better treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging in Predicting Response to Vorinostat and Temozolomide in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the strength of the association between magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging measurable biomarkers and response to vorinostat plus temozolomide. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate MRS-detected inositol and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels (at 3 tesla) as indicators of mood alterations as measured by a self-report depression survey (IDS-SR). OUTLINE: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to -1 (course 1 only) and days 8-14 and 22-28 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients previously treated with standard radiotherapy and temozolomide receive maintenance temozolomide PO on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Patients undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging at baseline and at approximately 1 and 8 weeks on treatment. Patients also undergo an Inventory of Depression Symptomatology Self-Reported (IDS-SR) assessment at baseline and periodically during study.</detailed_description>
