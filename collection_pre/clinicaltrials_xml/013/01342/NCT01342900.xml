	<brief_summary>Monitoring and optimizing tissue oxygenation (StO2) in high-risk surgery and/or high-risk surgical patients may decrease the risk of postoperative complications. Tissue hypoxia occurs frequently during high-risk surgery in high-risk patients. The investigators want to see if an algorithm aimed at optimizing intraoperative tissue oxygenation reduces perioperative complications as well as length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS), 28-day mortality, and the duration of mechanical ventilation in these patients.</brief_summary>
