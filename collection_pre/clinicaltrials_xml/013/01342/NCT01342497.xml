History of severe hypersensitivity or ongoing hypersensitivity that might affect the patient's suitability for the study (e.g. hypersensitivity to wound dressings), as judged by the investigator. History of allergy to, or insensitivity to, local anaesthetics Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed (overthecounter) medication, including herbal medication (e.g., St. Johns Wort) that could possibly interfere with the objectives of this study (e.g., could affect the closure of chronic dermal ulceration), during 2 weeks (or 5 halflives of the compound whichever is the longer) before the anticipated first dose of study medication. Occasional paracetamol for pain relief (maximum 2 g per 24 hours) and adrenergic nasal spray for relief of nasal congestion are allowed Having received BBR012 or isoniazid within the 6 months prior to the screening visit Bleeding disorder or history of increased bleeding</criteria>
