	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research trial is studying biomarkers in samples from young patients with soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Samples From Young Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify the key components of driver pathways of primary and secondary soft tissue sarcomas. - To perform the next-generation sequencing on primary versus normal on undifferentiated sarcomas. OUTLINE: Genomic DNA and RNA samples from undifferentiated sarcoma tumors are analyzed by next-generation sequencing for somatic mutations. Normal matched lymphocytes and tissue are also analyzed.</detailed_description>
