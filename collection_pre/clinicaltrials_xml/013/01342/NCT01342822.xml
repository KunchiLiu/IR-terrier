	<brief_summary>The PROMUS Element™ clinical trial (PLATINUM-PLUS) consists of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the European Union (EU) which will enroll approximately 2980 subjects (2:1 randomization PROMUS Element™: Xience™ Prime) in a Population of consecutive, all comers in the reimbursed indications per-country All subjects will be screened per the protocol required inclusion/exclusion criteria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Assess the Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element) for Coronary Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PLATINUM-PLUS trial will investigate in a broad patient and lesion population, the CE Mark approved PROMUS Element™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element), which combines the Element™ stent (the latest generation stent from Boston Scientific Corporation [BSC, Natick, Massachusetts, United States]), everolimus, and the poly (n butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) and poly (vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) polymers. The PROMUS Element, received CE Mark on November 3rd 2009; it is currently under investigation in the PLATINUM clinical trial, and has great promise as it combines BSC's novel stent technology with the everolimus drug and polymers that have demonstrated excellent performance in the SPIRIT clinical program. PROMUS Element comprises the following key components: everolimus, 2 polymers, and the Element stent component. The same everolimus and polymer combination is commercially available in many countries on the MULTI-LINK VISION™ stent. It is manufactured and distributed by Abbott as the XIENCE™ V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE V), and also distributed by BSC as the identical stent system, also manufactured by Abbott, as the PROMUS™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS). The names XIENCE V and PROMUS are used synonymously within this protocol. While PROMUS Element is a new DES system, its constituent parts are either approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, i.e., drug and polymers from PROMUS, P070015), are under investigation in an FDA-approved trial (i.e., Element stent component in the PERSEUS trial, G060237), or have received an approvable letter from the FDA. The balloon component material of the PROMUS Element delivery system is the same as that used in TAXUS Liberté (P060008), which received an approvable letter on February 11, 2008. The PROMUS Element stent delivery system is from the Apex™ Monorail™ PTCA Dilatation Catheter (P860019/S208), which received an approvable letter on October 24, 2006. Table 1 compares the TAXUS Express2, TAXUS Liberté, and PROMUS Element stent systems.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria 1. The patient must be ≥18 of age 2. Symptomatic ischemic heart disease (CCS class 14, Braunwald Class IB, IC, and/or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia); 3. Acceptable candidate for CABG; 4. The patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations; 5. The patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics Committee (MEC). Angiographic Inclusion criteria: 6. Single or multiple native coronary artery or saphenous vein graft lesions in single or multiple vessels; 7. Patients with multilesion or multivessel coronary disease may undergo staged (planned) procedures within 30days of the index procedure. 8. Reference vessel diameter must be ≥2.25 to ≤ 4.25 mm by visual estimate. 1. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test; 2. Patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated; 3. Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer, known malignancy , congestive heart failure, organ transplant recipient or candidate) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than 1 year); 4. Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, prasugrel, platinum chromium alloy, everolimus, and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated; 5.
