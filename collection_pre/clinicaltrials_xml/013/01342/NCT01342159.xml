	<brief_summary>One of the most frequent complications of diabetic retinopathy is diabetic macular edema. Recently, intravitreal bevacizumab and intravitreal triamcinolone were the most popular therapeutic modalities. However, as the long term effects of intravitreal bevacizumab and intravitreal triamcinolone on visual acuity and macular thickness have not been compared, it was the purpose of the present study to compare these treatment effects</brief_summary>
