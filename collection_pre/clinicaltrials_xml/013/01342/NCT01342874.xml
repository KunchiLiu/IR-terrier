	<brief_summary>Objective: Insulin resistance during normal pregnancy and in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are unknown. New criteria are based on fasting glucose levels since the beginning of pregnancy. Inositol, a putative second messenger of insulin, correlates with the degree of insulin resistance. Dietary supplementation of inositol improves insulin resistance in patients with GDM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Outcomes Associated With Inositol Dietary Supplementation in Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: A randomized double-blind study was carried out in women with GDM. Patients were randomly exposed to inositol and placebo. Increase of BMI, blood glucose at 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fetal and neonatal adverse outcome, and insulin treatment were correlated to inositol exposure.</detailed_description>
