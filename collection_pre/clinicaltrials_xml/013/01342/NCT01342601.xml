	<brief_summary>Ectoin acts on membranes by forming an Ectoin-Hydro-Complex therewith providing a protection against external agents like aeroallergens. The effects of Ectoin containing nasal spray and eye drops have already been demonstrated in several studies with adult Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR) patients and it was shown that they can effectively reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis without resulting in any significant adverse events. The aim of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Ectoin Nasal Spray and Ectoin Eye Drops in pediatric and adolescent SAR patients. It is assumed that Ectoin containing products show an excellent safety profile and very good tolerability together with a potent efficacy in the treatment of SAR.</brief_summary>
