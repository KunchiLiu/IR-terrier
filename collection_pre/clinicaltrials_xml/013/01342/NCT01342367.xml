	<criteria>Age &gt; or = 70 years and/or Charlson comorbidity index score &gt; or = 2 Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma Two or more of the following intermediate risk features for recurrence, Gleason Score = 7, PSA 1020 ng/ml, Clinical Stage T2bT2c Percent positive biopsy cores &gt; or = 50% One or more of the following high risk features for recurrence, Gleason Score 810, PSA &gt; 20 ng/ml, Clinical Stage T3aT4 Clinically negative lymph nodes as established by imaging, nodal sampling, or dissection No evidence of bone metastases on bone scan History/physical examination via the Charlson Comorbidity Index within 60 days prior to registration Zubrod Performance Status 02 Age &gt; or = 18 Baseline serum PSA within 60 days prior to registration Baseline serum testosterone obtained within 60 days prior to registration Study entry PSA and serum testosterone must not be obtained during the following time frames, 10day period following prostate biopsy, following initiation of oral androgen manipulation, within 30 days after discontinuation of finasteride or dutasteride CBC/ differential obtained within 60 days prior to registration with adequate bone marrow function Patient must be able to provide studyspecific informed consent prior to study entry Liver function parameters as follows, Total Bilirubin &lt; or = 2 x institutional upper limit of normal, AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) &lt; or = 2 x institutional upper limit normal Prior radical surgery (prostatectomy), highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or cryosurgery for prostate cancer Prior hormonal therapy, such as LHRH agonists (e.g., goserelin, leuprolide), antiandrogens (e.g., flutamide, bicalutamide), estrogens (e.g., DES), or bilateral orchiectomy Use of 5alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) specifically prescribed for the treatment of prostate cancer Prior or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer; prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is permitted Prior radiation, including brachytherapy, to the region of the prostate that would result in overlap of RT fields Active lupus or scleroderma Severe, active comorbidity, including but not limited to,unstable angina within the last 6 months without subsequent corrective cardiovascular procedure,or acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Hepatic insufficiency with AST, ALT, or Bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal,clinical jaundice, and/or coagulation defects Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol.Patients who are HIV seropositive but do not meet criteria for diagnosis of AIDS are eligible for study participation</criteria>
