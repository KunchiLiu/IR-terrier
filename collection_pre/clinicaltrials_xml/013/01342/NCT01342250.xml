	<brief_summary>Although liver transplantation provide a option to cure patients suffering with decompensated liver cirrhosis this condition, lack of donors, postoperative complications, especially rejection, and high cost limit its application. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have been shown to replace hepatocytes in injured liver, effectively rescued experimental liver failure and contributed to liver regeneration, which suggest the novel and promising therapeutic strategy In this study, the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) transplantation for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
