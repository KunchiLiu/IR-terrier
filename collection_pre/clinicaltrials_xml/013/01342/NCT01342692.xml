	<brief_summary>In order to improve the overall survival benefit observed with AZA in higher risk MDS, its combination with other active drugs in MDS must be tested. Among drugs that have demonstrated to be active as a single agent in MDS and have preclinical potential additive or synergistic activity with AZA are Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors including Valproic acid, Lenalidomide and idarubicin. Phase I studies have already been conducted or are being conducted combining those agents to demethylating agents, showing a low toxicity profile and significant responses in high risk MDS. In this phase II randomized trial, we want to identify the most promising combination of Azacitidine and another drug (among 3 drugs: Valproic acid, Lenalidomide and Idarubicin) in higher risk MDS, by comparison to Azacitidine alone. Of note, based on efficacy and toxicity, one or several combinations may be stopped, and others, previously tested in phase I trials, included after protocol amendment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Best Promising Drug Association With Azacitidine in Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this phase II randomized trial is to identify, among 3 combinations of Azacitidine and another drug evaluated simultaneously, the most promising combination(s) for the treatment of higher risk MDS (IPSS Int-2 and High) compared to Azacitidine alone. The 3 tested drugs in combination with Azacitidine are: Valproic Acid, Lenalidomide and Idarubicin. The aim of this trial is to identify, in a situation where several potentially interesting drugs tested in combination with AZA exist, the most promising combination(s) based on efficacy compared to azacitidine alone, based on a two-stage design that allows a formal efficacy comparison between the K=3 investigational treatment groups and the control group.</detailed_description>
