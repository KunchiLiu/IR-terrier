	<brief_title>Different Ribavirin Dosages and Different Duration of Treatment in Combination With PegInterferon in Patients With Genotype 2 and 3 (WRITE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are going to compare weight-based dosages of ribavirin, in combination with Peginterferon alpha-2a, with standard fixed dosages of 800 mg. Patients will be evaluated at week 4 with an assay of sensitivity of 15 IU/ml. Patients with week 4 response will discontinue treatment at week 12 in both arms. Patients with HCV RNA still detectable at week 4 and receiving 1000-1200 mg of ribavirin in arm A will discontinue treatment at week 24, whereas patients with HCV RNA still detectable at week 4 and receiving 800 mg of ribavirin in arm B will be treated till week 48. A standard treatment arm (C) including patients treated for 24 weeks with Peginterferon alpha-2a and fixed 800 mg ribavirin dosage will be used as control arm.</detailed_description>
