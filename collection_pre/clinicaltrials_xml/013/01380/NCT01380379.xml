	<brief_summary>Previous research has shown that self-defense training can lead to gains in women's assertiveness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and physical competence, and decreases in anxiety, helplessness, fear, and avoidant behaviors. However, most of this research has been conducted with healthy women who had not previously experienced physical or sexual violence. The investigators believe that women with such trauma histories require additional care because of potential triggering symptoms. As such, the investigators are mindful of the potential for triggering trauma symptoms and will work with the women so that they feel safe and comfortable in their participation. This pilot study aims to examine whether similar psychological gains from self-defense training are made in women who have previous experiences of physical and/or sexual violence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Defense Training in Women With Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a high rate of violence against women in the United States. For example, at least 1 in 6 women will experience an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime (Tjaden &amp; Thoenees, 2000). The high physical, emotional, economic and social costs of such violence are staggering. In particular, there can be a serious impact on mental health, with both immediate and long-term consequences (e.g., Coker et al., 2000). The aim of this project is to examine the psychological benefits of a class, which incorporates psychological and physical self-defense skills, for women who have been the victim of sexual or physical violence. A small literature suggests that women who take self-defense classes have increases in general self-efficacy and self-esteem (e.g.,Ozer and Bandura, 1990). This project is focusing on women who already have a history of physical or sexual violence. The investigators hypothesize that women who already have such a history of violence will benefit from a self-defense class that incorporates psychoeducation and brief psychology treatments in order to successfully participate in such a class and that ultimately it will improve their psychological well-being. Potential participants will first do a short phone screening to see whether they may be eligible for the study. If so, they will be brought into the clinic for a full eligibility assessment. Eligibility Procedures: Before entering the study, participants will participate in an eligibility interview. This will consist of a psychiatric interview (e.g., portions of the SCID and psychiatric rating scales), trauma history (e.g. CAPS), and physical health assessment. Participants will either need approval from their primary care physician to participate in the physical self-defense portion of the study or have a brief physical exam will a physician on the research team. If the participant is eligible for the study, they will be added to the list of participants. Once an adequate number of participants have been screened and determine eligible for the study, they will participate in the group for 8 weeks. Participants will fill out a series of questionnaires pre- and post- the course. Each set of questionnaires should take less than 1 hour to complete. In addition, the investigators conducted a 6-month post-class, follow up assessment. Self-defense class: The self-defense program is an eight week curriculum that meets once per week for 2.5 hours per session. The course which involves three components. The first component is a psycho-educational component which provides current basic information about physical and sexual assaults and also skill building, such as assertiveness, communication skills, and boundary setting. The second component of each class is physical resistance techniques which offers ample training. This includes information about basic targets, punches, and kicks, as well as breaking out of holds and other resistance skills. The third component of each class includes a supportive psychotherapy debriefing session. Following participation in the self-defense class all participants will be required to come for an in-person, debriefing interview.</detailed_description>
