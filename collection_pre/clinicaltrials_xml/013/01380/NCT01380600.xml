	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed, advanced/metastatic colorectal carcinoma Failed both oxaliplatin and irinotecan based regimens for advanced/metastatic disease (if tumor advanced either immediately or within 3 months of the end of treatment) Resistance to Erbitux: patients with Ras mutations, or for whom Erbitux has failed (if tumor advanced either immediately or within 3 months of the end of treatment, or there is no response to Erbitux therapy due to a lack of expression of EGFR (epidermal growth factor)) Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70 Age ≥18 years Laboratory Safety: WBC ≥ 3,500 cells/mm3 and ≤ 50,000 cells/mm3, ANC ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3, Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (transfusion allowed), Platelet count ≥ 100,000 plts/mm3,Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN, INR ≤ 1.5, AST, ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN (in case of liver metastasis: AST,ALT ≤5.0 x ULN) Serum chemistries within normal limits (WNL) or Grade 1 (excluding alkaline phosphatase) If patients are diabetic, a fasting glucose must be done and patients must be &gt; 160 mg/dL. Patients who, if they are sexually active, are willing and able to refrain from sexual activity for 3 weeks following JX594 administration. Patients who are willing and able to use a permitted contraceptive for 3 months after the final administration of JX594. Significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and/or medication (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) Known myeloproliferative disorders requiring systemic therapy History of exfoliative skin condition (e.g. eczema or ectopic dermatitis) requiring systemic therapy History of acquiring opportunistic infections. Tumor(s) invading a major vascular structure (e.g. carotid artery) Tumor(s) in location that would potentially result in significant clinical adverse effects if posttreatment tumor swelling were to occur Clinically uncontrolled and/or rapidly accumulating ascites, pericardial and/or pleural effusions History of severe or unstable cardiac disease Current, known CNS malignancy (history of completely resected or irradiated brain metastases by WBRT or stereotactic radiosurgery allowed) Administered anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to first treatment (6 weeks in case of mitomycin C or nitrosoureas) Use of antiviral, antiplatelet, or anticoagulation medication [Patients who discontinue such medications within 7 days prior to first treatment may be eligible for this study.] Low dose aspirin (approximately 81 mg) allowed. Pulse oximetry O2 saturation &lt;90% Pulse oximetry O2 saturation &lt;90% at rest Experienced a severe systemic reaction or sideeffect as a result of a previous smallpox vaccination Pregnant or nursing Household contact exclusions: Women who are pregnant or nursing an infant Children &lt; 5 years old People with skin disease (e.g. eczema, atopic dermatitis, and related diseases Immunocompromised hosts (severe deficiencies in cellmediated immunity, including AIDS, organ transplant recipients, hematologic malignancies)</criteria>
