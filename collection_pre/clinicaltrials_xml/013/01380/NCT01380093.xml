	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the abuse potential of EMBEDA compared to controlled release morphine when crushed and taken orally by non-dependent recreational opioid users; secondary purposes include to determine the abuse potential of crushed EMBEDA relative to placebo and and to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of crushed EMBEDA with crushed controlled-release morphine and crushed placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is a recreational opioid user who is NOT physically dependent on opioids based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersFourth EditionText Revision (DSMIVTR) criteria, and the Naloxone Challenge. A recreational opioid user is defined as recreationally abusing opioids for nontherapeutic purposes (i.e., for psychoactive effects) on at least 10 occasions within the last year and at least once in the 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Subject is in generally good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Has a history or current diagnosis of substance dependence (excluding caffeine and nicotine), as assessed by the Investigator using the DSM IVTR criteria. Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for substance and/or alcoholrelated disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine). History or presence of any clinically significant illness (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, oncologic, musculoskeletal, or psychiatric) or any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the study results. Has a known allergy or history of hypersensitivity to morphine sulfate, opioids in general, naltrexone hydrochloride (HCl) or similar compounds and/or the known excipients in the investigational drug products. Has any condition in which an opioid is contraindicated (e.g., significant respiratory depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia, or is suspected of having paralytic ileus). Females who are pregnant, lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the course of the study. Females with a positive serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 or at any subsequent study visit will be excluded from participating in the study.</criteria>
