	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare rates of hernia formation between colostomies created with no hernia preventing mesh versus colostomies created with a particular mesh.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Prevention of Peristomial Hernias Via Parietal Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies indicate that implanting mesh for peristomal hernia repair may efficiently prevent hernia relapse. However, mesh provides a good infection site, which is not a desirable characteristic for a material adjacent to a colostomy "port". Our goal is to implement a high-quality, randomized trial to demonstrate whether or not systematic mesh implantation upon primary hernia creation is an effective means of avoiding this common and troublesome complication.</detailed_description>
