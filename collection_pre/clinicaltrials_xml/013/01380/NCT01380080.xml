	<brief_summary>People with HIV have a high chance of becoming infected with TB, especially when they live in areas where TB infection is common. It can be difficult to diagnose TB in people who need to start HIV treatment right away. Within about 6 months after starting HIV treatment, some of these people can become very sick with TB and can even die from it. This study is being done in people who are starting HIV treatment and who live in areas where the TB infection rate is high. The purpose of this study is to test an experimental approach to TB treatment to see if it is better than the usual approach. The experimental approach is to start TB treatment at the same time as HIV treatment, even when TB infection has not been found. The usual approach is to start TB treatment only if TB infection is found. In this study, half of the people will start TB treatment at the same time as they start their HIV treatment. The other half will start TB treatment only if TB infection is found. The study will also test how safe and effective it is to start TB treatment at about the same time as HIV treatment even when TB infection has not been found. The study will collect information about diet, whether (and when) people in the study become sicker or die, how well their HIV is controlled, how they are feeling, how they are taking their medications, whether it matters where they live or what kind of HIV and TB care is standard, how many people are diagnosed with TB while in the study, and how the cost of the two treatment options on a national level could be compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REMEMBER: Reducing Early Mortality &amp; Morbidity by Empiric Tuberculosis (TB) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, open-label, phase IV strategy trial for participants from resource-limited settings (RLS) who present with advanced HIV disease and no probable or confirmed tuberculosis (TB), as defined in the current ACTG diagnosis appendix, and who are initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) will be randomized to one of two strategy arms: immediate, empiric TB treatment (Empiric arm) or local standard of care TB treatment (IPT arm). Randomization was balanced by clinical trial unit and stratified according to CD4+ T cell count (&lt;25 vs. ≥25 cells/mm^3) and presence of any of the following prognostic factors: reportable hospitalization within the past 30 days, BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m^2, or anemia (hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dl). Participants are followed for 96 weeks. Participants attended study visits at screening, enrollment, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Signs and symptoms, ART modifications, concomitant medications, and clinical events as defined by AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Appendix 60 were collected at each visit. Blood was collected for CD4 and HIV-1 RNA at study entry, weeks 4 and 24 and blood for safety laboratories (liver function, hematology, and renal function) was collected at all visits except week 1. A sputum sample was collected and stored at study entry. The current results submission included data up to the primary outcome time point (week 24), and that after study completion, there will be a second results submission to include the data from the later visits up to week 96.</detailed_description>
