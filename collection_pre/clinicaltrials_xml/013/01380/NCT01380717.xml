	<brief_summary>Patients with reduced kidney function have a higher risk of heart disease and death. Studies have shown that blood vessels in patients with hypertension change with a decrease of lumen size and growth of the vessel wall. By treating patients with antihypertensive certain medication vessel lumen and walls normalize. Treating hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease slows the progression of kidney function loss. The aim is to compare different degrees of antihypertensive medication in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension will slow the progression of kidney loss.</brief_summary>
