	<brief_summary>BIBF 1120 is a newly discovered compound that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug is currently being used in treatment for other cancers in research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this agent, BIBF 1120, may help to stop recurrent malignant glioma cells from multiplying and it may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels at the site of the tumor. In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well BIBF 1120 works in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BIBF 1120 for Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two arm, multicenter, open label phase II trial in adult patients with recurrent supratentorial high-grade glioma. One arm (the "bevacizumab naïve" arm) will enroll patients who have not received prior bevacizumab therapy, and the other arm (the "post-bevacizumab" arm) will enroll patients who have experienced progression on bevacizumab. All subjects will receive BIBF 1120 at 200mg orally, twice daily in cycles of 28 days. Subjects will come to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle (or within 2 days prior) for blood and urine tests and a physical and neurologic exam. Bloods will also be checked within 2 days before or after Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2. An additional blood sample will be taken on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1, at the start of every even-numbered cycle, and at the end of active study treatment. Subjects will have gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI scans performed with tumor measurements at screening, at the start of even-numbered cycles, and at the end of active study treatment(unless already obtained within 4 weeks of completing study treatment). 40 study subjects will have diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI at baseline, after 1 week on therapy (± 2 days), within 2 days prior to the start of every even-numbered cycle, and at the end of treatment (unless already obtained within 4 weeks of completing study treatment).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histopathologicallyconfirmed, supratentorial, recurrent glioblastoma; subjects with an initial diagnosis of a lower grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy is determined to be glioblastoma Demonstration of recurrent disease on MRI following prior therapy Development of progressive disease after having received prior RT, and must have an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of any radiation therapy to study entry (unless progressive tumor growth is outside the radiation field or there is histopathological confirmation of recurrent tumor). Bidimensionally measurable disease (minimum measurement of 1 cm in one dimension) on MRI performed within 14 days prior to first treatment. (If receiving corticosteroids, participants must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids for at least 5 days prior to baseline MRI.)
