	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of CRLX101 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer. The development of targeted therapies has changed the approach to treating NSCLC significantly over the past decade with targeted therapies generally possessing safety advantages over traditional cytotoxic regimens. However, combination paradigms and resistance patterns complicate the use of these agents. CRLX101 is a nanoparticle comprised of camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to a cyclodextrin-based polymer. CRLX101 is designed to increase the exposure of tumor cells to CPT while minimizing side effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients who are ≥ 18years of age. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar, squamous cell, large cell, or mixed carcinoma) that is not amendable to surgical treatment and patient has have failed 1 or 2 different lines of chemotherapy. Measureable disease and evidence of progression on the previous therapy. Progression may be clinical or radiological. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/µL without growth factor support. Platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/µL without support. Adequate hepatic and renal function including the following: Total bilirubin &lt; 2 × ULN, AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for patients with liver metastasis, PTT within normal limits, INR ≤ 1.5, Serum Creatinine &lt;1.5 ULN At least 4 weeks post any radiotherapy or biological therapy; at least 6 weeks post nitrosoureas therapy. Full recovery from diagnostic or therapeutic surgery (i.e., complete wound healing) and at least 30 days have elapsed prior to initial dosing. Full recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy (i.e., Common Toxicity Criteria [CTC] Grade 1 or less with the exception of Grade 2 alopecia). Women of childbearing potential must have adequate pregnancy test. If postmenopausal, must be ≥ 12 months since last menses. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use an effective form of contraception during the study and for 60 days after the last dose of study drug. CNS metastases by radiologic evidence or histology, unless clinically stable (must have been treated by resection or radiation) for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. Patients may not be receiving dexamethasone for control of CSF pressure. Concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation: PTT less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN or low dose aspirin and lowweight heparin only are allowed. More than 2 previous lines of chemotherapy for lung cancer. This includes biologic (immunotherapy) therapy. History of previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or history transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months of study entry. History of prior malignancy not cured by excision. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not excluded, but patients with other prior malignancies must have had at least 2year disease free interval. Recent history (within 6 months of screening) of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure History of cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical or electrical therapy. QTc &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females. Any major surgery within 30 days or minor surgery within 10 days of study entry, or patient not recovered from surgery. History of organ or bone marrow transplant. Known active and/or uncontrolled infection, including HIV and are not stable on antiretroviral therapy. Any investigational therapy within 28 days of study entry. Pregnant or nursing. Anyone who in the judgment of the investigator cannot comply with the protocol, provide truly informed consent, or is likely to live &lt; 90 days Severe or significant allergy to any chemotherapy or premedication. Clinically evident ascites (e.g., abdominal distention, bulging and/or fluid wave) or Grade 3 peripheral edema. Any prior cancer treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor.</criteria>
