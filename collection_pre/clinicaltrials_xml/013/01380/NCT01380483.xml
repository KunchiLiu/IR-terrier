Clinically significant illnesses within 4 weeks of the administration of study medication. Abnormal laboratory test judged clinically significant. ECG or vital signs abnormalities (clinically significant). History of allergic reactions to doxycycline or other related drugs (e.g., chlortetracycline, demeclocycline, minocycline and tetracycline). History of allergic reactions to heparin. Any food allergies, intolerances, restrictions, or special diet which in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in this study.

History of significant alcohol abuse within six months of the screening visit or any indication of the regular use of more than two units of alcohol per day (1 Unit = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL of alcohol 40%) Recent history of drug abuse or use of illegal drugs: use of soft drugs (such as marijuana, pot) within 3 months of the screening visit or hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), crack) within 1 year of the screening visit. Subjects who have taken prescription medication 14 days preceding administration of study medication or over the counter products 7 days preceding administration of study medication, except for topical products without systemic absorption. Subjects who have taken any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within 30 days prior to administration of the study medication (examples of inducers: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, rifampin/rifabutin; examples of inhibitors: antidepressants, cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole, MAO inhibitors, neuroleptics, verapamil, quinidine). Subjects who have undergone clinically significant surgery 4 weeks prior to the administration of the study medication. Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, would prevent the subject from participating in the study.</criteria>
