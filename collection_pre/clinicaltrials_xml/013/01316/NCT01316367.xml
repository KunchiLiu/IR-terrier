	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Individual health education is considered to be essential in the overall care of patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2), although there is some uncertainty regarding its metabolic control benefits. There have been very few randomized studies on the effects of individual education on normal care in DM2 patients with a control group, and none of these have assessed the long-term results. Therefore, this study aims to use this design to assess the effectiveness of the PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Causes in Educational Diagnosis, and Evaluation) education model in the metabolic control and the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: An open community randomized clinical trial will be carried out in 8 urban community health centers in the Northeastern Madrid (Spain). Six hundred patients with DM2 will be randomized in two groups: PRECEDE or conventional model for health promotion education. The main outcome measures is glycated hemoglobin A1C, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipids and control criteria during the 2-year follow-up period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assignment to the Health Promotion Education (HPE) will be random, three centers will use conventional HPE (the control group) and the remaining five will use PRECEDE-type HPE. Eligible patients are selected from a list of DM2 patients by each professional using random sampling, until the predetermined sample size is attained. Conventional HPE is defined according to the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health National Conference on Diabetes Mellitus, and was complemented by the criteria for good care of the Madrid Primary Healthcare Service for the promotion of healthy lifestyles among adults for 2004-2007</detailed_description>
