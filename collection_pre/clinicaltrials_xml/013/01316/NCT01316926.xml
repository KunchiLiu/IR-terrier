	<brief_title>Paxil CR Bioequivalence Study Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Full title: Relative bioavailability study between the formulations: Paroxetine Hydrochloride 25 mg tablet with controlled release (Paxil CR) manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Inc. - Mississauga - Canada (test formulation) and Paroxetine Hydrochloride 25 mg tablets with controlled release (Paxil CR) manufactured by SmithKline Beecham (Cork) Limited - Cidra - Puerto Rico (reference formulation), fasted administration in healthy volunteers for both genders. The study is open, randomized, crossover in steady state and the volunteers received multiple doses of the drug test and reference (two periods of drug administration). The population is composed of 60 healthy volunteers, adult of both gender, with age between 18 and 40 years, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 27. Volunteers have weight above than 50 kg. 50% of the volunteers recruited are female and 50% male. There are not restrictions regarding the ethnic group.The relative bioavailability of the formulations after oral administration in steady state will be evaluated based on statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from data of concentration of drug in blood. The concentration of Paroxetine hydrochloride (controlled release) will be measured by an appropriate analytical method and valid after the drug administration.The Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at steady state in each fasting period. The safety assessment will include evaluation and clinical monitoring, vital signs monitoring, ECG, and laboratory tests. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
