	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the time to recolonization intraoperatively after preoperative disinfection with chlorhexidine solution in ethanol and to determine evidence of differential bacterial growth with or without plastic adhesive drape on the chest as well as with or without microbial sealant on the leg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recolonization Following Preoperative Disinfection Plastic Adhesive Drapes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to measure the time to recolonization intraoperative after preoperative disinfection with chlorhexidine solution in ethanol and to determine evidence of differential bacterial growth with or without plastic adhesive drape as well as with or without microbial sealant on the leg. A RCT study of 140 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or aortic valve replacement (AVR) are included. The investigators test the hypothesis that patients randomized to no plastic adhesive drape intraoperatively will have a reduced recolonisation compared to patients with plastic adhesive drape.</detailed_description>
