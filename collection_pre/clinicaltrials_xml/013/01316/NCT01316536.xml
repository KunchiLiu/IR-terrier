	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, prospective single-blinded placebo-controlled study of consecutive intubated ICU patients requiring anxiolytics and analgesic medications. Patients will be randomized into two groups: one group will receive music (MUSIC), whereas the other group (CONTROL) will wear headphones, but hear an audio loop of recorded ICU sounds (vent alarms, ambient noise, talking, etc). The two groups will then be analyzed for sedation and analgesia requirements; Ramsay sedation score, ICP in brain injured patients, ventilator days, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).</detailed_description>
