	<brief_title>Proof-of-concept Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of EBP921 in Delta Hepatitis (HDV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, phase 1b, proof-of-concept study to assess the safety and efficacy of EBP921, a prenylation inhibitor, in subjects chronically infected with delta hepatitis. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two different doses of EBP921. Dosing will occur over 28-days and during that time, evidence of antiviral response will be assessed by frequent measurements of HDV-RNA via PCR assay. In addition, safety lab data will also be collected along with surveillance monitoring of HBV activity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Men and women age 18 or older with the capacity to give written informed consent 2. Patients with compensated chronic HDV infection as indicated by presence of antiHDV in serum. 3. Liver biopsy should be performed within oneyear of study screening and graded using the Knodell scoring system. 4. Presence of HDV antigen in liver tissue or HDVRNA in serum. 5. Active HBV replication will not exclude patients. 6. Previous therapy with standard alphainterferon or peginterferon will not exclude patients. 7.

Underlying autoimmune/immunedeficiency disease (e.g., lupus, sarcoidosis, celiac disease, HIV antibody positive, AIDS) 5. Chronic (&gt; 4 weeks duration) diarrhea 6. Body weight &gt; 128 kg and &lt; 40 kg 7. Uncompensated cirrhosis 8. Absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 per cubic millimeter 9. Platelet count less than 90,000 per cubic millimeter 10. Evidence of concurrent HCV infection with positive serum HCVRNA 11. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma 12. Active substance abuse (alcohol, inhaled or injected drugs) within the past 12 months 13. Diagnosis of malignancy in the previous five years excluding superficial dermatologic malignancies 14. Any experimental therapy in the previous 6 months prior to enrollment. 16.
