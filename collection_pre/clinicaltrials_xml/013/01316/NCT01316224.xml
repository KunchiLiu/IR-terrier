	<brief_title>Prevalence and Incidence of Articular Symptoms and Signs Related to Psoriatic Arthritis in Patients With Psoriasis Severe or Moderate With Adalimumab Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 1% to 3% of the population worldwide. A significant portion (5%-40%) of participants with psoriasis develop PsA, a chronic inflammatory arthritis that causes progressive joint damage, reduced functionality and increased mortality risk. Skin disease typically manifests before arthritis in more than 80% of PsA participants, and psoriasis symptoms usually precede joint symptoms by an average of 10 years. Participants with psoriasis who have comorbid PsA incur substantially increased cost of care and experience greater impairment of physical functioning and quality of life compared with participants with psoriasis alone.</detailed_description>
