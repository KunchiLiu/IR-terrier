	<criteria>Adult subjects (1860 years of age or up to 64 years of age with approval) Documented chronic HCV infection to be of at least 6 months duration and plasma HCV RNA ≥ 5 log10 IU/mL at screening. HCV treatment naïve Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 80 mL/min, QTcF interval ≤ 450 msec, QRS duration &lt; 100 msec, PR interval &lt; 220 msec, Body mass index (BMI) of 19.0 to 34.0 kg/m2, inclusive. Eligible subjects must also be HCV treatmentnaïve. Subjects with prior documentation of cirrhosis, excessive current alcohol intake, any evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (i.e., αfetoprotein &gt; 50 ng/mL or by any other standard of care measure) Urine drug screen positive for illicit/illegal drugs ALT and AST levels &gt; 5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Direct bilirubin &gt; ULN, clinical or other laboratory evidence of hepatic decompensation (i.e., platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3, prothrombin time ≥ 1.5 × ULN and albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL) are not eligible for study participation. Subjects with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,000 cells/mm3 (&lt; 750 cells/mm3 for black or AfricanAmerican subjects), hemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 11 g/dL, Coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or another HCV genotype (other than type 1 for Cohorts 15 and type 2 or 3 for Cohort 6) are not eligible for study participation. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma Any sign of decompensated liver disease, including prothrombin time ≥ 1.5 X ULN, platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3 or albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL at screening OR current or prior history of clinical hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage) History of clinicallysignificant illness or any other major medical disorder that may interfere with subject treatment, assessment or compliance with the protocol History of a primary gastrointestinal disorder that could interfere with the absorption of the study drug or that could interfere with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility</criteria>
