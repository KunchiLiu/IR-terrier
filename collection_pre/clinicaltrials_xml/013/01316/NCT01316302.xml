	<brief_title>12-Week Study of Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is recognized as a prevalent, chronic and disabling condition. Lifetime prevalence has been estimated at 13% in the National Comorbidity Survey. There is good reason to think that Pristiq® would be effective in Social Anxiety Disorder. Effexor XR, which is mechanistically similar to Pristiq®, was found effective for subjects with Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder in all five of the placebo controlled trials in which it was studied.</detailed_description>
