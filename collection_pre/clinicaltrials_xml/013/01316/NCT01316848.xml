	<brief_title>A Single Center, Open-label, Randomized, Two-period Crossover Food Effect Study of Single Doses of Tivozanib (AV-951) in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover PK food effect study of tivozanib administered orally at 1.5 mg. Subjects will be screened for eligibility up to 28 days prior to entry into the study. For each of 2 study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on the day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing for each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 1.5 mg tivozanib in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least 48 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the CRU on an outpatient basis for collection of additional blood samples for up to 504 hours postdose.</detailed_description>

Male subjects who are either sterile or agree to use, during the period from informed consent until 45 days following Study Completion, 1 of the following approved methods of contraception: a double barrier method (eg, male condom with spermicide, use by female sexual partner of an intrauterine device with spermicide, a female condom with spermicide, contraceptive sponge with spermicide, a diaphragm with spermicide, or use of a cervical cap with spermicide); a sterile sexual partner; a female sexual partner using an intravaginal system (eg,NuvaRing®); or a partner using an oral, implantable, transdermal, or injectable contraceptives.

History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator. History of stomach or intestinal surgery, nephrectomy, cholecystectomy or resection that would potentially alter absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs as determined by the investigator (appendectomy and/or hernia repair may be allowed). History or presence of an abnormal ECG, which, in the Investigator's opinion, is clinically significant. Diagnosis of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to Period 1 Checkin.

Donation of blood ≥ 250 mL from 30 days prior to informed consent until study completion, inclusive, or of plasma from 2 weeks prior to informed consent until study completion, inclusive. Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Period 1 Checkin; Blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg confirmed by repeat at Screening or at Period 1 Checkin.
