	<brief_summary>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (500 mg once daily and 500 mg twice daily) of GSK1605786A in maintaining remission over 52 weeks in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. Efficacy will be assessed by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score. Eligible subjects will have achieved response (CDAI decrease of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI less than 150) in a prior GSK sponsored induction study. The primary endpoint will be proportion of subjects in remission at both Weeks 28 and 52. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters including liver function tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram. Population pharmacokinetics will evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes assessments will include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), SF-36v2, EQ-5D, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - Crohn's Disease (WPAI-CD) and disability.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group study in adult subjects with Crohn's disease who previously achieved clinical response (CDAI decrease of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI less than 150) in a prior Phase III induction study (Study CCX114151 or another GSK sponsored induction study). Subjects will be randomised to 52 weeks of oral treatment with GSK1605786A 500 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily or placebo. Subjects who are receiving concomitant corticosteroids at entry will undergo dose tapering following a defined schedule. Subjects who complete the treatment period may be eligible to enter an open-label extension study. Subjects who experience disease worsening and require additional (rescue) treatment will be withdrawn and may be eligible to enter the open-label study. Subjects who do not enter the open-label study must complete a follow-up assessment 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Approximately 756 subjects will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
