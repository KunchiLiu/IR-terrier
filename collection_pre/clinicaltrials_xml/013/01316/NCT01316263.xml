	<criteria>Participant has histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable and/or metastatic GIST Participant has measurable disease Participant has documented objective progression following, or intolerance to, treatment with both imatinib and sunitinib Participant's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) is 0 to 2 Participant has either: 1. prior results from growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity (KIT) and PDGFRα mutation analysis that meet analytical criteria as defined for the onstudy analysis of these mutations and tumor tissue (from either primary or metastatic tumor) that can be submitted for analysis within 30 days after the first dose of study therapy; or 2. if prior results from KIT and PDGFRα mutation analysis are not available or do not meet analytical criteria as above, then tumor tissue (from either primary or metastatic tumor) must be submitted for genotype testing at the latest 28 days prior to the first dose of study therapy Participant has adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation function Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study and for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of IMC3G3 Participant has a life expectancy of ≥ 3 months Participant has untreated central nervous system metastases, and as a result, is clinically unstable with regard to neurologic function Participant has a history of another primary cancer Participant has received any investigational therapy within 14 days prior to registration, or is currently enrolled in any other type of medical research Participant is receiving concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy Participant has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Participant has undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to registration If female, participant is pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
