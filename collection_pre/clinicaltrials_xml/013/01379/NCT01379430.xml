	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP candidate vaccines in healthy adult volunteers in a malaria endemic region. The regime proposed in this trial has protected non-immune volunteers against sporozoite challenge in clinical trials performed by Oxford, and so may be protective against naturally acquired infection in Kenya.The study population will comprise 30 healthy adult males aged 18-50. The investigators do not propose to include a placebo group. At this stage the investigators objective is to describe the safety profile in a small number of individuals, and the confidence intervals for the proportion of individuals with a particular event would be too wide for meaningful comparison with a placebo group. Immunogenicity will be judged by comparison with baseline.</brief_summary>

History of splenectomy Haemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dl Clinically significant abnormalities of laboratory screening tests (full blood count, ALT, creatinine levels, urine dipstick examination for blood and protein). Blood transfusion within one month of the beginning of the study History of vaccination with previous experimental malaria vaccines Administration of any other vaccine or immunoglobulin within two weeks before vaccination. Current participation in another clinical trial, or within 12 weeks of this study Any other finding which in the opinion of the investigators would increase the risk of an adverse outcome from participation in the trial. Likelihood of travel away from the study area HIV positive. History of contact dermatitis (due to the use of a potentially irritant disinfectant that may be present in trace amounts in the AdCh63 METRAP vaccine, see the investigators brochure for details, attached)</criteria>
