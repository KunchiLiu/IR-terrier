	<brief_summary>KaleEAST is a non-interventional, post-marketing observational study (PMOS) in which lopinavir/ritonavir is prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to dose, population and indication. No additional procedures (other than the standard of care) are to be applied to the patients. The KaleEAST PMOS was conducted in a prospective, single-arm, multicountry, multicenter format. The study was carried out in two (2) parts: the first part was initiated in 2004 with the lopinavir/ritonavir capsule formulation, the second part started in 2006 after the lopinavir/ritonavir tablets had become available in the participating countries. The aim of this post-marketing observational study was to obtain further data on clinical, biological, and virological outcomes, compliance and tolerability of Kaletra®-containing regimen during routine clinical use in the participating countries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As this study is observational in nature, subject follow-up was not specified by the protocol but was left to the judgment of each physician within the 18 months period, which defines the survey for each participant. For indicative purposes, follow-up of each participant should enable approximately 7 visits during this period. These visits will take place at average intervals of 3 months, apart from the first visit following inclusion (usually at the end of the first treatment month) and apart from visits required because of intercurrent events. Participant visits were assigned as follows: Baseline/Day 0 (start of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment), Month 1 (day 1 to day 45), Month 3 (day 46 to day 136), Month 6 (day 137 to day 228), Month 9 (day 229 to day 319), Month 12 (day 320 to day 410), Month 15 (day 411 to day 501), Month 18 (day 502 to day 593). Each participant is planned to be observed during his/her lopinavir/ritonavir capsule containing treatment regimen for a maximum period of 18 months, and each participant is planned to be observed during his/her lopinavir/ritonavir tablet containing treatment regimen for a maximum period of 9 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients infected by HIV1 infection who are either: Antiretroviral treatment (ART) naive or Had failed or had been intolerant to one previous combined antiretroviral treatment (cART), not including a Protease inhibitor (PI) (firstline pretreated without a Protease inhibitor) or Had failed or had been intolerant to one previous antiretroviral treatment ART, including one Protease inhibitor (firstline pretreated with a Protease Inhibitor). A ritonavirboosted Protease inhibitor PI is considered as treatment with one Protease inhibitor PI.
