	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the first-cycle maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II (RP2D) dose of Cabazitaxel when combined with Cisplatin and Follow-Up induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck for three cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel - PF Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study objectives are the following: - To assess the safety, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicity of cabazitaxel when combined with cisplatin and Follow-Up (FU) induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). - To establish the phase II recommended dose of cabazitaxel when combined with cisplatin and Follow-Up induction in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The secondary study objectives, in regards to the combined Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil regimen in patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, are the following: - To assess the toxicity profile - To assess best Overall Response Rate (complete and partial responses) after completion of 3 cycles of treatment - To assess Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) after 3 years Analysis of the secondary variables will be primarily descriptive in nature due to the small sample size. All results will be considered hypothesis generating to be confirmed in a future study. Patient, for whom an informed consent has been obtained and who have met the inclusion/exclusion criteria after having the screening evaluation performed within a one-week window, will be assigned to a dose level according to the dose escalation rule described in the protocol. Treatment consists of an Induction chemotherapy period, which is the period when the patient will undergo 3 cycles of Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil (PF). The Induction chemotherapy will be followed by Consolidation Therapy, which is 6-7 weeks of Chemoradiation treatment or Surgery + Recovery time, depending on their primary site and overall medical condition. Both treatment periods will consist of approximately 16 weeks (9 weeks of Induction and 7 weeks of Consolidation, if Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy (CRT)), or shorter than 16 weeks, if surgery. After three cycles, the patients will be assessed for clinical, radiographic, and pathologic response to Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil before beginning Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy or surgery. Patients, who do not complete three cycles of Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil for reasons of toxicity, progressive disease, choice, or other medical necessity, will be treated with standard Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy or surgery depending on their primary site and overall medical condition. Once the Consolidation treatment is completed, the follow-up of patients will be for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with stage IV only, previously untreated, locally advanced SCCHN (patients may have had previous surgery, but not chemotherapy or radiotherapy). During the dose escalation phase before the MTD and DLT are established for cabazitaxel combined with cisplatin and FU induction chemotherapy primary sites allowed include the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and unknown primary regardless of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) status. Metastatic SCCHN will be allowed in escalation phase. Once MTD and DLT for cabazitaxel combined with cisplatin and FU induction chemotherapy are established (expansion cohort) primary sites allowed include the oral cavity, oropharynx (HPV negative only), larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and unknown primary (HPV negative only). No patients with metastases will be allowed in this phase (expansion cohort).

Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test at baseline and on Day 1 Patients must provide verbal and written informed consent to participate in the study Locally advanced HPV positive oropharyngeal or unknown primary SCCHN for the expansion cohort only (Once MTD and DLT for cabazitaxel combined with cisplatin and FU induction chemotherapy established).

Surgery, irradiation or chemotherapy within the previous 4 weeks Any other concomitant anticancer therapies Patients will be excluded if they received any prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or treatment with biologic response modifiers (except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) History of colitis or chronic diarrheal illness History of, or active, comorbid medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would raise significant risk to the patient.</criteria>
