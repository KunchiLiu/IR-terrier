	<brief_summary>The vecuronium requirements may be reduced for recipients of living donor liver transplantation, as the vecuronium is eliminated principally by the liver. Furthermore, the requirements may be different according to the phase of surgery. The requirements may also be different according to the preoperative hepatic function as measured by MELD score during prehepatic phase, or graft to recipient body weight ratio (GRWR) during neohepatic phase. Therefore, the investigators are trying to investigate the difference of vecuronium requirements according to the phase of surgery or MELD score, GRWR.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vecuronium requirements may be reduced for recipients of living donor liver transplantation, as the vecuronium is eliminated principally by the liver. Furthermore, the requirements may be different according to the phase of surgery. The requirements may by further reduced during anhepatic phase of liver transplantation. And the requirements may be increased as the graft functions during neohepatic phase. We also postulated that the requirements may be different according to the preoperative hepatic function during preanhepatic phase, and according to the graft to recipient body weight ratio (GRWR) during neohepatic phase. Therefore, we are trying to investigate the difference of vecuronium requirements according to the phase of surgery, MELD score, GRWR.</detailed_description>
