	<brief_summary>Postherpetic Neuralgia is a painful nerve condition that can occur when nerve fibers are damaged following an outbreak of shingles. The purpose of this study is to identify and study abnormalities in the nerves and cells in the of patients with postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) and characterize changes that could be responsible for causing nerve pain. This data will be compared to the tissue of healthy volunteers. Our goal is that this information will lead to the development of better treatment options for people with painful nerve conditions.</brief_summary>
