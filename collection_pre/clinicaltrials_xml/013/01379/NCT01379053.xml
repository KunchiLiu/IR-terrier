	<brief_summary>The zNose® MRSA test is a non-invasive breath test for markers of Staphylococcus aureus, which may predict the probability of bacterial organisms in the anterior nares, throat and respiratory tract, wounds, and anus and therefore be able to replace or supplement current active Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) surveillance efforts. It consists of: - A collection apparatus for collection of volatile compounds from suspected infection sites onto a sorbent trap or Tedlar bag, as well as for the collection of a separate sample of room air. - Analysis of the volatile organic compounds from suspected infection sites and room air by short acoustic wave gas chromatography. - Interpretation of the volatile organic compounds with a proprietary algorithm in order to predict the probability of Staphylococcus aureus infection and colonization. This study will test the hypothesis that we can identify the presence of MRSA by sampling the "head space" above culture media of anterior nare samples provided by patients with MRSA. Additionally, this study will test the hypothesis that we can identify the presence of MRSA by sampling air exhaled through the nostrils (nasal exhalant).</brief_summary>
