	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) of three different doses of latanoprost (75, 100 and 125 ug/ml) to that of the marketed 50 ug/ml dose, in a dose ranging study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, 18 years of age or older. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) requiring unilateral or bilateral administration of intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering treatment, including patients who were naïve to IOP lowering treatment. IOP between ≥ 24 mmHg and ≤ 36 mmHg in at least one eye at the 8 AM time point at baseline/randomization. Closed/barely open anterior chamber angle or a history of acute angle closure. A history of discontinued prostaglandin IOP lowering treatment, unless the reason for discontinuation was participation in a clinical study. Ocular surgery or argon laser trabeculoplasty in one or both eyes within 3 months prior to the screening visit. Use or anticipated requirement during the study of any topical medication that was known to affect IOP. Anticipated need to modify systemic medication known to affect IOP (eg, betaadrenergic antagonists, alphaadrenergic agonists, calcium channel blockers, angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotension II receptor antagonists) during the study period.</criteria>
