	<brief_summary>Imipenem is a carbapenem antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This agent is often used as the last line of therapy for highly resistant Gram negative bacilli nosocomial infections. In common with other beta-lactamase inhibitor, the main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index that correlates with the therapeutic efficacy is the time that concentrations in the tissue and serum are above the MIC and administration by continuous infusion is the preferred mode of administration to maximize this parameter. However, in tropical countries, the stability of carbapenem antibiotics is an important consideration when considering continuous infusion. Therefore, prolonged infusion may be a useful mode of administration to maximize bactericidal activity. This study will demonstrate the stability of imipenem in clinical use at room temperature in tropical countries.</brief_summary>
