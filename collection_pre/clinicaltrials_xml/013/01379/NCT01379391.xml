	<brief_summary>Factors influencing platelet engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) includes previous chemotherapy courses, conditioning regimen, HLA compatibility, source of stem cell, CD34+ cell count, infection of virus/bacteria/fungal, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), etc. Large-scaled clinical trials have demonstrated that platelet count below 20G/L on 14 days after transplantation is an predictive factor for delayed platelet engraftment, which lead to increased platelet infusion requirement and high risk of bleeding. Multivariable survival analysis indicated that delayed platelet engraftment in Allo-HSCT is independent predictive factor for transplantation related mortality (TRM). But effective treatment approaches for delayed platelet recovery after Allo-HSCT are still lacking now. Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO) is a fully modified recombinant human thrombopoietin accurately expressed in mammalian cells. The rHuTPO agent manufactured by the 3Bio Pharmaceutical Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Shenyang is approved by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China in 2005 and is the first rHuTPO agent available globally. RHuTPO was approved for for immune thrombocytopenia and chemotherapy-related thrombocytopenia in China. Animal experiments showed that TPO-mobilizing stem cell could promote platelet engraftment in Allo-HSCT in mice. As for efficacy and safety of TPO on platelet engraftment after Allo-HSCT, it's marginally addressed in clinical trials. Based on preliminary research results, investigator designed a phase IV, open-label, prospective, multicenter Study of the efficacy and safety of recombinant human thrombopoietin injection (rHuTPO, TPIAO)on platelet engraftment in Allo-HSCT in China.</brief_summary>
