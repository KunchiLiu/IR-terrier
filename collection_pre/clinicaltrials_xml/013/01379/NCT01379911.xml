	<brief_summary>Satiety is defined as the inhibition of eating, as a consequence of fullness after consuming food. Being able to effectively measure satiety is an important concept that has implications in the treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity. Increasing post-meal satiety is recognized a useful strategy for weight management. Recently, the category of foods marketed as having satiating effects has seen significant growth and this trend is expected to continue. The purpose of this project is to develop and validate methods for assessing the degree of satiety induced by foods and natural health products using commercially available food products. This trial will examine the effects of a commercially available yogurt (containing added protein and fibre) on self-reported satiety and hunger, as well as food intake in both controlled and uncontrolled settings.</brief_summary>
