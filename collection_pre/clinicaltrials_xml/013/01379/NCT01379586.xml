	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ONO-4053 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a first-in-human study of ONO-4053 in healthy volunteers. This study consists of three parts. Part A will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when single ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner. Part B will investigate the pharmacokinetics of ONO-4053 in the fed and fasted state in an open-label manner. Part C will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when multiple ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner. Doses for Part B and C will be determined after data from Part A are available.</detailed_description>
