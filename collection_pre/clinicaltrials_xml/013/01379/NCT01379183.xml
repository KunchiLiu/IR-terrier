	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique for suspected small bowel disease. This technique depends, in part, on adequate distension of the small bowel. This is accomplished by administering large volumes of a non-absorbable oral contrast material prior to the examination, which typically produces excellent distension of the distal small bowel and stomach, but poor distension of the proximal small bowel. Erythromycin is a common antibiotic that is known to promote stomach emptying and is used to treat diabetics with gastroparesis (poor stomach emptying.) The hypothesis of this study was that erythromycin will increase gastric emptying and hence improve small and large intestinal distention during MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Magnetic Resonance (MR) to Understand the Effect of Erythromycin on Bowel Motility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric, small, and large intestinal volumes were assessed with MRI after ingestion of a low concentration of barium sulfate solution (1350 mL) and randomization to erythromycin 200 mg i.v.) or placebo in 40 healthy volunteers. Magnetic Resonance Images of the abdomen were acquired with a torso phased array coil and a 1.5 tesla magnet.</detailed_description>
