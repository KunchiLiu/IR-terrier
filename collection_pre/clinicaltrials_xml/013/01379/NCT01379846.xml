	<brief_title>Study of TAK-816 in Healthy Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib) is one of the major causes of infectious meningitis in children, and can also cause sepsis, cellulitis, arthritis, epiglottitis, pneumonia and myelitis. TAK-816 is a conjugated Hib vaccine being tested in healthy infants aged 3-6 months at the time of the first dose. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (immunogenicity) and safety of TAK-816 (10 ϻg/0.5 mL) in comparison with ActHIB (Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine) as a control. In addition, the efficacy (immunogenicity) and safety of Absorbed Diphtheria-Purified Pertussis-Tetanus Combined (DPT-TAKEDA) vaccine when TAK-816 and DPT vaccine are administered concomitantly will also be investigated. For the Primary Immunization Phase of this study: three doses of TAK-816 or ActHIB 10 µg/0.5 mL and DPT-TAKEDA 0.5 mL will be administered at 4-week intervals over 8 weeks (Visit 1, 2, 3). At4 weeks after the third dose, a follow-up observation and evaluation will be made (Visit 4). For the Booster Vaccination Phase of this study: a single dose of TAK-816 or ActHIB 10 µg/0.5 mL and DPT-TAKEDA 0.5 mL will be given at 52 weeks after the third dose (Visit 5). At 4 weeks after the fourth dose, a follow-up observation and evaluation will be made (Visit 6).</detailed_description>
