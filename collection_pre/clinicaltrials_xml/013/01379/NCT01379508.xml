	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety following the Roadmap Concept strategy with an initial monotherapy using either telbivudine or tenofovir in HBeAg negative CHB patients. The data from the study should allow for the validation of the Roadmap concept in a prospective manner, for both telbivudine and tenofovir treated HBeAg negative CHB patients. As part of a post-approval commitment to the European Health Authorities, the data will also be used to provide an optimized clinical treatment strategy for better clinical use of telbivudine in European HBeAg negative patients. Furthermore, the data from the study will contribute to a better scientific understanding, disease management and treatment of HBeAg negative CHB patients.</brief_summary>
