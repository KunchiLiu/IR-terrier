	<brief_title>Comparison of Stability and Outcomes in Single-radius Femoral Component for Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, femoral designs based on a sagittal single radius were designed to allow better mid-flexion stability and extensor function after total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to compare mid-flexion stability and clinical outcomes in patients that received TKA using either a single-radius femoral design or multi-radius femoral design.</detailed_description>
