	<criteria>Adult men age 1880 who have had an open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy more than 6 months ago who have bothersome urinary incontinence. Any significant cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities that would preclude the patient from another surgical procedure as they would be too high risk for general anesthesia. They will also be excluded if based on their anatomy or urodynamics, they will most likely not benefit from a surgical incontinence procedure (e.g. poor bladder contractility, bladder neck contracture, etc).</criteria>
