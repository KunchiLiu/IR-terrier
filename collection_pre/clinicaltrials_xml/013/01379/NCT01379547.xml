	<brief_title>Procalcitonin to Shorten Antibiotics Duration in ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with sepsis is largely empirical. An extended treatment course for up to two weeks is a common practice for patients with sepsis in the ICU, despite lack of evidence for this duration of therapy. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a new biomarker that has high negative predictive value for systemic bacterial infection. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether serial PCT measurements can shorten antibiotic treatment duration in patients with sepsis in the ICU. Specific Aims 1. To show that implementation of a procalcitonin-guided antibiotics stewardship algorithm may result in shortened antibiotics course in ICU sepsis patients 2. To show that implementation of a procalcitonin-guided antibiotics stewardship algorithm may not result in inferior outcome as compared to conventional therapy</detailed_description>
