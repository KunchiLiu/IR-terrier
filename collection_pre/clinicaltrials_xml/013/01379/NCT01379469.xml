	<brief_title>Carbamazepine in Severe Liver Disease Due to Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to determine if Carbamazepine therapy in patients with severe liver disease due to Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the hepatic accumulation of ATZ. The other objectives are: To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment reduces hepatic fibrosis in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient patients with severe liver disease. To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment reduces portal pressure in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient patients with severe liver disease. To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment is safe and tolerated by patients with severe liver disease caused by alpha-1-deficiency. To determine whether Carbamazepine treatment leads to stabilization in disease severity as measured by the MELD scores.</detailed_description>
