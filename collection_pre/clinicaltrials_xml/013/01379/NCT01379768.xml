	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to count and analyze the white blood cells in tear samples collected from study participants following sleep. The results from contact lens wearers were compared with the results from non-contact lens wearers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Cell Response in the Tear Film After Overnight Contact Lens Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study was to determine and compare the relative oxidative response of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the relative cell adhesion response of PMNs, and the leukocyte population in tear samples collected from contact lens wearers and non-contact lens wearers. Tear samples were collected via a binocular eye-wash. The samples were processed, and a cell count was performed using a hemacytometer. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of different PMN cell markers before and after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).</detailed_description>
