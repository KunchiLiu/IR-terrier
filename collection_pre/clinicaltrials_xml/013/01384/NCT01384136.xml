	<brief_summary>The telomere system stabilizes the chromosomes. Telomeres are shortened during senescence, in cases of genetic instability and secondary to stress. The investigators aim is to study the telomere system in cord blood and in the placenta immediately after the delivery in pregnancies defined as high risk pregnancies following sterss events such as placental insufficiency, preeclampsia, diabetes. The investigators intend to compare the telomere system in maternal blood to cord blood and to placental biopsies and to study the influence of different stressogenes on this system.</brief_summary>
