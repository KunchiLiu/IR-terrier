	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic effect of the chronic application of eye-drops on tear evaporation rate in dry eye and normal subjects exposed to a condition of environmental stress. The effect will be studied in terms of changes in tear physiology and the inflammatory biomarkers on the ocular surface.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of the Chronic Application of Tear Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Environmentally induced dry eye is a condition which occurs in otherwise asymptomatic individuals in certain situations, for example with the use of computers, in overheated or air conditioned workplaces and in conditions of low humidity. The most common ocular complaints associated with these environments are burning, dryness, stinging, and grittiness. Although the exact cause of these symptoms is unknown, it is thought that increased tear evaporation rate due to low humidity plays a vital role. The changes in tear film physiology, which occurs in these environments, have traditionally been dealt with by the use of eye drops (particularly the highly viscous variety), which have been shown to be an effective therapeutic option in the treatment of environmental dry eye disease. Previous studies of the use of eye-drops of various formulations has shown improvements in tear physiology in mild to moderate dry eye patients with their use in both acute and chronic application protocols. In this study, an attempt was made to relate the effects on tear physiology induced by variations in environmental conditions to the beneficial effect produced by the use of eye-drops.</detailed_description>
