	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine whether multispectral imaging increases the diagnostic accuracy of the current standard of high-definition white-light endoscopy for the detection of Barrett's-associated neoplasia (high grade dysplasia or cancer). The investigators goal is to develop a multispectral endoscopic platform that can be used to survey a large surface area and, potentially, serve as a 'red flag' for microendoscopic imaging of small areas. The goal of this pilot study is to preliminarily determine the accuracy of these modalities during the endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus.</brief_summary>
