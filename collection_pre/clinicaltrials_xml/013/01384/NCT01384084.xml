	<brief_summary>The investigators have performed colposacropexy in women with uterovaginal prolapse for many years with satisfactory results. This study was designed to compare whether, in the treatment of patients with uro-genital prolapse and urinary incontinence, the addition of a contemporary anti-incontinence procedure such as mini-sling is associated with a reduction of post-operative urinary incontinence (correction of pre-existent urinary incontinence and prevention of masked urinary incontinence).</brief_summary>
