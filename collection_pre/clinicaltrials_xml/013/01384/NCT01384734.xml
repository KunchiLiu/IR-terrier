	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of four doses of BMS-663068 with Raltegravir (RAL) + Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF). At least 1 dose of BMS-663068 can be identified which is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious when combined with RAL + TDF for treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects.</brief_summary>
