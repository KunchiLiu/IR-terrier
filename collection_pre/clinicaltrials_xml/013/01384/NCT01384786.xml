	<brief_summary>Patients with hyperthyroidism and/or goiter are evaluated with blood samples and scintiscan before they are treated with radioiodine for their thyroid disease. Because the investigators do not get a histologically/final diagnosis the investigators want to make sure, that the patients treated do not have a thyroid cancer when treated.
