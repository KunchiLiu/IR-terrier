	<brief_summary>This is an open label safety and tolerability continuation study of intracerebroventricular administration of sNN0029, containing the growth factor VEGF165, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that have previously participated in study sNN0029-001. The intention of the study is to investigate safety and tolerability of intracerebroventricular administration of sNN0029 and whether it can improve motor function and prolong survival in patients with ALS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised WFN El Escorial criteria (Appendix B). 2. Previous participation in study sNN0029001 with completion of 12 weeks study drug administration. 3. To have completed the investigations associated with safety in study sNN0029001 without development of clinically significant safety concerns. 4. Patient has been given written and verbal information about the continuation study, has had the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and procedural commitments. 5. Patient has given oral and / or signed consent (written) to participate in the study. In the event that a patient who gives oral informed consent is not physically able to sign the informed consent form (ICF) due to disease progression, a witness may sign the ICF on the patient's behalf. 1. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic. 2. Proliferative retinopathy. 3. Nonproliferative retinopathy of moderate severity or higher. 4. Concurrent clinically significant dementia as determined by the investigator. 5. Concurrent clinically significant depression as determined by the investigator. 6. Need for administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication (e.g. aspirin, Plavix, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Low dose aspirin or occasional use of NSAIDs is allowed (See Appendix E). 7. Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters as assessed by the investigator. 8. For female patients, ongoing pregnancy or planned pregnancy 9. Breast feeding</criteria>
