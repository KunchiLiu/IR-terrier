	<criteria>Provision of written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures. Men and women aged 18 or older. Histologically or cytologically confirmed neoplasm causing pain and requiring management with opioids. Selfreported active symptoms of OIC at screening (&lt;3 RFBMs/week and experiencing &gt;1 reported symptom of hard/lumpy stools, straining, or sensation of incomplete evacuation/anorectal obstruction in at least 25% of BMs over the previous 4 weeks); and Documented confirmed OIC (&lt;3 RFBMs/week on average aver the 2week OIC confirmation period. Receiving a stable maintenance opioid regimen consisting of a total daily dose of &gt;30 mg of oral morphine, or equianalgesic amount(s) of 1 or more opioid therapies for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening for cancerrelated pain with no anticipated change in opioid dose requirement over the proposed study period as a result of disease progression. Patients receiving Opioid regimen for treatment of pain other than related to cancer. Any condition that may have affected the permeability of the bloodbrain barrier, eg, known brain metastases, meningeal metastases, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, recent brain injury, uncontrolled epilepsy. Patients with cancerrelated pain due to ovarian cancer, leukaemia, or lymphoma are excluded. Patients with multiple myeloma will be allowed.
