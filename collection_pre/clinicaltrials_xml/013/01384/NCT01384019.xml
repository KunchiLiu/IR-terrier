	<brief_summary>The investigators examined the mechanism underlying the lack of benefit from distal protection and thrombus aspiration (DP-TA) in 126 patients with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) in a prospective, randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Distal Protection Device in ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with first-diagnosed STEMI were randomly assigned to distal protection and thrombus aspiration (DP-TA) pretreatment during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or conventional PCI (c-PCI). The primary endpoint was the remodeling index (RI), measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) post-PCI and 6 months after PCI. Secondary endpoints, determined by CMR within 3 to 5 days after PCI, included the infarct ratio (infarct size to entire left ventricular [LV] size ) by delayed-enhancement (DE), area at risk (AAR) ratio (AAR to LV size) by T2 high-signal intensity , microvascular occlusion index (MVO) ratio (MVO to LV size) by DE, and myocardial salvage index (MSI, [AAR-infarct size] x 100/AAR).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>30 and less than 80 years presenting with STEMI more than 30 minutes but less than 12 hours after symptom onset with ≥ 2 mm of STsegment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads or with a presumably new left bundlebranch block for whom primary PCI was intended included thrombolytic therapy before PCI; spontaneous restoration of coronary flow (&gt; TIMI grade II or III); cardiogenic shock (Killip class IV); major surgery or active bleeding within 6 weeks; aspirin, thienopyridine, or heparin allergy; neutropenia (&lt;1000 neutrophils/mm3), thrombocytopenia (&lt;100000 platelets/mm3), hepatic dysfunction, or renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt;2.5 mg/dL [221 μmol/L]); noncardiac condition with expected survival less than 1 year; current participation in other investigations.</criteria>
