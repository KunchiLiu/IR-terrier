	<brief_title>An Algorithm for Intra-operative Goal-directed Haemodynamic Management in Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a systematic literature search a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm was created. The algorithm was adapted to international standards and consensus was reached through a modified Delphi method at international meetings. The feasibility of using the algorithm for intraoperative haemodynamic management was tested and the resultant clinical data analyzed retrospectively for several types of surgery with the hypothesis that the goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm is feasible in the clinical setting and can improve clinical outcome.</detailed_description>
