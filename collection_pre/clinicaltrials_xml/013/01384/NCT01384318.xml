	<brief_summary>In common clinical practice, one means of ensuring an acceptable cuff pressure in endotracheal tubes (ETT) is to hold continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 20-25 cmH2O and inflate the cuff of the ETT until no gas leak is noted around the cuff. The purpose of this study is to validate this technique by checking the intracuff pressure using a manometer after the cuff is inflated using the CPAP technique.</brief_summary>
