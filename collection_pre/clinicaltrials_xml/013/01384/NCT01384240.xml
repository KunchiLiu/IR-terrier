	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to obtain data to evaluate whether high-resolution imaging of the colon can assist clinicians in detecting dysplastic (precancerous) and neoplastic areas. This is a pilot study of a novel technology, a miniaturized microscope device which can be used during standard endoscopy to image the gastrointestinal epithelium. Theoretically, by visualizing superficial mucosal changes at a high-resolution and magnification, the investigators will be able to obtain optical images that can be used to guide endoscopic biopsy and polypectomy. This may foster the selective targeting of dysplasia/neoplasia, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.</brief_summary>
