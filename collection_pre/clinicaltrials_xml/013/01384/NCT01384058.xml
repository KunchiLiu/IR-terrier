	<brief_summary>It is of interest how ezetimibe alone or in combination with statin may influence atherogenic dense Low Density Lipoprotein (dLDL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary objective of this study will be whether there is a change of the concentrations of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in dLDL from baseline in each of the 3 treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ezetimibe or Simvastatin or Both on Low Densitiy Lipoprotein -Subfractions in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selective cholesterol resorption inhibitor ezetimibe belongs to a new class of cholesterol lowering drugs. It is of interest how ezetimibe alone or in combination with statin may influence atherogenic dense Low Density Lipoprotein (dLDL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary objective of this study will be whether there is a change of the concentrations of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in dLDL from baseline in each of the 3 treatment groups. The comparison between treatment groups is exploratory due to insufficient power to detect any change between treatments.</detailed_description>
