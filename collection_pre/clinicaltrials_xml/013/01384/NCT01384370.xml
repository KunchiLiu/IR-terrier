	<brief_summary>In both the ASC-US Study and Adjunct Study populations, the objectives are to: - evaluate the performance characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay for detecting cervical disease in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results and - evaluate the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay to detect HPV high-risk types 16, 18, and 45 in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay on the TIGRIS DTS System in Women With ASC-US or Negative Pap Test Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay (AHPV-GT Assay) is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection of E6/E7 viral messenger RNA (mRNA) of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18 and 45 in cervical specimens from women with positive results in the APTIMA HPV Assay. The AHPV-GT Assay can differentiate between samples positive for HPV 16 from those positive for HPV 18 and/or 45, but does not differentiate between HPV 18-positive samples and HPV 45-positive samples. Cervical specimens collected in ThinPrep Pap Test vials containing PreservCyt Solution (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, Massachusetts) with commercially available collection devices (broom-type collection device or cytobrush/spatula combination) may be tested with the AHPV-GT Assay either pre- or post-Pap processing. The assay is used with the TIGRIS DTS (TIGRIS) System. In both the ASC-US Study and Adjunct Study populations, the objectives are to: - evaluate the performance characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay for detecting cervical disease in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results and - evaluate the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay to detect HPV high-risk types 16, 18, and 45 in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>â€¢ the subject attended a colposcopy visit, and the referral Pap sample had a valid APTIMA HPV Assay result, and the sample had an APTIMA HPV Assay positive result, or the sample had an APTIMA HPV Assay negative result and the subject had a consensus histology result of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 [CIN2] or more severe (eg, CIN2, CIN grade 3 [CIN3], or cervical cancer; "CIN2+"), or the sample had an APTIMA HPV Assay negative result and the subject had a consensus histology result of normal or CIN grade 1 (&lt;CIN2) and was randomly selected for inclusion. the referral Pap sample had a valid APTIMA HPV Assay result, and the sample had an APTIMA HPV Assay positive result, or the sample had an APTIMA HPV Assay negative result and the subject had a consensus histology result of CIN2+, or the sample had an APTIMA HPV Assay negative result and the subject had a consensus histology result of &lt;CIN2 and was randomly selected for inclusion. Samples from evaluable subjects meeting the sample inclusion criteria will not be tested with the AHPVGT Assay if there is insufficient volume for AHPVGT Assay testing or the sample was deemed unsuitable for testing (eg, stored under unacceptable conditions).</criteria>
