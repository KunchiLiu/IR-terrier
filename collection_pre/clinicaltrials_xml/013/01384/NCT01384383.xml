	<criteria>Males and females 1870 years of age Chronic HCV infection Subjects must have liver biopsy results (≤ 3 years prior to screening) indicating the absence of cirrhosis. Alternatively a noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy (such as FibroTest, FibroScan, or Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse imaging) within 6 months of Screening in countries where allowed Monoinfection with HCV genotype 1a or 1b HCV RNA &gt; 10^4 IU/mL at Screening IL28B CC genotype HCV treatment naïve Candidate for PEG/RBV therapy Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 36 kg/m2 Creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min Agree to use two forms of highly effective contraception methods for the duration of the study and for 7 months after the last dose study medication. Females of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test at Screening and Baseline Exceed defined thresholds for key laboratory parameters at Screening Diagnosis of autoimmune disease, decompensated liver disease, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, significant psychiatric illness, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancy (with exception of certain skin cancers), hemoglobinopathy, retinal disease, or are immunosuppressed Subjects with current use of amphetamines, cocaine, opiates (e.g., morphine, heroin), or ongoing alcohol abuse are excluded. Subjects on stable methadone maintenance treatment for at least 6 months prior to Screening may be included into the study Use of prohibited concomitant medications two weeks prior to baseline through the end of treatment</criteria>
