	<brief_title>Pentoxiphylline and Vitamin E Versus Vitamin E in Patients With Non- Alcoholic Steatohepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to randomise 120 patients of biopsy proven NASH into cases and control groups. Baseline investigations: Clinical characteristics - Age - Gender - Anthropometry (BMI, waist circumference, waist- hip ratio, triceps skin fold thickness, mid arm circumference) - Alcohol intake should be nil Laboratory characteristics - Hemogram, INR, KFT - LFT (especially ALT, GGT) , APRI (AST to platelet ratio) - Fasting Lipid Profile - Other possible etiologies of liver disease (viral markers, ferritin, ANA, IgG, ceruloplasmin ) - HOMA-IR (II) - Serum uric acid levels Liver stiffness - Fibroscan - MR elastography Radiological characteristics - USG abdomen Variceal status by UGI endoscopy Alpha fetoprotein Pro- inflammatory markers - TNF-alpha, IL-6, adiponectin, leptin and osteopontin Liver biopsy and NAS score</detailed_description>
