	<brief_summary>This study seeks to obtain normal samples of blood, saliva and urine to serve as controls for other approved protocols and for analysis. These include determination of the functional capabilities of cells, proteins, nucleic acids and microvesicles obtained from peripheral blood including plasma, serum and cellular fraction from normal individuals. Saliva and urine will have similar testing which may also be compared to the blood testing results. The ongoing objective varies from investigation to investigation but in general the investigational goals are to better understand the immune function of normal volunteers and compare it to immune function in disease states.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood will be obtained via peripheral venipuncture. The blood will be divided into components (e.g. plasma, serum, microvesicles, and cells) then analyzed. Flow cytometry will be used to determine cell and microvesicle subsets. RNA will be extracted from the various components of blood and will be subjected to gene and microRNA profiling to determine gene expression. DNA will be isolated from the cells to be used in studies investigating epigenetic regulation of genes identified in the screens. Protein will also be isolated from the multiple components to examine the impact of genetic regulation by epigenetic mechanisms or microRNA on protein expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be placed in tissue culture for study. Saliva and urine will be obtained the same day as blood for testing.</detailed_description>
