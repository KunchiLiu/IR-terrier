	<brief_summary>In order for a tumour to grow and spread to other parts of the body, it needs to have a blood supply. Certain proteins in the body, called cytokines or growth factors, have been shown to cause the growth of new blood vessels that supply tumours and therefore help the tumour to grow and spread. Motesanib (AMG 706) prevents these proteins from working, and may help to prevent the growth of tumours. In the first part of this study, we will look at the way your body absorbs this drug into your blood, how your body changes and breaks down the drug, and then how the drug leaves your body in your urine and faeces. In order to provide potential treatment benefit for the subjects who participated in the first part of the study, the second part of the study will allow subjects to continue on motesanib (AMG 706) treatment. The estimated length of this part of the study is unknown, and dependent on how subjects respond to motesanib (AMG 706).</brief_summary>

Subjects with irregular bowel habits (more than 3/day or less than 1 every 2 days). Subjects who will not refrain from taking herbal/ complementary therapies (which have the potential to alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of the [14C]AMG 706) for 7 days before first dosing, and for the duration of the ADME part of the study.
