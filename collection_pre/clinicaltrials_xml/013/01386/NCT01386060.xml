	<detailed_description>Subjects will first undergo a phone screening, and if eligible, they will complete three study visits at Week 1, Week 8, and Week 15. The study visits involve at-home surveys, voice recordings, physical measures (height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and blood pressure), EEG recordings (including recordings of electrodermal activity and heart rate variability), computer tasks, in-lab saliva collection, overnight urine collection, 2-day saliva collection at bed waking, 30 minutes post-waking, afternoon, and bedtime, and a small handheld device that randomly administers eight short assessments in the subjects' natural environment. Subjects will be randomized to receive a 6-week mindfulness meditation course either between the first and second study visits or between the second and third study visits. Participants who receive training during the first and second visits will continue meditating until the third visit. The one-on-one instruction occurs once a week for 1 Â½ hours, and participants are asked to listen to guided meditations and do other mindfulness-based tasks on a daily basis between sessions.</detailed_description>
