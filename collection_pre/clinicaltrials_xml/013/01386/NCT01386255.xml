	<brief_summary>Despite the use of proton pump inhibitors and available prokinetics, medical therapy is ineffective in an important number of children with CP and GERD, and failure of medical therapy is associated with a substantial morbidity. Many patients, particularly children with CP and GERD, continue to experience complications despite aggressive therapy because antisecretory medications do not address the primary reflux mechanism (TLESR). Furthermore, in patients with CP, surgical options are fraught with serious complications and long-term morbidity. Because the available treatment options for children with CP and intractable GERD are limited, new therapies are urgently needed. Baclofen, which has been shown in animals and humans to decrease TLESRs, may be a good alternative for the treatment of children with CP with intractable GERD.</brief_summary>
