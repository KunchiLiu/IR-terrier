	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vorinostat and bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether vorinostat is more effective when given alone or when given together with bortezomib in treating patients with refractory or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well vorinostat works when given alone compared with vorinostat given together with bortezomib in treating patients with refractory or recurrent stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat With or Without Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Stage IIB, Stage III, or Stage IV Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine if the combination of bortezomib plus vorinostat (SAHA) is more effective than vorinostat alone, in terms of prolonging progression-free survival, in patients with stage IIB-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have failed prior therapy. Secondary - To determine the overall survival of these patients. - To determine the response rate in these patients. - To determine the time to progression in these patients. - To determine the duration of response in these patients. - To determine the incidence of second cancers in these patients. - To determine the acute and late toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - To determine if translational research may provide insight into disease mechanism and identify biomarkers useful for prediction of treatment response. (Exploratory) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides vs erythrodermic mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs ≥ 2), and country. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and tissue samples are collected periodically for translational research to provide insight into disease mechanism and identify biomarkers useful for prediction of treatment response. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease progression.</detailed_description>
