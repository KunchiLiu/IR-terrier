	<brief_title>Safety Study of Bone Marrow Cell Concentrate Prepared Using the Magellan System to Treat Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical limb ischemia (CLI) continues to be an important cause of atherosclerotic morbidity and mortality despite conventional therapies. Modulation of angiogenesis is a promising alternative to surgical revascularization. Trials of isolated angiogenic growth factor therapies using recombinant proteins or gene transfer have been conducted, but with disappointing results because it is unlikely that a single angiogenic factor is solely or even primarily responsible for angiogenesis. Emerging stem cell therapies represent a new approach to the modulation of angiogenesis. Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) hold promise because they can reproduce a pro-angiogenic milieu in the ischemic limb rather than upregulate a single angiogenic factor. For this CLI study, the Magellan® System is utilized for the preparation of autologous cell concentrate at the point of care. The bone marrow aspirate is obtained from the patient and concentrated with the cell concentration kit, and delivered intramuscularly to the affected limb for the treatment of impaired ischemic tissue in order to improve perfusion, reduce pain and revascularize tissues in patients who have inadequate tissue blood flow, prohibitive medical comorbidities, or failed previous treatments for revascularization for the prevention of amputation.</detailed_description>
