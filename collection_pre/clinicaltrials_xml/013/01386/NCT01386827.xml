	<brief_summary>The old mouse brain derived Japanese encephalitis vaccines (MBJEV) have been reported to cause serious adverse effects and are therefore replaced with the novel Ixiaro vaccine. The present study investigates whether vaccinees primed with MBJEV can be boosted with Ixiaro. Travellers receiving Japanese encephalitis vaccines are enrolled for a follow-up of immune responses in four groups: A) primary immunization with BMJEV, B) primary and secondary immunizations with MBJEV, C) primary immunizations with Ixiaro and S) Primary immunization with MBJEV and secondary immunization with Ixiaro. Immune responses are followed with help of serum samples collected before and after vaccination.</brief_summary>
