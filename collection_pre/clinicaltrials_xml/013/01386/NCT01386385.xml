	<brief_summary>This phase I/II partially randomized trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with radiation therapy, carboplatin, and paclitaxel and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy, carboplatin, and paclitaxel are more effective with or without veliparib in treating non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib With or Without Radiation Therapy, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel in Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose of ABT-888 (veliparib) when given concurrently with standard carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To assess whether carboplatin/paclitaxel plus ABT-888 compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel plus placebo improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. (Phase II) III. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy plus ABT-888 to those treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiotherapy plus placebo. (Phase II) IV. To assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) and disease control rate in the subset of patients with measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. (Phase II) V. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the regimen. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect tumor tissue from pretreatment biopsies (archival samples) for biomarker studies, including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) activity by measuring the levels of poly-ADP-ribose, gamma-H2A histone family, member X (gamma-H2AX), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair enzymes such as excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 1 (ERCC1)/x-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 (XRCC1). II. To collect blood samples for evaluation of gamma-H2AX (circulating tumor cells) and other relevant future studies. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a randomized phase II study. PHASE I: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) once daily (QD), 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Patients also receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-43 and carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 36, and 43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without disease progression after completion of chemoradiotherapy undergo consolidation therapy. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning within 4-6 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7 (course 1) and 22-28 (course 2) and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and on day 22 of course 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients undergo 3D-CRT and receive veliparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as in Phase I induction and consolidation therapy. ARM II: Patients undergo 3D-CRT as in arm I. Patients also receive placebo PO BID on days 1-43 and carboplatin and paclitaxel as in Phase I. Within 4-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, patients receive placebo on days 1-7 and carboplatin and paclitaxel as in Phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for first 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologicallyproven new diagnosis of unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB*, nonsmall cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or mixed) Per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition, pleural and pericardial are now considered stage M1a disease; when pleural fluid is visible on the computed tomography (CT) scan or on a chest xray, a thoracentesis is required to confirm that the pleural fluid is cytologically negative; patients with exudative pleural effusions are excluded, regardless of cytology; patients with effusions that are minimal (i.e. not visible on chest xray) that are too small to safely tap are eligible; a small effusion that has positive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) has to be proven to be malignant per standard of care diagnostic procedures for the patient to be excluded Patients must have measurable or nonmeasurable disease documented by CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or PET/CT; the CT from a combined PET/CT may be used to document only nonmeasurable disease unless the scan is of diagnostic quality; measurable disease must be assessed by CT within 28 days prior to registration; pleural effusions, ascites and laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only evidence of disease; nonmeasurable disease must be assessed within 42 days prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form Patients with brain metastases are ineligible; all patients must have a pretreatment CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for central nervous system (CNS) disease within 42 days prior to registration Patients must not have received any prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy or other biologic therapy) for lung cancer Patients must not have received prior chest radiation therapy for NSCLC Patients must not have had a previous surgical resection; however, patients may have undergone exploratory thoracotomy, mediastinoscopy, excisional biopsy or similar surgery for the purpose of determining the diagnosis, stage or potential resectability of newly diagnosed lung tumor;
