	<brief_summary>This study will look at the permeability, or 'leakiness' of the airway epithelium (the inner lining of the lung) in asthmatic patients. Increased leakiness of this lining has been shown in asthmatic patients by other studies, not only in the lung but also possibly in the gut, perhaps reflecting a widespread defect. This leakiness may underline the interaction between the environment and a person's genetic make up, and may contribute to why some people get asthma, and how severe it is. Increased leakiness may allow increased exposure to inhaled allergic substances, helping to perpetuate the inflammation in the lungs that is a hallmark of asthma. Specifically, this study will attempt to modify and reduce this permeability through the use of a substance called 'keratinocyte growth factor', or 'kgf'. KGF is a naturally occuring human protein, which is involved in stimulating the growth of cells lining the layers of the skin and gut, helping to repair damage and maintain their structure. It has been manufactured in a laboratory as the commercial compound 'Palifermin', which has already been used in humans to reduce damage to the lining of the mouth after chemotherapy. The study will see if Palifermin can similarly improve the lining of the lung in asthma patients and improve their symptoms. To date no treatments have been used in this area in asthma, and if successful the study will open up a whole new area of therapy</brief_summary>
