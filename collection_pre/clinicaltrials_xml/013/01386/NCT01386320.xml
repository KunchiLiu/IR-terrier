	<brief_summary>Forefoot surgery includes bunion surgery and similar reconstructive bone cutting surgery and is very painful. Local anaesthetic nerve blocks have been used for many years to help alleviate pain following this surgery. The present study aims to compare a new ultrasound guided nerve block to a well established nerve stimulator guided technique. Comparisons will include time taken to carry out the block, speed of onset of numbness and duration and quality of pain relief after surgery.</brief_summary>
