	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective, randomized, pilot study is compare ease of tracheal intubation, amount of microaspiration and efficacy of secretion removal using three FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-cleared endotracheal tubes (ETT) after the induction of general anesthesia in the operating room (OR). Studies in the intensive care unit (ICU) have demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of ventilator acquired pneumonia when a ETT with suction above the cuff is used to remove secretions that accumulate above the inflated cuff. This will be the first study to evaluate the efficacy of above the cuff suctioning during general anesthesia and surgery. One hundred and ten adult patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery (general, colorectal or gynecological) requiring general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation will be randomized into 3 groups to receive one of the following three endotracheal tubes: 1. Teleflex ISIS HVT Cuffed Tracheal Tube with Subglottic Secretion Suction Port Endotracheal Tube (Teleflex ISIS ETT). 2. Mallinckrodt TaperGuard Evac Endotracheal Tube (TaperGuard Evac ETT). 3. Mallinckrodt Intermediate Hi-Lo Endotracheal Tube. (Standard ETT) The first two groups will be compared to standard ETT (third group) regarding easy of tracheal intubation, efficacy of suctioning of secretions, efficacy of sealing the trachea with an inflated ETT cuff by preventing the movement of test dye (methylene blue) from the pharynx into the trachea and incidence of post-operative respiratory complications.</brief_summary>
