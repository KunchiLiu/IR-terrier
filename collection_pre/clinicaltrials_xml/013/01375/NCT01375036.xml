	<criteria>Key Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study. Current participant or willingness to participate in the CFF patient registry database ≥ 6 years of age Subject has CF as diagnosed by one of the following Documented sweat chloride ≥ 60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test, or Two wellcharacterized genetic mutations in the CFTR gene, or Abnormal nasal potential difference (NPD) AND accompanying clinical characteristics consistent with CF. For subjects who lack documentation of either a positive sweat chloride test or an abnormal NPD, and who have only one wellcharacterized genetic mutation of the CFTR gene, the diagnosis of CF is determined by the Investigator. FEV1 ≥ 25% predicted and ≤ 90% predicted. ≥ 2 lower respiratory tract cultures positive for PA with results documented in the subject's medical history. Subject must be able to provide written informed consent/assent prior to any study related procedure; parent/guardian must be able to give written informed consent as necessary prior to any study related procedure. Key Subjects who meet the following exclusion criterion are not to be enrolled in this study. • Any serious active medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with subject assessment.
