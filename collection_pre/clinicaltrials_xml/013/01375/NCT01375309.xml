	<brief_summary>Probiotic supplementation to preterm infants have been reported to be beneficial in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Our pilot study also showed accelerated feeding in preterm infants who received Bifidobacterium bifidum early after birth. In order to evaluate these beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium bifidum, a prospective randomized control study is conducted. The hypothesis of the study is that Bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to preterm infants improve enteral feeding and growth in very low birth weight infants.</brief_summary>
