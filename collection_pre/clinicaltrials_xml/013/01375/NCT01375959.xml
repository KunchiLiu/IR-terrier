	<brief_summary>Resveratrol is a substance found in many plants, including grapes and red wine, which is widely used as a nutritional supplement. Studies in cells and lower animals show that resveratrol has many potential benefits, including prolonging lifespan, preventing cancer and heart disease and normalization of glucose metabolism. Although use of this agent shows great promise in the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes, there have been no studies reported to date in humans. As an initial step, this proposal is for a 6 week pilot study of resveratrol treatment in older adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in order to explore its effects on post-meal blood glucose metabolism. Preliminary studies will also be conducted to explore how resveratrol works by studying cellular function (in muscle samples obtained from study participants) and by testing resveratrol's effect on blood vessel function.</brief_summary>
