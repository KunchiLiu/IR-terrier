	<brief_summary>Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) has been proven to improve outcomes in patients with significant coronary artery diseae(&gt; 70% lumen diameter narrowing). But, acute coronary syndrome may occur in those with intermediate lesions(50%-70% lumen diameter narrowing), and the effect of SES in these patients remains unclear. Here the investigators hypothesize that application of China-made SES may improve the clinical outcomes in these setting.</brief_summary>
