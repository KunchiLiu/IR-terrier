	<brief_summary>Aspirin is the only anti-platelet medication used at the acute phase of ischemic stroke. The investigators would like to study laboratory effect of the first oral 300 mg dose of aspirin, given at hospital, after an ischemic event. The principal hypothesis is that platelet activity would be able to recover during this day and could lead to ischemic recurrences. Two blood samples are accomplished. The first 2 hours after aspirin intake and the second 23 hours after. Photometric aggregometry are performed with arachidonic acid and collagen induced platelet aggregation, measure of thromboxan B2 levels and reticular platelets count.</brief_summary>
