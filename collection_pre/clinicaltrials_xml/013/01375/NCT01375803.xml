	<brief_summary>This study will critically evaluate the effects of a novel dietary fiber administered to subjects at high risk for developing diabetes to determine if this intervention will improve insulin sensitivity compared to control product administration and, thus, decrease risk for developing diabetes. The hypothesis is that consuming this novel fiber twice a day for 12 weeks will significantly decrease fasting plasma glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin values in pre-diabetic subjects (i.e. subjects with fasting plasma glucose levels 95-140 mg/dl at screening) compared to consumption of the control product.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female of any racial/ethnic group; able to read, comprehend, and write English at a sufficient level to complete studyrelated materials Age: at least 30 and no more than 70 years at randomization into this trial BMI: 2540 kg/m2 at randomization into this trial Fasting blood glucose: 95140 mg/dl (for those with glucose 9599mg/dl, must have history of gestational diabetes or first degree relative (parent or sibling) with history of diabetes; for those with glucose 100125 mg/dl, will be enrolled as the primary target for recruitment; for those with glucose 126140 mg/dl (asymptomatic diabetes), must not have prior diagnosis of diabetes and must not have prior treatment/pharmacotherapy for diabetes) Good general health as evidenced by the medical history Blood chemistry and urinalysis results within normal ranges or within an acceptable range determined by the physician on site and/or in consultation with the Medical Monitor Available and willing to participate in the study for up to 15 weeks Willing to follow a weightmaintaining Lifestyle diet throughout the 12 week trial, maintain physical activity patterns at baseline levels throughout the study period, and not add new exercise routines, dietary supplements, vitamins or other unusual food products Willing to consume two 16 oz beverages every day with meals for 12 weeks and able to transport the test article Presence of any condition the Investigator believes would interfere with subject's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, or which might confound the interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk Food allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study product (e.g. Gluten sensitivity, celiac disease) Participation in another clinical trial that might interfere with this trial or exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to first visit History of diabetes (subjects with a prior history of gestational diabetes may be enrolled if they had no pharmacologic treatment for diabetes since pregnancy) Treatment for diabetes or a related condition (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome) with metformin, an oral agent, or insulin or other injections used for diabetes management Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg, or a diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 mmHg based on an average of 3 readings sitting) Fasting serum triglyceride value &gt;250 mg/dl (since changes in triglyceride values can affect glucose homeostasis) Untreated hypothyroidism with a TSH &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for the test laboratory with repeat value that also exceeds this limit Recent history of weight loss (&gt;4 kg in the past 3 months) or a significant variation in weight (&gt;4 kg in the past 3 months, for example, due to a medical condition such as pregnancy, or hormonal therapy) Use of medications or herbal remedies for weight loss (e.g., sibutramine, orlistat, amphetamines, phentermine, and ma huang) or use of these substances within the past 3 months Current or recent history (past 12 months) of drug, alcohol or chemical abuse. Alcohol abuse will be defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz hard liquor) Pregnant, breastfeeding or female of childbearing potential who is unwilling to commit to the use of a medically approved form of contraception throughout the study period.</criteria>
