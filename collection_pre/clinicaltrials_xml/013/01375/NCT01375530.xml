	<brief_summary>Background: - The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health needs healthy volunteers for vaccine clinical trials. These trials will allow researchers to study vaccines and injection devices. These studies will also allow researchers to understand the immune system and how vaccines work. In this protocol, researchers will screen healthy volunteers for these future trials. Objectives: - To screen healthy volunteers for clinical trials at the NIAID. Eligibility: - Healthy people between 18 and 70 years of age. They must be available to take part in clinical trials and be able to provide blood for research studies. Design: - Screening for a clinical trial may begin several months before the vaccine clinical trial begins. - Volunteers will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They may also answer questions about sexual activity and drug use. - Volunteers will provide blood samples and possibly urine samples. They may have other tests as needed for the study. - Volunteers will not receive any treatment in this screening trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to screen potential study volunteers to determine if they are eligible for clinical trials of investigational products conducted by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH. Educational materials on the investigational products and protocols will be reviewed with and provided to subjects during participation in the screening protocol. Approximately 3,000 adults, ages 18-70 years, will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
