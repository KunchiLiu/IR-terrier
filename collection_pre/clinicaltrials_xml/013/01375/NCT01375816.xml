	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposome-encapsulated irinotecan hydrochloride PEP02, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving liposome-encapsulated irinotecan hydrochloride PEP02 together with leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil is more effective than giving irinotecan hydrochloride together with leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil as second-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying liposome-encapsulated irinotecan hydrochloride PEP02 given together with leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil to see how well it works compared with giving irinotecan hydrochloride together with leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil as second-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the objective response rates (complete response and partial response) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with liposome-encapsulated irinotecan hydrochloride PEP02, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (FUPEP) Versus irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (FOLFIRI 1) or leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride-modified (FOLFIRI 3-modified). Secondary - To determine the safety of these regimens in these patients. - To determine progression-free survival of these patients. - To determine overall survival of these patients. - To assess the quality of life of these patients. - To assess the correlation of UGT1A family polymorphism and the toxicity of liposome-encapsulated irinotecan hydrochloride PEP02 or irinotecan hydrochloride. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified, in terms of prognosis, according to treatment center, prognostic score (ECOG performance status [PS] 0 and normal LDH value vs ECOG PS &gt; 1 and/or LDH &gt; 1 times upper limit of normal), and time to progression after first-line therapy (â‰¥ 9 months vs &lt; 9 months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients are assigned to either the FOLFIRI 1 or Modified FOLFIRI 3 treatment groups according to the investigator's discretion in combination with bevacizumab - FOLFIRI 1 in combination with bevacizumab: Patients receive bevacizumab over 30-90 minutes,irinotecan hydrochloride over 1 hour and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and a bolus of fluorouracil followed by fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity - Modified FOLFIRI 3 in combination with bevacizumab: Patients receive bevacizumab,irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in FOLFIRI 1. Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on day 3. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (FUPEP)in combination with bevacizumab: Patients receive bevacizumab over 30-90 minutes liposome-encapsulated irinotecan hydrochloride PEP02 IV over 60-90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacogenetic analysis of UGT1A family polymorphisms. Quality of life is assessed by using a generic scale EQ-5D and the QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline and after courses 4 and 8. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and then every 2-3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
