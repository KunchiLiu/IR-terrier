	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of the Plastizote abduction brace compared to the Pavlik harness in the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and 2) compare parent/caregiver satisfaction between the Plastizote abduction brace and the Pavlik harness. The investigators hope to learn which brace treatment is best for a definable population so the appropriate brace can be chosen initially avoiding the time, expense, and frustration of a failed technique.</brief_summary>
