	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate the effect of gastrectomy on remission of type 2 diabetes in patients with gastric cancer and type 2 diabetes, to investigate the mechanism of blood glucose alteration and intestinal hormonal signaling by the reconstruction methods, and to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose: - To investigate the effect of gastrectomy on remission of type 2 diabetes in patients with gastric cancer and type 2 diabetes - To investigate the mechanism of blood glucose alteration and intestinal hormonal signaling by the reconstruction methods - To evaluate the applicability and efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with diabetes Contents: - Evaluation of the status of diabetes in gastric cancer patients with DM after gastrectomy - Comparison of two reconstruction types after gastrectomy Bypass duodenum and upper jejunum: Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy Preservation of duodenal passage: Gastroduodenostomy - Analysis for biochemical markers reflecting diabetic status: fasting glucose, postprandial 2h glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, lipid profile - Correlation of parameters associated with diabetes and GI hormones - Measurement of GI hormones which have an effect on glucose tolerance - Insulin, glucagon, IGF-1, GLP-1, Neuropeptide Y, Ghrelin, Leptin - Correlation of reconstruction methods, parameters of diabetes and GI hormone levels - Evaluation of mechanism of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy on controlling diabetes - Evaluation of Feasibility of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in gastric cancer surgery in patients with DM - Degree of high blood glucose control, the amount of antidiabetic medication, costs for DM treatment, quality of life assessment - Analysis for the mechanism of gastrointestinal physiology to diabetes control</detailed_description>
