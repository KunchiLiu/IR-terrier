	<brief_title>Effect of Self Regulation With Mindfulness Training on Body Mass Index and Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is associated with deficits in self regulation. Approaches that foster increased non-judgmental present moment awareness and increased acceptance have been demonstrated to enhance self regulation. One commonly used approach that synthesizes these concepts is mindfulness training. This study is designed to assess the effect of a mindfulness training program with special focus on diet and nutrition, on body mass index, cardiovascular risk markers, peripheral blood telomere length and telomerase levels in obese adults. The mindfulness training program is adapted from the Attention and Interpretation Therapy developed by study investigators at Mayo Clinic. The study is designed as a 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial involving 40 obese adults and their partners/spouses with standard dietary counseling as the control intervention. Promising feasibility and efficacy data from the study will prompt us to pursue a larger, multi-center trial to more definitively test this program as well as apply this intervention in clinical practice.</detailed_description>
