	<detailed_description>Constipation is a common problem affecting approximately 17% of the general population in Europe. Several reports suggest that production of hard or lumpy stools (HLS) is strongly associated with the development of constipation. HLS are produced not only by chronic constipated patient but also by healthy population. Thus, reducing the incidence of HLS might be beneficial in terms of reducing the incidence of constipation in healthy population. The results of two clinical studies conducted in Europe indicate the positive effect of fermented milk (FM) containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) to modulate the hardness or dryness of stools. Koebnick et al. (2003) reported that consumption of the FM drink containing LcS decreased the occurrence of hard or lumpy stools, and improved the severity of constipation in patients with chronic constipation in Germany. An open trial conducted in Ghent, Belgium used commercially available FM containing LcS (Yakult® Light) in subjects who frequently had hard or lumpy stools, screened by an average Bristol Stool Form Scale (BS) score &lt; 3.0. After 3 weeks of treatment, the proportion of subjects who produced hard or lumpy stools (BS score = 1 or 2) ≥ 25% of bowel movements decreased from 73.7% at baseline to 36.8%, while in the non-intervention control group the proportion increased from 75.0% to 85.0% during the same period. Based on the results of those studies, it was anticipated that LcS might assist in reducing the production of hard or lumpy stools in the general population. In order to confirm the efficacy in healthy population, a randomised, double blind, placebo control study is required.</detailed_description>
