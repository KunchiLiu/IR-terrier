	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a proof of concept of KRP203 for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical benefit of KRP203 in subjects with moderately active refractory ulcerative colitis. The study will provide safety and tolerability data in this subject population up to eight weeks of treatment with KRP203. Additionally, this study will evaluate the duration of a clinical response to KRP203 by following up responding subjects for an additional 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety in Moderately Active Refractory Ulcerative Colitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KRP203 in subjects with moderately active refractory ulcerative colitis subjects. In total, approximately 72 subjects will be randomized into the study. After 30 patients have completed the 8 week treatment period with KRP203 or placebo, there will be an interim analysis to determine preliminary efficacy. The study will consist of up to 28 day screening period (day -35 to -8), baseline period (day -7 to day -1), treatment period (day 1 to day 56), follow-up period and study completion.</detailed_description>
