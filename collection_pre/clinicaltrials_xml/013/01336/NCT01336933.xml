	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy and pralatrexate works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy and Pralatrexate as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate in a Phase II study a preliminary estimate of the complete response (CR) rate of a new chemotherapy regimen involving Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Vincristine and Prednisone (CEOP) alternating with Pralatrexate (P) as front line therapy for patients with Stage II, III and IV Peripheral T-Cell NHL not otherwise specified (NOS), Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK negative), Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma, Hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma followed by an optional stem cell transplant with high dose chemotherapy and Autologous stem cell transplant. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate partial response (PR). II. To evaluate overall response (CR+PR). III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the regimen. IV. To assess the 2 year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) using this regimen. V. To assess the percentage of patients who intended to receive transplant versus those who actually proceeded with transplant. VI. To evaluate the ability to collect peripheral blood stem cells after this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3 or orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-3, and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5 (CEOP administration). Patients also receive pralatrexate IV over 3-5 minutes on days 15, 22, and 29 (P administration). Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with CR or PR, per investigators discretion, may then undergo hematopoietic stem cell collection and administration of standard preparative regimen followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years (transplant patients) or periodically.</detailed_description>

age 18 years or older (applicable to states where the age of majority is 18) Expected survival duration of &gt;= six months Karnofsky Performance Status &gt;= 70 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000 cells/mm^3, unless due to lymphoma involvement of the bone marrow Platelet Count &gt;= 100 mm^3, unless due to lymphoma involvement of the bone marrow Total bilirubin =&lt;

1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulants; if patient is on anticoagulation therapy, levels should be within therapeutic range Patients with measurable disease; patients with nonmeasurable but evaluable disease may be eligible after discussion with the principal investigator (PI); baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 6 weeks of registration to the study; abnormal positron emission tomography (PET) scans will not constitute evaluable disease, unless verified by computed tomography (CT) scan or other appropriate imaging Patients with measurable disease must have at least one objective measurable disease parameter; a clearly defined, bidimensionally measurable defect or mass measuring at least 2 cm in diameter on a CT scan will constitute measurable disease; proof of lymphoma in the liver is required by a confirmation biopsy Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding due to teratogenic effects of chemotherapy All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women Male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree follow accepted birth control measures Patient must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements Patients must be willing to give written informed consent, and sign an institutionally approved consent form before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care; with the exception of 1 cycle of chemotherapy based on current diagnosis and clinical condition, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care No serious disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the study Pregnant or breast feeding females Known positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human Tlymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1), or infectious hepatitis, type A, B or C or active hepatitis Major surgery within 2 weeks of study drug administration Prior malignancies within the past 3 years with exception of adequately treated basal cell, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast; prostate cancer of Gleason Grade 6 or less with stable prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels Patients with a diagnosis of other peripheral Tcell lymphoma (PTCL) histologies other than those specified in the inclusion criteria Contraindication to any of the required concomitant drugs or supportive treatments, including hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation and antiplatelet options, antiviral drugs, or intolerance to hydration due to preexisting pulmonary or cardiac impairment Any other clinically significant medical disease or condition laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed consent Concomitant administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole will not be allowed, since these may result in delayed clearance of pralatrexate</criteria>
