	<brief_summary>This is a single-centre, open-label prospective randomized pharmacodynamic investigation of 2 antiplatelet regimens in patients undergoing coronary intervention for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI): 1. Tirofiban bolus only or bolus followed by 2 hour infusion on top of 600 mg clopidogrel or 60 mg prasugrel. 2. Prasugrel given at 60 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitation Through Aggrastat By drOpping or Shortening Infusion Line in Patients With ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Compared to or on Top of PRasugrel Loading dOse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary hypothesis: Percentage IPA after 20uMol/ADP at 30' will be superior in the tirofiban arm (as aggregate) versus prasugrel alone arm Percentage IPA at 30' after 20uMol/ADP 90%±15 and 80%±15 in the tirofiban and prasugrel alone arm, respectively. For a power of 90% and an alpha error set at 5%, 50 patients per group have to be recruited.</detailed_description>
