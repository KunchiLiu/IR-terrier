	<brief_summary>The purpose of the National Lymphatic Disease and Lymphedema Registry is to collect health information in order to study the disease classification, natural history, and impact of Lymphatic Disease, Lymphedema and Related Disorders and its treatments and medical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Lymphatic Disease and Lymphedema Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project represents the inauguration of a National Patient Registry for Lymphatic Diseases. This project will be completed through an affiliation with the Lymphatic Research Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote research and the development of new therapies for patients with lymphatic diseases, including lymphedema. The registry will provide researchers with much-needed clinical data to study the impact of diseases of the lymphatic system, in order to develop improved treatments and find a cure for lymphatic diseases, lymphedema, and related disorders. The establishment of this initiative is a major step forward in research for direct study of groups of patients with lymphatic disease. In the future, this project will be able to be linked with a tissue bank, in which tissue and blood samples derived from patients will be made available for research into human disease states. A national patient registry and tissue/cell bank program paves the way for future clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies designed to treat lymphatic disease in human subjects.</detailed_description>
