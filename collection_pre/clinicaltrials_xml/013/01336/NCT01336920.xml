	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single agent carfilzomib in patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)+/ALK-, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma (NKL), transformed mycosis fungoides (MF) to large cell, and PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U). II. To assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of single agent carfilzomib in patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) ALK+/ALK-, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), NK-cell lymphoma (NKL), transformed mycosis fungoides (MF) to large cell, and PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U). III. To evaluate nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) activation in PTCL tumor tissue and correlate that with response to carfilzomib, a novel proteosome inhibitor, which targets NF-kappa B. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1, then every 4 months for year 2, then every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and then yearly thereafter.</detailed_description>
