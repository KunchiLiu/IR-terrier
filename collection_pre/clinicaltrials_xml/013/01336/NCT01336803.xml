	<brief_summary>This pilot trial studies the differentiation of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis with ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging procedures that allow doctors to more accurately differentiate between malignant bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis may help in diagnosing patients correctly and may result in more timely treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differentiation of Bone Sarcomas and Osteomyelitis With Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Establish magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis based on their ferumoxytol-enhancement on relatively early postcontrast T1-weighted images. II. Establish MR imaging characteristics of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis based on their ferumoxytol-enhancement on delayed postcontrast T2-weighted images. III. Establish T2-weighted MR imaging characteristics of iron labeled mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in osteonecrotic bone over time, before and after surgical core decompression and bone marrow implantation. IV. Adding a second branch for patients who can not receive ferumoxytol but still getting the MRI exam. OUTLINE: Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) and then undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI up to 1 hour after infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of a bone sarcoma or osteomyelitis Symptomatic osteonecrosis (ON) of the femur or proximal tibia with MR signal abnormalities that involve more than 50% of the respective joint surface, but no evidence of epiphyseal collapse There will be no gender/raceethnic restrictions In this pediatric &amp; adult study, the participant or parent/guardian is consented, and the patient when a minor is given an assent form and involved in the discussion as appropriate Contraindication to MRI Presence of metal implants Need for sedation or anesthesia Claustrophobia Hemosiderosis/hemochromatosis (patients can still be included in the 2nd branch without receiving ferumoxytol) There will be no restrictions regarding use of other investigational agents Patients with evidence of iron overload, hemosiderosis/hemochromatosis will be excluded for the bone sarcoma study; however, they can undergo MRI exam without ferumoxytol enhancement for the ON study History of allergic reactions to similar compounds will be obtained and patients with positive history of allergic reactions will be excluded from the study Pregnancy or nursing patients will be excluded from the study; a pregnancy test will be done prior to the MR examination for postmenarchal teenage girls, in whom pregnancy may be possible; only patients with a negative pregnancy test will be included in the study</criteria>
