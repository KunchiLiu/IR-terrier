	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab, as one new agent used in advanced esophageal carcinoma, has been shown to be effective and safe in some studies with head-neck cancers. Advanced esophageal carcinoma have poor prognosis and majority of patients resistant to chemotherapy in China. In the investigators phase II clinical trial proceeded before,the combination of paclitaxel with cisplatin showed good tolerance and efficacy to esophageal carcinoma. The investigators then initiated a prospective phase II clinical trial with Nimotuzumabplus paclitaxel/cisplatin as the 1st line treatment in advanced esophageal carcinoma to observe the efficacy and safety of the combination.</brief_summary>
