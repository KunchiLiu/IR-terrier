	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary openangle glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma; Intraocular pressure (IOP) of between 19 to 35 mmHg at any time of the day in at least one eye (designated as the study eye); On a stable medication regimen for IOP reduction one week prior to the screening visit; Best corrected visual acuity better than 20/200 (Snellen) or 1.0 (logMAR) in each eye; Sign informed consent; Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or low tolerance to any of the components of DuoTrav®; Any abnormality that would preclude the reliable performance of applanation tonometry in either eye; Infection in either eye; Conventional or laser intraocular surgery in either eye 3 months prior to screening visit; Risk for visual field or visual acuity worsening, in the opinion of the investigator; Women of childbearing potential; Pregnant or lactating women; Any condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, could interfere with participation in the study, or that could present a risk to the participant. Participation in another clinical study within 30 days before the screening visit; Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
