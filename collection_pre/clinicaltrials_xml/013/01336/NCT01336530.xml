	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, therapeutic confirmatory multicentre trial with 4 parallel treatment groups. The design is adaptive group-sequential with two interim analyses, possible sample size re-estimation after the first or second interim analysis and drop-the-loser approach. The study design was primarily chosen to show superior efficacy of Tepilta® compared to the single components and to placebo. Evaluation of safety is a secondary objective.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female ≥ 18 years. 2. Score = 0 on NRS for oesophageal pain. 3. Radiotherapy (RT) or combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) of a solid tumour in head/neck/thorax region. A minimum length of 5 cm of the oesophagus must be included in highdose radiation field. 4. Duration of RT 5 to 8 weeks. 5. Single radiation dosage of fractionated RT 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/day, of intensitymodulated RT (IMRT) 1.5 to 2.3 Gy/day, each for 5 days a week (single frequency deviations are allowed presuming that intended duration of RT remains 5 to 8 weeks). 6. First radiation in the intended radiation area. 7. Written informed consent. Randomisation criteria: 8. Appearance of oesophageal pain as follows: Score ≥ 2 on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain during main daily meals is reached at least once. 9. At least 20 Gy of the dose of radiation therapy in oesophageal area remaining. 10. Oesophageal symptoms of grade ≤ 2a according to the adapted Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE. 1. History of allergic reaction to the study medication or its excipients (i.e. aluminium or magnesium hydroxide, oxetacaine, any other ingredient of study medication). 2. Pregnancy, breastfeeding or planned pregnancy during the study. 3. Known hypermagnesaemia. 4. Known hypophosphataemia. 5. Clinically significant obstipation, as judged by the investigator. 6. Acute appendicitis. 7. Total intended radiation dose at lips and the anterior oral cavity &gt; 60% of total intended radiation dose at the swallowing process (pharynx, oesophagus). 8. Hyperfractionated RT. 9. Intended nasogastral tubes. 10. Primary tumour of the cranial base, brain, oral cavity, lips, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses. 11. Known bone metastases. 12. Reflux oesophagitis 3 months prior to the study. 13. Continuous systemic pain treatment at the beginning of RT. Systemic pain medication for oesophagitis prior to randomisation must not be taken. 14. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines, cinolone derivatives (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin), chenodesoxycholic acid, sodium fluoride, local anaesthetics (other than those used as study medication). 15. Patients relying on levothyroxine after resection of thyroid carcinoma being hypothyroid and patients relying on levothyroxine due to other reasons not being euthyroid. 16. Artificial nutrition at the beginning of radiation. 17. Drug (licit and illicit) or alcohol abuse which would interfere with the patient's proper completion of the study. 18. Exposure to an investigational product within the last 4 weeks, simultaneous exposure to another investigational product. 19. Lack of ability or willingness to give informed consent. 20. Anticipated nonavailability for study visits / procedures. 21. Lack of ability or willingness to keep patient's diary. 22. Lack of willingness to have personal study related data collected, archived or transmitted according to the protocol. 23. Vulnerable subjects.</criteria>
