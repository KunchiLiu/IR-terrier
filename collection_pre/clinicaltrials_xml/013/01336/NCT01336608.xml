	<criteria>COPD diagnosis defined by ATS/ERS Former or current smoker A measured aortic pulse wave velocity = or &gt; 11.0 m/s at Screening Pregnancy A current diagnosis of asthma alpha1antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD subjects with other and active respiratory disorders A cardiovascular event occurred in the 6 months prior to Visit 1 Current severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) and have a known ejection fraction of &lt; 30 % Clinical significant and uncontrolled hypertension Abnormal and clinical significant 12lead ECG findings at Visit 1 Have lung volume reduction or lung transplantation within 12 months prior to Visit 1 Poorly controlled COPD: Acute worsening of COPD that is managed by subject with antibiotics or corticosteroids, or requires treatment prescribed by a physician in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1; or subject needs to be hospitalised due to poorly controlled COPD within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 Lower respiratory tract infection that required use of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 Participate in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or who will enter the acute phase of pulmonary rehabilitation during the study. Other diseases or abnormalities in the opinion of the investigator would put safety of the subject at risk through participation; or would affect the safety or efficacy analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. subjects with carcinoma has not been in complete remission for at least 5 years. Carcinoma in site of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded if the subject has been considered cured within 5 years since diagnosis. subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study medications or components of the inhalation powder. subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years prior to Screening subjects are medically unable to withhold albuterol or ipratropium for 4 hours prior to spirometry testing at each study visit subjects are medically unable to stop the 'excluded medications' listed in the protocol subjects started, discontinued certain medications listed in the protocol or have not been on a stable dose in the past three months prior to Screening, or are not anticipated to remain on a stable dose during the study treatment period. Long term oxygen therapy requiring &gt;12 hour per day or a flow rate &gt; 2 L/min A body mass index = or &gt;35 kg/m2 Fasting lipid level LDL&gt;3.3 mmol/L, total cholesterol &gt;5.2 mmol/L, and triglycerides &gt; 2.24mmol/L Noncompliance Questionable validity of consent Prior use of study medication or other investigational drugs.
