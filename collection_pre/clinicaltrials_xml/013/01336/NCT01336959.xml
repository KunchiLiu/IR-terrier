	<criteria>Patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with CPB. Allowable procedures are CABG alone, aortic valve replacement or repair alone, mitral valve replacement or repair alone, CABG with aortic valve replacement or repair, and CABG with mitral valve replacement or repair. Patients with repeat surgery for any of the procedures can be included. Patients must weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body mass index (BMI) 18 kg/m2 Have an eGFR ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to participate in Part A, or an eGFR &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to participate in Part B. Upon completion of Part A, patients with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 may participate in Part B, with dose administered as per the dosing table left ventricular ejection fraction, in the last 6 months, ≥30% Active systemic infection or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with a glucose ≥250 mg% at the screening assessment Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, Female subjects must either: have been surgically sterilized or hysterectomized at least 6 months prior to study participation, or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to study participation. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential, Surgical sterilization procedures or hysterectomy must be supported with clinical documentation made available to the sponsor and noted in the Relevant Medical History / Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF, OR be postmenopausal. Female subjects are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms). Female subjects 60 years of age or younger must confirm menopause by the demonstration of a plasma FSH level in the postmenopausal range according to the lab normal range. Documentation of a prior plasma FSH level is acceptable History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing, or evidence of drug abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during screening or baseline New cancer diagnosis with planned chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, or cancer requiring ongoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy at the time of screening Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
