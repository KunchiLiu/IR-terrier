	<brief_summary>Overweight and obesity have become a serious global public health problem and the prevalence of these conditions is even higher among persons with mental disorders, compared with the general population. Overweight and obesity are partially associated with sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a health promotion intervention targeting physical activity and eating habits in persons with mental disorders. The study hypothesis is that between baseline and the end of the intervention, and after a 6-month follow up period, significant differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the intervention and control group will be identified. The investigators also hypothesize that the health promotion intervention will be cost-effective.</brief_summary>
