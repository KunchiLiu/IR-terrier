	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of Occupational Therapy in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson's disease is a complex disabling condition progressively affecting activities and participation of patients. Occupational Therapy aims to optimise functional performance and engagement in meaningful roles and activities. The lack of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of Occupational Therapy (OT) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) highlights the urgent need for high quality intervention studies. The Dutch clinical practice guideline for OT in PD (2008)offers a good basis for conducting an intervention study. The completed OTiP pilot underscored the feasibility and the need for a large scale trial. The OTiP study evaluates the effectiveness of OT in improving daily functioning of patients with PD.</detailed_description>

Or limitations in activities are dominated by the co morbid condition rather than by Parkinson's Disease.
