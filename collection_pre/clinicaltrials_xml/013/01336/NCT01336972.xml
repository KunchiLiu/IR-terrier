	<brief_title>Short-Term Renal Hemodynamic Effects of Tolvaptan in Subjects With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will characterize the effects of tolvaptan at steady-state in subjects with eGFR(Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ) &gt;60, 60-30 and &lt;30 mL/min*1.73 m2 and is designed to provide data to support the continued use or new introduction of tolvaptan in subjects with renal impairment due to ADPKD. Subjects titrated to the highest possible split-dose of tolvaptan used in studies with ADPKD patients will be assessed for the actions of the drug on renal hemodynamics, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in subjects with various levels of renal function. The reversibility of changes after withdrawal of the drug will be determined. Acute transitory effects on kidney volume will also be explored.</detailed_description>
