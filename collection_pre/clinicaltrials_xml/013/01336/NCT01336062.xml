	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer have poor prognosis and majority of patients resistant to 5-FU/DDP based first-line chemotherapy in China. There was no recommended second-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer. Taxane is promising in gastric cancer. Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel (Abraxane，ABI-007) has good convenience to use and been approved in breast cancer in many countries. The investigator then initiated a prospective phase Ib/IIa clinical trial with nab-paclitaxel plus TS-1 as the second-line treatment in advanced gastric cancer to observe the safety and efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of ABI-007 Plus S-1 as Second-line Chemotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a two-stage design. Stage 1 The investigator should evaluate two recommend dose and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 after one course of treatment as 3+1 design: nab-paclitaxel should be given intravenously on days 1 and 8 at a dose as follows, Treatment should be repeated every 3 weeks: Treatment arm A：125 mg /m2; Treatment arm B：100 mg /m2; Treatment arm C: 80 mg /m2; S-1 should be given orally twice a day as follows for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 1-week rest. Treatment should be repeated every 3 weeks. BSA ＜ 1.5 m2，40mg，bid;BSA ≥ 1.5 m2，50mg，bid. The investigator should determine whether to continue the original regimen; compare the safety and pharmacokinetic results with original profile of combination therapy to select the best therapy programs (RD, recommended dose). Stage 2 According to two-stage design (Simon,1989), re-entry subjects to the recommended dose group to a total of 25 valid cases. If 11 patients achieve response, then enter the second phase of total 66 patients.</detailed_description>
