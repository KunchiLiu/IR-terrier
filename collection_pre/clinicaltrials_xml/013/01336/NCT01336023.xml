	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted globally. The aim of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus insulin degludec (IDeg) and liraglutide (Lira) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects are to continue their pre-trial treatment with metformin or metformin + pioglitazone throughout the entire trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with type 2 diabetes HbA1c 7.010.0 % (both inclusive) with the aim of a median HbA1c of 8.3%. Accordingly, when approximately 50% of the randomised subjects have a HbA1c above 8.3%, the remaining subjects randomised must have a HbA1c of below or equal to 8.3%, or when approximately 50% of the randomised subjects have a HbA1c of below or equal to 8.3%, the remaining subjects randomised must have a HbA1c above 8.3% Male or female, age 18 years or above (Taiwan: 20 years or above for a site 653 in Taiwan: Taichung Veterans General Hospital) Subjects on stable dose of 12 OADs (metformin [at least 1500 mg or max tolerated dose] or metformin [at least 1500 mg or max tolerated dose] + pioglitazone [at least 30 mg]) for at least 90 days prior to screening Body Mass Index (BMI) maximum 40 kg/m^2 Treatment with insulin (except for shortterm treatment due to intercurrent illness at the discretion of the Investigator) Treatment with GLP1 (glucagonlike peptide1) receptor agonists (eg exenatide, liraglutide), sulphonylurea or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors within 90 days prior to trial Impaired liver function, defined as alanine aminotransferese (ALAT) at least 2.5 times Upper Normal Range (UNR) (one retest analysed at the central laboratory within a week from first sample taken is permitted with the result of the last sample being the conclusive) Impaired renal function defined as serumcreatinine at least 133 mcmol/l (at least 1.5 mg/dl) for males and at least 125 mcmol/l (at least 1.4) for females, or as allowed according to local contraindications for metformin (one retest analysed at the central laboratory within a week from first sample taken is permitted with the result of the last sample being the conclusive) Screening calcitonin at least 50 ng/L Subjects with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) Cardiac disorder defined as: congestive heart failure (NYHA class IIIIV), diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris, cerebral stroke and/or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months and planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation procedures Severe uncontrolled treated or untreated hypertension (systolic blood pressure at least 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure at least 100 mm Hg) Acute treatment required proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy (macular oedema) History of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis</criteria>
