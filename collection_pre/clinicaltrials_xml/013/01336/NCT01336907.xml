	<brief_summary>The FORESEE HOME is intended for the early detection of central and paracentral irregularities (abnormalities) in the visual field, most commonly associated with Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). However, the device has the ability to detect the development of the lesion post treatment and therefore to assess in determination of the next treatment. The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) may be used as well to identify choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Comparison between the two methods will allow better understanding of both devices. The FORESEE HOME can be used as an assessment tool for the progression and success of the treatment given to AMD lesions. Therefore, evaluating the size and the location of the treated lesions may serve as an additional tool.</brief_summary>
