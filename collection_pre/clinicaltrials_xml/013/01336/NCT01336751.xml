	<brief_summary>Study Primary Objectives: To compare glycemic control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (A1C), between insulin glargine and 75% insulin lispro protamine suspension/25% insulin lispro as add-on therapies in subjects who failed oral combination therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin. Study Secondary Objectives : To compare the following measures between subjects receiving insulin glargine or 75% insulin lispro protamine suspension/25% insulin lispro: - Incidence of hypoglycemia - Change in weight - Change in serum lipid profile - Percentage of subjects achieving A1C levels ≤7%</brief_summary>

Patients must be able to understand and willing to adhere to and be compliant with the study protocol Patients, who have had stroke, MI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or angina pectoris within the last 12 months. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacological treatment. Patients on nonselective beta blockers (including ocular).
