	<brief_summary>Does the consumption of dairy foods reduce the rate of bone loss in older women more than calcium and vitamin D supplements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dairy Foods Compared to Dietary Supplements and Bone Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research indicates that bone health is dependent on multiple nutrients, not just calcium and vitamin D, leading to the conclusion that calcium from sources that include other bone enhancing nutrients may be more effective in maintaining bone integrity than calcium and vitamin D supplements. Several studies have examined the effects of calcium intake from dairy foods on different indicators of bone health. Reducing the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women can reduce the risk of osteoporosis related fractures. Therefore we propose to study the effectiveness of 4 servings of milk and yogurt per day for 42 days compared to calcium and vitamin D supplements for 42 days to reduce calcium loss from the skeleton in post menopausal women. Postmenopausal women, approximately 50-65 years of age, will be studied. Each volunteer will receive both interventions in a cross-over design, in random order, separated by a 42 day washout period.</detailed_description>
