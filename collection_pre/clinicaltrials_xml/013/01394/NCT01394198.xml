	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to correlate the link between palpatory findings of somatic dysfunction and gastrointestinal endoscopic evidence of changes in mucosa. The investigators' hypothesis is that there is a direct connection between somatic palpatory changes and intestinal mucosal changes via a somatovisceral/viscerosomatic mechanism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study protocol is limited to an extra physical examination (the focused structural exam) prior to a scheduled routine or diagnostic endoscopy. Immediately prior to the scheduled endoscopy, subjects enrolled in the study will be palpated by a Neuromuscular Medicine (NMM)/Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) specialist for spinal tenderness, tissue texture changes and asymmetry or restricted range of motion as well as tenderness of Chapman points. The entire spine from the occipitoatlantal joint to the sacrum will be evaluated along with specific intercostal abdominal and lower extremity areas. The positive structural examination findings of spinal tenderness, tissue texture changes and asymmetry or restricted range of motion will be compared to the visual and pathological findings recorded in the operative report of the endoscopy procedure and the pathological report of any biopsies obtained during the endoscopic procedure.</detailed_description>
