	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at whether blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor will result in changes in the cardiovascular and inflammatory response to hypoglycemia. We are also looking at the effect of hypoglycemia on fMRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoglycemia and the Mineralocorticoid Receptor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of ongoing hypoglycemia on cardiovascular autonomic function is unclear and the focus of this protocol. In our preliminary studies, the investigators demonstrated that baroreflex sensitivity is impaired during hypoglycemia in healthy individuals. Treatment with eplerenone (200mg total administered in two doses in the 15 hours prior to the hypoglycemic clamp) prevented this impairment. The study is based on the overarching hypothesis that hypoglycemia leads to increases in aldosterone/mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activity and increased cardiovascular injury. This study will address the following Specific Aims: To test the hypothesis that MR blockade will reduce the adverse effects of hypoglycemia on inflammation and on autonomic control of cardiovascular function. The investigators will determine the effects of hypoglycemia (50 mg/dl for 2.0 hours) on the blood inflammatory factor interleukin-6 levels, on cardiovascular autonomic function (baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability) and on arrhythmia risk (microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA)) in each subject under two conditions - pretreatment with MR blockade (eplerenone) and pretreatment with placebo. To investigate the role of hypoglycemia on fMRI.</detailed_description>
