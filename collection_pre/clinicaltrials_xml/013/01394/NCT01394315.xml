	<brief_title>Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) for Monitoring Response to Neoadjuvant (Preoperative) Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot study will enrol up to ten patients over one year. Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer will undergo baseline clinical examination, mammography, ultrasound, MRI and DOT before commencement of treatment. DOT will be repeated at 1,3,6 weeks after chemotherapy, and at the end of each chemotherapy regimen. Ultrasound will be repeated every 6 weeks and at the end of treatment. Mammography and MRI will be repeated once at the end of treatment before surgery. A breast pathologist will evaluate the subtype of breast cancer and the pathologic response of the operative specimen at the end of treatment. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be administered to evaluate their preferences for DOT, ultrasound, mammography and MRI scanning at the beginning and the end of the study.</detailed_description>
