	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Alabama Veterans Rural Health Initiative is to better understand access and barriers to health care and to enhance veteran enrollment or engagement in health care services of veterans residing in rural areas. It describes an intervention that is adaptable for use by other VA facilities that serve veterans in rural settings, and importantly, this study will improve our understanding of barriers to care and evaluate a method for enhancing access to care. The anticipated impact is that more veterans in rural areas who were previously under-utilizing VA services will receive and attend a health care appointment. This gain may improve preventative and primary care health care and reduce long term health care morbidity, expense and burden. This study may also identify previously unknown barriers to care that can be surmounted by innovative access and health care delivery approaches. The primary objective is to evaluate an innovative approach for enhanced enrollment or engagement intervention (EEE intervention) for rural veterans in VA health care services. Phase I entails a two-cell design, addressing this objective with a prospective, randomized controlled multi-site clinical trial that evaluates an active intervention compared to a control treatment as usual (TAU)condition on whether or not a rurally-residing veteran obtains and attends a VA appointment. Phase II encompasses a three-cell design, addressing the above mentioned objective with a randomized controlled, multi-site clinical trial that evaluates two active interventions compared to a control intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PHASE I I. Primary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the control condition (Treatment as Usual; TAU), veterans who receive the enhanced enrollment or engagement intervention (EEE - patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and education), will be significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the comprehensive baseline evaluation. PHASE II I. Primary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the control condition (Outreach C - education only), veterans who receive the enhanced enrollment or engagement (EEE) intervention (Outreach A - patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and education), will be significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the comprehensive baseline evaluation. II. Secondary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the control condition (Outreach C), veterans who receive the patient navigation and education (Outreach B) will be significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the comprehensive baseline evaluation. III. Tertiary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the patient navigation and education (Outreach B), veterans who receive the EEE intervention (Outreach A) will be significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the comprehensive baseline evaluation.</detailed_description>
