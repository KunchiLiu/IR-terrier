	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to investigate whether and to what extent a cautious respiratory and exercise therapy can complement medical treatment and change the condition, oxygen uptake, quality of life, the pulmonary vascular pressures, the size of the right heart and the 6-minute walk distance in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</brief_summary>
