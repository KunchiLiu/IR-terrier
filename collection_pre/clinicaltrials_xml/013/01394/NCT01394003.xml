	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of advanced and/or metastatic cancer (solid tumors) that is refractory to standard therapy and/or therapies known to provide clinical benefit, or for which no standard therapy exists Have the presence of disease amenable to efficacy assessment as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Patients who have advanced nonmeasurable disease with elevation of a validated tumor marker may be eligible, if discussed and agreed upon by the investigator and the sponsor Patients entering Part C of the study must have a tumor that is safely amenable to 2 biopsies (one pretreatment and one ontreatment biopsy for the same tumor). Patients in Part C of the study must agree to biopsy procedures at time of consent Have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic organ function Have a performance status of less than or equal to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancerrelated hormonal therapy (with the exception of continuing gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy for patients with prostate cancer, or antiestrogen therapy [for example, an aromatase inhibitor] for patients with breast cancer), or other investigational therapy for at least 3 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy Are reliable and willing to be available for the duration of the study and are willing to follow study procedures Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug Females with child bearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks Are able to swallow capsules Have received treatment within 3 weeks of the initial dose of study drug with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication Have 1 or more serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable, asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastasis is not required Have hematologic malignancies, or lymphoma Females who are pregnant or lactating Have a second primary malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor, may affect the interpretation of results Have bleeding diathesis</criteria>
