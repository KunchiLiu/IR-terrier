	<brief_summary>Currently in Canada, either 4% sodium citrate or heparin 1,000-10,000 U/ml solutions are "locked" into hemodialysis catheters between dialysis sessions to prevent thrombosis. The use of an ethanol/sodium citrate locking solution may have advantages over either of these agents alone. The investigators hypothesize that the 30 % ethanol/4% sodium citrate catheter locking solution is safe and effective in the prevention of catheter-related infections and thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of an Ethanol/Sodium Citrate Locking Solution: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot study will utilize a prospective, randomized design. After meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and providing written informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to a 30 % ethanol/ 4% sodium citrate locking solution or heparin 1000 U/ml. Patients will be enrolled from the Health Sciences Centre and the Sherbrook Dialysis Units in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with Stage V chronic kidney disease preparing to start hemodialysis Exchange of an existing catheter to a cuffed, tunneled catheter OR planned vascular access with a cuffed, tunneled catheter CVC used for hemodialysis made of alcoholresistant polymers ie. carbothane Patients receiving catheters not made of alcohol resistant polymers Critically ill patients in ICU setting Patients with acute renal failure, who will likely not require prolonged vascular access ( ie. &gt; months) Patients with maturing fistulas/graft creation within 2 months Patients with planned antibiotic treatment courses lasting longer than 4 weeks from the date of new catheter insertion Patients receiving a new cuffed, tunneled catheter over a guide wire, if a fibrin sheath angioplasty was not performed after removing the previous dysfunctional catheter</criteria>
