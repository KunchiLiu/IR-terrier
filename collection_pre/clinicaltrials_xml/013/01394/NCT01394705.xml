	<brief_summary>This pilot study seeks to compare the change in energy expenditure and fitness levels of patients seen in the Children's Hospital Preventive Cardiology program receiving standard of care provider exercise counseling to similar patients receiving Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type (FITT) exercise prescription and counseling combined with BodyMedia supported by an online interactive tool. The investigators primary hypothesis is that this interactive technology coupled with support from a exercise specialist will increase the energy expenditure of the investigators patients over standard of care provider counseling. The investigators Secondary hypotheses include greater improvement in measured physical fitness Peak oxygen consumption (VO2max), oxygen consumption (VO2) at anaerobic threshold (AT) and ventilation/carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) slope, lipid profiles, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and self-efficacy in the intervention group compared to control.</brief_summary>
