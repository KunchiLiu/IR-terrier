	<brief_summary>Primary objective of the study is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Vorinostat (V), given in combination with fixed doses of Doxorubicin (D), Bortezomib (B) and Dexamethasone (D). Secondary objectives are: Assessment of safety and tolerability of VBDD; efficacy data of VBDD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat in Combination With Bortezomib, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone (VBDD) in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Multiple Myeloma (MM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A first cohort of three patients will be treated at the starting dose level of Vorinostat 100 mg/d, on day 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18 in combination with BDD. The dose level of Vorinostat will be escalated in each new cohort: if no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) has been observed in the previous dose level in 3 patient, the second cohort of 3 new patients will be treated with Vorinostat 200 mg/d and the third cohort will be given Vorinostat with 300 mg/d. Bortezomib will be administered intravenously (i.v.) 1.3mg/m2 d1, 8, 15. Doxorubicin will be administered i.v. with a total dose of 18 mg/m2 per cycle (9 mg/m2, d1 and 8). Dexamethasone will be administered per os (p.o.) with 40mg (first cycle) and 20mg (all other subsequent cycles) on d1, 8, 15, 22.</detailed_description>
