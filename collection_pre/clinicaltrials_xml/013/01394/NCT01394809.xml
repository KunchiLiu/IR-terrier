	<brief_summary>The therapy results after distal radius fracture especially of elderly patients are often suboptimal. The central problem results from the inevitable, 3-6-weeks immobilization, which leads to reduction in ROM of the wrist, deterioration of muscle strength as well as malfunction of fine motor skills and coordination. Currently, there are no adequate proactive strategies to counteract these immobilisation problems. Hence the overall aim of our research project is to investigate the therapeutic potential of a motor-cognitive therapy on hand function after distal radius fracture. On the one hand the pilot study should provide information about the level of recruitment rate necessitated for an adequate sample size which allows reliable evidence for the therapy effects. On the other hand we want to evaluate the sensitivity and adequacy of the assessment instruments. The pilot is conceived as a controlled, randomised, longitudinal intervention study over 6 weeks with 3 groups. One experimental group imagine movements and actions without executing them. A second experimental group performs mirror training, in which visual feedback through a mirror activates additionally the contralateral hemisphere. The control group receives therapy as usual. There are three key domains to be analysed: function (PRWE), impairment (ROM, strength) and participation in social life/life quality (DASH, EQ5D).</brief_summary>
