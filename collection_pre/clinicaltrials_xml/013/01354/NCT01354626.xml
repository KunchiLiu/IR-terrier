	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the potential beneficial effect of increasing protein in the diet in order to decrease hepatic lipid accumulation on a high-fat diet. The investigators hypothesize that increasing protein in a high-fat diet suppresses lipid accumulation in the liver, and that changes in (hepatic) fat handling underlie this reduced lipid accumulation.</brief_summary>
