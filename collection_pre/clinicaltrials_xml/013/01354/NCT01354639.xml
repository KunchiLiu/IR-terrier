	<brief_summary>The robotic thyroidectomy (RT) has excellent cosmetic and several functional results. But there were no definite evidence of oncological safety of robotic thyroidectomy yet. To assure the surgical completeness of robotic thyroidectomy, the investigators compared robotic thyroidectomy and conventional open thyroidectomy (OT) by means of the postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake of possible remnant thyroid tissue and stimulated TG level.</brief_summary>
