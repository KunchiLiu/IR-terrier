	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to study the effects of Vitamin D supplementation on the body's response to insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar), on inflammation and/or on specific cells and processes in fat tissue, and on function of skeletal muscle and joints.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Vitamin D Repletion on Insulin Resistance and Systemic Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the last several years, studies have shown that low vitamin D levels may increase risk of development of Type 2 Diabetes. The investigators will administer vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) to nondiabetic, insulin resistant subjects with vitamin D deficiency (total vitamin D levels &lt; 20 ng/ml) to increase the level of vitamin D initially to 30-50ng/ml and then to higher normal range of 51-75 ng/ml. The investigators will study its effects on insulin action, adipose tissue inflammation, and musculoskeletal function.</detailed_description>
