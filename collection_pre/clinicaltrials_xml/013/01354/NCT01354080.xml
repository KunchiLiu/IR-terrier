	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Massage in Treating Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constipation can be defined as "an embarrassing ailment of the 21st century". It affects about 20-25% of the population, women as well as men, but occurs more frequently in women (female:male ratio of 2.2:1). Persons of different age suffer from it. Constipation is a bothersome ailment which negatively affects the general physical and mental state, lowers physical and mental fitness, significantly hinders professional work, and decreases life comfort As the factors which contribute to the occurrence of constipation are very diverse and complex, the treatment is a long-term and slow process. There are numerous conservative treatment methods for constipation, such as physical treatments, reflexotherapy, biofeedback, pharmacotherapy, and modification of lifestyle. There is also a possibility of applying classical massage in persons with constipation. However, observations of the authors suggest it is not a therapy commonly applied.</detailed_description>
