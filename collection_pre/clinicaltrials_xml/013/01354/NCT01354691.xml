	<brief_summary>For many, Alzheimer's disease is the number one medical issue facing our aging society. It is a late onset neurodegenerative disease, frequently under diagnosed, that impairs memory and cognitive performance. There are no known treatments that can either prevent or reverse its progression. Consequently, there still remains a need to evaluate treatments which can better stabilize the symptoms of this disease. These symptoms frequently include decreased functional capacity and negative psychological attributes (e,g, depression, anxiety) in association with the memory and cognition deficits. This current study is being done to assess an investigational compound that has been designed to not only improved the cognitive status of affected patients but to also better manage all symptoms. Hence, the ultimate goal is to provide patients with an improved quality of life by slowing the progression of this neurodegenerative disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Ladostigil in Mild to Moderate Probable Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational compound ladostigil versus placebo in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the trial will be 26 weeks in duration and will involve two cohorts (i.e. one arm receiving ladostigil and one arm receiving placebo). After the initial 26 week period, all participating subjects will receive 26 weeks of treatment with ladostigil (i.e. the open label phase). A total of five territories will be participating in this trial. These include Austria, Croatia, Germany, Serbia and Spain.</detailed_description>
