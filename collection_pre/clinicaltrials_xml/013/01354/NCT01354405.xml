	<brief_title>Somatostatin Analogues as a Volume Reducing Treatment of Polycystic Livers (RESOLVE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this single center observational study is to assess the effect of lanreotide on polycystic liver and kidney. This is achieved by assessing total liver and kidney volume, and several urinary markers that could predict kidney damage or kidney dysfunction, such as GFR, blood pressure, and urinary tubular damage markers and serum biomarker FGF23. The investigators aim to include 43 patients affected by a polycystic liver due to ADPKD. The duration of the trial will be 28 weeks. The treatment will be 24 weeks and the first screening visit will take place four weeks before start of treatment. Eligible patients will be invited to participate.</detailed_description>
