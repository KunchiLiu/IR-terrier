	<brief_summary>Fasting during the Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and is a mandatory duty for all healthy adult Muslims. Fasting is considered safe in young healthy subjects but it can induce harmful effects and complications in patients with diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes are prone to hypo and hyper glycemia during fasting. When treating diabetic patients with a treatment guideline the rate of these complications can be reduced. Little data is available on patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin. The investigators therefore propose to assess the effect of a protocol containing detemir (levemir) and a premix of insulin aspart (NovoMix70) on glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes during the Ramadan and to compare this regimen to the standard care patients receive during this period. The investigators assume that patients receiving the intervention will have better glucose control during the Ramadan compared to patients receiving the standard care. As approximately 45 million Muslims suffer from type 2 diabetes and most of them fast during the Ramadan the results of this intervention may be significant and may improve the care of these patients allowing Muslims to respect their religious obligations without compromising their health.</brief_summary>
