	<brief_summary>The investigators seek to examine the effect of add-on N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) in the early phase of schizophrenia spectrum illness in collaboration with researchers Kim Do, PhD, and Philippe Conus, MD in Switzerland. Modifications of brain structure are thought to occur during the pre-illness phase and around the transition to psychosis. Therefore, studying new treatments that could target changes occurring during this period is of critical importance. Aims: Does add-on NAC treatment in early psychosis influence: - positive and negative symptoms - extrapyramidal side-effects of other medication - plasma concentration of glutathione - Mismatch Negativity, a physiological marker</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study proposes that a glutathione deficit leading to an abnormal response to oxidative stress is a vulnerability factor, combined with other brain specific factors, in brain functioning of some individuals with schizophrenia (Do et al., 2010). N-acetyl-cysteine is hypothesized to cross the blood-brain barrier and increase glutathione in the brain.</detailed_description>
