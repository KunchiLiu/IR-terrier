	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different but standard treatments for the fixation of Vancouver B1 periprosthetic. The investigators aim to compare open reduction internal fixation using a locked plating system versus plating and strut allograft with cerclage wiring to determine which treatment results in a faster return to function as measured by the TUG test at 6 weeks post-op.</brief_summary>
