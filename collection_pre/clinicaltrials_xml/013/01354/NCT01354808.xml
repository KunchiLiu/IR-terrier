	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether adjunctive cilostazol loading/maintenance to standard treatment (aspirin, clopidogrel, and statin) is effective in reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events, platelet activation, inflammation and myonecrosis in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS)undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In ACS patients, platelet activation, inflammation, and ischemia-reperfusion injury can be closely associated with the risk of post-PCI myonecrosis and ischemic events occurrence. In the ACCEL-AMI (Adjunctive Cilostazol versus high maintenance-dose ClopidogrEL in patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction)study, adjunctive cilostazol increased platelet inhibition compared with double-dose clopidogrel. Meanwhile, statins can reduce the extent of myonecrosis via limiting inflammation and myocardial infarct size by activating phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), ecto-5'-nucleotidase, Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and the downstream effectors inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Inhibition of PI3K, adenosine receptors, eNOS, iNOS, or COX-2 abrogates the protective effects of statins. In animal study, the combination of low-dose statin with cilostazol synergistically limits infarct size. Multiple studies have shown that cilostazol can influence inflammation and RISK pathway using the similar pathway with statin. This study will be performed to evaluate the role of adjunctive cilostazol in platelet inhibition, inflammation, and myonecrosis compared with standard treatment.</detailed_description>
