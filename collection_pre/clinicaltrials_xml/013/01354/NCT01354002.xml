	<brief_summary>The aims of this protocol are: to collect and store diseased and normal tissue and body fluid samples from new and returning patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), affiliated sites and collaborating institutions; to collect and store samples from relatives of SJCRH patients; to collect and store retrospective and prospective pertinent corresponding clinical and laboratory data on disease characterization, treatment, and outcome; and to serve as a source of human biological samples and corresponding laboratory and clinical data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol for Collecting, Banking and Distributing Human Tissue Samples: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Tissue Resources Core Facility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no study design for this protocol. Samples obtained under IRB/IEC-approved protocols that clearly permit storage of patient material at SJCRH will be banked, provided proof of informed consent is available. Such samples will be tagged accordingly and will be only released to fulfill the aim(s) of the protocol under which they were obtained, or to investigators that apply to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Tissue Resources Committee to use the samples.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients (and their relatives) and control populations treated or studied at SJCRH and SJCRH affiliates and collaborating sites that have IRB approval for TBANK with malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Patients from institutions that do not have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for TBANK, and at which a banking mechanism may not be established, who provide samples for research at St. Jude and from whom consent for TBANK is obtained by the TBANK principal investigator (PI). Patients from institutions that do not have IRB approval for TBANK, and who have not provided consent for TBANK, or patients not enrolled on SJCRH protocols that incorporate consent for tumor banking.</criteria>
