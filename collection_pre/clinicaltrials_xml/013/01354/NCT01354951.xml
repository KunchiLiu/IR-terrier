	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see what side effects a type of radiation treatment called focal brachytherapy has in treating early stage prostate cancer. The study is also looking at how useful focal brachytherapy will be in treating prostate cancer. Additionally, the investigators would like to see how this type of treatment impacts quality of life.</brief_summary>
