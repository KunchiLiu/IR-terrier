	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) frequently occurs in obese population undergoing bariatric surgery. There is a need for alternative screening tools for sleep apnea detection in the pre-operative period. The investigators would like to compare ApneaLink and complete polysomnography in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Apnea LinkTM for Sleep Apnea Syndrome Screening in a Bariatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSA can occur in up to 78% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery(1). Moderate to severe case will benefit from CPAP therapy, that can help avoiding post-operative complications(2). In this population, the investigators propose complete attended in-hospital polysomnography (PSG)in patients with a clinical high probability of OSA. According to obesity epidemics (3), waiting list for PSG in sleep labs is every day longer. The investigators want to assess sensitivity and specificity of a new portable screening tool, ApneaLink, to detect OSA in a bariatric population. Design: monocentric and prospective study Methods: Patients: - OSA suspicion based on : - symptoms and signs (snoring, apneas , neck circumference &gt;38 (women) or 43cm (men)) - BMI &gt; 50 - BMI &gt; 40, &gt; 40 y - BMI &gt; 35, men, hypertension - increased serum Bicarbonate - Polyglobulia Measurements - Polysomnography in sleep lab with concommitant recording performed with Apnea LinkTM (nasal flow and oxymétry recording). - between 2 weeks : recording performed with Apnea LinkTM (nasal flow and oxymétry recording)at home.</detailed_description>
