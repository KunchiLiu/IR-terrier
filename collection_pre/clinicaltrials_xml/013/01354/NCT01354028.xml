	<brief_summary>Premature infants sometimes require sedation to ensure minimal movement during diagnostic procedures such as MRIs. However, sedatives may produce adverse effects. The purpose of this two-day study is to determine whether massage therapy will promote sleep in preterm infants and also help them to stay asleep, providing a safer way to sedate infants for procedures. A small instrument called a sleep watch or actigraph will be placed around the infant's ankle to measure muscle activity and provide an indication of sleep. Infants will receive a 10- minute massage on one morning of the study and no massage on the alternate morning. Recordings from the actigraph will show whether there is difference in sleep pattern with and without massage. Infants will be monitored for any heart rate and oxygen saturation changes on both mornings of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Massage Therapy to Induce Sleep in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cross-over trial pilot study will assess the effectiveness of massage therapy for inducing and maintaining sleep in preterm infants. Massage therapy promotes relaxation and lowers stress levels, evidenced by increased vagal activity and lower cortisol levels. Safer methods of inducing sleep without drugs would be beneficial for infants who require sedation for diagnostic studies. The sample will include infants over 3 days old and between 32-40 weeks adjusted gestational age in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Infants who are clinically unstable, require surgery, have major congenital anomalies or have a history of severe birth asphyxia will be excluded. After parental consent, infants will be randomized to receive massage on study day 1 or study day 2. Standard care will be provided on the alternate study day. A minimum of 30 infants is required to complete the study. The primary outcome measure used to document the response to massage will measured by the Motionlogger® Micro Sleep Watch® Actigraph (Actigraph). The actigraph will be placed on the infant's ankle approximately following the 9 am feed and will record lower extremity activity until approximately the 12 pm feed. Massages will occur after a minimum of 30 minutes following the morning feeding when the infant is in a quiet alert state and will be approximately 10 minutes in length. Baby lotion used as standard care in the NICU will be used to facilitate ease of massage. Primary outcome measures will include data recorded by the actigraph: (a) sleep onset following massage intervention, (b) sleep end time, (c) number of awakenings and duration of awakenings during the study interval, (d) the duration of the longest sustained sleep period, and (e) sleep efficiency. Secondary outcomes will include oxygen saturation and heart rate during massage and for 30 minutes after massage.</detailed_description>
