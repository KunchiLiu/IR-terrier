	<brief_summary>This study is planned to investigate the relationship between duration of extracorporeal circulation and the extent of (acquired) platelet dysfunctions in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Extracorporeal Circulation on Platelet Function of Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery are planned to be included. At several intra- and postoperative measuring point, blood is drawn for multiple electrode aggregometry to investigate ex-vivo platelet aggregation as a surrogate for platelet function. Transfusion rate of allogenic blood products as well as postoperative blood loss is planned to be recorded.</detailed_description>
