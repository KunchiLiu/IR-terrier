	<brief_summary>Background: Aortic stent-graft is useful to occlude intimal tear and prevent further dilatation of the false lumen in patients with aortic dissection. The long-term benefit of aortic stent-graft in patients with uncomplicated distal aortic dissection has not been well demonstrated, especially in patients at high risk of aneurysmal change and death. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to evaluate long-term clinical benefit of stent-graft insertion performed just after the acute phase into the descending thoracic aorta in patients with distal aortic dissection and at high risk of aneurysmal change of the dissected aorta.</brief_summary>
