	<brief_title>Intramyocardial Multiple Precision Injection of Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells in Myocardial Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase of prevalence of heart failure in human population requires to develop new and effective methods of treatment. One of them is stem cells transplantation into a myocardial tissue, which cause the improvement of contractility, myocardial remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI), dilated cardiomyopathy, etc. Use of autologous stem cells does not require of immunosuppressive therapy and does not correlate with some ethical problems. Clinical application of mesenchymal stem cells always requires a step of culturing, which is associated with increased risk of contamination Therefore haemopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells or mononuclear bone marrow cells are often used to be transplant for treatment of heart failure (HF) patients.Using NOGA XP Cardiac Navigation System improves specificity of transplantations, that is decisive.</detailed_description>
