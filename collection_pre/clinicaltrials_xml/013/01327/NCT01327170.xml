	<brief_title>Micropulse Diode Laser Treatment for Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of the cases of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) recur spontaneously within three months of disease. After 3 months without resolution of acute CSC or in chronic CSC, continuous wave laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy should be considered. Direct threshold continuous photocoagulation treatment can shorten the duration of the serous detachment, but it is not appropriate for juxtafoveal or subfoveal leakage point.Subvisible photocoagulation potentially localizes and decreases chorioretinal thermic burn. Subthreshold diode micropulse (SDM) laser using a 810nm diode laser may spare the damage to the neural retina by raising the temperature of the RPE to just below the protein-denaturation threshold so that the thermal wave that reaches the neural retina is insufficient to cause neither damage nor clinically visible end-point. This therapeutic laser modality offers the possibility to minimize the iatrogenic retinal lesion.</detailed_description>
