	<brief_summary>The Essure procedure, FDA approved since 2002 and CE Mark approved since 2001, is the first permanent birth control method that can be performed in the comfort of a physician's office without hormones, cutting, burning or the risks associated with general anesthesia or tubal ligation. Soft, flexible inserts are placed in a woman's fallopian tubes through the cervix without incisions. Over the next three months, the body forms a natural barrier around the micro-inserts to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Three months after the Essure procedure, a doctor performs an Essure Confirmation Test. In the United States, this test is called a hysterosalpingogram and evaluates the location of the inserts and whether the fallopian tubes are blocked. Outside of the United States, a standard x-ray is performed to evaluate the location of the inserts. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a transvaginal ultrasound is an effective method of confirming micro-insert location.</brief_summary>
