	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is based on method Utstein, registering all recommended items of that model, in addition to adding more information, characterizing this way using a template Utstein modified for the epidemiology of PCR-hospital in Brazil. Objectives: establish a registry of patients suffering from respiratory (PCR)-hospital to assess demographic and clinical variables such as morbidity, mortality and standard practice in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In addition, assess independent predictors associated with survival in several times and survival curves.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bedding: Despite of ongoing advances and standardizing worldwide trumpeted by CPR guidelines, yet is little knowledge of the effectiveness of procedures for intra and extra-hospital CPR, so vast are the opportunities for documentation of these results in the field of clinical and epidemiological research. Utstein style emerged, then as a proposed methodology for the PCR during the Conference held at the former monastery Utstein, Norway. The "Utstein Style" was also the model for the construction of the National Registry of Cardiac Pulmonary Resuscitation (NRCPR), sponsored by the American Heart Association (AHA). The proposal of this study is based on method Utstein, registering all recommended items of that model, in addition to adding more information, characterizing this way using a template Utstein modified for the epidemiology of PCR-hospital in Brazil. Objectives: establish a registry of patients suffering from respiratory (PCR)-hospital to assess demographic and clinical variables such as morbidity, mortality and standard practice in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In addition, assess independent predictors associated with survival in several times and survival curves. Methods: Observational Study of prospective registration type, to document the clinical practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in-hospital effect in 17 hospitals and institutes of public and private Brazilian specialties. Additionally the longitudinal follow-up will be conducted until discharged, and measurement of mortality at 6 months and 12 months.</detailed_description>
