	<detailed_description>There is no clear indication regarding the treatment of patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) presenting at baseline with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) less than 20/200. Treatment of eyes with low visual acuity could lead to a waste of resources, without any functional and social improvements. Aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVBI) with respect to simple observation in</detailed_description>
