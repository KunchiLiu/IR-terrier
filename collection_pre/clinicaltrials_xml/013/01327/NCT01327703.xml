	<brief_summary>This study by Aptalis (formerly Axcan) assesses the efficacy and safety of Panzytrat® 25,000 compared to Kreon® 25,000 in the control of steatorrhea in participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Control of Steatorrhea in Participants With Cystic Fibrosis and Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, two-period cross-over study to compare the efficacy and safety of Panzytrat® 25,000 to Kreon® 25,000 in participants aged 7 years and older suffering from CF and EPI. The study consists of a qualification phase (5 to 15 days); two treatment periods of 14 days each (plus a 3-day window if needed) and a 3-day stool collection will be performed from Days 12 to 15. A safety follow-up phone call will be arranged 7-10 days after completion of the treatment phase or after an early discontinuation.</detailed_description>
