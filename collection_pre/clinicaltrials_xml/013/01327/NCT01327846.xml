	<brief_summary>Main Study (CACZ885M2301): The purpose of the pivotal phase of this trial is to test the hypothesis that canakinumab treatment of patients with MI at least one month prior to study entry and elevated hsCRP will prevent recurrent cardiovascular events. The purpose of the extension phase of the main study is to collect additional long-term safety data on continued exposure to canakinumab in patients who participated in the pivotal phase. Sub-study 1 (CACZ885M2301S1): The purpose of this sub-study is to evaluate the effect of quarterly subcutaneous canakinumab treatment for 24 months comparted with placebo on the carotid plaque burden measured by integrated vascular MRI in patients enrolled in the CACZ885M2301 study (CANTOS). Sub-study 2 (CACZ885M2301S2): The purpose of this CANTOS sub-study is to determine whether, in patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the CANTOS main study, canakinumab compared to placebo, on top of standard of care increases insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
