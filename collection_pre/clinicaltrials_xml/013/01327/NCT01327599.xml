	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, openangle or pigment dispersion glaucoma in at least one eye. Stable IOPlowering regimen of bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5% therapy (either administered concomitantly or in a fixed combination) within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, to assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period. IOP between 19 to 35 mmHg (at any time of the day) in at least one eye (which would be designated as the study eye). Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medication(s) prior to receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study. Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend all study visits. Best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each eye. Sign informed consent. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any component of DuoTrav® that is deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal Investigator. Corneal dystrophies in either eye. Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment. Bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, bronchial hyper reactivity, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical betablocker. History of severe allergic rhinitis. A condition, which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would interfere with optimal participation in the study, or which would present a special risk to the subject. Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
