	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, open-label, four-group, two-period, replicate design study to evaluate the effect of food on within and between subject variability in second generation formulation 20-mg tablet strengths, Lots P01008ZZA and P01009ZZA, administered as single doses of 40mg to 84 healthy male and female subjects. The study is powered to detect both a reduction in either the within or between subject variability (coefficient of variation [CV]%) of approximately 35%.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group study. The PK and PK/PD relationship of AKR-501 will also be studied. Approximately 65 eligible patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:3:1 ratio in a double-blinded fashion into one of five parallel treatment groups to receive daily doses of either AKR-501 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg or placebo for 28 days, respectively. Each AKR-501 dosing group will consist of 15 patients while the placebo group will consist of 5 patients. All study patients will be evaluated weekly (Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28) for safety, efficacy, and (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28) AKR-501 pharmacokinetics while receiving study treatment with a final assessment for safety and effectiveness to be done 2 weeks after the last study dose (Day 42).</detailed_description>
