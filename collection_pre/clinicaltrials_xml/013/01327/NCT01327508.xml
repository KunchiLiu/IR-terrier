	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to quantitate the amount of radiation both subjects and surgeons are exposed to during intramedullary nailing of the femur using the TRIGEN SURESHOT Distal Targeting System versus Standard nailing instrumentation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRIGEN SURESHOT™ Distal Targeting System Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TRIGEN SURESHOT™ Distal Targeting System was designed to be an intraoperative image-guided localization system to aid with drill positioning for screws during intramedullary nailing distal interlocking. It is hypothesized that this system will aid in identification of the distal holes leading to reduced exposure to radiation. The SURESHOT System provides information to the surgeon that is used to place surgical instruments utilizing electromagnetic tracking data obtained intraoperatively. It is indicated for long bone fractures treated with intramedullary nailing in which the use of stereotactic surgery may be appropriate. The hypothesis is that using the TRIGEN SURESHOT™ Distal Targeting System will allow accurate distal locking while effectively decreasing the amount of radiation exposure compared to the standard instrumentation process.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Unilateral femoral shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing in which the use of stereotactic surgery may be appropriate. Subject is between 1880 years of age. Subject is skeletally mature Subject is of legal age and capable of providing legal consent. Subject is suitable for current Intramedullary Nailing procedure Subject willing to accept randomization either to the TRIGEN SURESHOT Distal Targeting System or TRIGEN standard instrumentation. Exclusion Criteria Femur shaft fracture not amenable to intramedullary nailing in which the use of sterotactic surgery may be inappropriate. Fracture with vascular injury (Gustilo Type IIIC) requiring repair Open fractures where open wound is in communication with distal targeting holes and therefore would influence duration of locking procedure (i.e. potentially no need for incisions for locking screw placement). Fracture of the Metaphyseal distal femur with intraarticular comminution Known Pathological Fracture Subject is a prisoner Operative procedure for closed fracture is scheduled for greater than 2 weeks for closed fractures Subject has cognitive issue/mental status conditions that preclude intramedullary nailing in the judgment of the investigator.
