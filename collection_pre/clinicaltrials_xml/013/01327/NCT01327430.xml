	<brief_title>Phospholipid Absorption of a Milk Phospholipid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date the mechanisms for the intestinal absorption of glycerophosphates and sphingolipids are not completely investigated. It is assumed, that sphingolipids and sterols compete for intestinal absorption. In addition it is unclear, if a dietary phospholipid supplementation may influence the phospholipid concentration in plasma. To evaluate the effect of a dietary phospholipid supplementation 15 healthy female subjects received over 10 days daily 3 g of milk phospholipids stirred in a dairy product. During the following 10 days the subjects were supplemented with daily 6 g milk phospholipid. Finally, the subjects received over 10 days 6 g of the milk phospholipid in a dairy product and 2 g of plant sterols serving a commercial product.</detailed_description>
