	<brief_title>Tolerance of "on Line" Hemodiafiltration in Chronic Renal Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to appreciate the tolerance of "on line" HDF treatment versus conventional high flux hemodialysis in term of adverse events occuring during dialysis sessions between day 30 and day 120 of treatment and to evaluate: - Quality of life evaluated with the KDQOL questionnaire - Incidence of cardiovascular events - Influence of the technic on cardiovascular, inflammatory and infectious risk factors - Mortality</detailed_description>
