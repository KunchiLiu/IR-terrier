	<brief_summary>The primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of single and repeated doses of EMD525797, and characterize Pharmacokinetics (PK). The secondary objectives are to investigate the immunogenicity and Progressive disease (PD), and to assess the anti-tumor activity of EMD525797.</brief_summary>
