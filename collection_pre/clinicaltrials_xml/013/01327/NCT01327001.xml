	<brief_summary>Moderate and severe asthma bronchiale is treated by fixed combination (budesonide/formoterol or salmeterol/fluticasone) in the Czech Republic. There is a hypothesis that doctors should prescribe to each patients per year: six units of fixed combination budesonide/formoterol, or seven units of fixed combination budesonide/formoterol in approach SMART, or twelve units of fixed combination salmeterol/fluticasone. With regard to current prices the treatment by fixed combination budesonide/formoterol should cost less. The investigators do not have any data about real life utilization of fixed combination in asthma treatment in Czech Republic The investigators propose to conduct a non-interventional multicentric retrospective epidemiological study looking into the patients records kept by specialist - allergists and pulmologists. Retrospective data for eligible patients will be reviewed by participating investigators, physicians taking care of their patients, and recorded in the electronic CRF. Only patients who have been treated for asthma bronchiale (classification of severity - moderate or severe persistent asthma) with fixed combination for at least one year could be included into the study. There are no scheduled visits for any patient participating in the study.</brief_summary>
