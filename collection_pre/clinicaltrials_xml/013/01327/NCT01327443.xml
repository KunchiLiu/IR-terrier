	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a reduction in hepatic mitochondrial function is the main pathophysiology behind NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) and NASH (Non alcoholic steatohepatitis). The investigators further hypothesize that lifestyle modifications through aerobic exercise training without weight loss or diet-induced weight loss are effective in reducing NAFLD parameters by improving hepatic mitochondrial content and function in human subjects. The investigators propose a randomized, controlled human clinical trial to compare the effects of aerobic exercise training (without weight loss) versus diet-induced weight loss (without exercise) in individuals who have NAFLD or liver biopsy-confirmed NASH</brief_summary>
