	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to estimate the effect size of a contingency management procedure that reinforces walking at rates consistent with the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations of 10,000 or more steps per day in older adults. We expect that participants randomized to the contingency management intervention will increase walking to a greater degree than those assigned to a standard care condition.</brief_summary>
