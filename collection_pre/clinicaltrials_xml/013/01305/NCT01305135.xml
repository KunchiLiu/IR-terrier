	<brief_summary>Patients will receive escalating doses of ldarubicin combined to Azacitidine given at the FDA/EMEA approved Schedule and dosing. For the Phase I study : Determine the safety and tolerance of escalating doses of Idarubicin combined to Azacitidine in patients with INT-2 or higher risk MDS. For the phase II study: Primary: Evaluate rate and duration of response (according to IWG 2006 criteria and IWG 2000 criteria) to the combination of Idarubicin and Azacitidine in patients with INT-2 or higher risk MDS</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will receive ldarubicin combined to Azacitidine. - The first 10 patients will receive Idarubicin 5 mg/m2/d on day 8 of each cycle of Azacitidine 75 mg/m2/d CI during 7 days (First Cohort ). - Progression or not to the next cohort of 10 patients : Idarubicin 10 mgm2/d on day 8 of each cycle of Azacitidine 75 mg/m2/d CI during 7 days (Second cohort of 10 patients), will be decided after completion of the first cohort, after review of hematological toxicity by an independent safety review committee (SRC). - The next 21 patients will be treated either according to the first or second cohort schedule of Idarubicin, after review of hematological toxicity and efficacy by an independent safety review committee (SRC).</detailed_description>
