	<brief_title>A Survey Of Clinical Practice Of Adjuvant Treatment Of Breast Cancer Using Exemestane (Aromasin®) In Postmenopausal Hr+ Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It was hypothesized that 200 participating doctors would provide the survey with sufficient statistical precision to meet the objectives, with each participating doctor recruiting up to 6 patients. An initial sample of 1000 doctors should be contacted (letter, phone). These 1000 doctors will initially be chosen at random from a file held by Pfizer of doctors who have agreed to take part in a Pfizer survey. These doctors will be experienced and qualified in the treatment and management of patients with non-metastatic, surgically-treated breast cancer (medical oncologists, gynaecologists, and medical oncologists/ radiation oncologists). They are practicing in general hospitals, teaching hospitals, CRLCC cancer centres and private clinics treating patients with breast cancer. Study recruitment was stopped due to difficulty in enrolling the targeted number of patients on December 3, 2010. There were no safety concerns involved in the decision to stop enrollment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal patients, defined as: natural menopause for at least 1 year, surgical ovariectomy, chemotherapyinduced amenorrhoea for at least 2 years. Patients who have had surgical treatment for histologically confirmed breast cancer that was nonmetastatic at the time of the initial diagnosis.
