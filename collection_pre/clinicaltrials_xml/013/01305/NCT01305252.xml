	<brief_summary>The Study Hypothesis: Aggressive, upfront, dual therapy for treatment-naïve NYHA I/II/III PAH is superior to a traditional "step-up" approach. The study will evaluate: 1. Impact of dual, upfront, therapy on cardiovascular parameters in PAH as gauged by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) at 24 weeks and event free survival at outcome at 48 weeks. 2. Value of novel biomarkers (NT-pro BNP, Mts1/S100A4, and insulin resistance) and cutting-edge imaging technologies (cardiac MRI) as newer endpoints for clinical trials in PAH. 3. Utility of longer clinical trial design with the use of combined clinical events as time to clinical worsening surrogate</brief_summary>

Exclusion criteria: 1. Group II V pulmonary hypertension. 2. PAH with unrepaired congenital heart defect. 3. Current or prior PAH treatments within the last 612 months including experimental PAH therapies (including but not limited to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, rhokinase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostacycline, or cGMP modulators). 4. TLC &lt; 60% predicted; if TLC b/w 60 and 70% predicted, high resolution computed tomography must be available to exclude significant interstitial lung disease. 5.

Diastolic dysfunction ; Grade II C.LV systolic function &lt; 45% d. Pericardial constriction e. Restrictive cardiomyopathy f. Significant coronary disease with demonstrable ischemia 7. Chronic renal insufficiency defined as an estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min (by MDRD equation) 8. Current atrial arrhythmias 9. Uncontrolled systemic hypertension: SBP &gt; 160 mm or DBP &gt; 100mm 10. Severe hypotension: SBP &lt; 80 mmHg. 11. Pregnant or breastfeeding 12. Psychiatric, addictive, or other disorder that compromises patient's ability to provide informed consent, follow study protocol, and adhere to treatment instructions 13. Comorbid conditions that would impair a patient's exercise performance and ability to assess WHO functional class, including but not limited to chronic lowback pain or peripheral musculoskeletal problems. 14. Contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging, including significant claustrophobia, implanted metallic objects, or others as per Appendix X). 15. Known allergy to treprostinil or tadalafil. 16.
