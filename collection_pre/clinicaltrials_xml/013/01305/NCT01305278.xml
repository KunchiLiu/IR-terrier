	<brief_summary>Patients with a unilateral vestibular loss often complain of dizziness and imbalance. Movement usually increases these symptoms often resulting in patients avoiding these movements, causing further limitations in their activities of daily living. Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) involves a series of adaptation and balance exercises to improve symptoms of postural stability. There is evidence that stroke patients gain benefit in their rehabilitation from using gaming consoles (Nintendo Wii Balance) and we believe that similar advantages can be shown for balance patients. We plan a 3 arm study. As there is a considerable wait list for VR, the first arm will receive a Wii console and instructions to use it on the wait list and during VR. The second arm will receive a Wii console and instructions at the end of the waiting list and will use it during VR only and the control group will receive no Wii. All will spend the same time on the wait list and will receive identical assessments and VR</brief_summary>
