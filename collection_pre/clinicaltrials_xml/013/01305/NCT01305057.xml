	<brief_summary>The effects of topically applied pyridoxine tri-isopalmitate (P-IP) which stimulates filaggrin synthesis in keratinocytes, on skin hydration and barrier function were examined. Subjects were separated into two groups to examine the effect of P-IP. Subjects were treated with P-IP formulation on one side of the face and with a placebo formulation on the other side twice daily (morning and evening) for 28 days. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to the study. The skin hydration and TEWL (transepidermal water loss) were evaluated by measuring skin surface conductance with a skin hygrometer SKICON 200EX (I.B.S. ltd., Japan) and TEWL meter AS-CT1 (ASAHI BIOMED, Tokyo, Japan), respectively.</brief_summary>
