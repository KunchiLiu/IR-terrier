	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab with or without fosbretabulin tromethamine works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer that has come back or is persistent. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, find tumor cells and help kill them. Bevacizumab and fosbretabulin tromethamine may stop the growth of ovarian cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether bevacizumab is more effective with or without fosbretabulin tromethamine in treating ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cavity cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With or Without Fosbretabulin Tromethamine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of bevacizumab and fosbretabulin tromethamine (CA4P) compared to bevacizumab alone in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of fosbretabulin tromethamine plus bevacizumab. II. To characterize and compare progression-free survival in patients with measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) and patients with detectable (non-measurable) disease between regimens. III. To determine the overall survival for both regimens. IV. To estimate the proportion of patients with measurable disease who have objective tumor responses by treatment. V. To provide descriptive information about cancer antigen (CA)-125 responses by regimen and where possible by objective tumor responses. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and fosbretabulin tromethamine IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma; histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report Patients must have measurable disease or detectable (nonmeasurable) disease: Measurable disease defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam, or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Detectable disease in a patient is defined as one who does not have measurable disease but has at least one of the following conditions: Baseline values of CA125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definition for target lesions Patients in the measurable disease cohort must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG phase 3 protocol or rare tumor protocol for the same patient population Patients who have had one prior treatment must have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Patients who have had two or three prior treatments must have a performance status of 0 or 1 Patients should be free of acute hepatitis and active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI]) Recovery from the effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy, biological/targeted and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to registration (including small molecules and murine monoclonal antibodies); chimeric or human or humanized monoclonal antibodies (including bevacizumab) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor fusion protein (including VEGF Trap/aflibercept) must be discontinued for at least 12 weeks prior to registration; no investigational therapy within 30 days prior to the first date of study treatment Any prior radiation therapy must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to registration Prior therapy: Patients must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic (biologic/targeted agents, such as bevacizumab) or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than 1 nonplatinum, nontaxane regimen Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, noncytotoxic (biologic/targeted agents, such as bevacizumab) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients must have NOT received any noncytotoxic therapy (biologic/targeted agents) for management of recurrent or persistent disease (e.g., GOG protocol 170 series drugs or bevacizumab) For the purposes of this study, poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors will be considered "cytotoxic", and prior treatment with PARP inhibitors for primary or recurrent disease WILL be allowed (either alone or in combination with chemotherapy) Patients with both platinumsensitive and platinumresistant disease are eligible; patients with platinumrefractory disease are NOT eligible; platinumrefractory disease is defined as patients who have progression of disease during the preceding platinum treatment Definitions: Platinumfree interval (PFI) is the period of time from the date of last platinum therapy to the date of progression (recurrence by CA125, CT, etc.; CT is preferred) of disease or initiation of subsequent therapy (whichever occurs first); nonplatinum maintenance therapy (e.g., extending taxane treatment) is excluded as a "subsequent therapy;" if the patient's last regimen used platinum, and she has NOT progressed before enrolling onto this study, then her PFI will be calculated from the date of last platinum therapy to the date of registration onto this study PFI for the most recent platinum therapy will need to be calculated before enrollment onto this study for stratification purposes (i.e. balanced randomization) Patients who have a PFI =&lt; 182 days (26 weeks) are defined as "platinum resistant;" patients who have 182 &lt; PFI =&lt; 365 days are defined as "GOG platinum sensitive;" finally, patients with PFI &gt; 365 days are defined as "platinum sensitive" ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Potassium within the normal reference range for the laboratory;

patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis OTHER THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer within the last three years are excluded; prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor OTHER THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer within the last three years are excluded;
