	<brief_summary>In this randomized control trial, the investigators hypothesize that late-preterm infants resuscitated with a "low oxygen delivery" strategy (initiation of resuscitation with room air) will result in a significant reduction in oxidant stress without any harmful clinical effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resuscitation of Late-preterm Infants by Using Room Air or 100% Oxygen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The delivery of high oxygen concentrations leads to the production of free radicals that can injure many organ systems. Some studies have shown that resuscitation of term newborn infants with room air were safe and of great benefit. A static room air, however, may be inappropriate for resuscitation of preterm infants. The number of late-preterm infants has increased in recent years, which represent approximately 70% of all preterm infants. Our study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of using room air during resuscitation of late-preterm infants and whether this will avoid oxidative stress derived damage and improve outcomes.</detailed_description>
