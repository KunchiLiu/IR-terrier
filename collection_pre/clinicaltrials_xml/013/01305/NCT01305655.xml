	<brief_title>Glucarpidase Effect on Severe Delayed HDM-clearance in Children Treated With High-dose Mtx in ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NOPHO ALL-2008 protocol is a treatment and research protocol that aims to improve the overall outcome of Nordic children and adolescents with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and with the aim to reduce and prevent toxic treatment complications with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX). The specific and primary objectives of the randomized study is: 1. Early intervention in children and adolescents who experience delayed MTX-clearance and renal dysfunction with the enzyme Glucarpidase which rapidly hydrolyses MTX to non-toxic metabolites and lowers the serum concentration to avoid life threatening complications. Glucarpidase should be given if the 24 hour levels of MTX is &gt; 250 µM, 36 hour levels &gt; 30 µM or 42 hours levels &gt; 10 µM together with a reduced kidney function. Glucarpidase treatment should take place within 48 hours from the start of HD-MTX treatment. 2. To evaluate if the early intervention with Glucarpidase reduce the number of days the patients have to stay at the hospital. 3. Evaluate the reduction of health costs of early intervention in patients with delayed MTX-clearance and renal dysfunction.</detailed_description>
