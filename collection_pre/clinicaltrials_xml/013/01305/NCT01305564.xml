	<brief_summary>The Bard® Denali™ Retrievable Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) study is a prospective, multi-center study which is intended to provide evidence of safety of the placement and retrieval of the Bard® Denali™ Retrievable Inferior Vena Cava Filter in subjects requiring IVC interruption to protect against pulmonary embolism (PE).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject or their legally authorized representative demonstrates understanding of the nature of the study and voluntarily provides written informed consent prior to any data collection or study procedures. The subject is ≥ 21 years old, must be either a male or nonpregnant female with an expected lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures. A negative pregnancy test result (urine or blood) is required prior to implant. If an enrolled female becomes pregnant prior to study completion, participation in the study will be terminated. Based on Investigator judgment, the subject is at increased risk of PE requiring vena caval interruption. Note: Subjects diagnosed with acute DVT and/or PE must have objective confirmation based on imaging evidence of at least one of those diagnoses. Patients without PE or venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) who are at risk of PE may be enrolled in this trial. However, enrollment of these patients will be limited to a maximum of 40% of the total sample size. Based on Investigator's judgment, the subject has patent venous anatomy suitable for femoral or jugular/subclavian access for filter placement (e.g. no excessive tortuosity). The IVC is ≤ 28 mm in diameter at the intended implantation site based on radiographic imaging evidence. Based on Investigator's judgment, the filter can be safely placed such that the position of the filter tip is 1 cm below the lowest renal vein. Retrieval of the filter is expected within 180 days post placement. At the six month follow up, if the Investigator determines that the filter continues to be clinically indicated, the filter may be left in place until the risk of PE has passed or left in permanently. All patients not having their filter retrieved at six months will continue be followed to 24 months or one month post filter retrieval, whichever comes first. The subject has patent venous anatomy suitable for jugular access for retrieval of the filter based on imaging evidence within 48 hours prior to the filter placement procedure. Imaging mode will be at physician's discretion. The subject is willing to comply with the protocol requirements and specified followup evaluations. The subject has a previously implanted filter in the IVC or superior vena cava (SVC). The subject has a duplicated or leftsided IVC. The subject has a severe spinal deformity that would impede access to the IVC for the filter placement or filter retrieval procedures. The subject has a serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl (and not on dialysis) within seven days of study enrollment. Patients on dialysis are allowed to participate in this trial. The subject has a known uncorrectable bleeding diathesis or active coagulopathy. The subject has a life expectancy of &lt; 25 months. The subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to nickel or titanium. The subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to iodinated contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated. NOTE: Alternative contrast agents are not permitted for the purposes of this study. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study.</criteria>
