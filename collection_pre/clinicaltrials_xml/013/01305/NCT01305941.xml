	<brief_summary>Purpose: This study is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial testing the hypothesis that daily everolimus plus weekly vinorelbine and trastuzumab will be effective, safe, and tolerable among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases. Once enrolled, patients will receive everolimus PO daily in combination with weekly intravenous (IV) vinorelbine and trastuzumab. Cycles will be repeated every 3 weeks (21 days). At the time of progression, patients will come off study. Participants: Up to 35 adults over 21 with HER-2 positive breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Of Everolimus, Trastuzumab And Vinorelbine In HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective -To determine the intracranial objective response rate of mTOR inhibition (everolimus) in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive, progressive breast cancer brain metastases as defined via modified RECIST criteria. Secondary Objectives - To determine the intracranial objective response rate of mTOR inhibition (everolimus) in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive, progressive breast cancer brain metastases as defined by MacDonald criteria. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine as assessed via the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 - To evaluate time to intracranial progression after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine as defined via modified RECIST criteria - To evaluate the extracranial objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine. - To evaluate the extracranial time to progression as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine. - To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine. - To evaluate the impact of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine on quality of life as measured by the FACT-B and FACT-Br questionnaires. Exploratory Objective -To evaluate biomarkers in archival tumor tissue samples and correlate with therapeutic response to everolimus in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab. Following Hepatitis B antiviral prophylaxis if required, or following screening and informed consent if antiviral therapy is not needed, treatment will be initiated with everolimus PO daily in combination with weekly intravenous (IV) vinorelbine and trastuzumab (Days 1, 8, and 15) A cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21 days). Cycles of therapy will be repeated until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal from study for other reasons, including death.</detailed_description>

Patients in whom BM are asymptomatic and detected during routine brain MRI screening per institutional protocols are eligible. Prior intracranial radiation therapy (whole brain radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, gamma knife or equivalent) is allowed but not required. Patients with no prior treatment with ICR may be included unless ICR is emergently indicated (in consultation with a local therapist, ie neurosurgeon or radiation oncologist) ECOG performance status of 02. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks. At least 21 years of age. No prior mTOR inhibitors Prior navelbine allowed provided navelbine therapy discontinued &gt;/= 12 months from Day 1 of treatment under this protocol. Last anticancer treatment (including any investigational drug) &gt;/= 2 weeks from initiation of protocol based therapy, provided all AEs (other than alopecia) have resolved to ≤grade 1 at baseline. No active serious infection or other comorbid illness which would impair ability to participate in the trial. Left ventricular ejection fraction assessment (echocardiogram or MUGA scan) performed within 4 weeks prior to study initiation, showing a LVEF value ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN). If patient is on dexamethasone, must be on stable or decreasing dose of dexamethasone for ≥7 days. If patient is on different glucocorticoid e.g., prednisone, must be converted to dexamethasone prior to enrollment. Refer to dose modification of everolimus for patients taking dexamethasone. Interval ≥4 weeks between open brain biopsy and initiation of protocolbased therapy. INR ≤2.0. Anticoagulation is allowed if target INR ≤2.0 on a stable dose of warfarin or if patient on a stable dose of LMW heparin for &gt;1 weeks at time of enrollment. Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤2.5 x ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication. Patients must have adequate organ function as evidenced by: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5/µL Platelet count ≥100,000/µL Hg ≥9 g/dL Bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) AST or ALT ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN if liver metastases are present) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Archived, paraffinembedded tissue block (primary or metastatic) available for genomic studies is required.
