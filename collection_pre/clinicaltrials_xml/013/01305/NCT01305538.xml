	<criteria>Patient with PostHerpetic Neuralgia (PHN) as defined as pain present for more than 6 months after the onset of a herpes zoster skin rash affecting the trigeminal, cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. Based on patient diary information collected during the Baseline week (day 7 to randomization Day 1), patient has completed at least 5 diary entries and has an average weekly pain rating of at least 4 on the 11point pain rating scale. The patient is able to satisfactorily complete, in the Investigator's judgment, the Cognitive Battery. Male or female, 1885 years of age. Other severe pain that may potentially confound pain assessment. History of complete lack of response to pregabalin (at least 300 mg qd for 4 weeks) or gabapentin (at least 1800 mg qd for 4 weeks). Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9% Hemoglobin ≤ 9 g/dL. Active herpes zoster or known viral infection. Previous neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy for PHN. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the reexpressed abbreviated (fourvariable) Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation ≤ 40ml/min/1.73m2. Patients who have been on a stable dose of anticonvulsant,anticholinergic, antiviral medications, nicotine replacements, or any other smoking cessation medications for &lt;4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients who are on stable doses for =&gt; 4 weeks prior to randomization are allowed, however, there should be no adjustments to the dose of these medications during study. Patients currently on more than one drug for treatment of neuropathic pain (low dose opioids, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants). Patients are allowed to participate if on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization (Day1) and should remain stable during course of study.</criteria>
