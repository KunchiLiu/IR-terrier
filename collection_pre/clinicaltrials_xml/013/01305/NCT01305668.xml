	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease has two heterogeneous conditions (chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema phenotypes) with a different clinical presentation. The phenotype evaluation in COPD patient (trough clinical, functional and radiographic parameters) could influence final results in pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of the disease. The aim of our study is to investigate whether COPD patients with different disease phenotype (chronic bronchitis versus pulmonary emphysema) have a different response to PR.</brief_summary>
