	<brief_title>Understanding Medication Adherence Among HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are planning a study to improve health outcomes among patients with HIV/AIDS using insights from behavioral economics and financial incentives. We will conduct a survey with HIV/AIDS patients at Ponce Clinic (Infectious Disease Program of Grady Memorial Hospital, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). The patients will be low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and possessing varying degrees of medication adherence. We want to better understand how this particular population would react to commitment devices designed to increase medication adherence. We will survey participants to see if they would prefer more commitment, in the form of a "Take-Medication-Get-Paid" plan; less commitment, in the form of an "Attend-Clinic-Get-Paid" plan; or if they would prefer to designate their own levels of commitment.</detailed_description>
