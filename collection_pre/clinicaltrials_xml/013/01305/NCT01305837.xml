	<brief_title>Cyclic Oral Methylprednisolone Trial in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is presumably T-cell mediated and it is the most common non-traumatic cause of disability affecting young people. 85 % of the MS causes starts out as relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and 15 % as primary progressive MS (PPMS). It has been found that after 10 years 40-45 % of the RRMS patients will convert to a more progressive state of disease, secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Until recently it has been believed that the progression seen in MS occurred because of axonal loss and neurodegeneration could occur independently of inflammation. Now neuropathology studies shows that there is a close association between inflammation and neurodegeneration in all stages of MS - also the progressive forms of MS. Osteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix protein with chemokine, cytokine and intergrin properties. It has multiple immunological functions and is secreted by activated macrophages, leukocytes and activated T lymphocytes. It is present in extracellular fluids and is up-regulated at sites of inflammation. Increased levels of OPN where reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with MS. The main aim of this study is to analyze the effect of cyclic oral methylprednisolone on the intrathecal inflammation in patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis measured by OPN in the CSF. Second the investigators will look at other aims of intrathecal inflammation, neurodegeneration, demyelination and safety.</detailed_description>
