	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether the incidence of sore throat and other tracheal co-morbidities such as dysphagia and hoarseness can be lessened by use of a cuff manometer at the beginning of surgery to inflate to the proper pressure compared to the standard technique. The investigators hypothesis is that inflation of the endotracheal balloon using a cuff manometer immediately after intubation will reduce the incidence of sore throat and other tracheal co-morbidities.</brief_summary>
