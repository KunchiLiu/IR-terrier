	<brief_title>Local Infiltration Analgesia During Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of LIA is to gain an effective and safe pain control during the first postoperative days. The study is a single-center, randomized controlled trial, which will be performed in Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement in Tampere, Finland. The injectant mixture consists of 150 mg levobupivacaine mixed with 30 mg ketorolac and 0.5 mg adrenaline with occasional variations if the patient is unusually small, very elderly, infirm or has a history of significant intolerance to analgesics or anesthetic agents. The RKA mixture is diluted with normal saline. Total volume of the solution is 100 ml depending on the size of the wound. The normal saline injection are used in the control group in the same manner than in the RKA group.</detailed_description>
