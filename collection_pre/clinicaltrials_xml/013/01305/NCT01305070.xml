	<brief_summary>Comparison of recurrent-restenosis rates 6 months after angioplasty of in-stent restenoses or in-stent reocclusions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) using either a standard balloon (Admiral Xtreme, Invatec) or a paclitaxel-eluting balloon (In.Pactâ„¢ Admiral, Invatec).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age &gt; 21 years old. 2. Patient must sign informed consent form. 3. Patient must agree to participate in the study and comply with followup requirements. 4. Clinically, all patients must be in Rutherford category 2 to 4. Angiographic 5. Planned angioplasty of instent restenoses (degree of stenosis 70100%) within the SFA. The target lesion must not extend beyond the stent margins. In cases of two or more stenotic regions within the stented segment, these are considered separate lesions if there is a nonstenotic or only mildly stenotic (&lt; 30%) segment of at least 2 cm in length between them. Otherwise, they are considered a single lesion. In case of separate lesions, only the proximal lesion will be taken as the target lesion! 6. The length of the instent lesion should be at least 1 cm and maximally 20 cm (measurement by radiopaque ruler). 7. The degree of target lesion stenosis must be determined by preinterventional duplex ultrasound. 8. The target lesion region starts at the origin of the SFA and ends distally at the femoropopliteal crossover (crossing by SFA of medial rim of femur in the PA projection). 9. Patency (&lt; 50% stenosis) of popliteal artery and at least 1 infragenicular artery. General: 1. Patient is currently participating in another clinical trial. 2. Pregnancy or pregnancy planned during study duration. 3. Life expectancy less than 1 year. 4. Comorbidities preventing study participation. 5. Severe coagulation disorders. 6. Current treatment with anticoagulants other than aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel or prasugrel. 7. Active gastric ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding. 8. Thrombotic occlusion of the target vessel within previous 4 weeks. 9. Treatment of target lesion with laser or atherectomy devices. 10. Dialysis dependency. 11. Manifest hyperthyreosis. 12. Known allergy against contrast agent that cannot be adequately controlled by usual premedication. 13. Known heparin intolerance. 14. Known paclitaxel intolerance. Angiographic: 15. Target lesion extends into the popliteal artery. 16. Symptomatic untreated inflow lesion &gt; 50% in ipsilateral iliac arteries. Pretreatment of iliac stenoses is possible. 17. SFA lesions &gt; 50% stenosis proximal and/or distal to the target lesion that require treatment. 18. Target lesion extends beyond the stent margins.</criteria>
