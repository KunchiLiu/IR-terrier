	<brief_title>E7050 in Combination With Cetuximab Versus Cetuximab Alone in the Treatment of Platinum-Resistant Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib: a safety run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with Cetuximab; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 2-arm period. Approximately 95 patients with Platinum-Resistant Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the head and neck will be enrolled in the study (10-15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 80 patients in the Phase II portion). Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or the Phase II portion of the study. In the phase II portion, Patients will receive study treatment (E7050 plus Cetuximab or Cetuximab alone) for approximately six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). Beyond 24 weeks, patients who are experiencing clinical benefit may continue E7050 plus cetuximab, cetuximab alone or E7050 alone (Arm 1), or may continue cetuximab alone (Arm 2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm, for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated.</detailed_description>
