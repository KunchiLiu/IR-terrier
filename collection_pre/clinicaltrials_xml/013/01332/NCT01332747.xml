	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate Antihyperlipidemic Effect of a Classical Unani Antiobesity Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The largest proportion of cardiovascular diseases is represented by Coronary artery disease(CAD), cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases. During the past decades efficacious strategies have been developed for prevention of these diseases. These strategies involve general lifestyle changes, which include, healthy diet, optimal weight, physical activity, moderate or no alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation, treatment of high blood pressure, control of diabetes mellitus and in particular, treatment of hyperlipidemia. - Major clinical trials carried out, have shown a clear benefit of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C) reduction in terms of both CAD events and total mortality. A similar reduction in the relative risk of coronary events has been documented in patients with and without clinically evident CAD and in patients with mild or severe hyperlipidemia. - Hyperlipidemia can be primary which is gene related causing defects in the synthesis of lipoprotein degradation. The other type of hyperlipidemia is secondary which is subsequent to related metabolic abnormalities. - Although several Unani physicians have mentioned considerable details about fats in blood but it is observed that Hyperlipidemia has not been mentioned per se in the classical Unani literature. - A condition that resembles hyperlipidemia in various aspects like etiology, clinical features and complications has been described as obesity in the classical Unani literature and mentions related methods for managing such disorders including regimens and drugs (for reducing weight) are also observed in such references. - Unani physicians have bracketed obesity under cold derangement of temperament. - Unani physicians have emphasized the effect of Safoof-e-Muhazzil as the main weight loss drug. - Furthermore, Many of the drugs present in Safoof-e-Muhazzil including Lac which itself is a constituent of Safoof-e-Muhazzil have been attributed by Unani physicians to have de obstruent, desiccant, and softening and relaxant effect on vessel walls properties which further supports our hypothesis. These properties are also in cohesion with our hypothesis and perhaps these drugs may have scraping effect on atherosclerotic vessel walls. - Lipids are metabolized mainly in the liver and it is the error of the liver or the weakness of the liver that these lipids go unchecked into the blood stream. - Since most of constituents of Safoof-e-Muhazzil including Lac have been attributed to be liver strengthening agents, hence, due to their corrective effect on liver may help correcting raised lipid levels in the blood.</detailed_description>
