	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to find the optimal management of patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST elevations treated by primary PCI who have at least one significant stenosis of non-culprit coronary artery. The primary endpoint of the study will be incidence of combined endpoint of all cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke during the follow up of 24 months in group of patients treated with staged revascularization (PCI or CABG) in comparison with patients treated conservatively.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) of the occlussion or significant stenosis of infarct artery is a method of choice in treatment of acute myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI). It is not clear, what is the optimal management of patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST elevations (STEMI) treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) who have at least one significant stenosis of non-culprit coronary artery. Numerous cardiology centers perform staged PCI on significant stenoses involving the "non-infarct" coronary artery (arteries) 3-40 days after PPCI, but the benefit of this staged PCI for such patients has not yet been clearly demonstrated. Aim of study: The aim is to find the optimal management of patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST elevations (STEMI) treated by PPCI who have at least one significant stenosis of non-culprit coronary artery. The primary endpoint of the study will be incidence of combined endpoint of all cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke during the follow up of 24 months in group of patients treated with staged revascularization (PCI or CABG) in comparison with patients treated conservatively. Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that complete staged revascularization of significant stenoses of the coronary arteries will improve the long-term prognosis in patients after PPCI as compared to conservative management.</detailed_description>
