	<brief_summary>The purpose of this retrospective claims database study was to compare the change in migraine-related prescription (i.e. NSAIDs, Opioids, Ergots) utilization among migraine suffers following initiation of Treximet ™ (sumatriptan/naproxen) compared with subjects initiating treatment with other orally available triptans. The study was used to validate the migraine-related prescription utilization patterns predicted by the Treximet ™ Budget Impact Model. The SourceLx dataset from the family of Wolters Kluwer databases was used for this analysis. The database contains 30% of prescription claims filled in the United States (US), approximately 160 million patient lives. The data has broad representative coverage at both the geographic and payment levels.</brief_summary>
