	<brief_summary>The investigators aims in the current study are to examine whether the cholinergic status should be considered as another risk factor for the metabolic syndrome and it's co-morbidities and to test the effect of a hypocaloric high complex carbohydrates diet on the cholinergic status of overweight and obese adults with and without the metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholinergic Status and the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention studies have demonstrated that the autonomic disturbances of the metabolic syndrome may be reversible. A reduction in body weight induced by a hypocaloric diet exerts a marked reduction in sympathetic activity in obese people with or without metabolic syndrome. Incorporation of regular, moderate intensity aerobic exercise training during a dietary weight loss program does not confer additional benefits on resting sympathetic neural activity, compared with weight loss by diet alone. A new method has been developed to examine the sympathetic-parasympathetic status of an individual - the cholinergic status. Cholinergic Status represents the total soluble circulation capacity for acetylcholine hydrolysis. Higher cholinergic status means the individual is more sympathetic . A cross sectional study that took place in Tel Aviv Sorasky medical center and included 632 participants found that the cholinergic status is related to metabolic syndrome parameters in a dose response manner and that it correlates significantly with glucose,HbA1c, lipid profile and hs-CRP.</detailed_description>
