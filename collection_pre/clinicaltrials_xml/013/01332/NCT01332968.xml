	<brief_summary>This open-label, randomized study will assess the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab (RO5072759) in combination with chemotherapy compared to MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) with chemotherapy followed by obinutuzumab or MabThera/Rituxan maintenance in patients with untreated advanced indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After the end of the induction period, patients achieving response (CR or PR) will go on to a maintenance period thereby continuing on their randomized antibody treatment alone every 2 months until disease progression for a total of 2 years. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to approximately 2.5 years. After maintenance or observation patients will be followed for 5 years until progression. After progression, patients will be followed for new anti-lymphoma therapy and overall survival until the end of the study.</brief_summary>
