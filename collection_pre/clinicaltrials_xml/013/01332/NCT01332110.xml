	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common running injury and is believed to be associated with higher than normal knee joint loading. Footwear has been developed that may decrease these knee loads in healthy subjects, but their effects on patients with PFPS are unknown. In this study, we aim to test the effects of such footwear on patients with PFPS. We hypothesize that patients who receive the footwear intervention will show a decrease in knee joint loading, and consequently will show improvements in subjective levels of perceived knee pain over a period of six weeks compared to a control condition.</brief_summary>
