	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effect of dosing with fluticasone furoate 100 μg (micrograms) in asthmatic subjects aged 5-11 years of age. Fluticasone furoate is currently under development as the inhaled corticosteroid component of a combination product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist. The study will be a randomized two-way crossover, with a placebo control. During each treatment period subjects will receive a daily dose via a novel dry powder inhaler for 14 days. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the aim that 20 will complete the study. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels will be investigated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and premenarchial female subjects aged 511 years on the last planned treatment day are eligible for this study. Premenarchial females are defined as any female who has yet to begin menses and is considered Tanner Stage 2 or less. Diagnosis of asthma at least 6 months prior to screening. Patients must be controlled on their existing asthma treatment at screening as defined by a Childhood Asthma Control Test score of &gt;19 and PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow) ≥80% predicted. Apart from asthma, eczema and rhinitis, subjects should be healthy and suffer from no other significant medical conditions. Subjects must be taking a stable regimen of a short acting betaagonist inhaler on an asneed basis for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Subjects must weigh at least 15 kg (kilograms). Subjects must demonstrate ability to accept and effectively use the fluticasone furoate devices using the demonstration kits provided to the site. Subjects and parents/guardians must be able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions. Parents/guardians must have the ability to read, write and record diary information collected throughout the study. They must also have the ability to manage study drug administration and PEF assessments. A signed and dated written informed consent from at least one parent/guardian, and accompanying informed assent from the subject prior to admission to the study. Subjects who have changed their asthma medication within 4 weeks of screening or subjects currently being treated with inhaled corticosteroids or have received such treatment within 4 weeks of screening. In addition, subjects currently receiving (or have received within 4 weeks of screening) any of the following asthma therapies: theophyllines, longacting inhaled betaagonists or oral betaagonists. Any medical condition or circumstance making the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study (e.g. history of lifethreatening asthma). Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment, including asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, intravenous) or emergency room attendance within 3 months or asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization within 6 months prior to screening. Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of screening and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study. Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at screening. Parent/guardian has history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, substance abuse, or other condition (e.g., inability to read, comprehend and write) which will limit the validity of consent to participate in this study. Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of the novel dry powder inhaler (i.e., lactose or magnesium stearate), for example, history of severe milk protein allergy. A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating Investigator, subInvestigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating Investigator. Children who are wards of the state or government. Evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the 12lead ECG (electrocardiogram) at screening.</criteria>
