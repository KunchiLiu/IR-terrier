	<brief_title>Study of TRC105 Combined With Standard-Dose Bevacizumab for Advanced Solid Tumors for Which Bevacizumab is Indicated</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor types. TRC105, a monoclonal antibody to CD105, is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor that complements bevacizumab in preclinical models. Together, these antibodies may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with bevacizumab alone. The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose for TRC105 when added to standard dose bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors for which bevacizumab is indicated.</detailed_description>
