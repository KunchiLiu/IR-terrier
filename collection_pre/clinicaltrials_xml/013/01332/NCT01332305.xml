	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to generate the data necessary to determine the gabapentin exposure produced by 4 dose levels of GEn (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg, and 2400 mg) or placebo, and the corresponding relief of symptoms in subjects with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study, comparing 4 doses of GEn (XP13512) with placebo given once daily to subjects with RLS. Eligible subjects were randomized in equal numbers into 1 of 5 treatment groups (GEn 600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg, or 2400 mg or placebo) for 12 weeks of treatment. Data from this study will be utilized as part of a larger pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis of data from several studies (XP084/RXP111495) that are part of the GEn RLS clinical development program. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.</detailed_description>
