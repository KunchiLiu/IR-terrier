	<brief_summary>This phase II, multicentric, national pilot trial is designed to estimate the sustained virological response rate (SVR) following a 12 weeks treatment by telaprevir combined with a 48 or 72 weeks treatment by peginterferon and ribavirin, based upon the rapid virological response (RVR) at week 8 (4 weeks after telaprevir start), and to compare the observed SVR to 20%, a rate determining a significant therapeutic benefit in this population of patients. The primary endpoint will be the SVR defined as undetectable HCV-RNA measured 24 weeks after the end of therapy (EOT).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II pilot trial is designed for HIV-1 and HCV genotype 1 coinfected patients who had previously failed a peginterferon-ribavirin regimen. Intervention Design: - Induction, Lead-in, phase: day 0 to week 4 PegInterferon alpha-2a, 180 µg subcutaneous injection, once weekly + Ribavirin (weight-based dose) 1000 mg for subjects weighing &lt;75 kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing ≥75 kg, b.i.d. - Telaprevir phase: week 4 to week 16 PegInterferon alpha-2a, 180 µg subcutaneous injection, once weekly + Ribavirin (weight-based dose) 1000 mg for subjects weighing &lt;75 kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing ≥75 kg, b.i.d. + Telaprevir 750 mg q 8h (or 1125 mg q 8h in association with Efavirenz) - Maintenance phase: week 16 to week 48 or 72 PegInterferon alpha-2a, 180 µg subcutaneous injection, once weekly + Ribavirin (weight-based dose) 1000 mg for subjects weighing &lt;75 kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing ≥75 kg, b.i.d. The duration of the maintenance phase is determined by the RVR at week 8 (4 weeks after Telaprevir start. Complete RVR (not measurable HCV-RNA at week 8): maintenance from week 16 to week 48 _Partial RVR (HCV-RNA below 1 000 UI/mL but still measurable at week 8): maintenance phase from week 16 to week 48 And stable antiretroviral treatment for over 3 months among the authorized combinations: (tenofovir 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, atazanavir 300 mg, ritonavir 100 mg) q.d. or (tenofovir 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, efavirenz 600 mg) q.d. or (tenofovir 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg q.d. and raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d.) once Drug-Drug interaction data will be available. Patients who could not receive one of these 3 combinations can be included if they are receiving a stable combination of at least 3 drugs among the following: tenofovir, emtricitabine/lamivudine, efavirenz, atazanavir-boosted or not, raltegravir (once Drug-Drug interaction data will be available). These patients cannot participate in the pharmacokinetic study. The trial will enroll 80 subjects. The proportion of patients included, presenting with cirrhosis (METAVIR F4) will remain below 50% of all patients The proportion of patients included, null-responders to previous HCV treatment (HCV-RNA decline at week 12 less than 2 log10 UI/ml) but no cirrhosis (maximum equal METAVIR F3) will remain below 30% of patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent form signed at screening visit at the latest Patient registered with or covered by a social security scheme HIV1 infection Chronic, genotype 1, hepatitis C with detectable HCV RNA at screening Virological failure following a previous treatment of at least 12 weeks by peginterferon alpha2a ≥ 135 µg once weekly or peginterferon alpha2b ≥ 1.0 µg per kg once weekly + ribavirin ≥ 600 mg once daily. Virological failure defined by persistence of a detectable HCVRNA, with the same genotype than before. Null responder patient, with less than 2 Log10 HCVRNA decline at week 12 with cirrhosis are excluded from the study. Null responder patients without cirrhosis (equal or below METAVIR F3) are limited to less than 30 % of all patients included No Interferon and/or Ribavirin within past 6 months Stable antiretroviral treatment for over 3 months at screening. Authorized combinations: tenofoviremtricitabineboosted atazanavir,tenofoviremtricitabineefavirenz,tenofoviremtricitabineraltegravir, once DrugDrug interaction data will be available. Patients with a stable combination of at least 3 of the following drugs: tenofovir, emtricitabine/lamivudine, efavirenz, atazanavirboosted or not, raltegravir.

Patients with a previous liver biopsy exhibiting cirrhosis lesions (METAVIR F4) are allowed to enter the study without a new biopsy.
