	<brief_summary>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Effective treatment for tobacco dependence exists and includes counseling and pharmacotherapy with nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline. The health care system is a key channel for delivering this treatment to smokers. Brief clinical interventions delivered at office visits increase smoking cessation rates, are among the most cost-effective of medical interventions, and are recommended by U.S. Public Health Service. However, physicians and other clinicians often fail to provide them. Clinicians' rates of providing tobacco treatment in ambulatory care can be improved, but even when successful, clinicians can only reach smokers who make an office visit. A health care system might improve its delivery of tobacco treatment by supplementing visit-based efforts with a population-based strategy, using methods proven effective in public health settings. A population of smokers could be identified from electronic health records and offered treatment proactively in a way that maximizes convenience and minimizes barriers such the cost of pharmacotherapy. This study tests the effectiveness of a population-based Direct-to-Smoker (DTS) outreach program provided to smokers in one community health center in Revere, MA, that is part of an integrated health care system. It uses the system's population management tools to identify smokers and proactively offers them evidence-based tobacco treatment that is free and does require making an office visit. A randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of the DTS program to usual primary care. The hypothesis is that adding the DTS program to usual primary care will increase the proportion of smokers who use tobacco dependence treatment and thereby stop smoking.</brief_summary>
