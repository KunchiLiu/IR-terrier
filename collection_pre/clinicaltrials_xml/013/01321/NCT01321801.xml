	<detailed_description>Acute pain frequently occurs during the postoperative period.Not treated acute postoperative pain may predict the development of chronic pain.Recently, the analgesic effect of pregabalin, as a part of a multimodal analgesia, has been evaluated in many studies. They have shown that pregabalin may have a role in the post operative pain management, as an adjunct. Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic drug, which have a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile from its predecessor gabapentin. Acute postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is complex in nature. Postoperative pain is the main complaint and the primary reason for delay discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.The study includes patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
