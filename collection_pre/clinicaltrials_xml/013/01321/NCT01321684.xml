	<brief_summary>For unilateral spinal block, spinal local anesthetics should take effect on the spinal nerves of one side. With full flexion of the spine, the cauda equina becomes tightened and hangs in the middle of the subarachnoid space. This study was performed to assess if flexion of the vertebral column facilitates unilateral spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
