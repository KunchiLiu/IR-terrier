	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of a pregabalin controlled release (CR) tablet administered fasted in the evening relative to a single dose of the CR tablet administered immediately following a 600 to 750 calorie evening meal. The single dose pharmacokinetics of the pregabalin CR administered fed or fasted will also be compared to the single dose pharmacokinetics of the pregabalin immediate release (IR) capsule. In addition, the safety and tolerability of these 3 treatments will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
