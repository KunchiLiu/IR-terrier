	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a home care medication management program which includes nurse coordination and use of the MD.2 medication-dispensing machine will affect older adults' health outcomes, satisfaction, use of health care services, and health care costs over a one year period. The investigators propose a longitudinal three group repeated measures design, enrolling, and randomly assigning, clients who are discharged from a home health care agency with documented problems in medication management. One group will receive the MD.2 medication dispensing device and nurse coordination, the second group will receive a Medplanner: a simple box that has separate compartments for individual medication times over the course of a week plus nurse coordination, and the final group will receive Usual Care. The study hypotheses are the following: H1: With respect to health status outcomes, the MD.2 group will exhibit a more positive trajectory in physical and mental health status, functional status, cognitive status and depressive symptoms over the course of a year than will the Medplanner Group. H2: With respect to health status outcomes, the Medplanner Group will exhibit a more positive trajectory in physical and mental health status, functional status, cognitive status and depressive symptoms over the course of a year than will the Usual Care Group. H3: The rate of hospitalization, hospital days and emergency department visits will be significantly lower for the MD.2 Group as compared to the Medplanner Group. H4: The rate of hospitalization, hospital days and emergency department visits will be significantly lower for the Medplanner Group as compared to the Usual Care Group. H5: The nursing home admission rate will be significantly lower for the MD.2 Group as compared to the Medplanner Group. H6: The nursing home admission rate will be significantly lower for the Medplanner Group as compared to the Usual Care Group. H7: The total cost of care will be significantly lower for the MD.2 Group as compared to the Medplanner Group. H8: The total cost of care will be significantly lower for the Medplanner Group as compared to The Usual Care Group. H9: There will be incremental savings in terms of costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the MD.2 group compared with the Medplanner Group. H10: There will be incremental savings in terms of costs per QALY gained in the Medplanner group compared with the Usual Care Group.</brief_summary>
