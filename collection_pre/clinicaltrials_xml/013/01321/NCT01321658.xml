	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled trial on frail elderly patients (aged 65+) with colorectal cancer. The patients will be randomized into two groups. The control group will receive standard surgical treatment. The intervention group will in addition go through a preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment. The assessment will include evaluation of co-morbidity and medication, social status, nutritional status, cognition, depression and physical performance. This assessment will form basis of an individualized perioperative intervention. The main aim of the study is to see if the number of postoperative complications in this group can be reduced by a perioperative geriatric intervention. A study of inflammation markers in serum will also be performed, with focus on identifying potential biological frailty markers.</brief_summary>
