	<brief_summary>The sleep respiratory troubles (central apnea or CHEYNES-Stokes dyspnea) are frequent after stroke. The association of the sleep respiratory troubles with a reserved functional prognosis is debated. The purpose is to find out the frequency of the sleep respiratory troubles after stroke in a PRM department and to study their relationship with functional and neurological recovery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sleep respiratory troubles (central apnea or CHEYNES-Stokes dyspnea) are frequent after stroke. The association of the sleep respiratory troubles with a reserved functional prognosis is debated. The purpose is to find out the frequency of the sleep respiratory troubles after stroke in a PRM department and to study their relationship with functional and neurological recovery. Forty-five patients with the average of 58,2 years had been included in this prospective MONOCENTRICAL study. The detection of the sleep respiratory troubles was realised using a nocturnal oxymetry device and measuring the inspiratory flow, gathering the index of apnea-hypopnea. The NIHSS, the FIM and the FUGL-MEYER scales were used at the moment of inclusion and two months AFTERWORDS.</detailed_description>
