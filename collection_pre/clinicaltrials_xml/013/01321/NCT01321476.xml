	<brief_summary>This study will use excess tissue from endoscopic or surgical procedures to examine the elements of plaque that are found in the carotid walls of patients who have a type of heart and blood vessel disease called atherosclerosis. Tissue will be collected from patients undergoing carotid procedures as well as patients undergoing liver and/or intestinal biopsies. This lab study will examine the different types of proteins that play a role in developing heart plaque.</brief_summary>
