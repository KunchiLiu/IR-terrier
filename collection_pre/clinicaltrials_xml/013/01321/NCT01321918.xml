	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is the formation of a DNA bank to realise a case-control genetic study designed to identify sequence variations in DNA that predispose to sudden cardiac death in adults. The secondary objective of this study is the creation of a register for epidemiological surveillance of adult extra-hospital sudden death.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criteria for register : Adults ≥ 18 years of age. Persons who experienced sudden death defined as follows :cardiovascular arrest of non traumatic origin that occurred unexpectedly within an hour after the start of any prodromes. Patients not hospitalized at the time of sudden death. Inclusion criteria for DNA bank : Case subjects : Adults ≥ 18 years of age. Persons who experienced sudden death defined as follows :cardiovascular arrest of non traumatic origin that occurred unexpectedly within an hour after the start of any prodromes. Patients not hospitalized at the time of sudden death. Patients supported clinically by an emergency ambulance service. Control subjects : Adults ≥ 18 years of age. Adults hospitalized in an cardiac intensive care unit. EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criteria for register : Violent death : criminal, suicidal or accidental. Exclusion criteria for DNA bank : Case subjects : Violent death : criminal, suicidal or accidental. Identified cause of death extracardiac : neurological cause, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, aortic rupture or other identified extracardiac cause. In accordance with Articles L12215 L1221L12218 and 81 of the Code of Public Health, the categories of persons are excluded from research due to the fact that it can be achieved with an efficiency comparable over another class of people : Adult subject to legal protection measure, Pregnant woman, Parturient, Breastfeeding mother, Person deprived of liberty, Person hospitalised without his consent, Person admitted to a medical or socially facility. Control subjects : History of sudden death, Documented history of ventricular fibrillation, History of sustained ventricular tachycardia (lasting longer than 30 seconds) documented.</criteria>
