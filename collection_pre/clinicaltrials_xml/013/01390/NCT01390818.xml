	<brief_summary>This research trial is testing a combination of two experimental drugs, MSC1936369B (Mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) Inhibitor) and SAR245409 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pi3K)/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor), in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The primary purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the drug combination.</brief_summary>
