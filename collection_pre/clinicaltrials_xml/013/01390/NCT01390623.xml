	<brief_summary>Urinary tract community infections are one of very frequent reason consultation and prescription. Urinary tract represents the second site of bacterial community infection after the respiratory system. The management of the acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis was simply codified in the past recommendations of the French Agency for Safety Health Products (AFSSAPS) in 2008. Treatment is based on two main families of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones with 7 days treatment and 3rd generation cephalosporins with 10 to 14 days treatment. The practice of a short treatment with ceftriaxone intra venous relayed by cefixime orally provides a simplified treatment for patients, a reduced use of fluoroquinolones and a probable decrease in correlation with the emergence of fluoroquinolones resistance, and finally, a decrease in the cost of treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be included by investigators or coinvestigateurs, the day of consultation in the emergency adult department in Clermont-Ferrand city. The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis is established in the emergency department based on the clinical, laboratory and imaging criteria.
