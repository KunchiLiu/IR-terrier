	<brief_title>Safety Study of Anti-Influenza Virus Monoclonal Antibody to Treat Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza is a highly communicable acute respiratory disease that is considered to be one of the major infectious disease threats to the human population. Annual vaccination is generally effective only against those strains included in the vaccine. Because of the frequent emergence of divergent variants and the periodic emergence of strains with novel hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase surface proteins that can result in global pandemics, the availability of potent antiviral agents for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza remains an urgent clinical and public health priority.</detailed_description>
