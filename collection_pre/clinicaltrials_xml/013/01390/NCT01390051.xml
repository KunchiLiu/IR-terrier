	<brief_title>Can Low Molecular Weight Heparin During Pregnancy With Intrauterine Growth Restriction Increase Birth Weight?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical purpose: 1. To examine whether treatment with low molecular weight heparin in pregnant women with Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)increases the birth weight of the child. Our hypothesis is that an increased birth weight leads to reduced morbidity and mortality among these children. Laboratory purposes: 1. To evaluate three new methods to monitor the effect of LMWH. 2. To investigate if 2 biochemical markers are positive predictors of IUGR IUGR is defined as a foetus that grows less than expected. IUGR is estimated to occur in up to 5% of all pregnancies, and IUGR is the second most common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Thus, 75% of all stillbirths are caused by IUGR. IUGR is diagnosed by ultrasonography. In IUGR the uteroplacental blood flow is often compromised resulting in foetal growth restriction. Design: The study is a prospective randomised study where pregnant women with suspected severe IUGR are randomised either to treatment with Innohep® or no treatment. Half of the women receive Innohep® and half of the women do not receive treatment. Endpoints The primary endpoint is the difference in birth weight in children born of women receiving Innohep® during pregnancy and children born of women who have not received Innohep® during pregnancy</detailed_description>
