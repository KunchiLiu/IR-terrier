	<brief_summary>It is known that intravenous immunoglobulins can induce hemolysis, but the mechanism is not known in detail. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the specificity of antigens on red blood cells in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who have shown signs of clinically relevant hemolysis following treatment with the intravenous immunoglobin Privigen®. The study was to explore potential mechanisms of hemolysis by analysis of the specificity of the antibodies possibly involved. To distinguish between clinically non-relevant hemolysis and a relevant intravascular hemolysis, an independent adjudication by a committee was performed for each patient with signs of hemolysis determined in the laboratory or in the clinic. This study was requested as a post-marketing commitment study by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By September 2014, no case of clinically significant intravascular hemolysis was found, and the FDA agreed to halt the study and analyze all hemolysis-relevant endpoints using FDA criteria for hemolysis in addition to analyses planned in the protocol. The study was not restarted.</brief_summary>
