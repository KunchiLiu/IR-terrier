	<brief_summary>Hypertension is a chronic disease that affects about 23% of the brazilian population. The treatment of hypertension by pharmacological intervention is efficacious, but has side effects and significant costs. Techniques that reduce the respiratory rate are shown as a effective non-pharmacological treatment in controlling blood pressure. Evidence has shown that a slow and deep breathing rate, around 10 breaths per minute or less, significantly reduces blood pressure. However, the physiological mechanisms involved in blood pressure decrease due to decreased respiratory rate are not yet known. Therefore the goals of this study will evaluate the chronic effect of breathing exercise guided on office and 24 hours blood pressure and analyse the chronic effect of breathing exercise guided over the autonomic function in hypertensive patients in stages 1 and 2.</brief_summary>
