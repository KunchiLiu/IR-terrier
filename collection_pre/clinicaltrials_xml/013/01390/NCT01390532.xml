	<brief_summary>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with advanced heart failure and left ventricular dyssynchrony (LVD). Too many patients do not clinically improve with CRT. New LVD markers other than QRS duration are needed. Study objective : feasibility assessment of rest and real-time stress 3D Blood-Pool Gated SPECT (BPGS) with a new designed cardiac imaging camera (DSPECT, Spectrum DynamicsÂ®, Ceasaria, Israel) to quantify LVD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rest/Stress Quantification Of Left Ventricular Dyssynchrony By 3D Gated Blood Pool D-SPECT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sequential 5 min Gated blood pool D-SPECT acquisition at rest and during last stage of dobutamine and atropin infusion (&gt;85% PHR). Rest and stress left ventricular ejection fraction, phase standard deviation and entropy will be determined using a fully automatic commercial software (QBS, Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, CA).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Chronic heart failure with LVEF &lt; 35 %, QRS &gt; 120 ms, NYHA III/IV, optimal medical therapy for more than one month.
