	<brief_summary>In this protocol the investigators plan to demonstrate management of glucose using a modular insulin management system based on continuous glucose monitoring and targeted towards the avoidance of hypoglycemic and prolonged hyperglycemic episodes (i.e. control to range). The protocol is designed to challenge the insulin management system with meals and mild exercise, so as to demonstrate its capacity to avoid large glucose excursion with changing metabolic state. This system is designed to both - monitor the meal boluses of the patient and correct it in case of observed/predicted under insulinization (avoidance of prolonged hyperglycemia), based on a coarse and subjective knowledge of the meal amount, a precise understanding of the subject's day to day insulin treatment, continuous glucose monitoring, and past insulin injections; - predict and avoid hypoglycemic events, based on continuous glucose reading and past insulin injection. The investigators plan to enroll 12 adolescent T1DM patients (expected retention 10/12) and compare glucose control performances under two treatments: standard vs. the new insulin management system. The protocol will include a total of 5 admissions per subject (3 out-patients and 2 in-patients): screening, CGM insertion 1, CGM insertion 2, inpatient 1 and inpatient 2. During the 24h inpatient admissions the patients will be challenged with 30 minutes of mild exercise and 3 meals, insulin coverage of these events will vary depending on the chosen treatment, each subject will be exposed to both studied treatments (repeated measure design). The order of treatment during the inpatient admissions will be randomized.</brief_summary>
