	<brief_title>Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension in Chinese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence of hypertension is increasing in China.While actually,the controlled rate of hypertension is relatively low,though numerous safe and effective pharmacological therapies are used in clinical practice.Studies confirmed that renal sympathetic nerves contributed to development and perpetuation of hypertension. Previous study has stated that renal denervation was effective and safe in patients with resistant hypertension, while little data is known in Chinese patients. We hypothesis that renal denervation is effective and safe in treatment of Chinese patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This trial plan to recruit 100 patients(Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow up duration of 3 years.Patients in ablation group will receive percutaneous renal denervation combined with necessary antihypertension drugs and patients in control group will receive appropriate antihypertension drugs. We aim to explore the long term safety and validity of renal denervation in Chinese patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</detailed_description>
