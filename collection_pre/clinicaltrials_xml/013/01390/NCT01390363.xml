	<brief_title>Study of Adolescent Immunization Recall Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled trial is a 3-armed study designed to evaluate an immunization recall system in adolescents. In the control arm (Group 1), the adolescents will receive usual care, in which they will primarily receive immunizations at annual physical exams, or as recommended by providers at urgent care visits. In one intervention arm (Group 2), the parent/guardian will receive a telephone call informing them that the adolescent is overdue for one or more immunizations (conjugated Neisseria meningitidis (MCV4) vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) booster, and/or the second varicella (VZV) vaccine). In the second intervention arm (Group 3), both the parent/guardian and the adolescent will receive a telephone call informing them that the adolescent is overdue for one or more immunizations. Immunization rates will be compared between the 3 groups at a four week and a twelve month follow up period.</detailed_description>
