	<brief_summary>RIP-VALVE is a randomized, single blinded study that will test the hypothesis that remote ischemic preconditioning initiated before surgery reduces post-operative myocardial damage in aortic valve surgery. Infarct size will be determined by 72 hours area under curve of troponin-I.</brief_summary>
