	<brief_title>Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Subjects With New Onset of Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a bicentric, randomized placebo controlled, double blind study, with the aim to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in subjects with new onset of type 1 diabetes on immunological, endocrine and metabolic parameters. The primary study goal is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the number and function of the master regulatory T-cells under controlled conditions within 13 months. The secondary study goals are a comprehensive immune phenotyping to determine whether Vit D produces changes consistent with a general improvement in immune homeostasis that supports ß-cell tolerating interventions, the assessment of ß-cell function in all subjects to obtain preliminary data on the effects of Vit D on ß-cell survival.</detailed_description>
