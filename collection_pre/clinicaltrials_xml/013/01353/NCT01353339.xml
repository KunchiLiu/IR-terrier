	<brief_summary>Primary Research Questions: Efficacy, safety and feasibility of a 3-month course of levofloxacin in a pilot study will be assessed. 1. Under efficacy, this pilot will determine whether levofloxacin can decrease the incidence of BK viruria and peak urine BK viral load. 2. Under safety, this pilot will determine the incidence of adverse events with levofloxacin. 3. Under feasibility, this pilot will determine the number of kidney transplant patients randomized over an eight month enrolment period, adherence to the levofloxacin and frequency of patient drop-out and loss to follow-up</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quinolone Prophylaxis for the Prevention of BK Virus Infection in Kidney Transplantation: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BK virus infection has emerged as a major complication in renal transplantation leading to a significant reduction in graft survival. There are currently no proven strategies to prevent or treat BK virus infection. Quinolone antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, have demonstrated activity against BK virus. The investigators hypothesize that administration of a quinolone antibiotic, when given early post-transplantation, will prevent the establishment of BK viral replication in the urine and thus prevent systemic BK virus infection. A non-randomized study in kidney transplant recipients found that patients given levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin had a significantly lower incidence of BK viremia compared to those not receiving a quinolone (4% versus 24.5%, P=0.02). Objective: The primary objective of the full trial will be to determine if the quinolone levofloxacin decreases the occurrence of doubling creatinine, transplant failure or death in kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this pilot trial is to assess the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a 3-month course of levofloxacin in the kidney transplant population. Results from this pilot study will provide vital information to design and conduct a large, multi-centre trial to determine if quinolone therapy decreases meaningful clinical outcomes in kidney transplantation. If levofloxacin significantly reduces BK viruria and urine viral loads in kidney transplantation it will provide important justification of biologic effect to progress to the larger trial. If the full trial shows that levofloxacin significantly reduces BK infection and improves outcomes, its use in renal transplantation will be strongly endorsed given the lack of proven therapies for this condition.</detailed_description>
