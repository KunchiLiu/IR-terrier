	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to develop an original biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes (multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy) based upon the detection of pathological alpha-synuclein species in routine colonoscopic biopsies.</brief_summary>
