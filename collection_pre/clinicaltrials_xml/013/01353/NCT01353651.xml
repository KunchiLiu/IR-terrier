	<brief_summary>Even though the indication for endovascular therapy has been enlarged, open repair of common femoral artery is still considered as the treatment of choice. A recent pilot study showed that endovascular repair of the CFA seems to be a safe technique of revascularization with acceptable initial results at 12 months (Azema et al, Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg, 2011, in press). TECCO, a French randomized and controlled trial, has been set up to compare open and endovascular procedures for the treatment of CFA atherosclerotic lesions.</brief_summary>
