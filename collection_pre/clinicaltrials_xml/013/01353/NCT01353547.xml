	<brief_summary>The purpose of the research study is to identify the genetic, environmental and immune profiles that may increase a person's risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). While MS is not a disease caused by a single variation in genetic material (DNA), a single environmental factor, or a single malfunction in immune cells, there are genetic alterations, environmental exposures and immunologic factors that make the development of MS more likely. Obtaining information about who is at risk for MS will be beneficial in the future if the investigators can identify effective ways to prevent or slow down the progression of this disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system (white bloods cells that normally fight infection) becomes misdirected and attacks healthy tissue. In patients with MS, the misdirected white blood cells attack myelin, a lining that insulates the nerves found in your brain and spinal cord. This results in inflammation and damage in the myelin. Loss of this protective lining disrupts nerve impulses and causes abnormal function in the nervous system. This large research study will ultimately enroll over 5000 subjects who are at risk of developing MS.</detailed_description>
