	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a cost effective and safe form of renal replacement therapy in patients suffering from end stage renal disease. However currently available PDF (peritoneal dialysis fluids) are not biocompatible for the peritoneal cavity and its cells. Acute cytotoxic effects of the majority of the current glucose-based PDF are caused by low pH, lactate, high glucose and its degradation products (GDP). Toxic effects of PDF can thus be extended to suppression of mesothelial HSR (heat shock reactions) following PDF exposure resulting in increased susceptibility of mesothelial cells against PDF exposure: PDF inherent stress factors fail to adequately induce HSP as effectors of the cellular stress response - the adequate HRS rather seems to be blocked. Hence, therapeutic approaches to activate and enhance the HSR will reduce peritoneal damage and organ failure and improve the survival of organisms. Preclinical results demonstrated that supplementation of PDF with pharmacological doses of alanyl-glutamine restored HSP expression and increased the resistance of mesothelial cells in in-vitro models of PD and preserved peritoneal integrity in in-vivo models of PD. After these positive preclinical results, this study shall now clarify, whether the addition of alanyl-glutamine to the most commonly used glucose-based PDF is safe and tolerable. Therefore PDFs will be drained in a randomized cross-over study. Main outcomes measures will be total HSP expression in peritoneal cells and changes of the peritoneal transport kinetics and the presence/absence/severity of side effects.</brief_summary>
