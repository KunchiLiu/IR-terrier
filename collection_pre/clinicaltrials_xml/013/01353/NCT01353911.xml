	<detailed_description>Amendment 4 unblinded treatment after an interim analysis for all subsequently enrolled TN participants (the Second Cohort) who were receiving grazoprevir 400 or 800 mg daily, and they were down-dosed to 100 mg daily between Treatment Week (TW) 3 and TW12 for the remainder of the 12-week treatment course. Amendment 5 allowed treatment-naïve participants with chronic hepatitis C and compensated cirrhosis to be enrolled and receive open-label grazoprevir 100 mg in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV, without a corresponding control arm.</detailed_description>
