	<brief_summary>This is a two part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of MK-1972 in participants with HIV-1 infections. In Part 1, participants will be randomized to receive MK-1972 (at one of 5 different dose levels given once or twice per day) or placebo. Part II will begin after the results of Part I are known; participants will be randomized to receive MK-1972 (only one dose level, twice per day) or placebo. The primary hypotheses are that MK-1972 at the studied doses is safe and well tolerated in HIV-1 infected males; and that MK-1972 has superior antiretroviral activity compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
