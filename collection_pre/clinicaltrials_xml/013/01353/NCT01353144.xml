	<brief_title>A Comparison of Two Therapeutic Strategies for the Treatment of Aspirin-associated Peptic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of this study are to compare esomeprazole plus aspirin with esomeprazole alone in the treatment of aspirin-related ulcers. Patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers are randomized to receive esomeprazole (40 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) or esomeprazole (40 mg/day) alone for 8 weeks. Follow-up endoscopy was carried out at the end of the eighth week. The primary end point was the healing of peptic ulcers.</detailed_description>
