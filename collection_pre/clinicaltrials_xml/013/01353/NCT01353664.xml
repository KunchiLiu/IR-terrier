	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Previously participated in and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria in one of the romidepsin clinical trials: ROMIADVM001 (NCT01324310), ROMIADVM002 (NCT01324323). Additional studies added at the discretion of the medical monitor of the study 2. Physician believes continued romidepsin treatment is of benefit to participant. 3. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures are conducted. 4. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 5. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential; and 6. All females of child bearing potential must use an effective method of contraception (an intrauterine contraceptive device [IUCD] or double contraceptive method using condoms and a diaphragm plus spermicide) during the treatment period and for at least 1 month thereafter. Male participants should use contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3 months thereafter. Female participants should avoid the use of estrogencontaining contraceptives, since romidepsin may reduce the effectiveness of estrogencontaining contraceptives. An in vitro binding assay determined that romidepsin competes with Î²estradiol for binding to estrogen receptors. Exclusion Criteria 1. Concomitant use of drugs that may cause a significant prolongation of the corrected measurement of the time between the start of cardiac Q wave and the end of the T wave (QTc) . 2. Concomitant use of Cytochrome P 450 3A4 (CYP3A4) strong inhibitors within 1 week of trial medications. 3. Concomitant use of therapeutic warfarin due to a potential drug interaction. Use of a low dose of warfarin or another anticoagulant to maintain patency of venous access port and cannulas is permitted. 4. Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy or any investigational agent after the last dose of romidepsin from the preceding romidepsin study. 5. Participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
