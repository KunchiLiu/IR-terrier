	<brief_title>Safety Study of Single Administration Post-exposure Prophylaxis Treatment for Marburg Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Marburg hemorrhagic fever is a rare human disease caused by the Marburg virus, a filamentous, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. In general, the mortality rate associated with Marburg virus outbreaks has ranged from 23% to 88%, with the highest death rates seen in more recent epidemics. No vaccine or effective therapy is available for Marburg hemorrhagic fever. AVI-6003 is an experimental combination of 2 phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligomers with positive charges on selected subunits (PMOplusâ„¢). These oligomers specifically target viral messenger RNA encoding 2 Marburg virus proteins thought to be important in viral replication and host immune suppression. The present study is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating single-administration doses of AVI-6003 in healthy human subjects.</detailed_description>
