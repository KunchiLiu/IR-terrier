	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression of a certain class of molecules, called costimulatory molecules, in humans with Cystic Fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder which renders the lung susceptible to persistent inflammation which, at times, can worsen, resulting in accelerated decline in lung function and eventually death or transplant. Our goal is to determine if the levels of costimulatory markers can be used to predict exacerbation and subsequent lung function decline in subjects with Cystic Fibrosis.</brief_summary>
