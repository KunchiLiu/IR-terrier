	<brief_summary>Individuals with chronic cervical SCI are known to have a restrictive ventilatory defect due to complete or partial loss of respiratory muscle innervation which is dependent upon the level and completeness of injury [2]. In addition, they share many aspects of obstructive airway physiology commonly associated with asthma. In asthma, physiological responses such as decrease in baseline airway caliber, bronchodilatation following inhalation of a beta-2-adrenergic agonist or anticholinergic agent, airway hyperreactivity, are all closely related to airway inflammation. The cause of such inflammation is unclear, and may be multi-factorial and attributable to: recurrent respiratory infections due to inability to effectively clear secretions, unopposed parasymphathetic innervation, and loss of functional sympathetic innervation to the airways. Therefore, the investigators propose to test for the possible involvement the above mechanisms by pharmacological intervention, and to study effects of such intervention on overall pulmonary function and indirect measures of pulmonary inflammation: levels of FeNO, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) inflammatory biomarker profile, pulmonary function tests, and cellular profile of the induced sputum.</brief_summary>
