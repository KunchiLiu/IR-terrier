	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and hepatic surgery are major operations, associated with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of clinical scoring systems and inflammatory cytokine levels for predicting systemic inflammation. This correlation might identify peri-operative clinical outcomes, then forecast further systemic inflammation in cardiac and hepatic surgical patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Clinical Scoring System and Cytokines for Prediction of Inflammatory Response in Major Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is commonly found in most major surgery. Early detection of SIRS will lead to early treatment. Serum cytokines levels are reliable markers for SIRS detection but with high cost and inconvenience. Clinical Scoring Systems are commonly used for assessment of patients with SIRS. If they have good correlation with cytokine levels, they might be used to predict peri-operative clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
