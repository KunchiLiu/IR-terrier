	<criteria>Type 1 diabetes diagnosis Age 18 65 years (inclusive) Hemoglobin A1c ≤ 10.5% within the last 4 months Diagnosis of gastroparesis, or symptoms consistent with gastroparesis (early satiety, chronic intermittent nausea or vomiting with food intake) Patient has gastroparesis confirmed on screening study A female patient is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or childbearing potential with negative serum hCG prior to each gastric emptying study. Active nitrate use (e.g. Cialis, Viagra, Levitra, nitroglycerin, Isordil, Imdur, amyl nitrate/poppers) Fasting fingerstick glucose &gt; 250 mg/dL History of abdominal surgery including gastric banding procedure Patient is on chronic parenteral feeding Patient has a history of eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, binge eating, bulimia) Regular opiate use Recent (last 6 weeks) history of poor control of diabetes e.g. hypoglycemia requiring medical intervention, diabetic ketoacidosis, admission for control diabetes or complications of diabetes Acute severe gastroenteritis The patient has participated in another clinical trial in the last 30 days. Use of medications potentially influencing upper gastrointestinal motility or appetite within one week of the study [e.g., prokinetic drugs, macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin), GLP1 mimetics/analog, amylin analog] History or presence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or other condition that would in the opinion of the investigator make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in this clinical study. Chronic angina or NYHA class III or IV CHF Concurrent use of ketoconazole or itraconazole History of severe vision loss, retinitis pigmentosa, or nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) History of CVA Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test Lactating females Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt; 160 or DBP &gt; 100) Hypotension (SBP &lt; 90 or DBP &lt; 60) Other major medical conditions: priapism, sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, leukemia, active cancer diagnosis, HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, or bleeding diathesis.
