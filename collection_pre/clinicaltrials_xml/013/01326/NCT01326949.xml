	<brief_summary>Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) refers to an obstruction in the trunk of the portal vein. It can extend downstream to the portal branches, or upstream to the splenic and/or the mesenteric veins. The prevalence of PVT is 10-25% and incidence is about 16% in cirrhotic patients. Recent studies demonstrate that the presence of PVT is not only an independent predictor of failure to control active variceal bleeding and prevent variceal rebleeding, but also significantly associated with increased mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, in recent American Association of the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines and Baveno V consensus on management of PVT in cirrhotic patients, no treatment strategies in cirrhotic patients with PVT was clearly recommended due to the absence of randomized controlled trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) for Prevention of Variceal Rebleeding in Cirrhotic Patients With Portal Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anticoagulation Anticoagulation appears to be an effective first-line therapy for PVT in non-cirrhotic patients. However, anticoagulation is more complex in the setting of cirrhosis. The risk to benefit ratio of anticoagulation have never been fully confirmed in cirrhosis if there are a history of variceal bleeding or high-risk varices. Furthermore, the application of anticoagulation combined with non-selective beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation is not completely advocated in cirrhotic patients with PVT due to the limited reports and the increased risk of bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) TIPS is just regarded as the second-line therapy for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. However, this indication might be changed in the setting of PVT, given that an earlier decision of TIPS for PVT might achieve a higher recanalization rate. Certainly, an early decision of TIPS seemed to bring the risks of hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, and procedural complications, although a high recanalization rate of thrombosed portal vein and prevention of variceal bleeding was achieved. Indeed, the risk to benefit ratio of TIPS in cirrhotic patients with PVT for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding has never been evaluated. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of TIPS and conventional therapy (endoscopic treatment, propranolol and anticoagulation) in decompensated cirrhosis patients with PVT and a history of variceal bleeding.</detailed_description>
