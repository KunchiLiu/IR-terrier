	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study was to compare two devices and three methods for achieving hemostasis after a transradial angiogram while assessing vascular complications and time endpoints. The heart has traditionally been accessed through the femoral artery. However, in the last 20 years, the radial artery has gained more popularity among physicians and patients, thereby offering an alternative to the femoral approach. Various methods of applying compression to the radial puncture site have been used, but no research has been done to show what best practice is. In this case, best practice would be the most effective way of getting hemostasis while limiting complications and ensuring the efficient use of nursing and medical resources. It is hypothesized that statistically significant differences are seen in time to discharge in the fast-release Terumo and Clo-Sur P.A.D. groups, as compared with the control Terumo group, without increasing vascular complications.</brief_summary>
