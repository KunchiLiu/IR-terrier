	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to reduce impaired driving, risky driving and alcohol-related negative consequences among injured emergency department (ED) patients through a telephone brief intervention. This study will allow researchers to test a novel method of brief intervention that has the potential to be convenient and efficient mechanism to deliver an intervention to an at-risk population. Eligible patients will be consented in the ED, will receive an assessment and then will be randomized into one of two conditions: 1) telephone brief intervention or 2) a comparison control group with a home safety educational program. The participant will also receive an appointment for an initial telephone call. Both conditions will be provided over three telephone sessions: the initial call (immediately following randomization) and two booster calls at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after randomization. Participants will provide information about their alcohol use, alcohol-related injuries, impaired driving, and other driving related negative consequences at 4, 8, and 12 months post-randomization.</brief_summary>
