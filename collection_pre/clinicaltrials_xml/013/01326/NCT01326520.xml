	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Phospholipids on Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the facts, that on the one hand milk phospholipids are characterized by a high sphingolipid content and on the other hand a disturbed sphingolipid metabolism in the epidermis of patients with atopic dermatitis was verified, a double blinded, controlled, randomized, cross-over study with a daily supplementation of 3 g milk phospholipids to subjects with a mild to moderate atopic dermatitis will be conducted. Forty patients will be randomized between two groups of each 20 patients. After an individual checkup and a run-in period of 2 weeks, the one group will receive the phospholipid enriched dairy product and the second group will be given a placebo dairy product over two month. A wash out-period of 4 weeks will follow, and the patients will consume the contrary dairy products over two month after a 2-week run-in period again.</detailed_description>
