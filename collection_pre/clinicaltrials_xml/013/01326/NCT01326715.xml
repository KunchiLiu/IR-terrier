	<brief_summary>Background: - Contrast agents are drugs that make certain body areas or abnormalities show up better on imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Mangafodipir is an MRI contrast agent with manganese that has been approved for MRI scans of the liver and pancreas. Because contrast agents with manganese have also been shown to be useful in studying problems with the nervous system, researchers are interested in determining if mangafodipir may be used for MRI scans of the brain or eye, two areas that often experience problems caused by disorders that affect the nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis. However, more information is needed on whether mangafodipir will be useful for this purpose, or how best to use it in MRI scans of the eye and brain. To study mangafodipir more closely, researchers are interested in studying its use in both individuals with multiple sclerosis and healthy volunteers.

To study mangafodipir more closely, researchers are interested in studying its use in both individuals with multiple sclerosis and healthy volunteers. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of mangafodipir in imaging studies of nerve disorders affecting the eye and brain. Eligibility: - Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who either have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or are healthy volunteers. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, and blood tests. - Participants will have up to 10 outpatient visits for screening and MRI scans over a period of up to 2 months. Participants will be divided into Eye and Brain groups, based on which area will be studied during the scans. (Participants who have available time may be eligible for study in both groups.) - Participants will have an initial MRI scan as part of the screening process. - At the first visit, participants will have a baseline MRI scan once before receiving mangafodipir. - Participants will have up to five MRI scans, with the following procedures: - Eye imaging group: MRI scans will be scheduled at specific times between 2 and 48 hours after receiving mangafodipir. Eye MRI participants will wear a dark contact lens and an eye patch for 30 minutes before receiving mangafodipir, and leave both on for up to 8 hours. The other eye will remain uncovered. - Brain imaging group: MRI scans will be scheduled at specific times between 48 hours and 7 days after receiving mangafodipir. - Participants will have a follow-up MRI scan 1 month after receiving mangafodipir. This scan is done to see how long mangafodipir may affect MRI images of the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Healthy Volunteers and People With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The goals of this pilot study are to assess whether: (1) manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) using mangafodipir trisodium can detect multiple sclerosis-related tissue damage in the retina, optic nerve, and brain; and (2) the MRI effects of manganese are detectable in the basal ganglia one month following administration. Study Population Up to 15 healthy volunteers and up to 15 participants with multiple sclerosis. Design The first phase of the study will involve healthy volunteers and will focus on optimizing our imaging protocol. The second phase will study participants with multiple sclerosis. Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure is T1-weighted signal intensity, measured: (1) in the retina, optic nerve, and brain at early time points after mangafodipir administration; and (2) in the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and whole brain one month following administration.</detailed_description>
