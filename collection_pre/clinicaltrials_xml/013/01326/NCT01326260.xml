	<brief_summary>This study involved the medical record review of resuscitation records for all severely-injured trauma patients requiring emergent surgical intervention and significant acidosis from 2005 through 2009.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Aggressive Correction of Severe Acidosis With Tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane (THAM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objective is to assess the efficacy of fluid resuscitation and treatment of acidosis in patients who were managed with use of amine buffer THAM (tris-hydroxymethlaminomethane) versus those who were resuscitated with crystalloids or colloids and may have have received sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of acidosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Presence of severe traumatic injury requiring emergent surgery Perioperative development of severe acidosis (defined arterial ph less than or equal to 7.20 or base deficit greater than or equal to 10 mEq/dL) Acidosis was treated with either THAM or "usual care" (defined as crystalloid either or without sodium bicarbonate)</criteria>
