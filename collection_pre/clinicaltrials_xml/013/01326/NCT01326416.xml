	<brief_summary>Android obesity contributes, via insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, to the development of cardiovascular atherosclerosis. It leads to poor quality of life. It is often associated with metabolic syndrome which includes, whatever the definitions used (National Education Cholesterol Program, NECP / Adult Treatment Panel III, ATP III or International Diabetes Federation, IDF), an increased waist measurement, an arterial high blood pressure and disorders of the glucide and lipid metabolism. The treatment of the current "epidemic" of obesity and metabolic syndrome in France (12.4 % of obese and 14 % of subjects with metabolic syndrome) thus requires new therapeutic approaches. A well-balanced diet and a daily physical activity are the indispensable requirements for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. It is possible to associate it to pharmacological agents, but the results are often partial and transient. Preliminary data suggest that leucine or arginine supplementation could facilitate the loss of fat mass. Moreover, the physical exercise has also demonstrated benefits. Sessions of physical reconditioning (aerobic work + muscular intensification) associated with a program of specific nutritional supplementation by a mixture of Leucine and Arginine (in the daytime) could improve the treatment of obese subjects affected by metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
