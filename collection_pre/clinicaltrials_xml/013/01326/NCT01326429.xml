	<brief_summary>Hypo- and hypernatremia are the most frequent electrolyte disorders found in hospitalized patients. The increasing use of diuretics and other medications influencing the water and sodium homeostasis potentially lead to a rise in the prevalence of the electrolyte disorders. Only little data is available on the frequency and the mechanisms leading to hypo-/hypernatremia. Thus, the investigators aim to A.) determine the frequency of hypo- and hypernatremia in the emergency department of a large tertiary university hospital and B.) explore the mechanisms leading to the development of dysnatremias by detailed clinical and laboratory examinations.</brief_summary>
