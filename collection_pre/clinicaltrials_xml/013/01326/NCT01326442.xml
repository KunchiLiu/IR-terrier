	<brief_summary>The study will test the hypothesis that supplementing the diet of subjects with Metabolic Syndrome with 2000 IU vitamin D and 1.8 g omega-3 fatty acids (EPA + DHA) per day, will facilitate weight loss, improve body composition and reduce metabolic and biochemical risk factors associated with type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adult men and women who meet the International Diabetes Federation criteria for Metabolic Syndrome will be enrolled and embark on a 16 week diet and exercise intervention using a low glycemic index diet with or without the supplementary vitamin D and omega-3. Subjects will be counseled weekly and blood collected at weeks 0 and 16.</brief_summary>
