	<detailed_description>Approximately 400 male and female subjects with moderate facial acne vulgaris will be enrolled in this randomized, multi-center study. Following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, subjects will be randomized to either 1.2%, 2.4%, or 3.6% facial cream (JNJ 10229570-AAA) or color-matched vehicle. Subjects will apply the study medication once daily on the face for 12 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the study duration.
