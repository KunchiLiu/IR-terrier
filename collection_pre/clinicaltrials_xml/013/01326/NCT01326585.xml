	<brief_summary>Dexamethasone is a medication that has been shown to have clear anti-nausea, anti-inflammatory, and painkilling properties. Dexamethasone is currently used to manage postoperative symptoms of a variety of surgical procedures. However, its effect has not been validated for scleral buckling surgery, which is used to treat retinal detachment, a medical emergency that can lead to permanent blindness. In this study, the investigators will randomly administer dexamethasone to half of scleral buckling surgery patients, and a placebo to the other half. The investigators will then compare the postoperative symptoms of the two groups in order to determine whether dexamethasone should be used for scleral buckling surgeries.</brief_summary>
