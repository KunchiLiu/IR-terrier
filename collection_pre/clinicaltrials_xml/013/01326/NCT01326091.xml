	<brief_summary>This is a parallel, randomized controlled trial comparing two types of patient positioning and their effect on radiologic measures (pre-surgery visit, in the operating room prior to surgery, at the conclusion of surgery, and at 3 weeks after surgery at patients' postoperative visits) as well as surgeon satisfaction (prior to the end of the surgery) and patient outcomes using patient self reported scales (pre-surgery, post surgery at 3 weeks follow-up).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Positioning in Lumbar Fusion Surgery and Its Impact on Spinal Sagittal Balance and Surgeon Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are evaluating how patient positioning affects radiologic metrics as well as surgeon satisfaction (surgeon being blinded to positioning). Patients will be allocated to either a hyperlordotic or a standard positioning group by computer generated randomization. Surgeons will perform all of their standard techniques to promote lordosis with instrumentation. Adult patients, ages 18-65, undergoing lumbar surgical fusion will be asked to participate.</detailed_description>
