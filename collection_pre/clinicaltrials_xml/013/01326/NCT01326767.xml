	<brief_summary>This study will be performed on grade IIIb and grade IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) chemotherapy naive patients with good performance status. In course of this study, patients will be treated with Paclitaxel in combination with either Cisplatin or Carboplatin in a maximum of six therapy cycles. The goal of this study is to determine, if a pharmakokinetic driven dose adaptation of paclitaxel leads to a reduction of of grade 4 neutropenia, compared to conventional Paclitaxel dosing, without affecting progression free survival and overall survival. This study includes a biomarker analysis and an optional genetic substudy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Capable of understanding the protocol requirements and risks, and providing written informed consent. Patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC (stage IIIBIV). Patients considered for firstline palliative chemotherapy with paclitaxel in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin. Patients having received prior adjuvant non taxanecontaining adjuvant chemotherapy are eligible. At least one bidimensionally measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1. ECOG Performance Status (ECOGPS) status ≤ 2. Female or male patients of 18 to 75 years of age at randomization Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not surgically sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 1 week prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing patients are excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive methods (condom). An absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500 cells/ mm3 (= 1.5 G/l). Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3. Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal, or ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal in case of liver metastases. Creatinine clearance (according to the CockcroftGault formula) ≥30ml/min. For patients planned to receive Cisplatin: Creatinine clearance ≥60ml/min. Patients suffering from asymptomatic brain metastases can be enrolled in case corticosteroid therapy is not indicated. Prior irradiation must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first cycle of treatment. Serious concomitant systemic disorders (e.g., active infection, severe heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study. A history of hypersensitivity reactions to drugs formulated in polyoxyethylated castor oil. Having received prior treatment with paclitaxel or cisplatin or carboplatin (other drugs/drug combinations are allowed). Concomitant treatment with any targeted drug (licensed or experimental) like bevacizumab or cetuximab. Any condition / concomitant disease not allowing chemotherapy with paclitaxel, the platinum compound (carboplatin or cisplatin) or required premedication for the treatment regimen. Pregnant/nursing women. Individuals known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B surface antigen or syphilis. Treatment with cytotoxic or biologic agents or any experimental drug within the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this study. Secondary malignancy within the last five years, with the exception of adequately treated carcinomainsitu of the uterine cervix, basalcell carcinoma of the skin and pTa or pTis urothelial cancer. Medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the patient to complete the study or sign informed consent. Preexisting neuropathy &gt; grade I NCICTC.</criteria>
