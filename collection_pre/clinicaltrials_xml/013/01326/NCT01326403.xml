	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid in Hip Fracture Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. transfusion of allogeneic RBC's is not free of adverse events and has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection 2. Tranexamic acid in trauma patients has been shown to reduce 30-day mortality. Hospital trauma protocol includes tranexamic acid in patients with major bleeding. 3. Tranexamic acid in orthopedic elective joint reconstruction surgery has been shown to substantially decrease bleeding in knee and hip arthroplasty. 4. in hip fracture surgery, transexamic acid reduces erythrocyte transfusion rate but may promote a hypercoagulable state. 5. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits plasminogen from turning into plasmin thereby inhibiting clot breakdown.</detailed_description>
