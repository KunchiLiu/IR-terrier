	<brief_title>Effectiveness Of Therapy With A Thermal Water Nasal Aerosol In Children With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted on the island of Ischia - Naples from April to June 2009, during the natural exposure period to parietaria pollen. The treatment started just before the pollen season, when all the children were asymptomatic, not treated with any drug and not affected by respiratory tract and systemic diseases. All the children were randomly divided into two homogeneous groups by sex and age. The first group has practiced crenotherapy with "hyper-mineral chloride sodium water" aerosol by nasal adapter for 15 days per month, for three consecutive months, at thermal spa services of Lacco Ameno, while the control group was treated, in the same period, daily, by a micronized nasal douche with 0.9% NaCl (isotonic) solution. Before the treatment (T0), at the end of the treatment (T1) and again 2 weeks after the end of the treatment (T2), all the children have performed spirometry (Pony FX Cosmed), and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (NIOX MINO analyzer COSMED), to assess their airway inflammation. At the time of recruitment, the parents of the children were instructed to fill a specific diary-card (TSS) at home, to assess rhinitis symptoms and possible drug use during all 3 months of treatment. The parameters considered in the TSS were: nasal obstruction, sneezing, nasal discharge and itching. These symptoms were scored: 0 = symptom absent, 1 = mild (symptoms present but not annoying), 2 = moderate (frequent and offensive symptoms but do not interfere with sleep or normal activities) 3 = severe (symptoms that interfere with sleep or normal activities). Every two weeks, at the end of each cycle of therapy the children underwent a general clinical control with nasal endoscopy, spirometry and monitoring the completion of diary cards and the possible use of drugs.</detailed_description>
