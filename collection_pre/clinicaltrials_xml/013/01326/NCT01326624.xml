	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of wearable defibrillator use in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or advanced heart failure symptoms, who have a high-risk for sudden cardiac death but are either not eligible for an implantable defibrillator under current guidelines or are not able to receive the device due to their condition.</brief_summary>
