	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine whether using telecommunication tools, specifically web pages containing online screening instruments and real-time video chat, will be an efficient way to implement Major Depressive Disorder screening among college students. The study also aims to determine if proactive depression screening and free online consultation with a psychiatrist will increase the rate of help-seeking among college students with MDD. Eligible participants will complete a demographics survey and depression screening assessment online. Those subjects who express suicidality or depressive symptoms will be offered the opportunity to complete a one-time psychiatric consultation with Skype video-conferencing.</brief_summary>
