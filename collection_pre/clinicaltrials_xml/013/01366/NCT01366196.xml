	<brief_summary>Acute pain management is challenging in patients after spinal fusions, particularly since most have taken analgesics for prolonged periods before choosing the surgical alternative. Many of these patients are either preoperatively or become after surgery narcotic dependent. In addition, the narcotic based anesthetic required for the procedure, may induce a postoperative hyper-analgesia which may be partially responsible for the acute postoperative pain which is refractory to traditional doses of narcotics. Both the persistent nociceptive and neuropathic pain which these patients experience and narcotic-induced hyper-analgesia is mediated via non-conventional neural pathways. It is for these reasons, that in these patients postoperative pain is refractory to narcotic treatment. Postoperative pain in this situation is best managed using a multimodal approach. This technique allows the application of a number of treatment modalities which maximize pain reduction and minimize treatment side effects. Pregabalin (Lyrica) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Pregabalin has a similar mechanism of action as gabapentin. Notably it has a rapid consistent absorption, linear pharmacokinetics, and a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Hence, pregabalin should be a beneficial addition to the multi-modal pain regimen after spinal surgery; particularly in narcotic tolerant patients who respond poorly to conventional narcotic analgesics after surgery. Hypothesis: Patients treated with Pregabalin after posterior-spinal fusions will have: 1) reduced pain at rest and with physical therapy, and 2) reduced narcotic requirements with fewer narcotic related side-effects than controls treated with Pregabalin. This may result in a shorter hospital stay (the mean length of stay for 1-2 level posterior lumbar-sacral fusions with instrumentation at our institution is 4.9±2 days).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients for elective lumber posterior spinal fusions with segmental instrumentation Use of pregabalin or gabapentin within the washout period. Some chronic pain patients should not be subjected to a washout period for either medication prior to surgery, as determined by their pain management physician, and these patients will be excluded from the study. Allergic sensitivity to pregabalin. Renal insufficiency, Cr ≥ 1.5 mg/dl. Active substance abuse. Unstable mental condition. Non English Speaking Patients.</criteria>
