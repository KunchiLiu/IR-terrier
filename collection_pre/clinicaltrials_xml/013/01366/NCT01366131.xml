	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEGF0444A combined with paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab therapy in patients with histologically or cytologically documented inoperable, locally advanced, metastatic (Stage IV), or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented inoperable (Stage IV) or recurrent nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Diagnoses of nonsquamous NSCLC that are based on sputum cytology alone are not acceptable. Mixed tumors should be categorized according to the predominant cell type. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST 1.1 Adequate hematologic and end organ function Prior therapy (including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors,radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or investigational therapy) before Day 1 of Cycle 1 for the treatment of Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC. Patients who received prior adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy for NSCLC are not excluded if the time interval from completion of adjuvant therapy until disease progression is &gt; 12 months. Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical trial with therapeutic intent within 28 days prior to enrollment Malignancies other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent Pregnant and lactating women Active infection requiring IV antibiotics BevacizumabSpecific Exclusions: Histologically or cytologically documented inoperable, locally advanced, mixed nonsmall cell and small cell tumors or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas with a predominant squamous component Evidence of tumor invading major blood vessels on imaging Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases History of stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) within 6 months prior to Day 1 Significant vascular disease within 6 months prior to Day 1 Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1</criteria>
