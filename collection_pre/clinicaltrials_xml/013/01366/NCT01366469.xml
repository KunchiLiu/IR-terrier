	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot study is to identify and quantify inflammatory and genetic markers from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum in patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing elective coronary revascularization (CABG) to determine the risk of developing post operative respiratory failure. To achieve this objective, this proposal outlines the following specific aims: Aim #1. To identify from BALF and serum, the change in inflammatory and genetic markers in patients with a history of COPD undergoing CABG. BALF and serum samples will be obtained at the time of intubation immediately prior to surgery and again upon skin closure immediately after the surgical procedure. Aim #2. To determine the extent to which inflammatory and/or genetic markers correlate with post-operative pulmonary complications defined as prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt; 24 hours), pneumonia, and/or tracheostomy. Aim #3. To inform the development and implementation of a large pivotal trial which may impact clinical decision-making during the initial pre-operative outpatient assessment of COPD patients undergoing CABG.</brief_summary>
