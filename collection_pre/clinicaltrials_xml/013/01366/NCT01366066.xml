	<brief_summary>During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in pressure was observed in the external urethral sphincter along with an increase in bladder capacity. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve Stimulation (TMNS) in women could induce pressure increment of the external urethral sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6 weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33 women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able to contract their pelvic floor muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study has shown promising effect on the overactive bladder syndrome. The present study aims to treat urinary incontinence and includes 2 groups of patients with 30 patients in each group: Women suffering from urinary stress incontinence and women suffering from urge incontinence. A medical vibrator is used and in each group the subjects will be randomized to vibration treatment or no vibration treatment. All patients will receive pelvic floor training and all women suffering from urge incontinence will receive anticholinergic medications. The stimulation will be performed at the perineum every day for 6 weeks with an amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. Results will be evaluated on the basis of questionnaires, micturition diaries and diaper tests. If the investigators are able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incontinence symptoms in the subjects the investigators asses that vibration can be a way of reestablishing a normal function of the pelvic floor muscles and bladder function in incontinent patients.</brief_summary>
