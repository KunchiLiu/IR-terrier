	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. it may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarker expression in tissue samples from young patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Expression in Samples From Young Patients With Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the expression of immunoregulatory proteins including CD4, FOXP3 and CD276 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). - To correlate the expression of these proteins with the levels of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) autoantibodies in patient of ANHL0131. OUTLINE: Archived tissue microarray samples are analyzed by mass spectrometry and validated by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and IHC.</detailed_description>
