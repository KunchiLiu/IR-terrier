	<brief_summary>The parameter that best correlates with 5 years disease-free survival (DFS ) in patients (pts) with localized rectal cancer (RC) is the pathological TNM staging (ypTNM) after chemo-radiotherapy (Ch-RT). DFS is 97% in pts with ypT0N0M0 = ypCR and 42% in pts with ypN +. Standard 5-FU Ch-RT achieves 15% of ypCR. The use of IMRT achieves a high proportion of ypCR . This study aimed to demonstrate in a prospective manner the feasibility of personalizing Ch regimen base in TT in combination with IMRT in patients with RC. Secondary objectives included the number of ypCR and safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Therapeutic Targets Tailored Ch and IMRT as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Rectal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The parameter that best correlates with DFS in patients (pts) with localized rectal cancer (RC) is the pathological TNM staging (ypTNM) after chemo-radiotherapy (Ch-RT).Tumor regression grading (TRG) after Ch-RT has been correlated with DFS , 86% for TRG 4, 75% for grouped TRG 2 + 3, and 63% for grouped TRG 0 + 1 but this is not as good as ypTNM to predict pts outcome. Standard 5-FU or capecitabine Ch-RT achieves 15% of ypCR with diarrhea and proctitis as the main grade 3 toxicities in the range of 10-15% . With the combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine pCR rates are the same but the toxicity is the range of 25%. IMRT studies reported 30% ypCR but with 30-40% grade 3 toxicities Last years strategies have explored ways to integrate additional chemotherapeutic agents as capecitabine , oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab and cetuximab in Ch-RT regimens and to find biomarkers of their effectiveness , but always in a retrospective way. Our hypothesis is that with the actual knowledge and technology, a prospective tailored chemotherapy selection in combination with IMRT is feasible and could improve the outcome of patients with rectal cancer.</detailed_description>
