	<brief_title>Vitamin D to Prevent Autism in Newborn Siblings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of autism is increasing. Also, women of childbearing age are increasingly found to be insufficient/deficient in vitamin D. Vitamin D is a neurohormone which is important for development of the child, especially of the child's brain. The primary source of vitamin D is from the sun through one's skin. People have been avoiding the sun because of skin cancer, because of increasing Television watching, computer viewing and wearing clothes that cover most of the body. This approach will study whether making the pregnant mother, whose child is at risk for autism because of a previous child with autism, replete with vitamin D will prevent that recurrence of autism in the newborn sibling.</detailed_description>
