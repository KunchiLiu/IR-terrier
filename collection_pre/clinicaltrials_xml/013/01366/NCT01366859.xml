	<brief_title>Nutritional Intervention in Children With Autism Using Whey Protein (Immunocal): Impact on Core Areas of Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder currently affecting as many as 1 of 150 children in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent condition with little hope for improvement. The treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and behavioral therapy; and conventional medical treatments have had little impact on ameliorating this disorder. Recent research has discovered that some autistic individuals have increased markers of oxidative stress and some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, genetic abnormalities in the glutathione pathway have been associated to autism. Thus, we are proposing that a nutritional supplement based on bovine milk serum containing cysteine-rich whey proteins serving as glutathione precursors can improve behavioral function in children with Autism. Hypothesis: Many children with autism have impaired antioxidant/detoxification capacity and chronic oxidative stress. Studies have also shown that autistic children show an abnormally high prevalence of glutathione deficiency. A cysteine-rich whey protein supplement demonstrated to raise glutathione levels will improve the metabolic imbalance and improve measures of autistic behavior. Purpose: This study will evaluate the effects of a cysteine-rich whey protein isolate supplement (Immunocal®) on autistic behavior in pre-school children with autism. Methods: This will be a 3 month double-blind placebo-controlled study. A total of 60 subjects will be selected/recruited and enrolled (see inclusion and exclusion criteria) to have a minimum 40 evaluable children (including estimated drop-outs) ranging in age from 3 to 5 years old to participate in the study and data recorded and collected. Children will be randomly assigned to either treatment- to the study product (Immunocal) or to the control (rice protein) for three months (20 subjects per group). Core areas of autistic behavior that will be assessed before (baseline/week 0), and at the end of treatment (week 12) are: atypical autistic behaviors and severity, communication, developmental status and behavioral problems. In addition, blood glutathione levels will be quantified before and after treatment. Side effects and adverse reactions will be compared between the two groups before (baseline/week 0) and at the end of treatment (week 12).</detailed_description>
