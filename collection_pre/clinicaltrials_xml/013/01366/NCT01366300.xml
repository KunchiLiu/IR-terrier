	<brief_title>Effect of Intravenous Lidocaine on BIS-guided Propofol Requirements During General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of intravenous lidocaine as a coadjuvant agent during general anesthesia has increased. Lidocaine infusion during and after abdominal surgery decreases postoperative pain and reduces ileus duration, reducing patient´s hospital stay and opioid consumption. Intravenous lidocaine´s effect on other intravenous anesthetics is unclear, and there are no present studies evaluating its interaction on hypnotic anesthetic requirements when using a BIS (Bispectral Index) monitor to maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia. We therefore decided to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the interaction of systemic lidocaine infusion, initiated and maintained during surgery, on propofol requirements and anesthetic depth as measured by BIS.</detailed_description>
