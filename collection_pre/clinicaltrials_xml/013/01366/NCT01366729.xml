	<brief_summary>Background 9000 people a year in Switzerland suffer a first time stroke. Of these 20 to 30% remain unable to walk and up to 60% are left with moderate to severe walking disability. Evidence shows that rehabilitation techniques which emphasise use of the hemiplegic side influence ipsilesional cortical plasticity and improve functional outcomes. Canes are commonly used in gait rehabilitation although they significantly reduce hemiplegic muscle activity. We have shown that an orthosis "TheraTogs" ( elastic corset supporting hemiplegic side) significantly increases hemiplegic muscle activity during gait. To date no clinical studies have investigated the long term effects of these techniques on gait recovery following stroke. This study aims to determine if advances in the understanding of cortical plasticity and its relation to functional recovery following stroke can be applied to clinical gait rehabilitation to improve long term outcomes. Hypotheses Early gait rehabilitation with canes will reduce hemiplegic muscle activity and inhibit balance reactions. In the long term this causes poorer walking ability and balance and consequently reduced social participation. Early gait rehabilitation with TheraTogs will increase hemiplegic muscle activity and facilitate balance reactions. In the long term this improves walking ability and balance leading to increased social independence and participation. Design Multi-centred, single blind, randomized control trial. Subjects 120 first time stroke patients Intervention When subjects can walk unaided on even ground whilst requiring verbal prompts and stand-by help without body contact (FAC 3) they will be randomly allocated into intervention (TheraTogs) or control (cane) group. TheraTogs will be applied to support hip extensor and abductor musculature according to a standardized procedure. Cane walking with cane at the level of the radial styloid of the sound wrist. Subjects will walk throughout the day with the assigned walking aid. Standard therapy treatments and usual care will remain unchanged and documented.The intervention will continue for five weeks or until patients have reached FAC 5 (independent walkers on all surfaces). Measures: the day before intervention begin, the day after intervention completion (max 5 weeks), 3 months, 6 months and 2 years after completion Primary outcome Timed "up and go" test Secondary outcomes surface EMG of hemiplegic lower extremity musculature, temporo-spatial gait parameters, hip kinematics, dynamic balance. The Stroke Impact Scale. Results Significance levels will be 5% with 95% CI`s. ITT analyses will be performed. Descriptive statistics will be presented. Relevant co-variables will be identified and analysed. Discussion This study could have significant implications for the clinical practice of gait rehabilitation after stroke in particular the effect and appropriate use of walking aids</brief_summary>
