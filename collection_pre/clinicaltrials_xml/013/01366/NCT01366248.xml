	<brief_summary>This NIH-NCCAM funded epidemiologic research is being conducted as an observational prospective case-control study of the use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Integrated Oncology (IO) and their effects on breast cancer patients in community settings. Hypothesis: IO services improve patients' quality of life and decrease cancer recurrence rates in breast cancer patients as compared to women with similar disease states and prognoses who do not receive IO care, and may or may not use CAM treatment on their own.</brief_summary>
