	<brief_summary>This is a single institution study of fludarabine and busulfan versus fludarabine, busulfan and low dose total body irradiation in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A study population of 80 subjects will be enrolled from The John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center. Subjects who are eligible to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation according to the eligibility criteria will be consented and enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of 2 conditioning regimen: fludarabine and busulfan, or fludarabine busulfan and low dose total body irradiation (TBI). Subjects will be followed until 1 year post transplantation to assess the relapse rate in each arm and transplant-related toxicity. The combination of fludarabine and busulfan is the current standard of care for patients with myeloid malignancies (AML, CML and other myeloproliferative disorders, or MDS) undergoing allogeneic transplantation at HUMC. In this study we will be comparing in a randomized fashion the standard regimen to a regimen of fludarabine, busulfan and TBI.</brief_summary>

The combination of fludarabine and busulfan is the current standard of care for patients with myeloid malignancies (myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other myeloproliferative disorder, or myelodysplastic syndrome) undergoing allogeneic transplantation at HUMC. In this study we will be comparing in a randomized fashion the standard regimen to a regimen of fludarabine, busulfan and TBI. Primary Objective The primary objective is to compare the relapse rate at 1 year of patients with myeloid malignancies receiving each regimen. Secondary Objectives The secondary objective is to compare the toxicity of each regimen</detailed_description>

Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study Donor Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Donor HLA 6/6 (HLAA, B, DrB1) related donor or 7/8 (HLAA, B, C, DrB1) unrelated donor Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with HUMC standard practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of allogeneic donors Unrelated donors will be identified, evaluated, and managed in accordance with National Marrow Donor Program standards Age ≥18 and &lt;70 yrs KPS of ≥70% Willing to donate bone marrow using standard techniques or peripheral blood HSC by leukapheresis Have adequate veins for apheresis or agree to placement of a central venous catheter (femoral, subclavian) if donating peripheral blood HSC Donor Exclusion Criteria Identical twin Female donors who are pregnant or breastfeeding Infection with HIV or viral hepatitis (B or C) Known allergy to filgrastim Current serious systemic illness Uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection Receiving experimental therapy or investigational agents History of cancer other than treated basal cell cancer of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
