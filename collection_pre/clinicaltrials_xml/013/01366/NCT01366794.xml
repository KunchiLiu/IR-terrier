Individual macronutrients or a mixed meal will therefore be served and gut hormones are measured during the following 300 min.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Macronutrients and Gut Hormone Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In healthy volunteers and subjects with dietary regulated diabetes mellitus, glucose, protein mixture or fat emulsion will be served individually and on a separate occasions a mixed meal will be served. Samples will be taken during the following 300 min.
