	<brief_summary>PIPF-016 (ASCEND) is a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The study objectives are to confirm the treatment effect of pirfenidone compared with placebo on change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and to confirm the safety of treatment with pirfenidone compared with placebo in patients with IPF.</brief_summary>
