	<brief_summary>Screening of nutritional status is unsolved problem in cardiac surgery. Applicability of such criteria as body mass index and albumin and screening scales (MNA, NRS-2002, SGA, SNAQ) in cardiac surgery is controversial and insufficiently studied. Furthermore, there is some known predictors of poor outcome, which closely related to nutritional status (C-reactive protein, total lymphocyte count). The aim of this study is assessment of several nutritional screening scales, objective nutritional criteria and predictors for the purpose of detection of most informative one or its combination.</brief_summary>
