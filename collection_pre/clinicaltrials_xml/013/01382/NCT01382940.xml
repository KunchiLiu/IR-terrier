	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the safety of administering rituximab at a more rapid infusion rate in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to biopharmaceuticals that treat diseases by interfering with tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF therapies), and were receiving methotrexate therapy for more than eight weeks.</brief_summary>
