	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the functional recovery of older ambulatory surgical patients and the impact of the current model of care on the caregivers of these patients. This study will provide unique insight into the challenges patients and their families face following surgery. The primary objective of this study is to: 1. Assess the impact of ambulatory surgery on functional capacity as assessed by the Syst√®me de Mesure de l'Autonomie Fonctionnelle (SMAF) one week and one month following surgery in a population of surgical patients 65 years of age and older. Secondary objectives are to determine if: 2. Changes in the patient's functional capacity result in increased burden of care as assessed by the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in the patient's primary caregiver. 3. Changes in functional capacity are correlated with decrements in quality of life as assessed by the Short Form 12 (SF12). 4. Changes in functional capacity are correlated with inadequate postoperative analgesia as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).</brief_summary>
