	<brief_summary>General anesthesia (GA) and paralysis are factors which facilitate atelectasis formation, especially in obese patients. Spontaneous breathing can reduce the amount of atelectasis. In this study, the investigators are comaparing obese patients undergoing hip arthroplasty in GA versus spinal anesthesia. Distribution of ventilation during and after anesthesia is assessed by eletrical impedance tomography (EIT).</brief_summary>
