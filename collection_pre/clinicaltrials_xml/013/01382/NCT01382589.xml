	<brief_title>Afamelanotide and Narrow-Band Ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) Light in the Treatment of Nonsegmental Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational product, afamelanotide, is a synthetic analogue of the human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). The earliest described function of alpha-MSH is its ability to stimulate melanin synthesis in the skin and therefore stimulate pigmentation. Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder. Interventions in the treatment of vitiligo include phototherapy with narrow-band (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (NB-UVB). The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy of afamelanotide, when combined with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) light, in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo. Afamelanotide is expected to speed up the repigmentation induced by NB-UVB light, leading to reducing frequency and doses of NB-UVB.</detailed_description>
