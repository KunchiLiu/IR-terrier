	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective study in acute ischemic stroke patients is to compare alarm-to-needle time during randomly allocated periods with and without availability of a specially staffed ambulance equipped with computed tomography (CT) and point-of care diagnostics. The investigators hypothesize that compared to regular care the investigators will reduce alarm-to-needle time by a minimum of 20 minutes by implementation of the stroke emergency mobile unit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PHANTOM-S: The Pre-Hospital Acute Neurological Therapy and Optimization of Medical Care in Stroke Patients - Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Time from symptom onset is crucial for the effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients. Many patients receive tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) with considerable delay. The investigators developed an ambulance equipped with a CT-scanner, point-of-care laboratory, teleradiological support and an emergency trained neurologist on board. In the Pre-Hospital Acute Neurological Therapy and Optimization of Medical care in Stroke patients (PHANTOM-S)-study the investigators aim at a reduction of the current alarm-to-needle time by pre-hospital use of tissue Plasminogen Activator in an ambulance. The investigators hypothesize that compared to regular care we will reduce alarm-to-needle time by a minimum of 20 minutes by implementation of the stroke emergency mobile unit (STEMO). This is a prospective study comparing randomly allocated periods with and without STEMO availability.</detailed_description>
