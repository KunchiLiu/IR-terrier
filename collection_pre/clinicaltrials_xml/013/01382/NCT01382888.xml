	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of topically applied heparin in comparison to placebo on suitability of newly constructed primary arteriovenous fistulas in patients planned for haemodialysis at 7th week (± 1 week) after first study drug administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Local Tolerability of Topically Applied Heparin on the Suitability of Newly Constructed Primary Arteriovenous Fistulas in Patients Planned for Haemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical dilemma surrounding the maturation and suitability of the AVF in patients undergoing hemodialysis suggests the requirement for a medication that can be added to the standard therapy with in order to help maturation and suitability of newly created AVF. Numerous research papers published over the past 25 years indicate that heparin might have a positive impact on main factors involved in the early failure of native AVF to mature. In total 56 eligible patients will be enrolled after giving informed consent. Screening will take place in the preceding 6 weeks before scheduled AVF creation. Only patients receiving a Brescia - Cimino (radio - cephalic) fistula or a distal ulnar artery to basilica vein, proximal radial artery to transposed basilica vein, brachial artery to transposed basilica vein and brachial artery to cephalic vein will later be randomized. Patients will be randomly assigned in equal proportions (each group 28 patients) to receive either topically applied heparin (Heparin 2,400 IU /ml Cutaneous Spray) or placebo using a computer-generated randomization. Participants and members of the study team will be blinded to treatment assignment. Patients will be instructed how to use and administer study medication for the consecutive 24 weeks following randomization. Assessment of the primary endpoint (suitability of newly constructed primary arteriovenous fistulas) is done at 7th week (± 1 week) after first study drug administration. The suitability and unassisted patency and local safety and tolerability by physician and patient of the AVF will also be determined at 12 weeks (± 1 week) and 24 weeks (± 1 week) after first study drug administration. Administration of study medication will be stopped at week 24 after randomization.</detailed_description>
