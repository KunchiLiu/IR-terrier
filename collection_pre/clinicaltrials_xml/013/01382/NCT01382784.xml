Epidemiological studies have shown an independent association between psoriasis and atherosclerosis, stroke and coronary artery disease. The main goal of this on-going study is to register data which will enable the identification of new markers of atherosclerosis activity and carotid plaque instability in patients with severe psoriasis.</brief_summary>
