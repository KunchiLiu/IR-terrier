	<detailed_description>The investigators will recruit adults patients with type 2 diabetes aged over 20 years with spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio over 30mg/g in two consecutive measurements. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive pentoxifylline (400mg three times daily) or placebo for 24 weeks.
