	<brief_summary>In ERCP practice, most often a combined use of guidewires is necessary to attain a therapeutic aim. E.g. a hyperflexible hydrophilic guidewire is changed after cannulating a stricture to a nitinol wire for improved stability with the use of therapeutic devices. A new guide-wire (G240) combines these characteristics with a stable shaft and a hydrophilic tip. The investigators test the hypothesis that the use of this new guidewire would decrease number of guidewires used within one ERCP session.</brief_summary>
