	<brief_summary>This multicentre, open-label, single-arm Study is to evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin 20 mg 76 weeks on coronary atherosclerosis plaque versus baseline in Chinese coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with hyperlipidemia by measuring the plaque volume using a 64 slice spiral CT. Effect on blood lipids, hsCRP and Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is also evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent Men or women, aged 18 75 Diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD) stable angina for more than 1 month and meet the following any one: 1. History of myocardial infarction. 2. CHD confirmed by coronary angiography. 3. Excercise ECG positive for CHD or perfusion defect 4. One or more main branch of coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50% confirmed by CT scanning. Hyperlipidemia (lipidlowering treatment naïve: LDLC ≥130mg/dl, or having received lipidlowering treatment: LDLC ≥100mg/dl) The 64 slice CT shows at least one significant coronary artery stenosis ≥20% with the narrowest ≤60% and meeting the following criteria: 1. Diameter of coronary artery lesion ≥2mm, length ≥5mm; distance between multiple lesions ＞1cm 2. Plaque density ＜100HU, no calcification 3. Vascular stenosis (20～60%) caused by plaques 4. Plaque thickness ＞1mm 5. Plaque not in the coronary artery with previous PCI treatment. Acute myocardial infarction within 6 months PCI or CABG therapy within 6 months Anticipated PCI or CABG therapy in the following 3 months.
