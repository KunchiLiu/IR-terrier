	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. In patients with severe preeclampsia there is an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage but the hemodynamic changes associated with this pathology make the management of any kind of bleeding particularly troublesome. There are many pharmacological options, being oxytocin the first line of treatment. However there is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of carbetocin, an oxytocin agonist. The investigators aimed to compare oxytocin with carbetocin for the routine prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in patients with severe preeclampsia.</brief_summary>
