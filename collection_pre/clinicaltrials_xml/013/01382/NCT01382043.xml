	<brief_summary>The safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES) with a biocompatible polymer have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials as well as in real world practice. Theoretically, a new DES with a biodegradable polymer should reduce the incidence of late in-stent thrombosis, however, the long-term safety and efficacy of these stents remains unknown. This study was aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of the Excel DES with a biodegradable polymer to the Endeavor DES with a biocompatible polymer in same individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Angiographic and IVUS Follow-up After Simultaneously Implanted Different Drug-eluting Stents in Same Individuals (AIFSIDDES)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>simultaneous implantation of one or more Endeavor stents and one or more Excel stents during the same index procedure willing to be followed up with coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound at least one year postprocedure. Patients were excluded from the study if they had more than two kinds of stents implanted or if the two study stents were implanted during separate interventional procedures or in coronary artery bridge vessel or restenotic lesions.</criteria>
