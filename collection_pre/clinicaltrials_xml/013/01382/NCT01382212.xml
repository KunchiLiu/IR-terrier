	<brief_summary>The objective is to evaluate the safety of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric subjects, ages 10 to 16 years old, with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (kidney failure) receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis and being treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Subjects will be in the dosing period of the study for 12 weeks in order to evaluate the incidence of hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in blood). Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled and all 12 will receive paricalcitol capsules.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must be receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for at least 3 months prior to Screening Subject is currently being diagnosed and/or treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism For entry into the Dosing Period (for subjects that are naïve to Vitamin D Receptor [VDR] Activators or those who have completed a 2 to 12 week washout), the subject must meet the following laboratory criteria prior to enrollment: A corrected calcium value ≥ 8.2 and ≤ 10.4 mg/dL A phosphorus value ≤ 6.5 mg/dL An intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) value &gt; 300 pg/mL and less ≤ 2000 pg/mL Subject is expected or scheduled to receive a living donor kidney transplant within 3 months of Screening or is a kidney transplant patient requiring full immunosuppressant therapy Subject is expected to stop peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis within 4 months of Screening (per investigator discretion) Subject has had a parathyroidectomy within 12 weeks prior to Screening Subject has had symptomatic or significant hypocalcemia requiring VDR Activator therapy (i.e., calcitriol, paricalcitol, or doxercalciferol) within 2 months prior to Screening Subject is taking maintenance calcitonin, bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids in an equivalent dose of greater than 5 mg prednisone daily, or other drugs known to affect calcium or bone metabolism within 4 to 8 weeks prior to Dosing Subject is receiving cinacalcet at the time of Screening</criteria>
