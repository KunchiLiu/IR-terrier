	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairments in cancer patients represent an important clinical problem. Studies to date estimating prevalence of difficulties in memory, executive function, and attention deficits have been limited by small sample sizes and many have lacked healthy control groups. More information is needed on promising biomarkers and allelic variants that may help to determine the etiology of impairment, identify those most vulnerable to impairment, and develop interventions for these difficulties. This is a longitudinal observational study of cognitive function in breast cancer and lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy to better understand the prevalence of cognitive difficulties (i.e., problems with memory, executive function, and attention) in these populations.</brief_summary>
