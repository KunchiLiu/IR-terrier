	<brief_summary>This study is primarily designed to assess the dose response, dose interval, efficacy and safety of three once daily (QD) doses (100mcg, 400mcg and 800mcg) and three twice daily (BID) doses (100mcg, 200mcg and 400mcg,) of GSK961081 administered via DISKUS™ for 28 days in subjects with moderate/severe COPD versus placebo. Salmeterol 50mcg BID is included in the study as an active comparator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 4-week Dose-Ranging, Dose-Interval, Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Study of GSK961081 in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase IIb multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging and dose-interval study. Eligible subjects will enter a seven-day run-in period followed by 28 days of double-blind, double-dummy treatment via the DISKUS inhaler. The study will consist of 8 visits, mainly conducted on an outpatient basis, 6 of which will be clinic visits and 2 of which will be phone contacts, including a post-treatment visit to follow up any adverse events. There will be approximately 425 subjects randomised to the study.</detailed_description>
