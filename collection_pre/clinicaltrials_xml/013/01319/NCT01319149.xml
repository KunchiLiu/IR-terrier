	<brief_summary>A retrospective molecular diagnostic review on wound care outcomes. The time periods include March, April, May of 2010.The retrospective review would analyze the days of healing during the timeframe, upon the introduction of molecular diagnostic testing</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Effects of Molecular Diagnostic Directed Wound Gels on Wound Care Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The null hypothesis would be that the introduction of molecular methods did not statistically affect patient outcomes. To study this hypothesis, our chief information technologist would query the database for any patients who are admitted during that time period. This period of time designated is March, April and May 2010.</detailed_description>
