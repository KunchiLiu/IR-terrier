	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients undergoing treatment with HIV infection and Hodgkin lymphoma may help doctors learn more about the effects of therapy on HIV. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood samples from patients with HIV infection and stage III or stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Blood Samples From Patients With HIV Infection and Stage III or Stage IV Hodgkin Lymphoma Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To quantify HIV-1 persistence in prospectively collected samples from patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Blood samples are collected before, during, and after treatment for lymphoma for HIV-1 RNA levels using standard and single copy assays and HIV-1 DNA quantification (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). After completion of treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: HIV1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDAapproved HIV1 enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by western blot at any time prior to study entry Documentation may be serologic (positive ELISA and positive western blot), or other federally approved licensed HIV diagnostic test Prior documentation of HIV seropositivity is acceptable Diagnosis of untreated Hodgkin lymphoma and participation in the parent protocol SWOGS0816, "A Phase II Trial of Response Adapted Therapy of Stage IIIIV Hodgkin Lymphoma Using Early Interim FDGPET Imaging." PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: No psychosocial conditions that would prevent study compliance and followup, as determined by the principal investigator Willing to provide serial blood samples PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
