	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to study the safety and tolerability of SENSIMED Triggerfish, a soft contact lens-based device intended to continuously record relative changes in intraocular pressure (IOP). The investigation enrols glaucoma patients and glaucoma suspects. All subjects receive two 24-hour recording sessions with the device in an ambulatory setting and at weekly interval. The level of discomfort in the study eye after 24 hours and side effects are the main endpoints of the investigation.</brief_summary>
