	<brief_title>MINI-AMI: Minimizing Infarct Size With Impella 2.5 Following PCI for Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the adjunctive use of the IMPELLA® 2.5 System for 24 hours following primary PCI for STEMI has the potential to limit the infarction of at-risk myocardium compared to primary PCI with routine post-PCI care (standard of care). This study is a feasibility study. Therefore, the principal objective is to identify trends in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based efficacy outcomes between the randomized treatment arms (Impella arm compared to control).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Signed Informed Consent Acute anterior STEMI with ≥2 mm of STsegment elevation in 2 or more contiguous anterior leads or ≥ 4 mm in total in the anterior leads, OR, Large Inferior STEMI with ≥2 mm of STsegment elevation in 2 or more inferior leads AND EITHER ≥1 mm STsegment elevation in V1 OR ≥1 mm of STsegment depression in ≥2 contiguous anterior leads (V1V3) Primary PCI performed within 5 hours of the onset of symptoms Patient undergoing emergent primary PCI of one culprit lesion in one major native epicardial coronary vessel Successful revascularization of the culprit native coronary artery with TIMI Flow Grade of 3 at the end of PCI Cardiac arrest requiring CPR within 24 hours prior to enrollment Current cardiogenic shock Left Bundle Branch Block (new or old) Atrial fibrillation Known history of prior MI Prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery Known mural thrombus in the left ventricle or contraindication to left ventriculography Presence of a mechanical aortic valve Documented presence of moderate to severe aortic stenosis or moderate to severe aortic insufficiency. Known history of severe kidney dysfunction. Known contraindication to MRI (implanted metallic or magnetically activated device; claustrophobia, inability to hold breath for 15 seconds). History of recent (within 1 month) stroke or TIA History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions. Administration of fibrinolytic therapy within 24 hours Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following: Heparin, pork or pork products; Aspirin, All of the following: Clopidogrel, Ticlopidine, Prasugrel Contrast media Participation in the active treatment or followup phase of another clinical study of an investigational drug or device. Severe peripheral arterial obstructive disease that would preclude the IMPELLA® System placement Requirement to treat two or more culprit vessels during primary PCI, or plan for staged coronary revascularization (PCI or CABG) within the next 30 days. Inability to place Impella within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, should patient be randomized to this arm.</criteria>
