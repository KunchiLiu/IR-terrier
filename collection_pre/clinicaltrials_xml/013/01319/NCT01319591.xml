	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare different estimates of calculating creatinine clearance by mathematical formula and compare them to creatinine clearance based on a timed urine collection in patients who received high-dose methotrexate for the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma or CNS involvement of systemic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Creatinine Clearance Calculation for Estimation of GFR in Patients Receiving HD Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We intend to perform a retrospective chart review to identify a serum creatinine-based equation that gives the best estimate of CrCl as compared with an equation derived from a 24-hour urine collection. Study subjects will be identified using the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Adult Pharmacy systems to identify patients who received high-dose methotrexate. Data will be collected starting with December 31, 2010 and proceeding chronologically backwards until the target enrollment of 40 patients is reached.</detailed_description>
