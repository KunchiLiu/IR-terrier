	<brief_summary>In a study conducted in our laboratory few years ago, we genotyped 22 genes in 2 athletic groups (endurance and sprinters) and in age and gender matched nonathletic controls. Few of these genes were found to be associated with athletic performance and area of specificity. Since then a few more genes have been found that are related to athletic performance, and we intend to study various genes related to 3 genetic cascade: genes associated with body fluid balance and homeostasis, genes associated with muscle strength, and genes associated with bioenergy. The results of this study compared with athletic level will provide deeper insight into the genetic mechanisms involved in performance.</brief_summary>
