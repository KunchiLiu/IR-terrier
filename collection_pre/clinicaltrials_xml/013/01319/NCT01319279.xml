	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: 1. To assess the pharmacokinetics of the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and in subjects with normal hepatic function. 2. To assess the safety and tolerability of the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and in subjects with normal hepatic function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. All subjects: Written informed consent is obtained 2. Subjects with normal hepatic function: The subject is in generally good health (ageappropriate) as determined by medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, ECG, serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, and serology. 3. Subjects with hepatic impairment: The subject's health is otherwise clinically stable as determined by medical history, physical examination, ECG, serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters (PT, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and international normalized ratio [INR]), urinalysis, and serology except for those signs and symptoms attributable to liver disease. The subject has case record notes demonstrating physical signs consistent with 1 or more of the following characteristic clinical manifestations of liver cirrhosis: liver firmness to palpation, splenic enlargement, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy, testicular atrophy, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity), or gynecomastia. The subject has a ChildPugh Classification score of 79 points (moderate). 1. All subjects: The subject has any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition. The subject is a poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 substrates based on genotyping performed at screening. The subject has previously participated in a study with CEP33237. The subject has a known sensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to hydrocodone or hydromorphone, related compounds, or to any metabolites, or any compound listed as being present in a study formulation. 2. Subjects with normal hepatic function: The subject has a positive test result for HBsAg or antibodies to hepatitis C. The subject has a history of alcohol, narcotic, or any other substance abuse. 3. Subjects with hepatic impairment: The subject has severe ascites. The subject has an acute exacerbation of liver disease as indicated by worsening clinical signs of hepatic impairment.</criteria>
