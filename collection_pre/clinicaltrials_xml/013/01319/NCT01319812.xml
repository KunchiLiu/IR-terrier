	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to separately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of BIOTRONIK's Astron and Pulsar stents. The Pulsar stent will be used for the treatment of femoro-popliteal lesions, located in the native superficial femoral artery (SFA) or proximal popliteal artery (PPA), while the Astron stent will be used for the treatment of the common or external iliac artery lesions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria To support the objectives of this study, the following initial inclusion criteria must be met for a subject to be enrolled and considered for the index procedure: Age ≥ 18 years Willingness to comply with study followup requirements Candidate for PTA Lifestyle limiting claudication or rest pain with an ABI ≤ 0.9 (resting or exercise). Thigh brachial index (TBI) may be used / performed if ABI is inadequate. Written informed consent For a subject to receive an investigational stent, the following procedurerelated criteria must be met: One de novo, restenotic or occluded lesion representing a femoropopliteal or iliac indication OR Two de novo, restenotic or occluded lesions representing one femoropopliteal indication and one iliac indication on contralateral limbs (i.e. one lesion per limb) Lesions may be one solid lesion or a series of multiple, smaller lesions to be treated as one lesion Subjects with bilateral, SFA/PPA disease (i.e. one SFA/PPA lesion per limb) are eligible for enrollment into the study. The target lesion will be selected at the investigator's discretion based on study eligibility criteria. The contralateral SFA/PPA intervention may be performed at the time of the index procedure (prior to treatment of study lesion); however, the use of an investigational treatment is prohibited. If the contralateral SFA/PPA intervention is not performed at the time of the index procedure, the intervention must be performed at least 30 days after the index procedure. The use of an investigational treatment for the contralateral intervention is prohibited. Subjects with bilateral, iliac disease (i.e. one iliac lesion per limb) are eligible for enrollment into the study. The target lesion will be selected at the investigator's discretion based on study eligibility criteria. The contralateral iliac intervention may be performed at the time of the index procedure; however, the use of an investigational treatment is prohibited. If the contralateral iliac intervention is not performed at the time of the index procedure, the intervention must be performed at least 30 days after the index procedure. The use of an investigational treatment for the subsequent contralateral intervention is also prohibited. Femoropopliteal lesions must be located at least 1 cm distal to the profunda femoris artery and at least 3 cm above the knee joint (radiographic joint space) Iliac lesions must be located only in either the common or external iliac artery Lesions must be treatable with a maximum of two stents Angiographic evidence of ≥ 70% stenosis or occlusion (operator visual assessment) Lesion length ≤ 190 mm (if de novo or restenotic) or ≤ 100 mm (if occluded) Target vessel reference diameter: 2.5 to 6 mm (SFA/PPA) or 6 to 9 mm (iliac arteries) by visual estimate Angiographic evidence of patent SFA and PPA (iliac indication) and angiographic evidence of at least one distal vessel runoff to the foot (both femoropopliteal and iliac indications). Patent is defined as &lt; 50% stenosis. For SFA/PPA intervention, a significant stenosis (&gt; 70%) or occlusion of an ipsilateral, inflow artery (e.g. aortoiliac, common femoral) must be successfully treated (use of investigational treatment prohibited) just prior to treatment of the target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as no complications and less than 30% residual stenosis following intervention. Exclusion Criteria To support the objectives of this study, the following initial exclusion criteria must not be present for a subject to be enrolled: Subjects pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study Life expectancy of less than one year RutherfordBecker category 5 or 6. Subjects with ulcers caused by venous disease may be enrolled in the study. Previously stented lesion(s) in the target vessel Target lesion(s) received previous treatment within 30 days prior to enrollment Prior peripheral vascular bypass surgery involving the target limb(s) Thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis within the past 30 days Known allergy to nitinol (nickel and/or titanium) Participation in any other clinical investigational device or drug study. Subjects may be concurrently enrolled in a postmarket study, as long as the postmarket study device, drug or protocol does not interfere with the investigational treatment or protocol of this study. Previous stroke or transient ischemic attack within the last three months prior to enrollment Previous coronary or peripheral bypass surgery (nontarget limb) within 30 days prior to enrollment Intolerance to contrast agents that cannot be medically managed and/or intolerance to antiplatelet, anticoagulant or thrombolytic medications Refuses blood transfusions Any medical condition, that in the opinion of the investigator, poses an unacceptable risk for implant of a stent according to the study indications For a subject to receive an investigational stent the following procedurerelated criteria must not be present: INR ≥ 1.6 Concomitant renal failure with serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Unresolved neutropenia (white blood cell count &lt; 3,000 / µL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 80,000 / µL) at the time of the index procedure Unresolved bleeding disorder (INR ≥ 1.6) at the time of the index procedure Presence of other ipsilateral, arterial lesions distal to the target lesion requiring treatment within 30 days of the index procedure (either before or after) or at the time of the index procedure Additional percutaneous interventional procedures (cardiac and/or peripheral) planned within 30 days after the index procedure Presence of a complication following predilation of target lesion Presence of a target vessel/lesion that is excessively tortuous or calcified or is adjacent to an acute thrombus that is unresponsive to antithrombotic therapies Target lesion is located within an aneurysm or associated with an aneurysm in the vessel segment either proximal or distal to the target lesion Target lesion requires the use of cutting balloons, atherectomy or ablative devices Subjects with less than single vessel runoff to the foot</criteria>
