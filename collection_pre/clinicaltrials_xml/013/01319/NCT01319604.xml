	<brief_title>SENSIMED Triggerfish</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 subjects will be enrolled in total. Enrolled patients will be randomized into one of 8 device groups of 6 subjects each or into the control group containing 12 subjects. Patients in the device arm will receive one session of 3-to 24-hour continuous IOP monitoring with SENSIMED Triggerfish®. SENSIMED Triggerfish® monitoring will begin at 18h ± 2 hours for all patients. SENSIMED Triggerfish® will be installed randomly on right or left eyes. During SENSIMED Triggerfish® monitoring on one eye, GAT and/or Perkins IOP measurements will be taken in the fellow eye every 3 hours. Outside this time they will receive GAT and/or IOP measurements every 3 hours in both eyes until the end of the 24-hours period. Patients in the control group will receive GAT and/or ICare PRO IOP measurements every 3 hours for 24 hours in both eyes.</detailed_description>
