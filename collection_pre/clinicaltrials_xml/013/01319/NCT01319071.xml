	<brief_summary>It is still unknown whether different genetic elements play a role in athletes' ability to create their area of specificity.In a study conducted in our laboratory few years ago, we genotyped 22 genes in 2 athletic groups (endurance and sprinters) and in age and gender matched nonathletic controls. Few of these genes were found to be associated with athletic performance and area of specificity. Since then a few more genes have been found that are related to athletic performance, and our aim in the current study is to expand our research to these new genes which include 3 genetic cascades: genes associated with body fluid balance and homeostasis, genes associated with muscle strength, and genes associated with bioenergy.</brief_summary>
