	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine injection on the relief of pain in patients undergoing 1-level posterior lumbar fusion. A total of 54 patients will be randomized into one of two groups (group C or group I) based on Excel number generation. Patients in group C will receive received normal saline intravenous injection, and patients in group I will receive an intravenous bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine followed by a continuous lidocaine infusion of 2 mg/kg/hr. Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption and the frequency at which patients pushed the button (FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system will be recorded at 4, 12, 24, 48 hours postoperatively.</brief_summary>
