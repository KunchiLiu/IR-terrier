	<brief_summary>Part I: Survey of Coronary Artery Calcification and Stenosis in Participants with Different Glycaemic Status Aims: To evaluate coronary artery calcification and stenosis in community-dwelling adults with different glycaemic status, using dual-source CT angiography (CTA) Study Subjects and Methods: 200 adults with normal glucose regulation (NGR), 200 with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and 200 with type 2 diabetes were recruited from an urban community of Shanghai, who then underwent a comprehensive examination including questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, biochemical analysis and CTA. Part II: Follow-up of Cardiovascular Events and Re-evaluation of Coronary Artery Calcification and Stenosis Aims and Methods: To investigate the development of cardiovascular diseases in subjects recruited in part I and re-evaluate coronary artery calcification and stenosis using CTA after 3-year follow-up To identify the predictive value of coronary artery calcification and stenosis with future risks of cardiovascular diseases and the possible development of coronary artery disorders among participants with different glycaemic status</brief_summary>
