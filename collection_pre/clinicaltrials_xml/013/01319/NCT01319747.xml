	<brief_summary>Recent studies demonstrated that radiofrequency isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVI) and surgically video assisted thorascopic pulmonary vein isolation (VATS-PVI) are acceptable or even superior alternatives to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with symptomatically paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data comparing effectiveness in both interventions are limited. The investigators want to compare the effectiveness of PVI and VATS-PVI. Secondary objectives are to compare the duration of hospitalization, quality of Life, cost and to compare the satisfaction of the patients.</brief_summary>
