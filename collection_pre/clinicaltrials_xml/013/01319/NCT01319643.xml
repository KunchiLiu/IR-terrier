	<brief_summary>Oxygen administration is a common practice in intensive care units, although concern is growing about oxygen toxicity. The aim of the study is to access whether a rigorous maintenance of a state of normal oxygenation in critically ill patients could obtain better outcomes, such as mortality, infections and organ failures, in comparison to conventional oxygen therapy practice.</brief_summary>
