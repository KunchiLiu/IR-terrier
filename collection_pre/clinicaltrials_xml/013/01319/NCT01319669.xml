	<brief_title>Clinical Trial on the Prevention of Thrombocytopenia After First-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled, open-labeled, multicenter clinical trial. The subjects are patients with NSCLC who are going to receive GC/GP regimen chemotherapy. Vadhan-Raj et al conducted a study in which they administered rhTPO in various ways to patients with sarcoma receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy. The results demonstrated that timing of administration of rhTPO can be adjusted according to the occurrence time of nadir platelet values induced by chemotherapy. The timing of administration of rhTPO in this study was determined based on the above proofs.</detailed_description>
