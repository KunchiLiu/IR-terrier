	<criteria>Participant is of nonAsian origin. Female participants of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use (and/or have their partner use) two acceptable methods of birth control beginning at the screening visit, throughout the study, and until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Participant has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤35 kg/m2 at the screening visit. Participant is judged to be in good health. Participant has no clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG). Participant has been a nonsmoker and/or has not used nicotine or nicotinecontaining products for at least 6 months. Participant is mentally or legally incapacitated, has significant emotional problems at the time of screening visit or has a history of a clinically significant psychiatric disorder over the last 5 to 10 years. Participants who have had situational depression may be enrolled in the study at the discretion of the investigator. Participant has a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or poses an additional risk to the participant by their participation in the study. Participant has taken any gastric antisecretory drugs (e.g., histamine receptor type2 antagonists [H2RAs] or proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]), antacids, or any other prescription or over thecounter (OTC) medications within 14 days prior to Period 1 and during the trial. Participant has been treated with any trial drug or therapy, or participated in a clinical trial in the 30 days prior to Period 1. Participant has any laboratory test result prior to dosing in Period 1 deviating from the normal reference ranges established by the local laboratory by more than 20% that the investigator judges to be of possible clinical significance. Participant has an estimated creatinine clearance of ≤80 mL/min based on the CockcroftGault equation. Participant has a history of stroke, chronic seizures, or major neurological disorder. Participant has a history of clinically significant endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, immunological, renal, respiratory, or genitourinary abnormalities or diseases. Participants with a history of uncomplicated kidney stones or childhood asthma may be enrolled in the study at the discretion of the investigator. Participant has a history of neoplastic disease. Participant is a nursing mother. Participant has any history or serologic evidence of hepatitis B or C with abnormal liver function tests (except for benign, selflimited hepatitis A &gt;5 years prior to randomization), hepatic or biliary tract disease, or a history of gastrointestinal tract surgery. Participant has an allergy or hypersensitivity to any component/excipient of the study drugs, has a history of significant multiple and/or severe allergies (including latex allergy), or has had an anaphylactic reaction or significant intolerability to prescription or nonprescription drugs or food. Participant is unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any medication, including prescription and nonprescription drugs or herbal remedies (such as St. John's Wort [hypericum perforatum]) beginning approximately 2 weeks (or 5 halflives) prior to administration of the initial dose of study drug, throughout the study (including washout intervals between treatment periods), until the telephone followup. There may be certain medications that are permitted. Participants must be explicitly warned of the potential risk of taking erythromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ketoconazole, itraconazole, cyclosporine, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)protease inhibitors during the study. Participant consumes excessive amounts of alcohol, defined as greater than 3 glasses per day of alcoholic beverages (1 glass is approximately equivalent to: 10 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of distilled spirits). Participant has consumed grapefruit juice, grapefruits and grapefruit products within 2 weeks prior to administration of the initial dose of study drug, and does not agree to refrain from their consumption throughout the study (including the washout interval between treatment periods) and until the telephone followup. Participant consumes excessive amounts, defined as greater than 6 servings (1 serving is approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine) of coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, or other caffeinated beverages per day. Participant has had major surgery, donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500 mL) or participated in another investigational study within 30 days prior to Period 1. The 4week window will be derived from the date of the last study procedure (i.e., telephone followup) in the previous study to the screening visit of the current study. Participant is currently a regular user (including "recreational use") of any illicit drugs or has a history of drug (including alcohol) abuse within approximately 1 year. There is any concern by the investigator regarding the safe participation of the participant in the study or for any other reason; the investigator considers the participant inappropriate for participation in the study.</criteria>
