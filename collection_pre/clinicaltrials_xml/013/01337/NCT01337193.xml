	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this research is to determine the effect of ultrasound imaging biofeedback on urine leakage, pelvic floor muscle contractions, and quality of life in women with stress urinary incontinence. This study will include women 20 years or older with stress urinary incontinence. The study will involve 2 groups: pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises with biofeedback using transabdominal Rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) (Group A) and PFM exercises alone (Group B). The participants will perform 16 exercise sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Group A will perform 3 pelvic floor exercises using the transabdominal RUSI to provide biofeedback. Group B will perform the same 3 pelvic floor exercises without biofeedback. All participants involved in the study will complete a general medical information questionnaire. In addition, all participants will have their PFM contraction assessed using an ultrasound machine placed over the lower abdomen, quality of life assessed with a written questionnaire, and given a 7-day bladder diary to complete prior to, at 4-weeks, and at completion of the study.</brief_summary>
