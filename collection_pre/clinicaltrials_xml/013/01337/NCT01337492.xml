	<brief_summary>Patients with either histological confirmation or clinical diagnosis who are candidate for orthotopic liver transplant(OLT) will receive Sorafenib 400mg 2 x day (BID) as a neoadjuvant (bridging) treatment until transplant. If patient progresses or falls outside of the Milan criteria on sorafenib patient can be treated per physician's discretion using local therapy. Patient will be followed until 30 days after the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Sorafenib as Bridge to Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: â€¢ To evaluate safety (including possible surgical complication) and feasibility of using sorafenib as neo-adjuvant (bridging therapy) prior to orthotopic liver transplant(OLT). The primary goal of this pilot study is to assess the safety and feasibility of treating HCC patients with sorafenib prior to OLT, as determined by the number of patients experiencing grade 4 hemorrhaging or bleeding post-operatively. To achieve these goals a 2-stage accrual design will be used with a maximum accrual goal of 10 patients. Initially 5 patients will be entered on-study. If more than one patient experiences grade 4 hemorrhaging/bleeding following OLT the trial will be closed and sorafenib will not be considered safe and/or feasible. If no patient experiences this event 5 additional patients will be enrolled. At the end of the study sorafenib will be considered safe and feasible in this setting if no patient experience grade 4 hemorrhaging/bleeding following transplant. With this design, and assuming at least 3 of the 5 patients in each cohort undergo OLT, the likelihood of stopping early is &lt;.04 if the underlying risk hemorrhages/bleeding are low (&lt;5% each) whereas there is a &gt;.42 chance of early termination if the risks are substantial (e.g. &gt;.20 likelihood of dose limiting toxicity and &gt;.30 likelihood of &gt;grade 4 hemorrhages/bleeding). Overall the likelihood of accepting or not accepting sorafenib as safe and feasible are &gt;.84, and &lt;.16, respectively under these conditions. Secondary objectives: - Drop out rate - Time to progression prior to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) - Waiting time.</detailed_description>

Men should use adequate birth control for at least three months after the last administration of sorafenib. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. Exclusion Criteria Cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt; class II New York Heart Association (NYHA).
