	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop fecal tests that will determine the extent of radiation exposure in patients undergoing radiation treatment for cancer. This project will determine whether fecal biomarkers can be used to diagnose exposure to radiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Biodosimetry in Children Undergoing Total Body Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing TBI as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) will have feces collected for use in the validation and refinement of new methods for rapid radiation biodosimetry. The stool samples will be collected before, and at defined times after TBI. Stool sampling will occur in the same manner that it does during routine patient care during HSCT.</detailed_description>
