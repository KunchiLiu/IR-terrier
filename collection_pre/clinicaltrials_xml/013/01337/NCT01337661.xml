	<brief_title>A Study of the Inflammatory Pathways Associated With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study in adult male and female subjects with COPD to collect blood, endobronchial tissues and BAL to investigate the inflammatory genes/pathways associated with AECOPD at the time of exacerbation (ie, active disease) and at 6 weeks later (ie, stable disease).</detailed_description>
