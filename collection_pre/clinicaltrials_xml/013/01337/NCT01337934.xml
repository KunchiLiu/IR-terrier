	<brief_summary>The use of albumin in critical ill patients is a matter of controversy. A large randomized controlled trial reported that albumin was as safe and effective as crystalloid solution for fluid replacement in intensive care unit, although the last one was less expensive. In Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines there are no preference for crystalloids over colloids. But recently, a retrospective analysis of patients with severe sepsis from SAFE study reported that the use of albumin in these patients would be superior, regarding reduction of mortality. The aim of this study is determine whether the use of albumin improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.</brief_summary>
