	<brief_summary>Telbivudine reduces DNA and normalizes alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) in chronic hepatitis B patients with few adverse effects, but its use during pregnancy has not been explored. In this open-label, prospective study from the second trimester to post-partum week 28. This trial is to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Telbivudine in HBeAg Positive Chronic Hepatitis B Pregnant Women with high level of serum HBV DNA and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels.</brief_summary>
