	<brief_summary>Biliary anastomotic strictures (post liver transplantation) occur in 15-20 % of the cases. Biliary stenting using plastic prosthesis during a period of 1 year is the treatment of choice. Problematic in this approach is the regular change, necessary to overcome occlusion of the stent, resulting in cholestasis and/or infection. This change needs to be performed every 3 months or more frequently in patients with symptoms of stent occlusion. The Kaffes stent (RMS) is a metallic removable stent, especially constructed for the treatment of biliary anastomotic strictures post liver transplantation. The advantage could be that this stent is less prone to occlusion with a lower change frequency (e.g. every 6 months). No randomized, controlled trial (RCT) or data exist comparing plastic stenting versus Kaffes stenting.</brief_summary>
