	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to implement a simplified Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (sNPWT) device in a low resource setting. The investigators hypothesize that the sNPWT device is at least equivalent to commercially available NPWT devices. Therefore, the specific aims of this study will be to measure: 1. the mechanical properties of the sNPWT device and 2. the adverse events associated with the sNPWT device.</brief_summary>
