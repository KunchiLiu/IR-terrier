	<brief_summary>P3914 a pro-drug of Naproxen, characterized by naproxen (COX inhibiting moiety) linked to a NO moiety is intended for the treatment of pain and inflammation. The rationale behind development of P3914 is to maintain the analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity of naproxen and enhance GI safety by virtue of release of NO besides with no major effect on blood pressure on long-term administration.</brief_summary>
