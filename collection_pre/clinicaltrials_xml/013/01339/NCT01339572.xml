	<brief_title>Clinical And Economic Impact Of Upfront Plerixafor In Autologous Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral blood stem cells are now considered the standard source of stem cells for autologous stem cell transplants. Unfortunately, there is still a 20-30% chance that inadequate numbers of stem cells will be collected, resulting in prolonged recovery of cell counts after transplantation and increased transfusion dependence. There is also a significant economic burden associated with remobilization and a risk that delays in collecting sufficient numbers of stem cells can result in an increased chance of disease recurrence prior to transplantation.</detailed_description>
