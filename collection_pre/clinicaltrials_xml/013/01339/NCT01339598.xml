	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the potential for Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognitive functioning in euthymic bipolar patients through comparing the effect of active or sham tDCS (placebo control) during the performance of two cognitive tasks. The investigators hypothesize that task performance will be improved with active relative to sham tDCS.</brief_summary>
