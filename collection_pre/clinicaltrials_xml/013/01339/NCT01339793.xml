	<brief_summary>In recent years, many hospitals have progressively perceived the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR). More and more hospital superintendents thus have realized that they should have a CSR strategy to deal with various stakeholders. Hospital, as a health care sector, is a labor-intensive industry. The management of hospitals should view its employees as salient stakeholders as well as a sort of precious asset by which hospital can possess a unique competition advantage in the operation. It is therefore important for superintendent to understand an employee's perspective on CSR and its impact on employees' work attitudes and organizational performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring the Relationships Among Hospital's Corporate Social Responsibility, Job Attitudes and Job Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the stakeholder theory and social identity theory, this study attempts to employ a survey approach to understand the superintendents and employees' perceptions of CSR, and to explore the effects of CSR on organizational commitment of employees and organizational performance. The samples are taken from the senior managers (such as the superintendent and vice superintendent) and employees in the hospitals of which the number of beds are more than 200. The structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to confirm the research framework and to test the hypotheses. The results will provide a reference for the management and regulators of hospitals to set up the CSR policies, and contribute to senior managers on the CSR strategy and human resource development with regard to hospitals.</detailed_description>
