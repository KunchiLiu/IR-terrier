	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and to establish the effectiveness of low voltage external beam radiosurgery using the IRay System for the treatment of subjects with recurrent leakage secondary to neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) as determined by decreasing the number of Lucentis injections required during the first 12 months of the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must have neovascular AMD, have received at least 6 prior injections with Lucentis or Avastin and have exhibited one or more of the following: have persisting fluid despite 3 consecutive monthly injections of anti VEGF, or received 4 prior injections over a 6 month period, or received 8 prior injections over a 12 month period. 2. Subjects must now have the need for further antiVEGF treatment due to increased fluid or persistent cysts on OCT, or leakage on FA. 3. Subjects must have a total lesion size of ≤12 disc areas and a CNV lesion with the greatest linear dimension of ≤6 mm, but not greater than 3 mm from the center of the fovea to the furthest point on lesion perimeter. 4. Subjects must have signed (and been given) a copy of the informed consent form, and be willing and able to return for scheduled treatment and followup examinations for the 3year duration of the study. 5. Subjects must be at least 50 years of age. 6. Women must be postmenopausal ≥1 year or surgically sterilized, or a pregnancy screen must be performed prior to the study and a reliable form of contraception approved by the investigator must be maintained during the study. 7. Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of 75 to 25 letters in the study eye and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye. 1. CNV due to causes other than AMD, including ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, multifocal choroiditis, choroidal rupture, or pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent ≥8 diopters). 2. A globe axial length of &lt;20 mm or &gt;26 mm. 3. Evidence of uncontrolled diabetes as determined by an HbA1c of &gt;6.5% and/or with retinal findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy. 4. Prior or concurrent therapies for age related macular degeneration including submacular surgery, subfoveal thermal laser photocoagulation (with or without photographic evidence), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), or ocular photodynamic therapy in the study eye. 5. History of radiation to the head in the region of the study eye.</criteria>
