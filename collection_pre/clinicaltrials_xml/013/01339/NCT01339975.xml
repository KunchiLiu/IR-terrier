	<brief_summary>Despite novel treatment options, Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) has been characterized by a constant increase in its mortality and consequently requires an important involvement in translational research. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interest of CXCL4, CXCL4L1 and CXCR3 as biomarkers in localized, locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Indeed these chemokines have shown anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties in experimental models and may be particularly interesting for prognostic and predictive purposes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Level of Expression and Prognostic Value of CXCL4, CXCL4L1 and CXCR3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on a physiopathological rationale, the use of RCC-directed antiangiogenic therapies into clinical practice leads to conclusive results and makes RCC a particularly well-suited tumor type to study factors involved in the angiogenic process. Furthermore the intensive use of targeted therapies in clinical practice raised new questions about their management. Therefore the identification of new molecular biomarkers is important: - to improve the precision of prognostic models currently based on clinical, biological or histopathological variables - to identify high risk patients that could benefit from an adjuvant treatment or a closer postoperative follow-up - to predict the response to antiangiogenic therapies and therefore identify the drug which is likely to be the most effective within an ever increasing pharmacopeia - to follow the therapy as precisely as possible, predict or attest the disease progression justifying a therapeutic modification Low CXCL4, CXCL4L1 and CXCR3 tumor expression levels are associated with bad prognosis factors in RCC. Consequently their interest in RCC is worth being evaluated, in two subgroups : Localized / locally advanced renal cell carcinoma and Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
