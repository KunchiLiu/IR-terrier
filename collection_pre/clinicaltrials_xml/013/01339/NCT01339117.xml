	<brief_title>Delivered Dietary Intervention for Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many children experience stomach pain or discomfort at some point during their lives. Some children have belly discomfort frequently while others rarely have this problem. There have been very few studies to test treatments for recurrent stomach discomfort in children. Recently, studies in adults with recurrent stomach discomfort suggest that diet changes may help. Currently, we do not know if these same diets will work in children with the same problem. In this study, two different diets will be provided (delivered) for two days with at least 5 days in between each provided diet. The child's symptoms will be recorded over the two days of each diet. Children will be asked to capture samples of their breath during the last day of the each two day delivered diet. Stool samples will also be collected.</detailed_description>
