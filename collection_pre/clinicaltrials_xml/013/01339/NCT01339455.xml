	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is a demyelinating and degenerative disorder of the CNS affecting vision and spinal cord function. This disease is rare compared to Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but it is devastating and often leads to accumulating disability with a 5 year-mortality of approximately 30%. Survivors are typically left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness, quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No agent has been found to be highly effective in halting disease activity. Based on recent outcomes of stem cell transplant trials and reports in autoimmune diseases including MS, and based on the mechanisms of NMO, we anticipate that stem cell transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for NMO patients. The hypothesis of the present trial is that autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation in patients with NMO will provide lasting benefit in relapse prevention. Specifically, we anticipate a 50% reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing relapse over a three year period. We will be following patients for a total of five years after transplantation.</brief_summary>
