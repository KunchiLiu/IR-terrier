	<brief_summary>Long-term follow-up studies have demonstrated significant late toxicities of total body irradiation (TBI), which are most marked in children radiated at a young age. Growth failure, decline in cognitive function, and endocrine abnormalities have all been described. Good outcomes can be achieved with alkylating agents only as a preparative regimen. This plan will use a combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy) with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to reduce the late toxicities of therapy that includes TBI.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Suitable cord blood from matched unrelated or related donor. Cardiac (Echo/EKG): shortening fraction ≥ 27% Electrolytes within normal CCHMC limits. Pulmonary function tests: DLCO ≥ 50% Renal: creatinine clearance/GFR ≥ 60 ml/minute/1.73m2 Lumbar puncture: no leukemic infiltrate. CBC: ANC ≥ 1000ml and unsupported platelet count of ≥ 50,000/ml Documented HSV and CMV titers, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C by serology, HIV by serology: all negative. Hepatic transaminases &lt; 2.5x normal; Total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl Patients who do not meet above organ function criteria (liver, cardiac, renal), due to the presence of a tumor compromising these organs, may have exception made for these criteria and remain eligible for treatment plan after consultation with Program Director of Blood and Marrow Transplant Patients with neoplastic or nonneoplastic disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to withstand the pretransplant conditioning regimen. Patients with uncontrolled (culture or biopsy positive) infections requiring intravenous antivirals, antibiotics, or antifungals. Patients on prolonged antifungal therapy with a history of fungal infection should be considered for a nonmyeloablative protocol. Patients who are pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this treatment plan. HIV seropositive patients</criteria>
