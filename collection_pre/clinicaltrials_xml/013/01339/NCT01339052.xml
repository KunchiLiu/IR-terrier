	<brief_summary>BKM120 is a newly discovered drug that has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that BKM120 may help to slow or stop the growth of malignant gliomas. The purpose of this study is to see how well BKM120 works in patients with malignant gliomas. Patients on this study will be treated in two groups: patients who are going to receive surgery and those who will not receive surgery. This study is trying to determine how effective BKM120 is in stopping cancer cells from growing. For patients receiving surgery the research will also try to determine if an effective level of BKM120 can penetrate the brain before surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of BKM120 for Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patients who will be having surgery, BKM will be taken orally for 8-12 days prior to surgery. Prior to surgery they will have a FDG-PET scan and during surgery a sample of tumor will be taken for research. Patients will resume oral BKM120 between 14 and 35 days after surgery. For patients who are not having surgery and post-surgery patients, BKM120 will be taken orally for 28 days (1 cycle). Patients will continue on BKM120 as long as their brain tumor does not get worse and they do not have severe or intolerable side effects. While on study, patients will have routine blood tests, a physical examination, and questionnaires to assess mood (each cycle), as well as an assessment of tumor by MRI or CT (~ every 8 weeks), and research blood samples at various timepoints for genetic studies and other tests that will measure any additional effect of the study drug and disease status. Participants may also be required to undergo a electrocardiogram and/or MUGA scan to monitor heart function during the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent document. Subjects must be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to record medication times accurately and consistently in a daily diary. Participants must be at least 18 years old. Participants must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60. Nature of illness and treatment history Participants must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma or variants. Participants will be eligible if the original histology was lowgrade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants is made. Participants may have had treatment for no more than 1 prior relapse(NOTE: Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e., radiation ± chemotherapy)). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 2 prior therapies (initial and treatment for 1 relapse). If the participant had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the participant undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as a second relapse. For participants who had prior therapy for a lowgrade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a highgrade glioma will be considered the first relapse). Participants must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan. For Cohort 2, CT or MRI within 14 days prior to start of study drug. MRIs should include vascular imaging when possible. For Cohort 2, corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required. For Cohort 1 subjects, CT or MRI should be performed ideally within 14 days prior to study registration, but because the screening MRI for this subset of subjects will not be used for evaluation of response, it is acceptable for this MRI/CT to have been performed greater than 14 days prior to registration if unavoidable. Furthermore, for this same reason, fluctuation in corticosteroid dose around this MRI does not warrant repeat scan so long as there is documented unequivocal evidence of tumor progression available. For Cohort 2, Immunohistochemical or genetic analysis on tumor tissue from a prior surgery must demonstrate activation of the PI3K pathway through one of the following: PIK3CA mutation of PIK3R1 mutation, PTEN negativity (&lt;10% of tumor cells staining) oh immunohistochemistry, PTEN mutation (any), homozygous deletion of PTEN Participants must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry. Participants must have recovered to a grade 0 or 1 from the toxic effects of prior therapy (with the exception of lymphopenia which is common after therapy with temozolomide). From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have elapsed: 4 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter)from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from antibodies, or 4 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) from other antitumor therapies. Participants with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive disease based upon nuclear imaging, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging or histopathology. Participants having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible for Cohort 2 as long as the following conditions apply: a) They have recovered from the effects of surgery; b) Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility. To best assess the extent of residual disease postoperatively, an MRI or CT scan should ideally been performed no later than 96 hours following surgery or at least 28days postoperatively, but scans performed outside of this window are considered acceptable if no alternative is available. In either case, the baseline/screening MRI must be performed within 14 days prior to registration. If the participant is taking corticosteroids, the dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required. Participants must have sufficient tissue from prior surgery for confirmation of diagnosis and correlative studies. Submission of tissue is to occur within 30 days after registration. The following amount of tissue is required: a) 25 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 45 micrometer thickness AND b)one of the following: i) At least 200 micrograms of frozen tissue OR ii)At least 10 (preferably 20) unstained FFPE sections of 10 micrometer thickness OR iii) At least 8 tissue cores from an FFPE block (200 micrometer total thickness of tissue from a block with a total surface area of 0.5 cm2) Clinical laboratory tests within 14 days prior to enrollment meeting the criteria listed in the protocol Cardiovascular assessment: baseline MUGA or Echocardiogram must demonstrate LVEF ≥ 50 % Electrocardiogram must demonstrate QTc interval of less than 480 msec Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception (defined in protocol) during study treatment and for 16 weeks after study discontinuation. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and within 48 hours prior to dosing with the study drug. Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring, must use condom during study treatment and for 16 weeks after study discontinuation and should not father a child in this period. Female partner of male study subject should use highly effective contraception while receiving study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study therapy. Cohort 1 Inclusion Criteria (In addition to the general eligibility criteria, participants in the Cohort 1 preoperative portion of the study must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible): A participant who is deemed by the site Investigator to be an appropriate candidate for surgical resection may be enrolled in the Cohort 1 preoperative study.
