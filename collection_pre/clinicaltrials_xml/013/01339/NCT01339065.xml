	<brief_summary>. Null Hypothesis: Giving low doze ketamine (0.5mg/kg) given preoperatively to adult patients undergoing elective surgery, in Mulago hospital, will not have a reduction effect on the levels of IL-6 &amp; IL-1β pro inflammatory markers by 48 hours. . Alternate Hypothesis: Giving low doze ketamine (0.5mg/kg) given preoperatively to adult patients undergoing elective surgery, in Mulago hospital, will have a reduction effect on the levels of IL-6 &amp; IL-1β pro inflammatory markers by 48 hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ketamine on Production of Inflammatory Markers in Post Operative Patients in Mulago Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH QUESTION Can 0.5mg/kg of Ketamine given preoperatively have an effect on the levels of pro-inflammatory markers? Primary specific Outcome: changes/deviations from baseline levels of IL- 6 pro-inflammatory markers of after surgery at PACU, 24 and 48 hours. Secondary specific Outcome: changes/deviations from baseline levels of IL-1β pro-inflammatory markers of after surgery at PACU, 24 and 48 hours.</detailed_description>
