	<brief_summary>The aim of the randomized controlled trial was to test two behavioral interventions among job-seekers with risky drinking. The interventions differed in their theoretical background: Intervention A was tailored to the stage of change, and Intervention B was non-stage-tailored. Over 12 months, job-seekers were pro-actively screened for risky drinking at three job-agencies. Job-seekers with risky drinking were asked to participate in the study. All three groups were assessed at baseline, and 3, 6 and 15 months later. The baseline assessment was self-administered using handheld computers. The follow-up assessments by interviews on the phone, primarily. Both intervention groups received individualized computer generated feedback letters at baseline and 3 months later.</brief_summary>
