	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Local Susceptibility Patterns Associated With Tigecycline in Comparison to Other Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, microbiologic in vitro evaluation which will study the susceptibility of tigecycline in disk diffusion on clinical bacterial isolates collected from inpatients and outpatients. Fourteen hospital centers participated in the program. In vitro efficacy of tigecycline will be determined through the in vitro disk diffusion activity, using FDA breakpoints.</detailed_description>
