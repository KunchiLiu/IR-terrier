	<brief_title>Evaluation of Loratadine for Prevention of Pegfilgrastim-Induced Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pegfilgrastim is a myeloid growth factor that stimulates neutrophil precursors and can be used to decrease infection risk associated with neutropenia. However pegfilgrastim may induce back and leg pain in 20-50% of patients. No intervention has been consistently successful in treating or preventing this pain. The exact mechanism of pegfilgrastim-induced pain is unknown but may be related to histamine-mediated inflammation. Several case reports and anecdotal reports have suggested efficacy of antihistamines for this indication. This study will have two parts. In the first part (Observational Phase), patients receiving pegfilgrastim will be surveyed to document the incidence of significant pegfilgrastim-induced back and leg pain. In the second part (Treatment Phase), patients who previously experienced such pain will be randomized to receive a 7-day course of either the antihistamine loratadine or placebo to determine whether pegfilgrastim-induced back and leg pain can be prevented with this intervention.</detailed_description>
