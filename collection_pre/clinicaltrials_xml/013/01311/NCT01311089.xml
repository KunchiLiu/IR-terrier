	<brief_summary>Most patients with thyroid tumors are effectively treated surgically by practitioners experienced in the techniques of thyroidectomy. Many patients, especially women, undergoing thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the neck. Robotic thyroidectomy which can hide the operative scar was associated with a higher degree of patient cosmetic satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most patients with thyroid tumors are effectively treated surgically by practitioners experienced in the techniques of thyroidectomy. Many patients, especially women, undergoing thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the neck. Robotic thyroidectomy which can hide the operative scar was associated with a higher degree of patient cosmetic satisfaction. In this study, we designed a prospective study comparing the cosmetic satisfaction and the postoperative body image change which associated with patient self-esteem between robotic thyroidectomy and conventional open thyroidectomy group.</detailed_description>
