	<brief_summary>Accumulation of salt and water in patients with liver disease (so called liver cirrhosis) is possibly related to the increased effect of steroid hormones on salt reabsorption in the kidney. By reducing overall steroid production with the dexamethasone the accumulation of salt and water could be prevented.</brief_summary>
