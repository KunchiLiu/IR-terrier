	<brief_summary>Nasotracheal intubation is usually required in oral surgery to allow an unrestricted surgical approach. The standard method is generally performed using the Macintosh laryngoscope supported by Magill forceps. However, it is recommended to perform awake tracheal intubation in situations where a difficult airway is predicted, a scenario where this technique may be poorly tolerated by the patient. Although fibreoptic intubation is considered the "gold standard", sometimes it is difficult to perform and,therefore, alternatives are necessary. The hypothesis is that optical laryngoscopes as the Airtraq nasotracheal and Mcgrath can improve the time and/or success of nasotracheal intubation in a manikin.</brief_summary>
