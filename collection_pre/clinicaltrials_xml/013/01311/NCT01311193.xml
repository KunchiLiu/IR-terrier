	<brief_summary>Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently suffer from emotional instability, daytime fatigue and sleep disturbances. The investigators examined circadian rhythms, sleep and well-being in women with BPD under their habitual life conditions with and without light treatment. Treated women diagnosed with BPD were investigated during 3 weeks without and 3 weeks with morning LT. Rest-activity cycles were continuously measured using wrist actigraphy, together with proximal skin temperature. Saliva samples were collected weekly to determine the diurnal melatonin rhythm. A range of self-ratings and questionnaires were used to assess depression and clinical state throughout the 6-week protocol. Ten matched healthy women followed the same 6-week protocol without light treatment.</brief_summary>
