	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of omega 3 fatty acid on neurological recovery, lipid profile and Antioxidant system in patients with spinal cord injury. One hundred spinal cord injured patients who come to clinic of spinal injury repair research center selected. Then the patients will receive two supplements capsules of omega 3 (600 mg) in the intervention group and placebo in the control group. Primary outcome measures are professionals evaluation of neurological function by using : - ASIA scale for sensory and motor function - FIM scale for Functional potential - FAM - SF_36 for quality of life Lipid profile and Antioxidant profile evaluation by using: - FBS - 2hpp - Insulin - LDL - Total cHOL - TG - HDL - Leptin Adiponectin -Calcium- - 25OHD - PTH,LH, FSH, Prolactin,Testosterone in males Bone markers by serum levels of :Osteocalcin-Osteoprotegrin_Bone Specified ALP- CTX - RANKL - BMD</brief_summary>
