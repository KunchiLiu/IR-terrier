	<brief_summary>Primary Research Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine efficacy of periarticular parecoxib sodium in a multimodal cocktail versus intravenous parecoxib injections for pain management in total knee arthroplasty Secondary Research Objective: - To determine if perioperative use of parecoxib sodium was associated with improved clinical outcomes - To evaluate the safety, in terms of adverse events; serious adverse events and tolerability of parecoxib sodium in periarticular injections in a multimodal cocktail</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Periarticular Parecoxib Sodium for Pain Management in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open label, parallel randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of periarticular parecoxib sodium compared to intravenous parecoxib sodium. 125 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis from 4 participating sites who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. After initial screening, patients will attend clinic for baseline examination. Subjects will then randomly allocated to periarticular parecoxib sodium or intravenous sodium in ratio of 1:1. patients are observed at post-operative 6, 12, 24 hours, subsequently daily for 4 days and finally at 2 week follow-up</detailed_description>
