	<brief_summary>The objective of the proposed research is to assess the efficacy of an eight-week, efficient and tolerable, low-intensity resistance-training program with concurrent application of partial blood flow restriction (PBFR) for improving quadriceps strength and volume in women with risk factors for incident symptomatic or progressive knee OA. This specific aim will be achieved through a randomized, controlled trial, comparing low intensity training with and without PBFR. There have been numerous reports of exercise interventions in people with knee osteoarthritis. However, this research is novel in that it will be the first to use a low intensity regimen that will minimize forces on the knee while still having the potential to lead to clinically meaningful strength gains in older adults with risk factors for incident symptomatic or progressive knee OA.</brief_summary>
