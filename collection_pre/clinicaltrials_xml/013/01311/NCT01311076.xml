	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of single doses of TAK-329 with a single dose of a subcutaneously-injected rapid-acting insulin analog in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAK-329 Glucose Clamp Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile-onset diabetes, occurs primarily due to β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency. The condition is immune-mediated and is usually idiopathic. Tight glycemic control using intensive insulin therapy was shown in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) to reduce rates of microvascular complications in T1DM; however, achieving and maintaining such control in T1DM using standard insulin therapy requires a high level of support and is associated with increased potential for hypoglycemia, increased weight gain and, in some patients, aggravation of cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia. TAK-329 is being developed by Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center, Inc. (TGRD) as an adjunct treatment to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who use insulin therapy. This study will take place at 1 site in the United States. A total of 36 male and female adult participants with T1DM will take part in the study. The study will last about 77 days, including a 28 days screening period, 4 cross-over treatment periods and a follow up period. Participants will be confined to the study clinic for 2 days in each period. Participants will also be contacted by phone 30 days following the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>
