	<brief_summary>This cohort observation, randomized controlled trial is intended to provide data that icons and non-verbal communication improve communication and cooperation with children with Autism/communication delay and aid in the transition to an unfamiliar environment. It would lay the foundation for future studies and practices of using icons and pictures for the whole office visit to enhance communication between the patient and physician/nurse/medical staff and cooperation of the patient. 1. Use icons during triage/check in process to decrease time and increase patient compliance. Compare typical children to those with Autism/communication delay. 2. Use icons during blood draw to improve communication with patients, to help with patient understanding, and increase patient cooperation and decrease noise and length of procedure.</brief_summary>
