	<brief_summary>The acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology provides real-time measurements of tissue stiffness. Aim: Using the ARFI ultrasonography, the investigators aims are to complete the correlation and validity studies between visceral ARFI quantification and the referenced Metavir fibrosis scoring and to conduct subsequent innovative studies on liver diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visceral Stiffness Measurement Using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using ARFI technology, we are establishing a complete hepatic and visceral shear wave spectrum to correspond to the entire METAVIR fibrosis scoring and various functional stratifications.</detailed_description>
