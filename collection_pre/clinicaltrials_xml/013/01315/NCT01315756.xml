	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that the use of the mobile phone-based self-help system FTA, and with the patients as active players, will improve diabetes self-management reflected by improved glycemic control and lipids, self-care behaviours and lifestyle changes such as improved dietary habits and increased physical activity, compared with usual care. Following this; it is also hypothesized that this will also lead to a reduction in overall risk for diabetes complications (expressed by reduction in e.g., 5 year absolute risk for coronary artery disease as calculated using the Swedish National Diabetes Register's risk calculator) and in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., as defined by the International Diabetes Federation). It also hypothesized that health counselling based on TTM and CBT by a diabetes nurse, and with individualized feedback via sms from the diabetes nurse, may have an important function as a supplement to the self-help system (FTA). In addition, it is hypothesized that the patients' health status and diabetes-related quality of life (HRQL) will improve. The results of this study may show that a commonly used tool like the mobile phone, and also mobile phone together with health counselling, fitted into the patients' daily life, is more effective and cost-effective than standard care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-management in Type 2 Diabetes Patients Using the Few Touch Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mobile phone-based lifestyle tools, and health counseling using tailored SMS and individual phone-calls to the patients, for self-management of T2DM. Maintaining daily symptom diaries (described below) by an easy way of self-monitoring appear to offer a valid and reliable way of assessing behaviours. In addition, the patients are able to view their own registrations on the Smartphone, i.e. a programmable mobile phone with a touch sensitive screen. The self-help system, called the "Few Touch application", recently tested on 12 people with T2DM at NST, University Hospital of North Norway (UNN), will form the basis for the patients' mobile interaction system.</detailed_description>
