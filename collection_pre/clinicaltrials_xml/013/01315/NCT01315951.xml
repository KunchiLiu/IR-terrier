	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to demonstrate the use of petroleum jelly in prevention of nonscalp seborrheic dermatitis exacerbations at the first signs of a flare. In doing so, it will decrease the chronic use of topical steroids. The use of petrolatum should have favorable outcomes for patients, without the side-effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Petrolatum's Effect on Initial Symptoms of Nonscalp Seborrheic Dermatitis and Preventing Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonscalp seborrheic dermatitis (NSSD) is typically a benign inflammatory process of the skin that affects oil rich areas including in and between eyebrows, paranasal area, behind ears, over the sternum, and groin. While these lesions typically come and go without proposing a threat to the patient, they can be socially debilitating, and psychologically distressing. The mainstay treatment for an exacerbation of NSSD is topical steroids. Topical steroids are very effective and useful to patient's who are desperately seeking treatment. However, most family practitioners are reluctant to prescribe or recommend topical steroids for chronic conditions like NSSD due to the potential side-effects including permanent atrophy of the skin. NSSD has an unknown etiology. However, one of its biggest risk factors appears to be dry skin due to its increase in incidence during colder seasons, and with use of alcohol-containing topicals. Naturally occurring skin yeast (ie Malassezia) are also thought to play a part. Petrolatum is considered a skin protectant and has a strong ability to hold moisture in skin. Along with restricting water from leaving skin, it also decreases most air from contacting the skin. This may slow the growth and activity of skin yeast that are typically considered facultative anaerobes. A patient diagnosed with nonscalp seborrheic dermatitis will be consented into the study and given instructions on the petroleum treatment. This includes wetting the affected area, blotting dry, and then applying petrolatum to the area before bedtime. This regimen is to be followed every other night until symptoms diminish. The patient will come back to the office for follow-up at one week, two weeks, and four weeks after treatment begins to see the outcome. Pictures will be taken at each encounter and used to measure progress through one mm graphs. Patients will not be identifiable in these pictures, and they will be labeled with the patient's given ID number.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1875 years old who are patients of the Genesys East Flint Clinic and have been diagnosed with recurrent NSSD Patients are to use the petrolatum treatment strictly for the initial symptoms of NSSD: Excessive flaking, and erythematous macules or papules Patients who are able to attend the followup appointments for assessment Patients are to have the doctor's confidence that that patient will correctly implement the treatment plan Patients not in the 1875 years of age range. Patients who are receiving treatment for their seborrheic dermatitis (Scalp or nonscalp) elsewhere. Patients who have not demonstrated recurrent NSSD. Patients who are unable to commit to a followup appointments for assessment. Patients who do not have the physician's confidence in implementing the studies treatment plan effectively. Patient's who are unable/unwilling to have petrolatum on affected area for at least a 6 hour length of time.</criteria>
