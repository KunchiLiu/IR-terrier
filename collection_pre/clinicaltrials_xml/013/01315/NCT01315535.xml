	<brief_summary>The literature does not discuss if the fast oral appliance titration (30 days period) in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) treatment, may improve subjects quality of life in such brief period. Temporomandibular dysfunction-related (TMD) is one of the most important side effects observed in OSAS treatment with oral appliance. Since the effectiveness of mandibular exercises in the control of TMD pain has already been verified, it may play a fundamental role in the support of the fast oral appliance titration.</brief_summary>
