	<detailed_description>Although gait disorders are frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), few studies have focused on cognitive motor effects of anti-dementia drugs and vitamin D. The objectives of this study are to - Compare characteristics of gait and balance measured among patients with ADRD separated into 3 groups according to stages of disease (i.e., pre-dementia, mild and moderate dementia stages) - To determine the effects of anti-dementia drugs and vitamin D on cognitive motor abnormalities - To determine whether motor abnormalities could be associated with cognitive impairments, specifically executive dysfunctions - To establish a database at Angers University Memory Center.</detailed_description>
