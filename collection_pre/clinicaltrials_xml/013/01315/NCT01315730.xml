	<brief_title>The Effects of Tactile Speech Feedback on Stuttering Frequency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new medical grade device (FDA - category exempt) has been newly designed and built at the University of Mississippi within the departments of Communication Sciences &amp; Disorders, Exercise Science, and Computer and Electrical Engineering. The device records either sound waves (via a small standard microphone) or three dimensional accelerometer data from the throat of a stuttering subject. This data is digitally signal processed, and "fed back" to the user in the form of a small vibrating disk/film that can be held between the fingers or mounted on the skin. This feedback data does not require the subject to attend to the incoming signal.</detailed_description>
