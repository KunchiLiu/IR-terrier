	<brief_summary>The investigators recently proposed a new hypothesis on the pathogenesis of mammillary fistulae (MF) suggesting that occlusion of hair follicles by keratinous plugging may relevantly contribute to the development of MF. The investigators believe that the pathogenesis of MF mimics the behaviour of hidradenitis suppurative, as both clinical entities manifest themselves as a chronic, suppurative and recurrent inflammatory process. This new proposal has led to the present suggestion of a therapeutic alternative for MF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Percutaneous Injection of Triamcinolone in the Treatment of Mammillary Fistula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the results from a prospective observational database with two groups of patients: 1. patients with MF treated by percutaneous drainage and saline solution. 2. patients with MF treated by percutaneous drainage and saline solution plus percutaneous triamcinolone. These patients are treated following usual clinical practice in our Department. All the procedures are made through an ultrasound-guided way. During the follow-up of these cases (clinical and with ultrasound) resolution rate will be registered by the same investigator. The follow-up will be at least 6 months.</detailed_description>
