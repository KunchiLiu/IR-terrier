	<brief_summary>Methadone treatment has became one of main actions taken in China to control the spread of HIV among drug users. Howeverï¼Œthe average methadone dose used is relatively low. An intensive methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) provider training on methadone dosage may be effective in increasing the methadone dose levels prescribed to new patients. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored education program for MMT service providers using subsequent methadone dose prescribed to new patients. The effects of methadone dose, with and without the inclusion of additional psychosocial services, will then be measured through MMT retention and illicit opioid use.</brief_summary>
