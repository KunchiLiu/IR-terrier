	<brief_title>Psychological Treatment for Children Suffering From Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor vehicle accidents account for a majority of TBI cases and are a leading cause for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among children. The vast majority of these cases involve mild TBI (mTBI) with persistent post concussion syndromes. However, the empirical data on treatment in this field is scarce. Few studies demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapies can be effective for adults with mild TBI suffering from Acute Stress Disorder, but no research, to date, addressed this question in pediatric population. In the current research we intend to examine the effectiveness of PE in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms in children and adolescents with m-TBI caused by motor vehicle accident, in comparison to children and adolescents without brain injury. Sixty children age 6 to 18 attending the Anxiety clinic in Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel will be included. All subjects will be treated with a manualized 12-18 week Prolonged Exposure protocol. Participants will undergo assessments, which will include interviews, questionnaires and neuropsychological tests concerning symptoms of PTSD, emotional and cognitive functioning. Ratings and neuropsychological testing will be made at baseline and following completion of treatment. Follow up will include questionnaires ratings at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after completion of treatment.</detailed_description>
