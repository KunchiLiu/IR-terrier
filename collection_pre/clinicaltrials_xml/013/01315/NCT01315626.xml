	<brief_title>Bronchiectasis: Evaluation of an Educational Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot study will be conducted for the purpose of evaluating an educational intervention (Description in Appendix A). As part of the educational intervention, primary care physician(s) will be trained in the use of an algorithm to guide assessment of patients seen with a respiratory chief complaint, and who have not previously been identified as having a diagnosis of BE. We propose an evaluation of three primary care practice(s) to compare the number of patients identified in three three-month periods as having a diagnosis of BE. The evaluation periods will be as follows: Period 1) the three-month period immediately following the intervention, Period 2) the three-month period immediately preceding the intervention, Period 3) the three month period starting one year prior to the intervention.</detailed_description>
