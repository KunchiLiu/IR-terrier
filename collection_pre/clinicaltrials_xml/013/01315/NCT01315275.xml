	<criteria>Male or female patients &gt;18 years of age who have signed an informed consent Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (according to ADA or WHO guidelines) with HbA1c not more than 10.0% at screening (Visit 1). Patients should be on diet, exercise, and/or pharmacological treatment for diabetes. Patients with visual impairment due to focal or diffuse DME in at least one eye Central Retinal thickness on OCT â‰¥ 250 microns in the central subfield BCVA score between 78 and 39 letters, inclusively, using ETDRSlike visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/32 to 20/160) Decrease in vision is due to DME and not due to other causes, in the opinion of the investigator Medication for the management of diabetes must have been stable within 3 months prior to randomization and is expected to remain stable during the course of the study. Ocular concomitant conditions/ diseases Concomitant conditions in the study eye which could, in the opinion of the investigator, prevent the improvement of visual acuity on study treatment Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in either eye Any active infection (e.g. conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) in either eye History of uveitis in either eye Systemic conditions or treatments Active systemic infection History of stroke &lt; 3 months Renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant OR renal insufficiency with creatinine levels &gt; 2.0 mg/dl Untreated diabetes mellitus Blood pressure systolic &gt; 160 mmHg and diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg Untreated hypertension Known hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or any component of the ranibizumab formulation Others Women of childbearing potential not using the contraception method(s) specified in this study (specify), as well as women who are breastfeeding Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
