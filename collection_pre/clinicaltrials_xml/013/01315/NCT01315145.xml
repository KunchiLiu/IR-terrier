	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, prospective, observational clinical study to compare patient outcomes following treatment with either the mild® procedure or epidural steroid injection in patients with moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis exhibiting neurogenic claudication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MiDAS III (Mild® Decompression Alternative to Open Surgery): Vertos Mild Patient Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was initially designed as a randomized trial. Due to difficulty of enrollment, the study was amended and converted to an observational comparative study with study arm being self-selected by the patient.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with neurogenic claudication where the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of back and leg pain average is ≥ 5. Prior failure of conservative therapy. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of ≥ 31%. Radiologic evidence of LSS, with unilateral or bilateral ligamentum flavum ≥ 4.1mm confirmed by preop MRI performed within 612 months of baseline visit. Able to walk ≥ 10 feet before being limited by pain. Available to complete 24months of followup. Adults ≥ 50 years of age. Prior surgery at intended treatment level. History of spinal fractures with current related pain symptoms. Motor deficit or disabling back and/or leg pain from causes other than LSS neurogenic claudication (e.g. acute compression fracture, metabolic neuropathy, vascular claudication symptoms, etc.). Significant/symptomatic disc protrusion or osteophyte formation judged by the Investigator as possible confounding factor to study results. Excessive facet hypertrophy judged by the Investigator as possible confounding factor to study results. Significant symptomatic foraminal stenosis. Confirmed anterior or retrolisthesis ≥ 3mm. Bleeding disorders and/or current use of anticoagulants with the inability to withhold anticoagulants for required time prior to procedure. Able to walk ≥ 200 yards unaided in erect nonflexed position before being limited by pain. Able to stand ≥ 15 minutes in erect, nonflexed position before being limited by pain. Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) within 7 days of treatment. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 32 as calculated using the patient's weight multiplied by 703 then divided by height in inches squared. Epidural steroid, systemic steroid or any spine interventional procedure within prior six weeks of study procedure. Dementia and/or inability to give informed consent and to understand and complete followup patient reported outcomes forms. Inability of the patient to lie prone for any reason with anesthesia support (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, etc.). On (or pending) Workman's Compensation or known to be considering litigation associated with back pain. Unable to tolerate MRI (pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator, etc.). Intrathecal pump. Any medical condition determined by the Investigator that would not allow subject to fulfill trial requirements or safely tolerate procedures in this study.</criteria>
