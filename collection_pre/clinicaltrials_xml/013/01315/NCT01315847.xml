	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the receptor occupancy (RO) associated with telcagepant (MK-0974) administration based on displacement of [11C]MK-4232 from the CGRP receptors in the brain using PET. The study enrolled healthy participants (Part I) and migraine patients (Part III). Due to a protocol amendment, study Part II was not conducted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Study of Brain Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Receptor Occupancy After Telcagepant Administration (MK-0974-067)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the 1120 mg (i.e., maximal) telcagepant dose, [11C]MK-4232 was administered and PET scan was started ~3 hours post telcagepant to coincide with the Tmax of the 1120 mg dose. For the 140 mg (i.e., therapeutic) telcagepant dose, [11C]MK-4232 was administered and PET scan was started ~2 hours post telcagepant to correspond with the timing of clinical efficacy measurements of telcagepant for migraine treatment in Phase III studies.</detailed_description>
