	<brief_title>Effect of Glucose Degradation Products (GDP) on Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) with neutral pH and low glucose degradation products (GDPs) are used in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Low GDP fluids are reported to be more biocompatible than conventional PDF. Determination of biocompatibility has mainly focused on local peritoneal effects; recently, there has been interest in evaluating the systemic biocompatibility of these fluids. In recent analyses of two retrospective cohorts of Korean PD patients, significant survival advantage was shown for patients treated with the biocompatible PDF compared to patients treated with conventional PDF. However, the mechanisms of survival advantage with low GPD PDF in these observational studies are difficult to assess. Additionally, it is not clear that new PDFs favorably impact risk markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiologic studies identified an independent association between inflammation and risk of cardiovascular events and mortality; this association has been confirmed in patients with advanced chronic kidney diseases (CKD).Other evidence showed that clinically overt vascular events are preceded by endothelial dysfunction and increases in circulating markers of endothelial activation, including vascular cellular adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1.Moreover, there is an association between inflammation and elevated levels of soluble VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in patients with or at risk of atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of soluble adhesion molecules are found in ESRD patients, especially in patients with CVD and malnutrition. The investigators hypothesized that conventional PDF as well as uremia itself lead to local peritoneal changes such as peritoneal neoangiogenesis and fibrosis, effects related to ultrafiltration failure and subsequently volume overload. In addition, direct effect of GDPs and/or increased systemic levels of AGEs activate endothelial cells and increase levels of vascular adhesion molecules and inflammation. Both local and systemic effects of PDF are possibly associated with increased cardiovascular risks and mortality in PD patients. This study aims to examine the effects of neutral pH and low GDP-containing PDF on systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in incident PD patients in a randomized, controlled study.</detailed_description>
