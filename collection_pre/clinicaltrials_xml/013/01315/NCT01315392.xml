	<brief_summary>Delayed wound closure is considered by many to be the standard of care for the treatment of an open fracture. This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of a large multi-center prospective randomized clinical trial and collect the pilot data needed to compete for the funding for such a trial. The study was designed to compare immediate and delayed closure of Gustilo type II and IIIa tibia diaphyseal fractures. The primary outcomes were the infection rates and fracture related complications in patients treated with immediate or delayed wound closure strategies.</brief_summary>
