	<brief_summary>Viagra (Sildenafil citrate) is an orally active selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Objectives: - To test the efficacy of Viagra 100mg on demand vs. Viagra 100mg daily (taken either at bedtime or 1 hour prior to sexual intercourse) in restoring erectile function following radical prostatectomy. - To test the safety and tolerability of Viagra 100 mg on demand vs. Viagra 100 mg daily after radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>

Subjects who have a medical history of major hematological, renal, vascular or hepatic abnormalities, those with psychological or social circumstances that would impair their ability to participate reliably in the study, or those who may increase the risk to themselves or others by participating in the study. 3. Subjects who have a medical history of diabetes. 4. Subjects who developed a postoperative complication, namely reoperation for hemorrhage, a documented urinary fistula or the indwelling of catheter for 3 or more weeks. 5.

Subjects with severe hepatic; cirrhosis or ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) 2x upper limit of normal) and renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30mL/min) or known history of hereditary degenerative retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. 10. Subjects who, for medical reasons and/or in the opinion of the investigator, require starting dose of 25mg of Viagra. 11. Subjects who are currently taking or are likely to be treated with nitrates or nitric oxide donors in any form (oral, sublingual, buccal, transdermal, inhalational or as aerosols) on either regular or intermittent basis. 12. Subjects who are receiving concomitant treatment or who during the study are likely to start the treatment with potent CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors ritonavir and saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, Miconazole, nefazadone, claritromycin, troleandomycin erythromycin and cimetidine). 13. Subjects who are currently using any commercially available treatments or noncommercial herbal preparations for erectile dysfunction, e.g. IC injections, vacuum devices, or testosterone patches. Such treatments/devices must not be used at any time during the study. 14. Subjects who have received any investigational drug within the six weeks prior to screening or who are taking any other investigational drug concomitantly. 15. previous prostate surgery or previous hormonal treatment. 16. Subjects at increased risk of priapism e.g. sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease) and myeloproliferative disorders (e.g. myeloid leukemia, polycythemia, thrombocytopenia). 17.
