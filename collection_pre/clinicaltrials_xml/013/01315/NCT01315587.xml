	<brief_summary>The pilot studies have showed that theta burst stimulation (TBS) can have the more rapid and durable effects to the apply traditional rTMS protocols. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of repetitive TMS and theta burst in reduction of negative symptoms and remission of cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia. In a randomized, double blind clinical trials, 30 patients with schizophrenia in Razi psychiatric hospital will be assigned to receive repetitive TMS; theta burst, or sham TMS, daily; for 20 sessions.
