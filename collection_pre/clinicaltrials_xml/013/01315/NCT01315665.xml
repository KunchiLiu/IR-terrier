	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to investigate the effect of sulforaphane from macerated broccoli sprouts in humans and to evaluate less invasive methods of assessing potential anti-inflammatory drugs in CF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Sulforaphane in Broccoli Sprouts on Nrf2 Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis to be tested is that sulforaphane consumed from macerated broccoli sprouts will activate Nrf2, reduce oxidative metabolites and reduce neutrophils in the oral mucosa after 5 days of therapy in healthy volunteers and CF subjects. The study requires 6 brief outpatient visits over 8 days. Study procedures include medical history, height, weight, vital signs, blood and urine collection, nasal curettage, saline mouthwash, and ingestion of broccoli sprouts (100 gm of 3 to 5 day old raw broccoli sprouts once daily for 5 consecutive days).</detailed_description>
