	<brief_summary>Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPC) represent a small cellular population of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. EPCs are recruited into injured tissues and play an important role in regeneration and reparation. Experimental and clinical data suggest that EPCs have hepatoprotective activity and could improve liver regeneration during acute and chronic liver injury. The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effects of autologous bone marrow-derived EPCs, when administered through the hepatic artery of patients with advanced liver cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
