	<brief_title>Dietary Fiber Mixture in Constipated Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite of an increase in the consumption of fibers being indicated for the treatment of constipation, few clinical trails have evaluated its efficiency. In the majority of prior studies only the effect of a single type of fiber was evaluated. Each type of fiber presents a particular characteristic, which determines its action mechanism and performance in different parts of the colon. Therefore, theoretically, greater effectiveness could well be observed when different types of fibers are associated into a single product for fiber supplementation. A randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled was performed to evaluate the effect of a dietary fiber mixture in constipated pediatric patients. Children aged between 4 and 12 years were included in the study and the initial diagnosis of functional chronic constipation was made in accordance with the Rome III criteria. The children having attended the Pediatric Gastroenterology Ambulatory of the Federal University of Sao Paulo and the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia hospital in Sao Paulo city. All of the children were undergoing constipation maintenance treatment with the use of a laxative in a dosage less than 1.0 ml/Kg for milk of magnesia, mineral oil or lactulose or less than 0.5 g/Kg for polyethylene glycol 3350.</detailed_description>
