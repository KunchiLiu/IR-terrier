	<brief_summary>The Biomarkers in autism of aripiprazole and risperidone treatment (BAART) project will provide evidence-based guidance in the selection and monitoring of drug treatment of autism. BAART involves 3 academic centers across South Carolina. Although the FDA has approved use of the antipsychotic drug risperidone for irritability associated with autistic disorder, a moderate response rate in pivotal clinical trials and concerns over tolerability and weight gain can force clinicians to select alternative drug treatments for which evidence-based support is sparse.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Biomarkers in autism of aripiprazole and risperidone treatment (BAART) project will provide evidence-based guidance in the selection and monitoring of drug treatment of autism. BAART involves 3 academic centers across South Carolina with expertise in phenotyping patients with autistic spectrum disorders, assessing patient response in clinical trials, and expertise in pharmacogenomic research. Although the FDA has approved use of the antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole for irritability associated with autistic disorder, a moderate response rate in pivotal clinical trials and concerns over tolerability and weight gain can force clinicians to select alternative drug treatments for which evidence-based support is sparse. BAART will assess predictors of efficacy, tolerability, and safety in 200 children 6-17 years old with autistic disorder (AD) during a double-blind, randomized 10 week treatment period with either risperidone or aripiprazole. Responders who complete the study may continue with medication treatment for three months. Factors considered will include 1) psychiatric history; 2) symptom response; 3) psychosocial support; 4) measures of tolerability; 5) serum prolactin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentration; and 5) a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to target genes for drug disposition and transport, response, and tolerability. The BAART project will result in evidence-based guidelines for selection and monitoring of drug treatment of children and adolescents with AD.</detailed_description>
