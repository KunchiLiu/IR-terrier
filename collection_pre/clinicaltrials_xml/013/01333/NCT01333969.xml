	<brief_summary>The application of a tourniquet for 5 minutes and subsequent reperfusion before actual inflation of the tourniquet for total knee arthroplasty (ischemic preconditioning) decreases the level of local inflammation and therefore postoperative pain in response to reperfusion of the ischemic extremity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ischemic Preconditioning on Postoperative Pain After Total Knee Arthroplasty, a Randomized, Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During knee surgery your surgeon routinely uses a device called a tourniquet that allows us to temporarily cut of blood supply to the site of surgery. This helps to reduce blood loss and improves operating conditions. When allowing blood back into your leg at the end of the procedure, debris (bone, fat, tissue breakdown products and cement from the surgery) gets washed out and gains access to the rest of your body. In the vast majority of cases this event bares no major clinical consequences, but can rarely result in signs of inflammation of various body systems. Patients with evidence of impaired organ system function such as pre-existing lung and heart disease may be more vulnerable. Previous studies suggest that cutting off the blood supply for a short period of time just before a prolonged episode, could lead to a decrease in the extent of tissue breakdown products in this extremity and may thus be associated with a decrease in the inflammation of other organ systems. We propose to study this theory in knee surgery patients by looking at levels of markers of inflammation present in the blood before and after surgery.</detailed_description>
