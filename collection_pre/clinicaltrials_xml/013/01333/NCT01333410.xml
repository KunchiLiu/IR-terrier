	<brief_summary>Vitiligo has remained a difficult disease to treat. Previous available therapies are often ineffective. It usually takes several months or years for complete repigmentation and some areas of the body get at best only partial repigmentation. The desire of the patient to undergo therapy varies from patient to patient and needs to be assessed individually. Several factors should be considered when planning the treatment strategies including type of vitiligo, site and degree of involvement, skin color, psychological effect, patient compliance, ease to assess to therapy, cost of treatment and social association of the disease. Topical corticosteroids are still be the standard treatment of localized vitiligo. However, the adverse effects such as skin atrophy, striae, pigmentary change and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis suppression can occur if we use inappropriate strength of topical steroids for a long period of time. Tacrolimus (FK-506) is a new immunosuppressive agent that acts by inhibiting T-cell activation and cytokine release. It offers a safe and efficacious alternative for many skin conditions. It minimizes the need for topical glucocorticoids and does not cause skin atrophy. Tacrolimus was first reported for treatment of vitiligo in 2002. The underlying mechanism was shown in an in vitro study that topical tacrolimus promoted proliferation of melanocytes and melanoblasts. This study purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.1% topical tacrolimus ointment comparing to 0.1% mometasone furoate cream in the treatment of adult vitiligo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of 0.1% Tacrolimus and 0.1% Mometasone Furoate for Adult Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At first visit, patients will be randomized to receive 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for apply to vitiligo lesion on one side of the body. The lesion on the other side of the body will be treated with 0.1% mometasone furoate cream. Patients are instructed to apply 0.1% tacrolimus ointment and 0.1% mometasone furoate cream twice a day for 6 months Patients will be follow up at 2, 4 and 6 months for clinical improvement, side effects and photographs</detailed_description>
