	<brief_title>Acute Pain Study Following Bunionectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bunionectomy was performed under regional anesthesia and propofol sedation. Perioperative anesthesia was standardized for all participants. Upon completion of surgery, designated study personnel ensured continued eligibility per the selection criteria of the protocol. After an appropriate period of time following bunionectomy, participants who had a pain intensity score of â‰¥ 40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) and moderate or severe pain intensity per the categorical pain intensity scale were eligible for randomization, in equal numbers, into 1 of 2 treatment arms: hydrocodone/acetaminophen extended release or placebo.</detailed_description>
