	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the persistence of immunity to hepatitis B in healthy children aged 7 to 8 years, after previous vaccination with Infanrix hexa™ in the first two years of life, and also their ability to mount an immune response to the challenge dose of Engerix-B™ Kinder.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female 7 to 8 years of age at the time of enrolment. Subjects with documented evidence of previous vaccination with four consecutive doses of Infanrix hexa™ as part of routine vaccination in Germany: three doses of primary vaccination received by 9 months of age and one booster dose received between 11 and 18 months of age. Written informed consent obtained from the parents/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) of the subject at the time of enrolment. In addition to the informed consent that will be signed by the parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s), written informed assent of the subject will be sought when the subject is judged able to understand by the investigator. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Child in care Use of any investigational or nonregistered product, other than the study vaccine, within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Evidence of previous hepatitis B booster vaccination since administration of the fourth dose of Infanrix hexa™ booster in the second year of life. History of or intercurrent hepatitis B disease. Hepatitis B vaccination at birth. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before and ending 30 days after the hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding challenge dose or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the challenge dose of HBV vaccine. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the hepatitis B vaccine, or evidence of hypersensitivity after previous immunisation with a vaccine containing the hepatitis B component. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.</criteria>
