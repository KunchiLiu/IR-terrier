	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of our research program is to develop an effective and cost-saving mind-body therapy to help patients with FM. The objective of this pilot study is to gather pilot data of the effect on pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life in FM patients using a specific type of qigong exercise, i.e. "six healing sound" qigong. Changes in relevant brain activity will be monitored in study subjects before and after the qigong exercise program, which may help us in better understanding the underlying mechanism of the qigong exercise. Data collected in this pilot study will help the investigators in preparation for a future clinical trial with a larger sample size. Our central hypothesis for the future clinical trial is that qigong exercise will lead to a significantly greater improvement in pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life in the experimental group compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
