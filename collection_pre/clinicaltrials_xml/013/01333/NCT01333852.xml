	<brief_title>Metformin Plus Paclitaxel for Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METTAX is a phase II randomized trial that aim to evaluate the addition of metformin to paclitaxel in patients that failed to curative-intent treatment for Head-and neck neoplasms. Patients eligible for this protocol will be randomized to paclitaxel 175mg/m2 plus metformin or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point is disease control (complete response, partial response or stable disease, according to RECIST 1.1) in the 12th week. Secondary end-points are PFS, OS, response rate and safety. Molecular markers in samples collected before and under treatment will be tested for correlation with clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
