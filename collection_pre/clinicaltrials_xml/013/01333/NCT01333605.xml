	<brief_title>IGEV Followed by Autologous Transplantation for Refractory or Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment in patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma is salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation for responsive patients. However, the standard of salvage chemotherapy remains uncertain. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IGEV regimen in a single-center basis.</detailed_description>
