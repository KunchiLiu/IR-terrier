	<brief_summary>Cognitive rehabilitation involves enhancing an individual's capacity to process information to improve their everyday functioning. One common form of intervention is computerised cognitive training (CT); however, efficacy results have been mixed. This research aims to investigate a novel method for enhancing outcomes from CT through combining CT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive and painless form of brain stimulation. In this study we aim to determine the efficacy of this approach through comparing in a randomized controlled study tDCS combined with CT versus CT and tDCS alone in healthy participants. We hypothesise that tDCS combined with CT will have greater generalisability effects than the other conditions.</brief_summary>
