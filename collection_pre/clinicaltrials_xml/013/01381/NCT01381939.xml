	<brief_summary>Induction of Labour in Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) has become a common procedure in management of ICP to avoid fetal complications. Surprisingly, this empirical approach has not been evaluated as to delivery complications and fetal outcome as yet. The investigators now examine weather ICP affects (i) delivery procedures chosen, in particular the incidence of caesarian section, (ii)fetal and maternal outcome in induced labor, and (iii)possible impact of bile acids and UDCA treatment in a retrospective cohort study based on approximately 5000 induced deliveries at Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. The investigators analyze data on on previous deliveries, BMI, medical history and medical book data. Primary endpoint is the risk of caesarian section.</brief_summary>
