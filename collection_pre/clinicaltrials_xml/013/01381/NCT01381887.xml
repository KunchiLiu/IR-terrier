Patients will participate in the study for up to approximately 16 weeks. During the study, patients will receive 4 treatments (A, B, C, and D); each treatment will be administered during a 3-day treatment period. Patients will receive 1 dose of study medication in the morning of Day 1 and Day 2 of each treatment period and treatment periods will be separated by approximately 2 weeks.

	<criteria>Patients with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control (based upon fasting glucose measurements &gt;=130 mg/dL and &lt;=250 mg/dL) on metformin monotherapy or on metformin in dual combination with other glucose lowering agents (sulphonylurea [SU] or a meglitinide or a dipeptidyl peptidase4 [DPP4] inhibitor) are eligible for enrollment in the study.
