	<brief_summary>The benefit of using platelet rich plasma (PRP) in cartilage injuries, and specifically in degenerative ones, has not been assessed yet. Current studies on the PRP healing or repairing effect on knee cartilage degenerative injuries are not conclusive to establish a standard of behavior, although PRP has shown to improve joint functionality and reduce pain. Hypothesis: PRP intra-articular injections in osteoarthritic knees reduces pain and leads to a more effective and lasting functional recovering than corticosteroid intra-articular injections.</brief_summary>
