	<brief_summary>Information on the prevalence of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma and its symptom burden is limited in commercially insured patients (age &gt;= 18 years and &lt; 65 years). Additionally, limited information exists on economic burden of adverse events associated with treatments for advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. An objective of the current study is to estimate the incidence, prevalence, and symptom burden associated with advanced/metastatic RCC in a US "real-world" setting. Another objective is to quantify the economic burden of severe adverse events with agents used in management of first line advanced/metastatic RCC (sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, and pazopanib). This study will employ a retrospective cohort design. Analyses of health insurance claims data from a large commercially insured population will be employed in the current study. Study subjects will consist of all persons, aged â‰¥18 years, with evidence of advanced RCC between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009; these persons will be identified based in part on case-ascertainment algorithms. Analyses will be directed at estimating annual rates of incidence and prevalence of advanced/metastatic RCC, as well as symptom burden and costs of common severe adverse events associated with treatments used in management of advanced/metastatic RCC (sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, and pazopanib).</brief_summary>
