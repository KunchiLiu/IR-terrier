	<brief_summary>Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to determine whether the repair of photoreceptor cone outer segment tips defect is significantly correlated with the visual outcomes after macular hole surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Foveal Cone Outer Segment Resumption to Predict Visual Recovery After Macular Hole Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was used to calculate the mean length of photoreceptor cone outer segment tips (COST) defect on 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after macular hole surgery. The correlation between the mean length of COST defect and the BCVA was determined. Prognostic factors might have influenced for COST repair was also evaluated by multivariable analysis.</detailed_description>
