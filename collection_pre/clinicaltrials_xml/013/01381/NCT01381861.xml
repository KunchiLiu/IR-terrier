	<brief_title>Evaluation of TRC105 in the Treatment of Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis plays a central role in the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer. In mouse models, VEGF-inhibitors diminish ovarian tumor growth, metastasis and malignant ascites formation. Independent Phase 2 trials have demonstrated single-agent activity for bevacizumab in recurrent ovarian cancer, and randomized controlled Phase 3 trials are ongoing in the first-line setting (GOG 0218 and ICON-7) and for recurrent disease (GOG 0213, OCEANS). TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an important non-VEGF angiogenic target on vascular endothelial cells. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models. In a Phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, TRC105 therapy caused a global reduction in angiogenic biomarkers and reduced tumor burden at doses that were well-tolerated. We hypothesize that TRC105 will have single-agent activity in recurrent ovarian cancer. By targeting a non-VEGF pathway, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGF inhibitors which could represent a major advance in ovarian cancer therapy.</detailed_description>
