	<brief_title>Argireline in Treatment of Periorbital Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Argireline has mechanism of action that significantly inhibited neurotransmitter release with a potency similar to that of BoNTA. Inhibition of neurotransmitter release was due to the interference of the hexapeptide with the formation and/or stability of SNARE complex. Notably, this peptide did not exhibit in vivo oral toxicity nor primary irritation at high doses. These findings demonstrate that Argireline is a anti-wrinkle peptide that emulates the action of currently used BoNTs. In vivo study, Topical Argireline 10% is applied on lateral preorbital area twice daily for 30 days. The result demonstrates a significant anti-wrinkle activity by decreased skin wrinkle 30%. These findings demonstrate a significant anti-wrinkle activity for Argireline, in agreement with its in vitro and cellular activities. Topical Argireline represents a bio-safe alternative to BoNTs in anti-wrinkle therapy.</detailed_description>
