	<brief_summary>This non-interventional longitudinal study is a follow-up of the Austrian Cholesterol Screening and Treatment project (ACT I), which assessed the cholesterol status, including achievement of the target levels applicable at that time (LDL levels &lt;100 mg/dL), in participants with coronary heart disease (CHD) already being treated with a statin. In this study, participants without adequate LDL-cholesterol reduction with a statin underwent extension of therapy with ezetimibe with the goal of achieving target levels.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Ezetimibe</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Participants in whom LDLcholesterol target levels have not been achieved. Participants in whom a decision has been made by the physician to initiate treatment with ezetimibe (longitudinal analyses). The treatment decision will be made prior to and independent from inclusion of participants into this study. Participants with LDL cholesterol levels â‰¤113 mg/dl and a very high risk, which led to casebycase approval of medication may be documented. Exclusion criteria: Any condition which, in the opinion of the treating physician, precludes treatment with ezetimibe. In order not to interfere with data collection it is recommended not to include participants currently in a clinical trial. Previous and ongoing treatment with ezetimibe.</criteria>
