	<brief_summary>ClarityIQ is a novel X-ray imaging technology, that combines advanced real-time image noise reduction algorithms, with state-of-the-art hardware to reduce patient entrance dose significantly. This is realized by anatomy-specific optimization of the full acquisition chain (grid switch, beam filtering, pulse width, spot size, detector and image processing engine) for every clinical task individually. Furthermore, smaller focal spot sizes and shorter pulses are used, which are known to positively influence image quality . The final effect on the clinical image quality is investigated in this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The advent of interventional neuroradiology (INR) has changed the treatment of neurovascular diseases by reducing the procedural invasiveness and the recovery time needed by patients, thus improving clinical outcome. However, INR procedures often require many high-quality digital substraction angiography (DSA) runs and long total fluoroscopy times, which can result in patients being exposed to considerable radiation doses levels. In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a real-time noise reduction algorithm for DSA in neuroradiology that is capable to reduce the patient entrance dose by 75% without loss of image quality.</detailed_description>
