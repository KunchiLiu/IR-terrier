	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in predicting response to rituximab treatment in samples from patients with indolent follicular lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Predicting Response to Rituximab Treatment in Samples From Patients With Indolent Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Genotype the full cohort of samples available from the RESORT clinical trial (ECOG-E4402) for FCGR3A 158V/F in parallel to independently verify results. - Correlate the FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms to response, response duration, and time to rituximab resistance. Secondary - Quantify copy number variation in FCGR3A in this cohort. OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples isolate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms using different complementary genotyping methods. Assay results are reviewed and compared with patients' outcome data.</detailed_description>
