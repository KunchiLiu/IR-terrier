	<brief_summary>This retrospective database study will assess differences in the risk of re-hospitalization and other COPD-related exacerbations and costs for patients receiving fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate combination 250/50 (FSC) versus anticholinergics [i.e. tiotropium (TIO) and ipratropium or combination ipratropium-albuterol (collectively referred to as ipratropium - IPR)] post-hospitalization or Emergency Department (ED) visit for the treatment of COPD. This is a hypotheses testing study. Associations are compared between FSC and AC cohorts. Hypotheses for the primary outcome and key secondary outcomes are presented below: Specifically the study hypotheses for the primary outcome being tested were: Ho: There is no difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization between FSC and AC Ha: There is a difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization between FSC and AC Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was: Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC Ha: There is a difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk of Re-Hospitalization in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Post Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Managed care patients (aged &gt;40 years) who were fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate combination (FSC)-naive in the 12 months pre-index period. The index-date was the date of discharge of the index Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-related hospitalization/Emergency Department (ED) visit. Eligible patients were required to newly initiate or switch to drug therapy with FSC or ipratropium (IPR) / tiotropium (TIO) during the identification period (01/01/2004 to 01/31/2008) to treat COPD. Patients who switched to another maintenance medication or had an exacerbation in the treatment assessment period (30-days post-index date) were excluded from the study. Follow-up period was 12 months post treatment assessment period. Patients classified as being on FSC 250/50 versus anticholinergics (TIO, IP or IPR). Examined risk of COPD-related exacerbations such as hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, COPD-related physician/outpatient visit with oral corticosteroid (OCS) or antibiotic prescription (ABX) within 5 days of physician/outpatient visit and COPD-related medical, pharmacy, and total healthcare costs in follow-up period.</detailed_description>
