	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to correlate the different patterns of resistance mutations observed in vivo in patients failing RAL treatment with the fold-change resistance determined by the phenotypic assay.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives are, as follows: - to establish standardised genotypic assay for the HIV-1 pol gene region (region of interest, sensitivity, mutations involved as primary or compensatory changes, role of polymorphism present at baseline). - to reach consensus on the algorithm interpretation of in house ex-vivo genotypic evaluations. - to assess the genetic changes in RAL-failing patients under continuous drug pressure or drug discontinuation (dynamics of the reversion of resistance mutations). - to evaluate in RAL resistant HIV-1 variants the changes in replication capacity (RC) (baseline vs. following-timepoints). - to evaluate the immunological and virological trend associated with a raltegravir-regimen failure.</detailed_description>
