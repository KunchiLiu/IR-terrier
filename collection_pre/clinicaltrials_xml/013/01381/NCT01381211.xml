	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor of the liver that accounts for an important health problem worldwide. In only 10% - 15% of all patients with HCC, tumors are considered resectable at presentation. In contrast to metastatic liver disease, there is no role for systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of HCC. Today only evidence is available for Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibiting agent. The arsenal of non-surgical therapies can roughly be divided into local ablative, transarterial and systemic therapies. In well selected patients, local ablative therapy can offer favorable long term results. For patients with disease confined to the liver, but locally more advanced, transarterial treatment modalities are proposed. These therapies exploit the dual blood supply to the liver. HCC derives its blood supply almost entirely from the hepatic artery, while liver parenchyma derives &gt; 75% of its blood supply from the portal vein. Antitumoral agents, such as cytotoxic drugs or radionuclides, can be delivered in close proximity of the tumor. Examples of transarterial therapies are: transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), bland transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads (TACE-DEB) and transarterial radioembolization with Iodine-131 or Yttrium-90. TACE is currently the gold standard for treatment of patients with intermediate stage HCC, with a reported median survival of around 17 months. A novel development in the TACE treatment for HCC is the drug-eluting bead (DEB). Recently performed small clinical trials reported the efficacy of DEBs in the treatment of intermediate stage HCC, which is substantially higher compared to conventional TACE. Yttrium-90 radioembolization (90Y-RE) is a relatively recently developed technique which implements transarterial administration of minimally embolic microspheres loaded with Yttrium-90, a Î²-emitting isotope, delivering selective internal radiation to the tumor. In this study the investigators want to prospectively compare TACE-DEB and 90Y-RE, two novel treatments that both have theoretical and/or proven advantages compared to the use of conventional TACE, in patients with intermediate stage HCC.</brief_summary>
