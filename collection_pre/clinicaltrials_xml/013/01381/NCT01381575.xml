History of allergic disease, suspected allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccines Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment Planned administration/administration of a vaccine/product not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before each dose of vaccine. Administration of routine meningococcal, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, inactivated influenza, diphtheria/tetanus and/or diphtheria/tetanuscontaining vaccine up to 8 days before each dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product Previous administration of MPL or AS04 adjuvant. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests, which in the opinion of the investigator precludes administration of the study vaccine Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment</criteria>
