	<brief_summary>Our overall goal has been twofold: 1) to evaluate whether there are significant age-related changes in flight simulator performance near age 60, and 2) to assess whether there is an alternative model that can explain longitudinal flight simulator performance on the basis of measures of cognitive function and expertise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Age-related Longitudinal Changes in Aviator Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overall goal has been twofold: 1) to evaluate whether there are significant age-related changes in flight simulator performance near age 60, and 2) to assess whether there is an alternative model that can explain longitudinal flight simulator performance on the basis of measures of cognitive function and expertise. Such a model might be able to predict change in aviator performance better than what could be predicted by chronological age alone.</detailed_description>
