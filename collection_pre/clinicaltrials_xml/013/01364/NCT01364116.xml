	<brief_summary>Measuring total hemoglobin(tHb) is a precious step to decide to start or to stop transfusion during operation. The newly developed instrument pulse CO-Cooximetry (Masimo) makes noninvasive monitoring of venous hemoglobin level (SpHb). The objective of this study - to compare the simultaneous level of tHb and SpHb during operation and after volume expansion in children - to assess the accuracy of amount of acute change of SpHb on Masimo and tHb</brief_summary>
