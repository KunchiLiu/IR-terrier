	<brief_title>Exercise in Critically Ill Patients With Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effects of an early targeted rehabilitation program on inflammatory markers and muscle mass in patients with sepsis syndromes in intensive care. The Primary Hypothesis is that an early targeted rehabilitation ICU patients with sepsis syndromes over 7 days will Prevent loss of lean muscle mass by within 7 days of recruitment to the study. Decrease pro-inflammatory and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines within 7 days of recruitment to the study.</detailed_description>
