	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Gabapentin/B-complex Versus Pregabalin in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin administered for 12 weeks in the treatment of pain in mild to moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) of acute or chronic presentation. Secondary Objectives: To determine the safety and tolerability of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin administered for 12 weeks in the treatment of pain in mild to moderate DPN of acute or chronic presentation. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin/B-complex or pregabalin. The duration of treatment per subject will be 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
