	<brief_summary>High intraocular pressure (IOP) is a known risk factor for developing primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). There is controversy in the literature regarding the degree to which caffeine influences IOP, with some studies reporting minimal changes in IOP while others report up to 4 mmHg increases. To date there are no double-masked randomized controlled trials that examine acute caffeinated coffee's effects on IOP in patients with or at risk for primary open-angle glaucoma. The investigators aim to better understand the relationship between acute caffeinated coffee (vs decaffeinate coffee) consumption and IOP in a double-masked, crossover randomized controlled clinical trial.</brief_summary>
