	<brief_summary>A significant association between resting heart rate (HR) and both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality has been demonstrated in numerous epidemiologic studies for both the general population and for patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiac disease is the leading cause of death among hemodialysis (HD) patients a recent study reported that the 48-hr mean HR is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in normotensive hemodialysis patients. Ivabradine, a pure HR lowering agent,acting on If current inhibition has proven beneficial antianginal effects and mortality reduction linked to HR reduction in ischemic patients. Aim: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ivabradine in normotensive hemodialysed patients with increased pre-dialysis HR (&gt; 80 bpm)</brief_summary>
