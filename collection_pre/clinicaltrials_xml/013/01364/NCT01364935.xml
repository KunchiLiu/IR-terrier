	<brief_title>Comparison of DuoFertility, LadyComp/BabyComp and Clearblue Monitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to recruit 30 women who are currently trying to conceive, and ask them to use the 3 fertility monitors for duration of 3 menstrual cycles. Additionally, during the study the women will be asked to fill in online questionnaires to assess the usability of the monitors. As the spouse is often a critical partner in the purchase decision and compliance, the investigators will also ask the spouse to complete similar online questionnaires.</detailed_description>
