	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treating pre-diabetic &amp; pre-hypertensive individuals using multiple drugs intervention (anti-hypertensive drugs (i.e., ACEI) plus anti-glycemic drug (i.e., metformin) plus anti-hyperlipidemic drug (statin)) would lower Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Pre-diabetic &amp; Pre-hypertensive Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risks of CVD are not confined to a subset of established "hypertensive" or "diabetic" population, but also increase among those with suboptimal blood pressure and glycemic level, namely "pre-hypertensive" or "pre-diabetic" population. Evidence on the effectiveness of drug interventions to lower CVD events in pre-clinical stage population has been scant.</detailed_description>
