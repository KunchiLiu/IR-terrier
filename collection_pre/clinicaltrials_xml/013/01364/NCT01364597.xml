	<brief_title>Open-label Long-term Study of Adjunctive Brivaracetam in Pediatric Subjects With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, long-term study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy. This study was initially designed for pediatric subjects who had completed a previous BRV study. With Protocol Amendment 3, enrollment was expanded to include up to additional 100 subjects as "directly enrolled subjects" ≥4 years to &lt;17 years of age with partial-onset seizures (POS) who had not previously enrolled in a pediatric BRV study. With Protocol Amendment 4, enrollment for "directly enrolled" subjects was modified from 'up to' an additional 100 subjects to "at least" 100 subjects, keeping the planned total enrollment of approximately 600 subjects to allow flexibility in the number of patients reaching 1 year of exposure. The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV. The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of BRV during long-term exposure.</detailed_description>
