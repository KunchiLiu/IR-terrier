	<brief_summary>This is an open label phase I study, to assess the safety and immunogenicity of novel schedules for vaccination with the candidate malaria vaccines AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP. These vaccines have been evaluated previously in a number of clinical trials proved to be safe and capable of inducing protective cellular immune response following challenge with the parasite. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults. They will be primed with AdCh63 ME-TRAP administered intramuscularly and boosted several times with AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP according to various schedules.. Safety data will be collected for each of the seven regimens. Secondary aims of this study will be to assess the immune responses generated by each of these regimes.</brief_summary>
