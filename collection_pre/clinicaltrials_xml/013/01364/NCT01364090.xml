	<brief_title>A Collaborative Trial in Injectors of Individualized Treatment for Genotype 2/3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of shortened treatment for hepatitis C genotypes 2/3 in current injection drug users or receiving opiate substitution therapy. Treatment will be with pegylated interferon alfa 2b (directly observed) and ribavirin for 12 weeks in those that have non-quantifiable (&lt;15 IU/ml detected and &lt;15 IU/ml undetected) HCV RNA or undetectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4 and 24 weeks in those that have quantifiable (â‰¥15 IU/ml) HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA on qualitative assay at week 4.</detailed_description>
