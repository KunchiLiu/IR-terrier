	<brief_summary>The investigators know little about how patients feel following radiosurgery treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Patient satisfaction may ultimately be one of the most important outcome measures for an individual patient; however, this has not been adequately assessed or followed. Multiple questions remain unanswered, including whether there is a correlation between patient satisfaction, the level of their current pain score, and the presence and degree of facial numbness, a possible side effect after radiosurgery. Therefore, the goal of this study is to gather this information from the patients who received radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia at Stanford and evaluate post-treatment patient satisfaction, the degree of facial numbness, and current pain score. This data will help the investigators understand outcomes that are important for patient satisfaction following treatment of a chronic pain syndrome.</brief_summary>
