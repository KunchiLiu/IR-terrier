	<brief_summary>Surgically repair of large abdominal hernias requires prosthetic materials such as mesh-like products. A relatively new synthetic product cPTFE is designed as a cost effective alternative to reduce associated post surgical complications. The study will monitor patients over a one year period.</brief_summary>
