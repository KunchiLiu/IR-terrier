	<brief_title>TODAY2 Phase 1 Immediate Post-Intervention Observational Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) was a multi-center study of the optimal approach to treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in children and adolescents. The TODAY clinical trial of experimental interventions ended in February 2011. It is followed by TODAY2, a longitudinal study to continue the care and observation of the TODAY cohort beyond the end of the TODAY intervention trial. TODAY2 consists of two phases. 1. First is the immediate transition of TODAY participants to non-blinded, non-randomized standard diabetes care and management with monitoring and follow-up for up to 24 months. During this period, the findings of TODAY are analyzed and interpreted by the study group. 2. The second phase is a protocol for long-term longitudinal follow-up of the TODAY cohort, based on findings from TODAY. The primary objective of the first phase of TODAY2 is to continue to follow the TODAY subjects for up to 24 months in order to begin to: - understand the persistence of the effects of the different treatment regimens used in TODAY, - describe the continued evolution of beta cell function, and - describe the development of vascular complications and risk factors for complications.</detailed_description>
