	<brief_summary>Preliminary research suggests that LIM-0705 improves insulin sensitivity with neutral effects on weight in obese and diabetic rodent models. Results from a Phase 1b clinical study, conducted in healthy volunteers, indicate that LIM-0705 and a major metabolite may be potential insulin sensitizers by OGTT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LIM-0705 administered for 28 days in adult males and females with impaired glucose tolerance or abnormal HOMA-IR. Secondary Objectives include: - examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LIM-0705 - explore the pharmacodynamics (PD) of LIM-0705 in obese adult males and females with impaired glucose tolerance (defined as two-hour plasma glucose levels of ≥140 to ≤199 mg per dL [7.8 to 11.06 mmol/L] on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) or abnormal HOMA-IR (HOMA-IR value ≥ 2.5) as measured by change in response to hyperinsulinemic clamp, mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) between Days -2 and 27 - explore the effect of LIM-0705 on fasting lipid, insulin and glucose profiles compared to baseline levels</detailed_description>

The second method of contraception must be the use by their female partners of any of the following: a diaphragm with spermicide, a cervical cap with spermicide, an IUD, a female condom, or an approved hormonally based contraceptive (e.g., an oral, transdermal, or implanted estrogen or progestin). Female subjects must be post menopausal or surgically sterile.
