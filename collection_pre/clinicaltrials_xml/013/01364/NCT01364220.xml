	<brief_summary>It is anticipated that 548 subjects will be recruited from approximately 27 centres in South Korea. This is an investigator-sponsored, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-centre study to assess the effects of rosuvastatin 20 mg compared to placebo in acute ischemic stroke patients, with the first dose within 18 hours after baseline MRI and continued treatment for 14 days. Subjects will be male or female, over 20 years, with diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with baseline MRI, and who are either statin-naïve or untreated with statin for the previous 3 months. The objective would be to compare the recurrence rate of ischemic stroke by comparing the imaging parameters during 14 days of treatment and clinical improvement as defined by percent improvement based on NIHSS scores measurements at baseline, 5 days and 14 days of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Very Early Use of Rosuvastatin in Preventing Recurrence of Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins have action mechanisms that may work nicely in preventing recurrence during acute stage of infarction! First, statins have antithrombotic effects and lower thrombogenicity. Statins prolong time to arterial thrombosis in endothelial injury model, inhibit P-selectin expression and platelet aggregation, reduce platelet PAR-1 thrombin receptor, and reduce tissue factor levels in plasma, its expression on monocyte surface, and atherosclerotic plaques. Second, statins enhance thrombolysis. They reduce PAI-1, increase t-PA activity and reduce fibrinogen level. Combined treatment of statins and t-PA in rats reduces the infarct size and downregulates expression of tissue factor, ICAM-1, vWF, and MMP-9. In addition, t-PA induced toxicity is reversed by statins. Third, statins have anti-inflammatory actions that can stabilize and even regress plaques. Statins reduce the number of T-lymphocytes within plaques, inhibit migration and activation of monocyte/macrophage system, and reduce matrix metalloproteinase activity that play a critical role in plaque rupture. Rosuvastatin 40 mg could regress coronary atheroma burden at 2 years, and reduce progression of carotid intima-media thickness. Benefits of statins in stroke patients are partially proven! First, statins are well known to be effective in primary prevention of stroke. Second, statins were effective in secondary prevention of stroke. A high dose of statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) reduced recurrent stroke in patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke when it was administrated 1-6 months after stroke onset. However, it is uncertain whether statins are effective during the first month after stroke. Third, outcomes are better in patients under statin treatment at the moment of stroke. Patients pretreated with statins showed better survival, less severe neurologic deficits, and improved outcomes when they were treated with thrombolysis. However, it is unknown whether statin treatment in stroke patients is effective when it is administrated during the acute stage. Based on strong supportive evidence in human and experimental animals which support theoretical superiority of rosuvastatin, this study will test a hypothesis that a high dose of rosuvastatin is effective in preventing recurrence during the first month after onset in ischemic stroke patients and should be given to all patients from their onset.</detailed_description>

Presence of highrisk potential cardiac sources of embolism based on the TOAST classification or other determined etiology of stroke at the time of enrollment. 3. Known major hematologic, neoplastic, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine dysfunction which, in the judgment of the Investigator, may affect the subject's ability to complete the study. 4. History of malignancy, except in subjects who have been diseasefree &gt;5 years or whose only malignancy has been basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma. 5. Lifethreatening illness indicating the subject is not expected to survive for at least 2 years. 6. Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome, and/or renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL [177 mmol/L]) at screening. 7.

Unreliability as a study participant based on the Investigator's knowledge of the subject, such as drug or alcohol abuse. 9. Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential who were not protected from pregnancy by an accepted method of contraception, such as the oral contraceptive pill, an intrauterine device or surgical sterilization 10. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as either a resting diastolic blood pressure of &gt;110 mmHg or a resting systolic blood pressure of &gt;185 mmHg recorded at screening despite blood pressure lowering therapy. 11. Clinically significant heart disease which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (or designee), is likely to require coronary bypass surgery, cardiac transplantation, surgical repair and/or replacement during the course of the study. 12. Subjects who have symptoms consistent with moderate or greater severity of] congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV), or whose most recent determination of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is &lt;0.35. 13.
