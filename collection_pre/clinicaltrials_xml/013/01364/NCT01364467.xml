	<brief_summary>This is a 14-day, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, masked clinical trial of oral guaifenesin for the therapy of Chronic Rhinitis in 36 children between the ages of 7 and 18 years. The study investigates the effectiveness of guaifenesin in the relief of nasal symptoms in children with CRS using the sinonasal 5 survey (SN-5) in comparison to nasal airway volume, and biophysical properties of nasal secretion. The investigators hypothesize that Guaifenesin use over a period of 14 days improves subjective nasal complaints in pediatric patients with chronic rhinitis and nasal congestion, as measured by the SN-5 survey compared to use of placebo. There will be an observed improvement in nasal volume and cross-sectional area following use of guaifenesin, and nasal secretions will have more favorable mucociliary and sneeze clearability compared to use of placebo.</brief_summary>
