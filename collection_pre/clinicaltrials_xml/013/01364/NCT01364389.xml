	<brief_summary>The study is a two-week, single-blinded, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group design, with a follow-up period up to a total study duration of 6-month, non-randomized, open-label phase to monitor safety, tolerability and, in responders, flare. It is a multicentric, multinational study. The protocol will seek to enroll a total of 30 patients, who will be randomized to the 3 arms at a ratio of 1:1:1. Patients will have a maximum screening period of 7 days with randomization at D1 for a dosing period of 15 days followed by a follow up-period of 154 days, or 4 months (112 days) after their last biologic dose, whichever is greater, and followed by unblinded re-dosing in the case of a disease flare.</brief_summary>
