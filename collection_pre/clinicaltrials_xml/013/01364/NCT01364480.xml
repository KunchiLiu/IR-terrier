	<brief_title>Microelectrode Brain-Machine Interface for Individuals With Tetraplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with tetraplegia (paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in partial or total loss of use of the arms and legs) have intact brain function but are unable to move due to injury or disease affecting the spinal cord, nerves or muscles. Brain-machine interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural signals are generated even though they are not sent to the arms, hands and legs. By implanting electrodes in the brain, individuals can be trained to send neural signals which are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then be used to control a variety of devices or computer displays.</detailed_description>
