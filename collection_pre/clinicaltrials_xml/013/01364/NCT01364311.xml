	<brief_summary>Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition inducing an inflammatory response on the ocular surface. Common symptoms include ocular discomfort, visual impairment and instability of the tear film with potential damage to the ocular surface. In addition, an intact tear film is important to provide a smooth optical surface, to act as a barrier to pathogens, to nourish the epithelial cells of the ocular surface and to prevent exsiccation. Alterations in the tear film composition, which can have their origin in several conditions, lead to tear film hyperosmolarity or instability resulting in DES. Regardless of the cause of DES, chronic dryness of the ocular surface leads to an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, which is triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This results in cell damage and activation of the immune system, keeping up inflammatory processes . In order to prevent ROS damage, several micronutrients such as vitamin C, E, and certain carotenoids, omega-3 free fatty acids, flavonoids and minerals have been used because of their antioxidant capacities. Based on this knowledge the potential of these antioxidant dietary supplements has been discussed as a treatment option for DES. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that antioxidant supplementations, in particular, supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids may be beneficial for patients with DES. The purpose of the present study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with dietary supplements improves subjective and objective symptoms of DES.</brief_summary>
