	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious complication of COPD which is associated with shorter survival, more frequent exacerbation, and increased use of health resources. There is no effective pharmacological treatment for COPD-associated PH. Therefore, the investigators wanted to evaluate the effect of udenafil, a phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, on exercise capacity of severe COPD patients.</brief_summary>
