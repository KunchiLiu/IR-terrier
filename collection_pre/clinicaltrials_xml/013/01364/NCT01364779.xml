	<brief_title>Prevalence of Aspirin Resistance in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cross-sectional of "aspirin resistance in hemodialysis patients" previously done in our institution showed that 23/66 (34.7%) hemodialysis patients were aspirin resistant. In a recent systematic review, renal impairment was associated with aspirin resistance . This association was seen in only two out of the twenty studies used in this meta-analysis . Both these studies are from the same center with a predominant Asian population. In this study we will try to evaluate the prevalence of aspirin resistance in CKD patient without being limited to a specific ethnicity.</detailed_description>
