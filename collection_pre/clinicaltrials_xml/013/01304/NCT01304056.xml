	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscles seem to be activating differently in critically ill patients than in healthy persons. Needle electrodes would provide artefact-free signal information about muscle activation. However, needle recordings are an invasive technique which limits its feasibility in clinical setting. Intention of this study is to investigate if surface electromyography could be used to measure recruitment patterns of ventilatory muscles.</brief_summary>
