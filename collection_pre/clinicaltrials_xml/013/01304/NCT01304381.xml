	<brief_summary>Patients with severe heart failure have as many symptoms as many patients with cancer but yet do not have equal access to supportive and palliative care. They have an unpredictable course of illness, which makes difficult to judge when the palliative stage has been reached. The Heart failure and Palliative care Programme is a three-year project in Sweden financed by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR). The overall aim is to develop, implement and evaluate a model that integrates cardiac care and palliative advanced home care for patients with severe chronic heart failure. The primary aim is to study the effects on patients' symptom burden, quality of life and activities of daily living. A randomized controlled clinical study is planned. Patients (n=62) with a confirmed diagnosis in accordance with the criteria proposed by the European Society of Cardiology and with NYHA III-IV symptoms and at least one of following criteria will be included; 1. At least one episode of worsening heart failure that resolved with injection / infusion of diuretics or the addition of other heart failure treatment in the last 6 months and regarded optimally treated according to the responsible physician. 2. Need for infusions-treatment. 3. Chronic poor quality of life (VAS &lt; 50) 4. Signs of cardiac cachexia (involuntary non-oedematous weight loss ≥ 6% of total body weight within the last 6-12 months) 5. less than one year life expectancy The participants will be randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention consist of a multidisciplinary approach and collaboration between specialist palliative and heart failure (HF) caregivers, in a shared structured person-centred and identity-promoting care at home during six months. Usual care is performed for the control group.</brief_summary>
