	<brief_summary>The area of the brain responsible of visuospatial processing data and more specifically the orientation of an object or image is located in parietal lobe, especially on the right side. A dysfunction of this region would result in a disorder of recognition of the orientation of objects and images that the investigators call orientation agnosia. Several isolated cases are reported in the literature but to the investigators knowledge deficit has never been systematically searched, or put into perspective compared to other neuropsychological deficits. Moreover, the precise location of the lesion responsible for such a disorder remains uncertain. The objectives of this study are (1) detect the existence of orientation agnosia in case of right parietal lesion, and (2) to improve the understanding of such a deficit allowing better management of this disorder.</brief_summary>
