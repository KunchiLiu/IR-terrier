	<detailed_description>Evaluate adequate mechanical ventilation based on protective ventilation protocols for children available so far. Evaluate and describe the subjects. Evaluate the necessity and outcome of rescue therapies (surfactant, prone position, corticosteroids, alveolar recruitment) Obtain data about ALI/ARDS' etiology, mortality rates and predictive factors related to the outcomes (PICU/ hospital discharge or death)</detailed_description>
