	<brief_summary>Primary objective: â€¢ To demonstrate that administration of V503 induces non-inferior Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) (for serum anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18) compared to GARDASIL. Secondary objectives: - To evaluate the tolerability of V503 in 9-15 year-old girls. - To summarize humoral immune response (anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) induced by V503 or GARDASIL.</brief_summary>
