	<brief_summary>Our objective in this study will be to determine if implementing the glucose/insulin clamp (GICT) on cadaveric organ donors can: - Prevent hyperglycaemia - Drop in the inflammatory cytokine response after brain death after a minimum of 6 hours therapy with the GICT prior to organ procurement. - Assess organ (heart, liver, pancreas and kidney) survival at one year post-transplant - Assess graft function by evaluating: - Liver: post-transplant liver function score (PTLF) - Kidney: graft function as defined by UNOS (immediate graft function IGF, slow graft function SGF and delayed graft function DGF and - Pancreas: 7 day post-transplant insulin requirement, C-peptide and C-RP levels at day one and seven post-transplantation</brief_summary>
