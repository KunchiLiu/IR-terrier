	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Kovacaine Nasal Spray</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of the standard dose of intranasal Kovacaine Mist of 0.6 mL (18 mg tetracaine HCl with 0.3 mg oxymetazoline HCl) and a proposed maximum recommended dental dose of 1.2 mL (36 mg tetracaine HCl with 0.6 mg oxymetazoline HCl). The primary objectives were to determine if either dose significantly changed blood pressure readings (systolic and diastolic), pulse rate, or oxygen saturation levels from baseline pretreatment values and to determine the safety profile of both doses. The secondary objectives were to establish the pharmacokinetics of oxymetazoline, tetracaine, and its major metabolite (parabutylaminobenzoic acid) following the intranasal administration of both doses. Each subject received the standard dose (3 sprays in each nostril with 4 minutes between each pair of sprays) followed 1 to 3 weeks later by the high dose (as 6 sprays in each nostril).</detailed_description>
