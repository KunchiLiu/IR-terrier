	<brief_title>A Trial of Irinotecan and BKM120 in Previously Treated Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved in the last two decades, the overwhelming majority of these patients will still succumb from this disease. It is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. We have witnessed significant leaps in understanding colorectal cancer carcinogenesis as well as in identification of a number of prognostic and predictive factors associated with this malignancy. With the use of combination chemotherapy and the addition of targeted agents, the median survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved from 4-6 months with supportive care to over 2 years. Molecularly directed therapy for cancer holds promise to a more personalized approach to treating cancer. Increase understanding of tumorigenesis has resulted in the identification of promising targets of therapy for more strategic approach to treatment of this malignancy. However, even with the development of molecularly directed treatment, the therapy for advanced colorectal cancer remains to be primarily palliative in nature to majority of patients. There is definite need for a more effective therapy, agents with more acceptable toxicity profiles, and drugs that could be administered without significant demand on time and activity for individual patients receiving these drugs. This is a phase I trial of the combination of irinotecan and BKM120 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have failed on or have become intolerant of at least one line of therapy for advanced colorectal cancer and who are candidates for irinotecan therapy. This study will attempt to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose of the combination of irinotecan and BKM120.</detailed_description>

Patients who have received wide field radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy Women who are pregnant or breast feeding; adults of reproductive potential not using an effective method of birth control.

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 8 days after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective contraception is defined as: true abstinence: Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.
