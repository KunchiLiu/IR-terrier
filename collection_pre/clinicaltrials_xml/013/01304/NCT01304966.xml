Although RRP is rarely fatal, the disease requires prolonged, extensive medical and surgical treatment, and causes physical and emotional suffering in affected children and their families. Although recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a relatively unusual problem, it accounts for significant health are expenditures.The goal of management of RRP is control of the disease, preservation of the voice and prevention of major complication .The purpose of study will identify risk factors for more severe juvenile RRP through prospective evaluation of a pediatric population in Thailand by the employing a protocol that includes staging of disease severity , as well as HPV genotyping. Objective: - To identify the genotypes of HPV isolated from Thai RRP patients - To compare staging and severity with HPV genotypes - To correlate the following characteristics of the Thai RRP patients with the HPV genotypes</detailed_description>
