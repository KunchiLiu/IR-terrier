	<brief_summary>To evaluate whether add-on to prostaglandin therapy with twice a day (bid) dorzolamide is statistically superior to twice a day (bid) timolol with regard to increasing ocular blood flow</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure, Blood Pressure, Ocular Perfusion and Blood Flow Fluctuations in Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotensive treatments for glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), depending on their chemical composition can influence the ocular circulation independent of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. It is therefore important not only to identify ocular blood flow deficits in GON, but also document the influence of GON treatments on the ocular circulation</detailed_description>
