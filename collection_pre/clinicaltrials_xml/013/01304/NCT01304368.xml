	<brief_summary>Chronic neck pain is a common worldwide problem. In the majority of cases, patients are treated by medication, referral to a physiotherapist or thermotherapy. Thermotherapy - the therapeutic application of topical heat - provides an easy to apply self-help strategy in patients with chronic neck pain. However, despite the frequent use in clinical practice, there is no research regarding this topic yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether thermotherapy self-treatment for chronic neck pain induces changes in perceived pain intensity and in sensory processing.</brief_summary>
