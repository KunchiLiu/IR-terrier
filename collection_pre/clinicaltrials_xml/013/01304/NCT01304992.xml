	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of lupin protein drinks (Lupinus angustifolius Boregine) in humans. Parameters concerning cardiovascular risk factors and the metabolism of proteins, lipids and cholesterol will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholesterol-lowering Effects of Lupin Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the preliminary finding that a daily dosage of 35 g lupin protein is capable to affect plasma lipids positively, the physiological effects of two different daily lupin protein dosages will be investigated in two separate study groups (group A: 25 g protein/day; group B: 40 g protein/day). Both study groups undergo double-blinded and controlled study conditions in a cross-over design. In each of the two study groups 35 volunteers with hypercholesterolemia will be allocated to one of two randomization groups: After a 1-week run-in period (baseline), half of the 35 participants of each study group will consume drinks with lupin protein in the respective amount (25 g or 40 g protein/day) over a period of eight weeks, the other half will receive the analogue amount of milk protein as well incorporated in a drink serving as control. After a wash-out period of four weeks, the protein source will be crossed within the two study groups for a second intervention period of eight weeks.</detailed_description>
