	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of the PASCAL laser (PAttern SCAn Laser) for diabetic retinopathy. Patients with proliferative or severe nonproliferative retinopathy will be treated with panretinal photocoagulation utilizing different treatment strategies. The investigators believe that using "lower" laser parameters, the clinical response may be equivalent with less adverse effects.</brief_summary>
