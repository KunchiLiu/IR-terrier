	<brief_title>Study of the Combination of Axitinib Plus Everolimus in Patients With Malignant Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I study of the combination of axitinib (AX) plus everolimus (EV) in patients with malignant advanced solid tumors. - To determine the recommended dose for phase II study of the combination of AX + EV - To determine the safety profile and predictive factors for toxicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy in adult solid tumors. - To assess functional vascular imaging (FVI) as surrogate marker of activity, biomarkers predictive of activity and preliminary efficacy data in metastatic RCC, untreated with antiangiogenics. Phase I, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized, sequential algorithm based dose-finding (3+3), clinical study in successive cohorts of patients. Patients will take both drugs orally, every day, without planned rest period (AX bid and EV once a day). By convention one cycle is 28 days. At the first cycle patients will take one week of AX single agent before starting EV. Patients will be treated at increasing dose levels (DLs) in successive cohorts of 3-6 patients according to the number of patients with dose limiting toxicities (DLT) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; i.e. the DL at which &lt;= 1/6 patient experiences a DLT during the first cycle). All decision concerning qualification for DLT, dose escalation, study termination, inclusion of additional patients, will be taken by a Trial Monitoring Committee.. The MTD will not be higher than the recommended dose of each single agent. Six additional patients will be entered at the MTD to confirm the feasibility of the dose and preliminarily assess the efficacy of the combination in patients with RCC untreated with antiangiogenics. Three levels of dose will be explored.</detailed_description>
