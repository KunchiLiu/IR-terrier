	<brief_summary>Immunosuppression is a key intervention in patients with solid organ transplant and is usually achieved by combination therapy with systemic CsA or tacrolimus with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or corticoids. However, the outcomes after lung transplantation are poor when compared with those after heart, kidney, or liver transplantation, with a survival rate of only 55% for recipients of lung transplants. Additional application of aerosolised L-CsA should suppress T-cell activation in the lung tissue and subsequently BOS development. The overall purpose of this phase-II/III study is to obtain efficacy and safety data of L-CsA in the prevention of BOS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>L-CsA in the Prevention of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) in Lung Transplant (LT) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preventive therapeutic intervention by L-CsA is primarily aimed to suppress T-lymphocyte suppression and inflammatory responses and secondly to prevent fibrotic effects making it more likely to be effective in early stages of BOS. Early development of BOS, which mostly will not be diagnosed, and acute organ rejections are strongly patho-physiological associated. Prevention of the very early development of chronic rejection by L-CsA post LTX may be the ideal starting point for IMP application.</detailed_description>
