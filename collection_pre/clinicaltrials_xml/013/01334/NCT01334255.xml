	<brief_summary>LT1009-Oph-002 is a Phase 1b study designed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of iSONEP following one, two or three injections of iSONEP, as needed, for the treatment of Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED) secondary to PED Secondary to Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) or Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>iSONEP to Treat Persistent Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED) in Subjects With Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) or Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixteen (16) subjects per dose group who have received a minimum of 3 and no more than 7 doses of an anti-VEGF agent (i.e., Lucentis or Avastin), and whose PED has not decreased by greater than 25% in height despite therapy, will be enrolled for a total of 32 subjects. The presence of PED diagnosed by the Investigator will be confirmed by SDOCT, ICG and FA by a digital imaging reading center prior to subject enrollment. The ability of iSONEP to induce regression of persistent PED in subjects with exudative AMD or PCV despite previous treatment with an anti-VEGF agent will be evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females &gt; 50 years of age with a diagnosis of PED secondary to AMD or PCV Serous and/or fibrovascular PED secondary to exudative AMD or secondary to PCV (confirmed by SDOCT, FA and ICG) that has not demonstrated at least a 25% decrease in the height of the PED (from the onset of antiVEGF therapy) following a minimum of 3 doses of an antiVEGF agent (i.e., Lucentis or Avastin) PED that has a height greater than 100 Î¼m Presence of CNV secondary to (i) AMD (based on FA) or (ii) PCV (based on ICG) ETDRS BCVA of 20/32 to 20/320 (letter score of 73 to 25) in the study eye ETDRS visual acuity of 20/400 or better in the fellow eye Subjects previously treated with, or are currently receiving treatment with another investigational agent or device for neovascular AMD in the study eye Subjects who have received &lt; 3 and &gt; 7 antiVEGF treatments in the study eye Subjects with retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP lesion) Lucentis or Avastin within 30 days prior to Day 1 in the study eye</criteria>
