	<brief_summary>There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is the major factor increasing blood pressure (BP). The current salt intake in most countries in the world is 9 to 12 grams per day (g/d), whil the World Health Organization's recommendation is &lt; 5 g/d. The aims of the present study is to determine if the overconsumption of salt influences the bp in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or frequently elevated bp. Each study subject will complete questionnaires, and their usual dietary salt intake is estimated from food composition on 3 completed food diaries. This is also compared with a 24-hour urine sample collection. Based on these results, the study subject receives personal advice to decrease sodium consumption and will change the diet for at least 28 days. During this diet, bp will be measured and food diaries will be completed. After the intervention, a questionnaire and a 24-hour urine sample collection will be collected.</brief_summary>
