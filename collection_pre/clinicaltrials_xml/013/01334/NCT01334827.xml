	<brief_title>A Formative Study to Explore the Sensory Perceptions of Vaginal Product Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success of microbicide products will derive from the synergy of their biological functionality and user acceptability. Biological functionality is the integrated result of safe and effective anti-HIV compounds incorporated into dosage forms or devices that successfully deliver those compounds to target tissues, fluids, and pathogens. Acceptability is a multi-factorial phenomenon that accounts for the personal, dyadic, product-related, and social contexts that potentiate - or not - a woman's decision to use a microbicide. Acceptability (assessed, in part, by the users' sensory perceptions of products during use) depends strongly upon dosage forms and/or delivery systems with biophysical functions and/or mechanical and materials properties that are most conducive to human use. Without both, microbicides' potential to decisively alter the public health impact of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections will be largely limited. The current protocol will specifically study the impact of gel volume on user perceptions, as well as extend user perception scale development to include those properties and product "behaviors" experienced when using a vaginal film.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women who: are between the ages of 18 and 45 report vaginal sex with their male sexual partner in the past 6 months report being in a monogamous sexual relationship with their male partner report consistent use of an effective birth control method: e.g., hormonal contraceptive, IUD, bilateral tubal ligation, Essure® or any nonincisional permanent birth control procedure, hysterectomy (partial or total, with/without oophorectomy), partner's vasectomy/salpingectomy are able to tolerate film use, as measured by pelvic exam at Visit 1B are willing to refrain from any vaginal product use (inclusive of douching) for 48 hours before Visit 1B and until they complete all study activities (except for studyrelated products) are willing to refrain from having vaginal intercourse 24 hours before Visit 1B and Visits 24 are willing to use condoms for vaginalpenile sex between all study visits (Visits 1A 4) are willing to refrain from any nonpenile vaginal penetration during dosage form evaluation visits (Visits 24) are willing to undergo HIV testing and receive test results and counseling. Men who: are at least 18 years of age report vaginal sex with their female sexual partner in the past 6 months report being in a monogamous sexual relationship with their female sexual partner are willing to refrain from having vaginal intercourse 24 hours before Visit 1B and Visits 24 are willing to use condoms for vaginalpenile sex between all of study visits (Visits 1A4) are willing to refrain from any nonpenile vaginal penetration during dosage form evaluation visits (Visits 24) are willing to use a nonlubricated latex condom (provided) for penilevaginal intercourse during dosage form evaluation visits (Visits 24) are willing to undergo HIV testing and receive test results and counseling. Women and men will be ineligible if: they are unable or unwilling to give informed consent their partner is unable or unwilling to give informed consent they are currently enrolled in other vaginal product study/studies they are STI (Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, syphilis), HIV positive upon screening (Visit 1A), or pregnant (females) at any study visit they are breastfeeding, or have completed menopause (i.e., at least 12 months without menstrual periods) (female participants only) they are currently attempting to get pregnant or have an intention to get pregnant during their participation in the study they have clinically significant abnormal pelvic findings and/or findings requiring therapy as a function of clinical exam at Visits 1A and/or 1B (female participants only) they report being within 30 days of their last pregnancy outcome or gynecologic surgical procedure they have known, or suspected, allergies to any component of the study products or similar ingredients in other products they have known, or suspected, allergies to latex they have any condition that, in the opinion of the study clinician or principle investigator, would compromise the participant´s ability to participate in the study</criteria>
