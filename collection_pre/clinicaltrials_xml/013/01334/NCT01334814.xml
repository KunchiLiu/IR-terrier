	<brief_title>Chronic Versus Intermittent Deep Brain Stimulation for Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized, single blind trial of intermittent versus continuous stimulation among essential tremor (ET) patients with a chronic history of continuous stimulation. The trial is 10 weeks in length with clinical evaluations (about 60 minutes) performed on weeks 1, 2, 6, and 10, and phone interviews (about 5 minutes) on weeks 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The study includes outcome measures of tremor, stimulation-induced side effects, sleep quality, and voltage threshold for optimal tremor control and sustained side-effects.</detailed_description>
