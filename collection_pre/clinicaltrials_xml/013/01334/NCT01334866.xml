	<brief_summary>This clinical study has been developed to evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting via Minimally Invasive Coronary Surgery (MICS); a minimally invasive coronary bypass procedure that is done on a beating heart via a smaller chest incision, thus avoiding the invasiveness of the standard procedure.</brief_summary>
