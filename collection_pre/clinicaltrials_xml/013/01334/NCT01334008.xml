	<brief_title>Study of Circulating Tumoral DNA in Metastatic Choroidal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Technique development: In first step, the different available techniques will be evaluated for specificity and sensibility using serial dilutions of cell lines with or without GNAQ mutation. Validation: The tumor DNA detection rate will be estimated from metastatic uveal patient's blood. The investigators will study 40 patients to obtain at least 15 patients bearing a GNAQ mutation in the primitive tumor or in metastasis. With those 15 patients, the investigators will determinate the most sensitive technique and the best cost/efficiency ratio.</detailed_description>
