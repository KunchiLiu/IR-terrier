	<brief_summary>This investigation is a feasibility study conducted in a VA outpatient treatment setting. The study is designed to test the feasibility of implementing a novel way of working with suicidal patients, the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS). The primary purpose of the proposed project is to determine if it is possible to train clinicians working in the Mental Health Clinic at the Denver VA Medical Center (VAMC) to utilize this therapeutic framework. This project is extremely timely in relation to expectations of future increased clinical demands among potentially high-risk Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans who may become suicidal in the years to come.</brief_summary>
