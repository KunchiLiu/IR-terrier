	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to explore the degree to which performance consistency on neuropsychological measures varies in a sample of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with persistent self-reported symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Consistency of Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) Performance in Those With Deployment Acquired Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild TBI outcome studies are traditionally limited to single administration or baseline/post-injury assessment models and they often fail to show enduring deficits among persons complaining of such problems. It may be the case that our standard approach to deficit measurement in mTBI has confounded our ability to elicit the actual impairment. The proposed study could generate an assessment paradigm shift (performance over time) and afford professionals the direction to better assess and ultimately serve persons with mTBI. Additionally, research on the impact of PTSD symptoms on throughput and cognitive performance has been mixed (Bremner et al., 1995; Brenner et al, 2010; Vasterling et al., 1998, 2002, 2006) and the proposed study will yield additional data in that area.</detailed_description>
