	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the BD 4mm x 32G Ultra-Fine Nano pen needle provides equivalent glycemic control to the BD 8mm x 31G Ultra-Fine short pen needle as measured by fructosamine (FRU) among Lantus®, Levemir®, and/or NPH users taking one or more single daily injections of greater than 40 units of insulin. Glycemic control, injection pain, leakage, preference, comfort, and other parameters will be compared between the 4mm x 32G and the 8 mm x 31 G pen needle after three weeks of use of each device. Sufficient numbers of subjects taking Lantus® as their basal insulin will be enrolled so as to allow for pre-specified analysis of this subgroup.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a 4mmx32G Pen Needle for Injection of Basal Insulin Doses Above 40 Units</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized two period crossover study. Each subject's participation is expected to last about seven weeks and includes a brief enrolment period followed by two consecutive three week treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2). In Period 1, subjects will use the first assigned study pen needle (either the 4mm Nano or the 8mm Short) to self-administer daily all their pen-based diabetes medications. Upon completion of Period 1, subjects will switch to the alternate pen needle for Period 2. The randomization schedule will determine the order of pen needle use. Blood samples for determination of fasting blood glucose and serum fructosamine concentrations will be collected at baseline (Visit 2) and the end of Period 1 (Visit 3) and Period 2 (Visit 4). Blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus Have been using a pen device for all diabetes or diabetesrelated medications for at least one month prior to screening Use a pen device to selfadminister greater than 40 units of Lantus, Levemir, and/or NPH in one or more single injections. For split doses, at least one of the injections must deliver more than 40 units. Documented hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from 5.5% to 9.5%, inclusive Self monitor blood glucose at once daily with a memory blood glucose meter, and willing do so at least twice per day for the duration of the study On a stable diabetes regimen (insulin and noninsulin meds, diet and exercise) for at least 1 month prior to screening Able to read, write and follow instructions in English Current administration of insulin with a pump. Current use a syringe to inject insulin or any diabetesrelated medication Participation in clinical study BDDC08011 or DBC10SQUIR05 History of intravenous drug abuse. Current status or history of a medical condition that would contraindicate treatment with study products or other conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at risk or potentially confound interpretation of the study results (i.e., recent history of ketoacidosis, hypoglycemic unawareness, etc).
