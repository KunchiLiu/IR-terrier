	<brief_summary>Project Summary: An electronic personal health record (ePHR) could maximize patient/clinician collaboration and consequently improve patient self-management and related health outcomes. The purpose of the proposed project is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of an ePHR that has been modified using a patient- and family-centered approach and incorporates the experiences, perspectives, and insights of patients and family members actually using the system. Comparison of patients with the ePHR intervention to a group of "care as usual" patients will be performed. The investigators Specific Aims are: (1) To improve the application of patient- and family-centered care elements in an existing ePHR, based on feedback from a pilot study of patients and their families. The modified ePHR will be tested in a pilot group of patients with hypertension and their families. (2) To implement and test the effectiveness of the modified ePHR with patients being treated for hypertension by a team of physicians, mid-level practitioners, nurse clinicians, and support staff in two ambulatory settings. Outcome measures will include patient activation and perception of care, quantifiable biological markers, patient-physician communication, and congruence of treatment with guidelines, particularly medication management; (3) To monitor the shift in provider and support staff awareness and incorporation of patient- and family-centered care as a result of implementation of the ePHR using questionnaires and focus groups. If successful, this ePHR could be implemented in additional locations in the Southeast.</brief_summary>
