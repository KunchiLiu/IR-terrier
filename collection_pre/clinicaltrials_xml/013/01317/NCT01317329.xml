	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that are associated with improved cardiovascular function with the use of CPAP therapy on subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Reversibility of Cardiovascular Injury With CPAP Use: Mechanisms Involved"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will monitor non-invasively changes in arterial stiffness, cardiac mass, pulmonary pressures, endothelial function, etc. We will also assess the reversibility of these changes after only 5-7 days of not using the CPAP mask. In a subgroup of subjects we will explore changes in coronary flow response after 12 weeks of CPAP use compared with baseline.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>subjects na√Øve of CPAP therapy just recently diagnosed with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The degree of OSA is defined by results of a comprehensive polysomnogram requiring an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;15 events/hour and Epworth score &gt;10, or an AHI &gt;20 events/hour either sex any race between 2150 years old. Systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg Changes in antihypertensive medications in the last 6 weeks Restless leg syndrome Average overnight oxygen saturation below 80% Current use of betablockers History of coronary artery disease History of Stroke Atrial fibrillation Peripheral vascular disease Suspected cardiac valve abnormality Ejection fraction &lt;50% Type I and type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Asthma or confirmed Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cigarette smoking in the last 6 months Raynaud's disease Pregnancy (the normal hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy affect greatly arterial stiffness parameters) If a subject becomes pregnant we will discontinue data collection. Physically incapable of resting on left lateral decubitus for 40 minutes. Mastectomy with lymph node removal that might preclude us to monitor blood pressures on both arms</criteria>
