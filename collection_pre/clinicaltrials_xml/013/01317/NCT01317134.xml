	<brief_title>Endothelial Function in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the current study are to identify and evaluate new prognostic non-invasive and serological markers in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The focus will be on L-arginine metabolism and to clarify its influence on endothelial function. The investigators also want to evaluate differences in plasma concentrations of L-arginine/NO metabolites and non-invasively assessed endothelial function based on specific PH-therapy. Furthermore, the investigators aim to transfer the results gained from the investigators study population to in-vitro systems in order to carefully characterize the involved signal transduction pathways. Thereby the investigators hope to identify potentially new therapeutic targets in PH or patient subgroups preferably benefitting from established therapeutic options.</detailed_description>
