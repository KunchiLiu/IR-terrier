	<brief_summary>Chemo-N0 (1993-1998) is the first prospective randomized multicenter trial in N0 BC designed to prospectively evaluate the clinical utility of a biomarker. It used uPA/PAI 1 as stratification criteria and randomized high-risk patients to chemotherapy versus observation; low-risk patients remained without any systemic therapy. The trial was designed to answer two principle questions: 1. Can the reported prognostic impact of uPA and PAI 1 be validated in a prospective multicenter therapy trial? Does low uPA/PAI 1 identify those low-risk N0 patients who are candidates for being spared necessity and burden of adjuvant chemotherapy? 2. Do uPA/PAI 1 high-risk patients benefit from adjuvant CMF chemotherapy?</brief_summary>
