	<brief_title>China Stroke Secondary Prevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CSSPT study is a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled secondary stroke prevention trial in China to determine whether the addition of folic acid and vitamin supplements will reduce recurrent stroke events and other combined incidence of recurrent vascular events and vascular death in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). All patients presenting to one of the participating neurologists or general physicians within one months of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or TIA (eye or brain) are eligible for this trial. Eligible patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive multi-vitamins or placebo. The primary outcome event is the composite event "stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from any vascular cause", whichever occurs first. Our target is to recruit a total of 8,000 patients over the two years with a median follow-up of 3 years. Recruitment to the trial began in July 2011 and is planned to continue until December 2013. The investigators aim to complete final follow-up by the end of 2016.</detailed_description>
