	<brief_summary>Many adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been found to have low bone density by the end of treatment. This can lead to long-term suffering in survivors due to poor bone health. Vitamin D is known to be associated with bone health and previous research has established that Vitamin D insufficiency is very common at diagnosis of ALL and worsens over the course of treatment. Researchers have also learned that a relationship exists between both Vitamin D and fat tissue and ALL and fat tissue. In adolescents being treated for ALL as well as in early survivors, this randomized study will therefore examine the effect of Vitamin D and calcium supplementation on correcting Vitamin D insufficiency and on improving bone density in the context of changes in body composition and body fat. Bone density will be measured by a radiology exam called a quantitative computed tomography (or "qCT") while body composition and body fat will be measured by a different radiology exam called a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (or "DEXA" scan). The study will also examine in depth the relationship between these three elements - Vitamin D insufficiency, obesity, and ALL - and their impact on bone density.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>GROUP A: PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED ALL: Are greater than or equal to 10 years of age and less than or equal to 21 years of age at diagnosis of ALL Have a new diagnosis of untreated ALL classified as "high risk" per NCI criteria (due to being greater than 10 years of age) Are beginning treatment with a Children's Cancer Group/Children's Oncology Group "high risk" protocol with a 4drug induction including steroids Are not pregnant GROUP B: EARLY SURVIVORS OF ALL Were treated for ALL and remain in first complete remission ("CR1") Were equal to or greater than 10 years of age and less than or equal to 21 years of age at diagnosis of ALL Have completed treatment on or as per a Children's Cancer Group/Children's Oncology Group "high risk" protocol between 12 and 48 months prior to enrollment in this study (consisting of a plan for a 4drug induction including steroids in Induction, Delayed Intensification, and steroid pulses in Maintenance. Steroids are allowed to have been discontinued due to toxicity). Are not pregnant GROUP C: SIBLINGS OF GROUP A Are either a fullsibling or a halfsibling of a patient in Group A Are living at the same residence as the sibling/halfsibling from Group A Are greater than or equal to 10 years of age and less than or equal to 21 years of age at the time of study entry, and within 3 years of the age diagnosis of ALL in the sibling/halfsibling from Group A Are on the same Vitamin D supplementation regimen (if any) as the sibling from Group A at the time of his or her diagnosis Exclusion Criteria (ALL GROUPS): Have a diagnosis of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) or any genetic disease associated with abnormal bone development Are undergoing treatment with other medicines that affect bones including chronic use of of steroids, bisphosphonate therapy, or Vitamin D at average dose greater than 400IU/day Have an underlying diseases altering body structure (i.e. missing a limb, severe dysmorphism) or severely affecting mobility (i.e. total or hemiparesis) Have a history of chemotherapy or radiation for other cancers Cannot complete the radiology exams/radiology exams uninterpretable (i.e. people with a hip replacement or prosthesis)</criteria>
