	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamics effects of warfarin 5 mg, in the presence or absence of belinostat 1,000 mg/m². Pharmacokinetic evaluation of belinostat 1,000 mg/m² and metabolites in the presence of warfarin 5 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Belinostat in Combination With Warfarin in Patients With Solid Tumors or Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single center, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. Upon providing informed consent and satisfying screening procedures, eligible subjects will report to the clinic for Part I of the study 14 days before the first dose of belinostat (Day -14) for clinical laboratory tests, warfarin (5mg) single dose and a series PK collections. On days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle patients will receive belinostat 1000mg/m*2 and will have a series of subsequent PK samples collected. On day 3 of cycle 1 only, the patient will also receive warfarin 5mg single dose prior to belinostat infusion. PK samples, urine samples, electrocardiogram (ECG) and safety measurements will be collected from Day 1 through Day 10 of cycle one. If it is in the interest of the patient, belinostat can be continued during Part II- extension phase for 5 additional cycles of belinostat treatment on days 1-5 of each subsequent cycle, or until disease progression, patient withdraws consent or if unacceptable toxicity occurs. During the extension phase routine physical exams, laboratory tests and safety and efficacy assessments will be performed. Disease evaluations will be conducted per standard of care. Patients who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will be followed until new anti-cancer treatment is initiated or death.</detailed_description>
