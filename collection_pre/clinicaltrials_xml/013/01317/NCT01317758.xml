	<brief_summary>Approximately 216, and up to 240, healthy males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, will be enrolled over a 5-month period into this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase I study. Subjects who meet the entry criteria for the study and provide informed consent will be randomized 2:1 between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine and placed into one of 6 groups (see table) to receive two doses of an intramuscular subvirion inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine at 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg given with the adjuvant AS03 or diluent (N=216, up to 240). All eligible subjects will receive 2 doses separated by approximately 21 days.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, Phase I study in healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an intramuscular subvirion inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005) virus vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur administered at different dosage levels (3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg) given with the AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GSK or PBS diluent.</detailed_description>

NonPRN use of systemic, overthecounter medications and PRN systemic, prescription medication may be allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of immunogenicity/reactogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications; vitamins; and contraceptives are also permitted. Received premedication with analgesic or antipyretic agents in the 6 hours prior to first vaccination, or planned medication with analgesic or antipyretic in the week following first vaccination.

Exclusion Criteria for Dose 2: Women who are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed at any given time from the first vaccination until 30 days after the last vaccination. Other than from participation in this study, received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication), since receipt of Dose 1, or expects to receive an experimental agent during the 13month study period. Are participating/have participated, since receipt of Dose 1, or plan to participate in another clinical trial with a licensed product during the 13month study period.

Those patients who have received &gt;/= 613 days of steroids, within the past 21 days will require at least 14 days off of steroids prior to administration of the second dose of vaccine see Section 10.3.3.

Received any live licensed vaccines within 4 weeks or inactivated licensed vaccines within 2 weeks prior to the second vaccination or plan receipt of such vaccines within 21 days following the second vaccination. This is inclusive of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines. Have new diagnosis of chronic medical disease or chronic medical condition since receipt of Dose 1 that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, would render vaccination unsafe, would interfere with the evaluation of responses or is not generally seen in "normal, healthy subjects". Received systemic, prescription medications for the treatment of chronic medical conditions, unless such use is on a PRN (as needed) basis only since receipt of Dose 1. NonPRN use of systemic, overthecounter medications and PRN systemic, prescription medication may be allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of immunogenicity/reactogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications; vitamins; and contraceptives are also permitted. Received premedication with analgesic or antipyretic agents in the 6 hours prior to second vaccination, or planned medication with analgesic or antipyretic in the week following second vaccination. This criterion should not preclude subjects receiving such medication if the need arises. However, premedication is to be discouraged. Hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or confinement for danger to self or others since receipt of Dose 1. New occurrence or new awareness of GuillainBarr√© Syndrome since receipt of Dose 1. Any unresolved or continuing solicited or unsolicited Grade 2 or greater severity adverse events, including reactogenicity events, that have occurred since receipt of Dose 1 without a clear, alternative etiology. Unresolved or continuing Grade 1 adverse events are permissible unless, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, they would render vaccination unsafe, would interfere with the evaluation of responses or are not generally seen in "normal, healthy subjects". Grade 2 or greater severity clinical safety lab values (according to the toxicity table, Section 11.1.1.2) that do not return to Grade 1 or less prior to the second vaccination. If the clinical safety lab values return to Grade 1 or less, vaccination should be rescheduled within the acceptable window for the second vaccination see Section 10.3.3. Subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or above clinical safety laboratory adverse event since receipt of Dose 1 should be excluded from receipt of second vaccination. Subjects who had a Grade 3 or above clinical safety laboratory adverse event prior to first vaccination will be evaluated by the site principal investigator and DMID Medical Monitor to determine receipt of second vaccination. Have an acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F, within 3 days prior to the second vaccination. Vaccination of subjects should be deferred until acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F, has resolved. If resolution occurs, vaccination should be rescheduled within the acceptable window for the second vaccination see Section 10.3.3. Emergence of Grade 2 or greater severity signs or symptoms since receipt of Dose 1 that could confound or confuse assessment of vaccine reactogenicity. Any new clinical findings since receipt of Dose 1, which in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or would interfere with the evaluation of responses or successful completion of the study. Plan to travel outside the U.S. in the time between the second vaccination and 21 days following the second vaccination. Subject refuses further vaccination. Subjects who do not receive the second vaccination will be asked to return for safety assessments and for scheduled venous blood sample collections for clinical safety laboratory and immunogenicity evaluations and will be followed for the duration of the study see the protocolspecific Manual of Procedures (MOP) for further details. Subject withdraws consent. The subject may withdraw their consent for study participation at any time and for any reason, without penalty.</criteria>
