	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine if surgical repair of the distal biceps fully restores the supination strength of the forearm. Secondarily, the investigators want to examine the insertion site location of the tendon and determine if it correlates with the patients' functional outcome as determined by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAPS), and isometric supination torque testing.</brief_summary>
