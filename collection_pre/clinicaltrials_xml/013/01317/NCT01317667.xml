	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase 1, escalating, multiple-dose, single-center study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the RVEc vaccine. The two principal hypotheses to be tested are: RVEc vaccine will display an acceptable safety profile as determined by adverse event data and RVEc vaccine will elicit ELISA immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers greater than or equal to 1:500 and toxin-neutralizing antibody (TNA) anti-ricin toxin-neutralizing antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:50 in vaccine recipients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study subjects must be 1850 years old. Subjects must weigh at least 110 pounds. Subjects must be in good health as judged from medical history, physical examination, EKG and chest xray, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, clinical chemistries, urinalysis, hepatitis serology, and HIV antibody test, and be medically cleared for participation by an investigator. If any HIV or hepatitis testing is positive, the individual will be provided with counseling and referral for health care. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test on vaccination day before each dose and agree to not become pregnant or breastfeed for 3 months after the last dose of the vaccine and be willing to use a reliable form of contraception during the study. Study subjects must read and sign an approved informed consent. Study subjects must be willing to complete a subject diary card after each vaccination. Study subjects must be willing to return for all followup visits. Study subjects must agree to report any adverse event (AE) that may or may not be associated with administration of the investigational product through the 9month followup visit. Study subjects will report all serious adverse events for the duration of the study. Body weight less than 110 pounds. Acute or chronic medical conditions or immunodeficiency from a medical condition or medical treatment, medications, or dietary supplements that, in the investigator's opinion, would impair the subject's ability to respond to vaccination. Severe hypersensitivity to any vaccine (anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, or laryngospasm). History of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other current/residual disease of the lungs. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests. Current smoker. Any known allergies to sodium succinate, Tween20 (a detergent), aluminum hydroxide, or kanamycin. Previously received ricin toxin vaccine or has antibodies to ricin toxin proteins. Receipt of licensed vaccines within 30 days prior to the start of the study or plans to receive other vaccines during the initial 9 months of the study (the only exceptions are the inactivated influenza vaccine that can be received at least 30 days after RVEc Dose 3). Receipt of investigational drug/test product within 30 days prior to entry or within the initial 9 months of the study. Females: Pregnant or breastfeeding. Enrolled in another greater than minimal risk study.</criteria>
