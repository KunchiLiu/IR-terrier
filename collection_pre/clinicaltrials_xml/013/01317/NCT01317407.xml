	<brief_summary>After an operation many patients are in a confused mental status at the intensive care unit. In this status they possibly fall out of their bed or pull out endotracheal tubes or central venous catheters accidentally. For this, they need permanently monitoring and control through intensive care personnel. The goal of the VIPSafe project is to develop robust techniques for automated patient monitoring, that rely on data from a small number of untethered sensors, which are nonetheless flexible enough to cope with a large variety of demands.</brief_summary>
