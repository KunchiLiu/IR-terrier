	<brief_summary>In chronic kidney disease calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) metabolism disorders are very common and also they are one of the leading causes of morbidity in these population. FGF23 is a novel factor that contributes Ca-P disorders. It has been hypothesized that FGF 23 increase is mediated by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The aim of the study is to evaluate this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
