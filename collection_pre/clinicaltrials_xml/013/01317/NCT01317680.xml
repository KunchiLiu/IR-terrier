	<brief_summary>Low intensity shock waves (LISW) have been proven in animal studies to induce local growth of new blood vessels. The investigators hypothesized that LISW therapy could improve the symptoms of patients with erectile dysfunction resulting from a problem of blood supply (damage that can occur after radical prostatectomy in addition to neural damage or solely) that do not respond to oral therapy (PDE-5 inhibitors).</brief_summary>
