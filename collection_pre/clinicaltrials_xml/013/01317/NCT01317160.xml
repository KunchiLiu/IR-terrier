	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study aims to determine whether intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), 75 patients, beneath functional bracing compared to treatment-as-usual in plaster cast, 75 patients, can reduce the Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) incidence and promote healing of sutured acute Achilles tendon ruptures. At two weeks post surgery, the IPC intervention will be ended and both patient groups will be immobilized in an orthosis until follow-up at six weeks. The endpoint of the first part of the study is VTE events. The primary outcome will be the DVT-incidence at two weeks, assessed using screening compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) by two ultrasonographers masked to the treatment allocation. Secondary outcome will be the DVT-incidence at 6 weeks. 1) Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) detected by CDU , 2) isolated calf muscle vein thrombosis (ICMVT) detected by CDU, 3) symptomatic DVT or ICMVT detected by CDU, 4) symptomatic pulmonary embolism detected by computer tomography. The endpoint of the second part of the study is tendon healing quantified at 2 weeks by microdialysis followed by quantification of markers for tendon repair. The endpoint of the third part of the study is the functional outcome of the patients at one year post-operatively using four reliable and valid scores, i.e. the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS), Physical Activity scale (PAS), Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and EuroQol Group's questionnaire (EQ-5D) as well as the validated heel-rise test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compression Treatment Effects on Complications and Healing of Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of DVT after Achilles tendon rupture is as high as 30-40% and patients exhibit a prolonged healing process with variable outcome. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin had no effect on preventing DVT after Achilles tendon surgery. Whether intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) can prevent DVTs and improve healing after Achilles tendon rupture has to our knowledge not been tested before.</detailed_description>
