	<brief_title>Pre-emptive Cycline Treatment on Cetuximab Induced Skin Toxicity in Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab, an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, has shown to improve FOLFIRI efficacy up to 59.3% OR, in wild KRAS patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Skin toxicity occurs in 81.6% of patients as an acne-like skin rash developed on the face and the trunk inducing pain, decreasing quality of life and drug compliance. Over 104 patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial sponsored by Center Paul Papin (NCT 00 559741), a grade &gt; or = 2 cetuximab-acneiform rash occured in 51 patients (49%). In this trial Cetuximab was combined with a FOLFIRI intensified (5-FU intensification based on pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetic studies of UGT1A1 status and DPD). Until now, no pre-emptive skin toxicity treatment with cycline has been demonstrated. Because of cycline's anti inflammatory properties and their use in inflammatory acne, cycline could prevent cetuximab-induced skin rash. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial, Jatoi et al., failed to highlight any cycline effect on 61 patients. On the other hand, the STEPP study (95 pts) showed the impact of cycline to prevent panitumumab related skin toxicities. Our primary objective is to reduce the incidence of grade &gt; or = 2 acne-like skin rash by 30% with a 6 weeks pre-emptive cycline treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing cetuximab therapy.</detailed_description>
