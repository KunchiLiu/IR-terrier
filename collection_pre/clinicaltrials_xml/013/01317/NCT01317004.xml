An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 05.5 inclusive. Must have received continuous treatment with a single approved and indicated MS DMT for a minimum of 6 months prior to the screening visit. Patients must continue with this MS DMT until the randomization visit. Na√Øve to treatment with fingolimod. A manifestation of MS other than those defined in the inclusion criteria. A history of chronic disease of the immune system other than MS or a known immunodeficiency syndrome.
