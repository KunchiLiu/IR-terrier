	<brief_summary>Ten randomly selected patients that have undergone an open proximal biceps tendon tenodesis with an EndoButton for bicipital pathology with Christopher Schmidt, MD, will be asked to participate in the study. The study will assess the tendon healing to bone through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individuals will also be asked to fill a visual analog scale (VAS) pain and disability of the arm shoulder and hand (DASH) assessment tools. The variables for our objective will include age, hand dominance, gender and chronicity of symptoms prior to surgery, and other related surgical procedures.</brief_summary>
