	<brief_summary>- Genomic medicine, using genetic information to improve health outcomes, is heralded as the answer to rising medical costs by focusing on prevention and tailored care. Despite its potential, little investigation has focused on how genomic medicine can be applied in health care. To be effective, it requires new ways to learn, deliver, and communicate medical information. It will also raise new ethical questions. - The overall goal of Guilford Genomic Medicine Initiative (GGMI) is to identify the specific challenges in "re-structuring" an existing medical system to integrate genomic medicine, and create solutions that can be used by other medical systems, such as the extensive military medical care system. To accomplish this goal, GGMI includes the development of a large-scale genomic medicine education initiative targeted at the community, providers, and patients, and a clinical systems model to implement strategies to facilitate the integration of genomic medicine into several pilot practices.</brief_summary>
