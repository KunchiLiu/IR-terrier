	<brief_title>Urine Adiponectin Concentration in Prediction of Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is a severe complication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). CIN is responsible for approximately genic renal insufficiency and is the third cause of hospital-acquired renal failure and the injury of endothelial of renal tubule is responsible for the CIN. However markers reliably identifying CIN in the patients undergoing PCI are rare. Adiponectin is a 30-kDa adipocyte-derived vasoactive peptide closely linked to components of the metabolic syndrome. Recent study demonstrates that the quantification of urinary adiponectin excretion appears to be an independent indicator of vascular damage potentially identifying an increased risk for vascular events. Therefore, the investigators presume that the adiponectin excretion may predict the incidence of the CIN. The present study is to determine the ability of urinary total adiponectin and its isoforms excretion in the prediction of CIN in the patients undergoing PCI.</detailed_description>
