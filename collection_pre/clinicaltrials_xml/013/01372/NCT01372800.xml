	<brief_summary>Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein in human body, and reports have shown that it act as a novel risk factor for brain and heart ischemia injury. This 5 years follow-up study will focus on serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms in Chinese population and its correlation to these diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Adiponectin in Chinese Population and Its Correlation to Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes, anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. Since its 1995 discovery, Ad has garnered considerable attention for its role in diabetic and cardiovascular pathology. Clinical observations have demonstrated the association of hypoadiponectinemia in patients with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. There is growing evidence supporting Ad can act as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injury. This 5 years follow-up study will focus on serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms in Chinese population and its correlation to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.</detailed_description>
