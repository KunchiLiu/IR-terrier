	<detailed_description>The aim was to evaluate the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on pain and area of venous ulcers in patients with venous insufficiency. In a simple-blind controlled clinical study, 20 subjects with venous ulcers with age over 50 years will be divided in two groups:neuromuscular electrical stimulation(n=10) and control group (n=10). Pain (by Visual Analogue Scale) and the ulcer area (by planimetry on graph paper and the software ImageJ Â®) were measured.</detailed_description>
