	<brief_summary>In this study, participants, who are scheduled to have a breast biopsy, will have several extra spot mammogram images taken of the suspicious area. These images will be acquired with varying levels of compression. The images will then be analyzed to determine whether the type of lesion (malignant or benign) can be determined from the image data alone. The biopsy results will be used as a gold standard to determine the true malignancy status</brief_summary>
