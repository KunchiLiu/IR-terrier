	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery is more effective than whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases that have been removed by surgery. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies how well stereotactic radiosurgery works compared to whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases that have been removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery or Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases That Have Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Goals 1. Overall Survival - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases whether there is improved overall survival in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. 2. Neurocognitive Progression - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases whether there is less neurocognitive progression post-randomization in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. Secondary Goals 1. Quality of Life (QOL) - To determine in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved QOL in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. 2. Central Nervous System Failure - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases whether there is equal or longer time to central nervous system (CNS) failure (brain) in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. 3. Functional Independence - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases whether there is longer duration of functional independence in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. 4. Long-Term Neurocognitive Status - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases whether there is better long-term neurocognitive status in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. 5. Adverse Events - To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with the interventions. 6. Local Tumor Bed Recurrence - To evaluate local tumor bed recurrence at 6 months with post-surgical SRS to the surgical bed in comparison to WBRT. 7. Local Recurrence - To evaluate time to local recurrence with post-surgical SRS to the surgical bed in comparison to WBRT. 8. CNS Failure Patterns - To evaluate if there is any difference in CNS failure patterns (local, distant, leptomeningeal) in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age in years (&lt; 60 vs ≥ 60), extracranial disease controlled (≤ 3 months vs &gt; 3 months), number of pre-operative brain metastases (1 vs 2-4), histology (lung vs radioresistant [brain metastases from a sarcoma, melanoma, or renal cell carcinoma histology] vs other), and resection cavity maximal diameter (≤ 3 cm vs &gt; 3 cm). Patient must complete baseline QOL and neurocognitive tests prior to registration/randomization. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) once a day, 5 days a week, for approximately 3 weeks. - Arm II: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a gamma knife or a linear accelerator procedure. Event monitoring occurs up to 5 years post registration/randomization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Preregistration 1. Number of Brain Metastases Four or fewer brain metastases (as defined on the preoperative MRI or CT brain scan) and status post resection of one of the lesions. 2. NonCNS Primary Site Pathology from the resected brain metastasis must be consistent with a noncentral nervous system primary site. Note: Patients with or without active disease outside the nervous system are eligible (including patients with unknown primaries), as long as the pathology from the brain is consistent with a noncentral nervous system primary site. 3. Size of Metastases Any unresected lesions must measure &lt; 3.0 cm in maximal extent on the contrasted MRI or CT brain scan obtained ≤ 35 days prior to preregistration. The unresected lesions will be treated with SRS as outlined in the treatment section of the protocol. Note: The metastases size restriction does not apply to the resected brain metastasis; with resected brain metastases only surgical cavity size determines eligibility. 4. Size of Resection Cavity Resection cavity must measure &lt;5.0 cm in maximal extent on the postoperative MRI or CT brain scan obtained ≤35 days prior to preregistration. Note: It is permissible for the resection of a dominant brain metastasis to include a smaller "satellite" metastasis as long as the single resection cavity is less than the maximum size requirements. 5. Tumor Staging Procedures All standard tumorstaging procedures necessary to define baseline extra cranial disease status completed ≤42 days prior to preregistration. 6. Treatment with Gamma Knife or Radiosurgery Able to be treated with either a gamma knife or a linear acceleratorbased radiosurgery system. 7. Age ≥ 18 years 8. Neurocognitive Testing Willing and able to complete neurocognitive testing without assistance from family and companions. Note: Because neurocognitive testing is one of the primary goals of this study, patients must be able to utilize English language booklets (and/or French booklets if enrolled in Canada). 9. Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaires Willing and able to complete QOL by themselves or with assistance 10. ECOG Performance Status ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0, 1, or 2. 11. SRS Credentialed by IROC Houston Quality Assurance The site's SRS facility is IROC Houston Quality Assurance approved. 12. Neurocognitive Testing Credentialing The site study team member performing neurocognitive testing of patients must have credentialing confirming completion of the neurocognitive testing training of the protocol. 13. Written Informed Consent Provide written informed consent 14. Mandatory Samples for Correlative Tests Willing to provide mandatory blood and urine samples for correlative research purposes. Preregistration 1. Pregnancy, Nursing and Contraception pregnant women, nursing women and men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception throughout the study and for men for up to 3 months after completing treatment. 2. Prior Cranial Radiation Therapy 3. MRI or CT Scans Inability to complete a MRI or CT scan with contrast of the head. 4. Gadolinium Allergy Known allergy to gadolinium. 5. Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Planned cytotoxic chemotherapy during the SRS or WBRT. 6. Other Tumor Types Primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma 7. Leptomeningeal Metastasis Widespread definitive leptomeningeal metastasis 8. Location of Brain Metastasis A brain metastasis that is located ≤ 5 mm of the optic chiasm or within the brainstem. Randomization 1. Number of Unresected Lesions Postoperative MRI or CT scan confirmed zero, one, two or three unresected lesions. 1.1 Each unresected lesion must measure ≤ 3.0 cm in maximal extent on the contrasted postoperative MRI or CT brain scan. 1.2 Note: The preregistration, postoperative, brain scan may be used for the randomization scan if obtained ≤ 28 days prior to randomization. 1.3 Note: If there are no unresected brain metastases (i.e., all brain metastases have been resected), a postoperative CT brain scan may be used if obtained ≤ 28 days prior to randomization. 2. Size of Resection Cavity Postoperative MRI or CT scan confirms resection cavity measures &lt; 5.0 cm in maximal extent. 2.1 Note: The preregistration, postoperative brain scan may be used for the randomization scan if obtained ≤ 28 days prior to randomization. 2.2 Note: If there are no unresected brain metastases (i.e., all brain metastases have been resected), a postoperative CT brain scan may be used if obtained ≤28 days prior to randomization. 3. Urine or Serum Pregnancy Test Negative urine or serum pregnancy test done ≤ 7 days prior to randomization, for women of child bearing potential only. Randomization none</criteria>
