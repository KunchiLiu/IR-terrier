	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of hydroxyzine in the treatment of meal-related anxiety in adolescents and young adults 8 to 25 years of age diagnosed with an eating disorder who are underweight. The investigators want to find out if hydroxyzine given before meals will improve meal-related anxiety compared to no hydroxyzine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Hydroxyzine Decrease Anxiety in Underweight Patients Diagnosed With an Eating Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a practiced-based pilot study in follow-up to clinical observations made by our treatment team that hydroxyzine attenuates meal-related anxiety and improves treatment adherence in patients with a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) (excluding the amenorrhea criterion) or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) specifically with low BMI (≤ 18). To our knowledge, hydroxyzine has never been formally investigated in treating meal-related anxiety and improving outcomes in patients with AN or EDNOS specifically with low BMI (≤ 18).</detailed_description>
