	<brief_summary>This is the first clinical trial with NOX-H94. The purpose of this clinical trial is to identify a safe and efficacious treatment regimen for the clinical development of NOX-H94 in patients with anemia of chronic disease (inflammation).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-in-human Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of NOX-H94</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NOX H94 is a pegylated Spiegelmer that specifically binds to human hepcidin, thereby antagonizing its role in hemostasis, and is therefore indicated for use in anemia of inflammation. Human hepcidin has emerged as the central regulatory molecule of systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is regulated by multiple, in particular opposing signals, including systemic iron availability, hepatic iron stores, erythropoietic activity, hypoxia, and inflammatory states. These different signals are integrated transcriptionally. In chronic inflammation, such as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease or cancer, elevated hepcidin levels have been measured and may be a key factor leading to anemia in these patients. NOX-H94 is therefore indicated for treatment of patients with an anemia of inflammation, which is characterized by increased intracellular iron stores, increased serum ferritin concentrations and reduced sensitivity to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), due to the limited availability of serum iron. Antagonism of hepcidin by NOX-H94 therefore leads to elevated levels of iron and transferrin saturation in the peripheral blood and could supply iron for erythropoiesis thereby correcting the anemia.</detailed_description>
