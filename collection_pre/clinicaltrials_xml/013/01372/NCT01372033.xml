	<brief_summary>The specific aims of this project are: 1. To conduct a randomized block experiment to test the effectiveness of different models of the seamless supervision/treatment system and traditional criminal justice supervision on reducing recidivism and drug use, and improving social adjustment among offenders; 2. To understand the differential impacts based on offender risk factors (e.g., propensity to engage in further criminal behavior) on criminal justice outcomes and to determine whether differences found between seamless and traditional system participants are moderated by offender risk level; 3. To understand differential treatment and social adjustment outcomes (e.g., treatment progress, employment status) of different types of offenders participating in various treatment services; and 4. To examine levels of systems and service integration between the supervision and treatment systems pre- and post-intervention and to measure the impact of integration on outcomes over time.</brief_summary>
