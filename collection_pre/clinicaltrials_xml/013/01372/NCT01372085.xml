	<brief_summary>This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, two-part study in healthy subjects. Part A will be a single dose, single period, placebo-controlled pilot study to explore the safety, tolerability, absorption and pharmacodynamic (effect of drug on a biological marker-pS6 levels in skin biopsies) of a single dose of 25 mg LY2584702 Reference formulation (RF). Part B is a single dose, placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover study to primarily evaluate the absorption of the Test Formulation (TF) in comparison with the (RF) of LY2584702.</brief_summary>
