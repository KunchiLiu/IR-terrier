	<brief_title>Oat Breakfast Satiety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to test the hypothesis that on an equivalent calorie basis, oat based breakfast cereals do not provide the same satiety benefit. The study will also demonstrate the satiety comparison of the cereals related to product density. Ninety-six healthy men and women 18 years of age or older will be enrolled into this study and divided into 2 groups of 48 each to investigate the satiety impact of two oat based breakfast cereals compared to the leading ready-to-eat (RTE) oat based breakfast cereal. Each subject will participate in two test sessions (1 test cereal vs the leading RTE cereal). Subjects will come to the Ingestive Behavior Laboratory between 8 and 10 am after having nothing to eat for 10 hours prior to the scheduled visit time and be given one of the three cereals. The second session will be scheduled at least 1 week after the first. Visual analogue scales of hunger, satiety and subjective energy will be completed at baseline, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Subjects will return on another day separated by at least a week to repeat the breakfast. Area under the curves of appetite and satiety will be compared with a mixed model.</detailed_description>
