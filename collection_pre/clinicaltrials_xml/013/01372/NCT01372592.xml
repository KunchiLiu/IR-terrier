	<brief_summary>The Spine TRACK Spinal Surgery Registry is a prospective multi-center observational data collection initiative, to capture clinical and radiographic outcomes in candidates for spine surgery with degenerative, deformity, and traumatic pathologies. As an observational database, there are no initial driving hypotheses, but rather data will be mined to answer unforeseen questions, but which may include broad topics such as comparative effectiveness between and among various surgical treatment options, and/or outcomes in various subgroups of patients such as defined by demographics, comorbidities, indications and symptoms, treatment variables, and/or outcome variables.</brief_summary>
