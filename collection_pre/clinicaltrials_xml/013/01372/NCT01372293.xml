	<brief_summary>An association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter gene that codify for 17b-HSD5 enzyme (71A&gt;G) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hyperandrogenemia has been suggested in previous studies. Given the role of 17b-HSD5 in androgenic metabolism producing testosterone from precursors, the investigators hypothesis is that women with PCOS and with the variant allele G have a poor response on hirsutism and on hormonal and metabolic variables after oral contraceptive pill (OCP) treatment for 6 months.</brief_summary>
