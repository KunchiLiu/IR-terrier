	<detailed_description>Ischemic/reperfusion injury in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with increased inflammatory cytokines that including TNF-alpha that can exert deleterious effects and therefore contribute to cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Several studies on rodents have reported administration of sTNFR-Fc, a scavenger of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha at the time of reperfusion would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury. Also reports had shown that serum TNF-alpha concentration is negatively correlated with a cardioprotective cytokine adiponectin. Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes. The major intracellular pathway activated by Ad includes phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is responsible for many of Ad's metabolic regulatory, anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the administration of Etanercept, an FDA approved rheumatoid arthritis treating sTNFR-Fc, at the reperfusion time would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury on patient, and effect serum adiponectin level.</detailed_description>
