	<brief_title>Evaluation of Capsule Endoscopy With PillCam® COLON 2 in Visualization of the Colon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PillCam Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule as demonstrated by the identification of subjects with polyps, compared to optical colonoscopy. 884 subjects participated in this study. All subjects that were enrolled in this study were indicated and scheduled to undergo colonoscopy based on their age and demographics for screening for polyps. Each subject was required to follow a bowel preparation regimen and to undergo capsule endoscopy (CE) followed by optical colonoscopy (OC). The optical colonoscopy procedure was scheduled 4-6 weeks after CE procedure to allow for the central readers reading of the PillCam RAPID video. The colonoscopist was kept blinded to the CE results</detailed_description>
