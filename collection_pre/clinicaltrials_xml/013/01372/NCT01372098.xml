	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) intervention in the context of Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) program improves women's quality of life and reduces violence relative to the NFP alone using a cluster randomized controlled trial. Our hypothesis is that an IPV intervention can be designed that is acceptable to participants in the NFP, feasible to implement, and that this intervention will improve quality of life for women and reduce exposure to violence.</brief_summary>
