	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2 Study of Paclitaxel with Cisplatin versus Fluoropyrimidine with a Platinum Agent for Neoadjuvant Therapy in Operable Esophageal Cancer Based on CHFR Methylation Status in Diagnostic Biopsies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHFR Methylation Status Esophageal Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives • To determine the rate of pathological complete response when the inclusion of paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy is based on the presence or absence of CHFR methylation in diagnostic biopsy specimens. Secondary Objectives - To determine the survival outcome with this treatment strategy. - To determine time to disease progression with this treatment strategy. - To determine the agreement between tumor CHFR methylation and detection in plasma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or GE junction 2. Patient must be untreated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for this diagnosis of esophageal cancer. (Endoscopy with biopsy and dilation is permitted.) 3. Tumor must be located between 20 cm from the teeth endoscopically and 2 cm into the gastric cardia. Cervical esophageal cancers and true gastric cancers are excluded. 4. Stage T23/N03/M0 as determined by imaging studies and biopsy where appropriate. T4 disease is permitted if defined as resectable by the thoracic surgeon (involvement of the pleura, pericardium or diaphragm). 5. Patients must have had an endoscopic ultrasound 6. Patients must have had a staging PET scan 7. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 8. ECOG performance status 01. 9. Surgically resectable tumor 10. Patients with a history of a curatively treated malignancy must be diseasefree and have a survival prognosis that exceeds three years. 11. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN creatinine &lt; 1.5 X institutional ULN 12. Female patients must not be pregnant or breast feeding. Radiotherapy is associated with significant birth defects and/or nonviable fetus. Paclitaxel, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and 5fluorouracil have teratogenic potential. A negative pregnancy test is required within 14 days of treatment for all women of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately. 13. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Patients may not be receiving any investigational agents. 2. Incomplete healing from previous major surgery. 3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents they are assigned to. 4. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, phenobarbital, or St John's Wort; these drugs induce CYP3A and may decrease levels paclitaxel. 5FU is a strong CYP2C9 inducer, and concomitant use with carvedilol, celecoxib, fosphenytoin, fluoxetine, phenytoin, warfarin and other CYP2C9 substrates should be used with caution. 5. Uncontrolled, intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 6. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. 7. Patients from whom biopsy tissue cannot be obtained for correlate study analysis.</criteria>
