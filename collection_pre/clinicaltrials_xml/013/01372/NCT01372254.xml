	<brief_summary>The objective of the proposed project is to develop a novel, behavioral approach to smoking cessation that can be integrated with residential drug use treatment for low income substance using smokers with elevated depressive symptoms. The approach utilizes behavioral activation strategies which have been shown to reduce smoking among community samples and which can be easily targeted for the particular needs of low income substance users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Intervention for Low Income Depressed Smokers in Drug Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will take place in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators will utilize pilot testing with 10 participants (two groups of 5 individuals) to integrate two existing behavioral activation manuals to develop the Behavioral Activation for Drug Abusing Smokers (BA-DAS). In Phase II, the investigators will randomize 80 patients to either: 1) standard smoking cessation treatment (ST) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or 2) BA-DAS (which includes ST and NRT). Based on the outcome of this preliminary trial, the BA-DAS protocol will be further refined and readied for larger-scale clinical trials to develop a comprehensive approach to treating smoking among low income, largely minority, depressed smokers in residential drug use treatment, which may be instrumental in reducing smoking among this especially at risk group.</detailed_description>
