	<brief_summary>An increasing number of patients survive critical illness and intensive care, but describe having impaired physical function several years after discharge as a consequence of extensive loss of muscle mass. Reasons for loss of muscle mass and physical function are multiple, but insufficient nutrition is likely to contribute. This randomised trial will investigate the effect of an optimised nutrition therapy during intensive care, on short term clinical outcome and physical quality of life. We hypothesise, that early nutritional therapy, directed towards patient-specific goals for energy and protein requirements, will improve both short- and long-term outcomes.</brief_summary>
