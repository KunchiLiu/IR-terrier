	<brief_summary>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the most frequent complications of pregnancy, being a serious health problem around the world. Previous studies have suggested that there is an association between a short period of exposure to paternal sperm of a new sexual partner and the development of an immunological reaction that could trigger a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. For this reason we want to study the relationship between the primipaternity concept (exposure to male antigens present in semen over a short period of time previous to the pregnancy) and the development of preeclampsia in adolescents.</brief_summary>
