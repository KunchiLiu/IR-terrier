	<brief_summary>PURPOSE The goal of the present project is to unravel the importance of bile acid-induced GLP-1 secretion (via the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5) in human physiology. In the present study the investigators examine the GLP-1 secretion in healthy subjects and in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. The investigators hypothesize that patients with T2DM of relatively long duration will be characterized by reduced gall bladder emptying, and, consequently, reduced intestinal TGR5 activation; resulting in attenuated postprandial GLP-1 responses (primary endpoint).</brief_summary>
