	<brief_summary>It is crucial to rapidly identify cardiac ischemia in the care of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Cardiac troponins are a major factor in the diagnostic of myocardial infarction. New methods have been developed to improve the accuracy of the assay and determine low troponin concentrations. Elecsys® (highly sensible T troponin) TnT-HS assay is supposed to help early detection of myocardial infarction after onset of symptoms. It should therefore shorten the transit time to emergencies by a more rapid intervention or a faster return home. The aim of the study is to compare TnT-HS assay to the standard troponin assay in the detection of early cardiac ischemia in patients with ACS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with suspected ACS with 2/2 negative results of conventional troponin I assay and 1/3 positive result of highly sensitive troponin assay will have a non invasive cardiac Rb82 PET/CT performed within 24 hours of admission. This exam is recognized by Associations of cardiology for its high sensibility and specificity in coronary disease detection.</detailed_description>
