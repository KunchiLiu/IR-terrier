No history or presence of diseases of the kidneys, heart, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract or endocrine organs, or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. No history of clinically relevant allergies. Obtained, signed and dated informed consent. Ability and willingness to comply with protocol requirements.

History of thrombosis. Chronic infection or acute significant infection or fever within the last 5 weeks prior to the start of test substance administration. Subjects with any abnormality of the spleen (confirmed by echography) or history of splenic disease, or subjects that underwent splenectomy in the past. Blood donation (&gt;500 ml) or a comparable blood loss within three months prior to the start of drug administration. Subjects who, in the investigator's opinion, may not be capable of following the study schedule for any reason, with special emphasis on eligibility for the aphaeresis procedure. Participation in an investigational drug study within 60 days prior to drug administration, or within less than 6 times the terminal elimination halflife of the test substance used in the respective trial (whichever is longer).
