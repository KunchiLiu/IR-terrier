	<brief_summary>The CPASMA trial is a descriptive, prospective, multicentre clinical trial, with a before/after Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assessment in participating patients. It aims to answer the following question: Is there an improvement in asthma in those patients with both asthma and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) treated with CPAP after six months?. It is hypothesized that treatment of OSAS with CPAP in patients with both OSAS and asthma concommitantly, may have a beneficial effect also on asthma outcomes. This clinical effect in asthma could be assessed objectively by applying validated questionnaires for quality of life and asthma control.</brief_summary>
