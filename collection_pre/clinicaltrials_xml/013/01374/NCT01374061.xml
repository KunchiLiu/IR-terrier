	<detailed_description>Introduction: In France, patients in critical status brought to hospital by emergency physicians and nurses experimented in tracheal intubation. It is an invasive act allowing a protection of airways and an optimal oxygenation of the patients in distress. The reference technique is the direct laryngoscopy by Macintosh . Corresponding data shows that a video laryngoscope - GLIDESCOPE laryngoscope - improve the conditions of intubation in the surgical unit thanks to a better display(visualization) of the opening. A derived device for pre hospital emergency units (GLIDESCOPE RangerÂ®) deserves to be compared with the classic laryngoscopy in emergency conditions. Objectives: compare the emergency intubation in Pre hospital meadow by Glide Scope Ranger with regard to the classic method Progress of the study: the patients will be included by emergency physicians working in out of hospital teams of 3 major hospitals of Paris. The patients will be randomized in 2 groups: 1 group classic laryngoscopy (group 1) and a group Glide scope Ranger (group 2). The score IDS will be compared for every group as well as the arisen of a complication during the procedure. The consent will be collected on the place or during the hospitalization.</detailed_description>
