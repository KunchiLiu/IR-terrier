	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if engraftment can be achieved safely in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies who undergo non-myeloablative transplant with peripheral stem cells from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haploidentical donors with pre and post-transplant cyclophosphamide as immunosuppression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Using Related, HLA-Haploidentical Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is important to extend the option of nonmyeloablative, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for potential therapy of hematologic malignancies to patients who do not have an HLA-matched donor. Almost all patients would have a related donor identical for one HLA haplotype (haploidentical) and mismatched at HLA-A, B or DR of the unshared haplotype. Thus far, nonmyeloablative HSCT from HLA-mismatched donors has been associated with a high rate of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In this protocol, we will use a combination of immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide administered before and after HSCT to facilitate engraftment and to delete highly alloreactive T-cell clones presumably involved in GVHD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ≤70 years old Eligible diagnoses: CML in AP AML with highrisk cytogenetics [del(5q)/5, del(7q)/7, abnormal 3q, 9q, 11q, 20q, 21q, 17p, t(6:9), t(9;22), complex karyotypes (≥3 abnormalities)] in CR1 AML ≥ CR2; patients should have &lt;5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant Highrisk ALL defined as: CR1 with highrisk cytogenetics t(9;22), t(8;14), t(4;11), t(1;19) for adult patients &gt;4 wk to achieve CR1 ≥ CR2 Patients should have &lt;5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant MDS (&gt;int1 per IPSS) after ≥ 1 prior cycle of induction chemotherapy; should have&lt;5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant MM Stage II or III patients who have progressed after an initial response to chemotherapy or autologous HSCT or MM patients with refractory disease who may benefit from tandem autologousnonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant CLL, NHL or HD who are ineligible for autologous HSCT or who have resistant/refractory disease and who may benefit from tandem autologous nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant. Patients who have received a prior allogeneic HSCT and who have either rejected their grafts or who have become tolerant of their grafts with no active GvHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy could be enrolled Patients with suitably matched related or unrelated donors Patients with conventional transplant options (a conventional transplant should be the priority for eligible patients ≤ 50 yr of age who have a related donor mismatched for a single HLAA, B or DRB1 antigen) CNS involvement with disease refractory to intrathecal chemotherapy Presence of active, serious infection (e.g., mucormycosis, uncontrolled aspergillosis, tuberculosis) Karnofsky Performance Status &lt; 60% for adult patients (Appendix A) Patients with the following organ dysfunction: Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35% DLCO &lt;35% and/or receiving supplemental continuous oxygen Liver abnormalities: fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction as evidenced by prolongation of the prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bacterial or fungal liver abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral hepatitis with total serum bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL or symptomatic biliary disease. HIVpositive patients Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant (βHCG+) or breast feeding Fertile men and women unwilling to use contraceptives during and for 12 months post transplant Life expectancy severely limited by diseases other than malignancy Patients on any other investigational drug at time of enrolment</criteria>
