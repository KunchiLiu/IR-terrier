	<brief_title>Community-based Program to Treat Childhood Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive community based program on reducing excess weight. Overweight and obese study participants will be grouped with peers of similar ages and their parent/guardians. The participants will be divided into 2 groups, child (6-12 yrs. old) and teens (13-17 yrs. old) and will be accompanied by their parent/guardian. 150 participants will be recruited for this study. This 6-month program (12 in-person group workshop sessions and 12 at-home sessions) takes the best components of current evidence for individual treatment and places them in a comprehensive community based program. These include: - Parental involvement - Reduction in consumption of sugar sweetened beverages - Reduction of screen time - Self-monitoring - Physical activity - Stimulus control</detailed_description>
