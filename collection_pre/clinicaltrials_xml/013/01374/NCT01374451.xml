	<brief_summary>This study will estimate the treatment effect of everolimus in combination with pasireotide LAR relative to everolimus alone on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced progressive PNET. A planned primary analysis was completed with data cut of 02-Apr-2014. The study did not meet its primary objective, which was based on progression-free survival (PFS) as per local radiology assessment and was prematurely terminated with the last patient last visit on 19-Feb-2015. However, it is important to note that the data did not reveal any new safety concerns. It was decided to stop the study and this decision was shared with the study sites on 31-Jul-2014.</brief_summary>
