	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common scenario in intensive care unit. Discussions about it is exponentially growing up due its high mortality rates all over the world and low quality of life among survivors. Mechanical ventilation is recognized to play an important role in treatment of patients with ARDS. However, mechanical ventilation itself has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury if inadequate strategies are chosen. Several studies compared different mechanical ventilation strategies in ARDS but the results remain uncertain regarding their influence on survival in patients with ARDS. Thus, this is a multicentric randomized controlled trial, with allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis to investigate if maximum alveolar recruitment maneuver in association to Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrated by static compliance of respiratory system (ART strategy) is able to increase 28 days survival in patients with ARDS compared to conventional strategy proposed by the ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSNet strategy). Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical ventilation with diagnosis of ARDS less than 72hours. Patients will be excluded if they are less than 18 years old, in use of vasopressors drugs in increasing doses over the last 2 hours or mean arterial blood pressure less than 65mmHg, presence of any contraindication to hypercapnia, undrained pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema and lack of consent from patient's surrogate to participation. Patients included will be randomized to receive ART strategy or ARDSNet strategy and will be followed until hospital discharge, 28 days and 6 months.</brief_summary>
