	<brief_title>Assessment and Prevention of Acute Post-herniotomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent post-herniotomy pain (PPP) affects everyday activities in 5-10% of patients. Even brief intervals of acute pain can induce long-term neuronal remodeling and sensitization, chronic pain and lasting psychological distress. Chronic pain may be caused by intense acute PPP, intraoperative nerve injury and/or ongoing inflammation or mesh response with subsequence damage to nerve structures. The aim of our study is to analyze analgesic efficacy, safety and prevention of persistent postsurgical pain of two different pharmacological strategies.</detailed_description>
