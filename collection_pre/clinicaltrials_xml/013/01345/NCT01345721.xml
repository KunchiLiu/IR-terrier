	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of bactericidal antibodies in children of approximately 22 to 45 months of age previously enrolled in the V59P22 study who received Novartis MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine or Meningococcal C Conjugate Vaccine. This is measured by percentage of subjects with human Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) titers ≥ 1:8 directed against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. In addition the response one month post an additional dose of Novartis MenACWY will be measured by percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 and GMTs.</brief_summary>
