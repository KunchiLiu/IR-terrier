	<criteria>Documented evidence of multiple myeloma (per local assessment; see section 7.2): Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow greater than or equal to 10% and/or presence of a biopsyproven plasmacytoma, and Monoclonal protein present in the serum and/or urine Radiographic (Xray, or computer tomography [CT]) evidence of at least 1 lytic bone lesion (or at least 1 focal lesion per magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) Plan to receive or is receiving primary frontline antimyeloma therapies Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Age ≥ 18 years Adequate organ function, as defined by the following criteria (per central or local laboratory values; see section 7.2): Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)/ Serum alanine aminotransferase ≤ (ALT) 2.0 x ULN/ Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN/ Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min/ Serum calcium or albuminadjusted serum calcium 2.0 mmol/L (8.0 mg/dL) and 2.9 mmol/L (11.5 mg/dL) Written informed consent before any studyspecific procedure is performed Nonsecretory multiple myeloma based upon standard Mcomponent criteria (ie, measurable serum/urine Mcomponent) unless the baseline serum free light chain level is elevated POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) Plasma cell leukemia More than 30 days of previous treatment (before screening) with antimyeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy or a single short course of steroid [ie, less than or equal to the equivalent of dexamethasone 60 mg/day for 4 days]). Planned radiation therapy or surgery to the bone (does not include procedures performed before randomization) Prior administration of denosumab Use of oral bisphosphonates with a cumulative exposure of more than 1 year More than 1 previous dose of IV bisphosphonate administration Prior history or current evidence of osteonecrosis/osteomyelitis of the jaw Active dental or jaw condition which requires oral surgery, including tooth extraction Nonhealed dental/oral surgery, including tooth extraction Planned invasive dental procedures Evidence of any of the following conditions per subject selfreport or medical chart review: Any prior invasive malignancy within 5 years before randomization/ Any noninvasive malignancy not treated with curative intent or with knownactive disease within 5 years before randomization/ Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 4 weeks before randomization/ Active infection with Hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C virus/ Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Active infection requiring IV antiinfective therapy Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant within 5 months after end of treatment Female subject of child bearing potential is not willing to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 5 months after the end of treatment (see section 6.3) Known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during the study (eg, mammalian derived products, calcium or vitamin D) Subject is receiving or is less than 30 days since ending other experimental device or drug (no marketing authorization for any indication) Subject will not be available for followup assessment Any major medical or psychiatric disorder that in the opinion of the investigator, might prevent the subject from completing the study or interfere with the interpretation of the study results</criteria>
