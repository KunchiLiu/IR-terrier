	<brief_summary>This study design has two components: 1) a cross sectional assessment of brain connectivity and response to pain in healthy controls and demographically matched fibromyalgia patients, and 2) a longitudinal assessment of the same outcomes in fibromyalgia patients randomized to either CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or a Disease Education condition. The investigators will evaluate 90 fibromyalgia patients who will receive CBT treatment once a week for 8 weeks, for a total of 8 treatments. Baseline data from these patients will be compared to results from 30 pain-free controls and 60 education program controls. Participants will undergo experimental pain assessments as well as brain neuroimaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroimaging Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose to use fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to study CNS pain processing during the anticipation and experience of acute pain in individuals with FM and healthy controls. Investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with FM as well as healthy controls. After the baseline visit, FM participants will be randomly assigned into the CBT or control condition (Education). Overall, FM Participants will attend 8 treatment visits, and 6 assessment visits (two at baseline, one at mid-treatment, two at the end of treatment, and one at 6 months post-treatment). These assessment visits include a total of 3 fMRI sessions (at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment). Healthy Controls will undergo the same baseline procedures as the FM subjects but will not attend any of the treatment or follow up assessment visits. Findings from this research will provide important information about catastrophizing's CNS (Central Nervous System) correlates.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for FM patients: 1. aged 1865 2. female 3. have a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia and meet the Wolfe et al 2011 research criteria for fibromyalgia 4. on stable doses of medication prior to entering the study and agree not to change medications or dosages (or CAM treatments) during the trial 5. righthanded 6. baseline pain intensity of at least 4/10 on average and pain report for at least 50% of days 7. able to provide written consent. Exclusion Criteria for FM: 1. comorbid acute pain condition 2. comorbid chronic pain condition that is rated by the subject as more painful than fibromyalgia 3. current use of opioid analgesics or stimulant medications or the fatigue associated with sleep apnea or shift work (e.g., modafinil) 4. Routine or daily use of narcotics, marijuana or substances of abuse 5. Certain condition that intervene with Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and/or fMRI procedures (e.g., Peripheral neuropathy, implanted ferrous metal, claustrophobia etc) or/and any impairment, activity or situation that could prevent satisfactory completion of the study protocol (e.g unreliable, or inconsistent pain scores). Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Control Participants 1. aged 1865 2. female 3. righthanded 4. able to provide written consent Exclusion criteria for Healthy Control Participants: 1. any acute or chronic pain condition (e.g., FM, arthritis) 2. current use of opioid analgesics or stimulant medications or the fatigue associated with sleep apnea or shift work (e.g., modafinil) 3. Routine or daily use of narcotics, marijuana or substances of abuse 4. Certain condition that intervene with Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and fMRI procedures (e.g., Peripheral neuropathy, implanted ferrous metal, claustrophobia etc) or any impairment, activity or situation would prevent satisfactory completion of the study protocol (e.g unreliable, or inconsistent pain scores). This includes unreliable, or inconsistent pain scores as deemed by the principal investigator.</criteria>
