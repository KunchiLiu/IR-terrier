	<criteria>1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy patients on optimal medical treatment. Optimal medical treatment is defined as the continued symptoms of chest pain or dyspnea despite treatment with 2 antiischemic agents (beta blockers, CCB or nitrates). Unless contraindicated, all cardiomyopathy patients should be treated with a beta blocker and an ACEI/ARB. 2. Anginal chest pain or dyspnea 3. Documentation of non treatable or optimally treated coronary artery disease 4. Ejection Fraction of less than or equal to 40% 1. Less than 18 years of age 2. Pregnant or breast feeding 3.
