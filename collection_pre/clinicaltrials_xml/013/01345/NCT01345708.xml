	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the activity, safety and the duration of the response of low dose rituximab associated with standard oral prednisone as first line therapy in newly diagnosed warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and cold hemagglutinin disease, and as second line therapy in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia relapsed after standard oral prednisone. Further aim was to correlate the clinical response to biological parameters (cytokine and anti-erythrocyte antibody production in cultures).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Newly diagnosed "warm" or "cold" AIHA, defined by symptomatic anemia and positive DAT, in the absence of underlying lymphoproliferative, infectious or neoplastic disease (according to the single Center diagnostic criteria). Idiopathic "warm" or "cold" AIHA relapsed after first line treatment with oral prednisone. Aged &gt;18 years ECOG performance status grade 0, 1 or 2 No psychiatric illness that precludes understanding concepts of the trial or signing informed consent Patients who have provided written informed consent prior to study participation, with the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice. Cell or humoral immunologic deficit (congenital or acquired) Any other coexisting medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection requiring systemic therapy HIV or HbsAg positive (with HBVDNA+) or HCVAb positive (with HCVRNA+) patients History of malignancies within 3 years prior to study entry Concomitant immunosuppressive or cytotoxic treatment Positive pregnancy test. Lactation. The presence of associated organspecific autoimmune diseases do not constitute exclusion criteria. Previous splenectomy does not constitute exclusion criteria</criteria>
