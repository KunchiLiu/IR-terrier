	<brief_summary>This study is designed to look at the potential for an investigational drug (PF-04995274, under development by Pfizer, Inc. as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease) to reverse changes in memory and learning/problem solving skills caused by co-administration of a marketed drug called scopolamine. Scopolamine is known to cause temporary changes in memory and learning/problem solving skills that are similar to those seen in people with alzheimer's disease(AD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Changes in sponsor's organizational strategy have led to the decision to terminate the study and therefore to not conduct the second cohort (Cohort B/arms 2 and 3) . This decision was not based on significant safety concerns. Date of termination (ie, the date the site was notified to stop study activities) was 12 Oct 2011.</detailed_description>
