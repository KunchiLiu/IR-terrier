	<brief_summary>New Nordic diet guidelines advocate a reduction in consumption of protein from animal sources such as beef and pork, due to environmental concerns. Instead, intake of protein from vegetable sources such as legumes and pulses should be increased. However, little is known about the effect of protein from (Nordic grown) beans and peas on body weight and appetite regulation. The objective of this study is to examine if protein from vegetable sources (beans and peas) is comparable to protein from animal sources regarding acute meal-induced satiety.</brief_summary>
