	<brief_summary>Asthma is the most frequent respiratory disease during pregnancy. In a third of cases, the level of asthma control can decrease during the pregnancy, especially between the 29th and the 36th week. The occurrence of such complications are linked with a high asthma severity level just before the conception and an history of respiratory complications in a previous pregnancy. Many reviews and recommendations claim that pregnant women with asthma should be included in an educational progamme. However, this is poorly studied. The purpose of this study is to observe if an educational programme given before the 20th weeks of gestation has an effect on asthma control until the end of gestation.</brief_summary>
