	<brief_title>Time-lapse Evaluation of Embryo Development After Stimulation With One of Two Different Gonadotrophins.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>So far the assessment of the development potential of the single embryo has been limited by the vulnerability of the embryos when exposed to fluctuations in temperature and CO2 levels. Thus embryos can only be allowed to leave incubators for a very limited time period. However, with the development of time-lapse systems for clinical use it is possible to make continuous time-lapse recordings of embryos while they are in a safe incubator environment. The embryos are not compromised, but the entire embryonic development can still be seen, and will subsequently provide new and essential information on the competence of the single embryo. Based on the above it is expected that the probability of selecting the most viable and competent embryo is increased, which, in turn, will increase the success rate for couples seeking infertility treatment.</detailed_description>
