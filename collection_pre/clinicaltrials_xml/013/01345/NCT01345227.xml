	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of bone marrow (BM) as site for islet transplantation (Tx) in humans. The investigators hypothesis is that BM represents a better site than liver thanks to its potential capacity to favor islet engraftment in face of a more easiness of access and bioptic follow up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We were permitted to perform single intra BM islet infusion at the level of the iliac crest in patients having contraindications for intraportal infusion. A needle for BM aspiration (14 G) is inserted into the superior-posterior iliac crest and islet suspension (1:2.5; tissue:Ringer's Lactate solution) is infused. The entire intraBM-injection procedure lasted 8-15 min from the beginning of anaesthesia (short propofol sedation).</detailed_description>
