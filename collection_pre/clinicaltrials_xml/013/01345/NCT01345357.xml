	<criteria>Written informed consent is obtained. The patient has a either a histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant advanced solid tumor or a mantle cell lymphoma (and has experienced failure of as least 1 previous therapy) and the patient may benefit from the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. The patient has measurable or nonmeasurable disease evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines. The patient is a man or woman at least 18 years of age. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. The patient has a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more. The patient has adequate hematologic assessments and adequate renal and hepatic function as specified in the study protocol The patient has audiogram results without clinically significant abnormalities. The patient may have had chemotherapy provided that at least 3 weeks have elapsed and prior sequelae have resolved. If the patient has had prior radiation (curative or palliative) or prior treatment with nitrosoureas, a minimum of 4 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively, must have elapsed before treatment with CEP9722. The patient has had no immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibody therapy, for at least 4 weeks and no hormonal therapy for at least 1 week, with the exception of patients with prostate cancer, who may continue hormonal therapy. Written informed consent is obtained. Agreement by women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal) to use a medically accepted method of contraception and continue the use of this method for the duration of the study and for 90 days after participation in the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method. Agreement by men not surgically sterile or who are capable of producing offspring to practice abstinence or use a barrier method of birth control, and continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 6 months after participation in the study. With the exception of cancer, the patient has any serious or uncontrolled surgical, medical, or psychiatric history that could prevent compliance with study procedures, or compromise the integrity of the study. The patient has any of the protocol specified risk factors for Torsade de Pointes The patient has a brain lesion requiring systemic therapy with corticosteroids or anticonvulsive agents. The patient has previous hypersensitivity reactions to 1 or more of the components of the CEP9722, gemcitabine, or cisplatin drug products. The patient is a pregnant or breastfeeding woman. (Any women becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.) The patient is participating in another interventional clinical study at the time of enrollment or has participated in another interventional clinical study within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The patient has any malabsorption syndrome and/or prior gastrectomy The patient has a concomitant uncontrolled and/or chronic infection or severe systemic disease. The patient has had previous treatment with another poly (adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. The patient is unable to swallow tablets. The patient cannot interrupt continuous treatment with proton pump inhibitors and/or H2 receptor antagonists.</criteria>
