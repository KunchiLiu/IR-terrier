	<brief_summary>Pain is a complex experience influenced by gender and genetics, and, by psychosocial and sensory experiences. Pain sensitivity is thus highly variable between individuals. In the present study we evaluate individualsÂ´ pain perception in response to a number of different pain stimuli in 100 healthy volunteers (50 females and 50 males). The data will allow us to assess pain sensitivity, to predict pain responses and to investigate gender related differences in pain perception. A second aim is to evaluate the robustness of the different pain-tests since the tests are repeated with an interval of 2-4 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pain perception is affected by physiological, psychological, existential and demographic factors. In the present study psychophysiological, psychological, genetic and demographic components in pain perception are evaluated in healthy volunteers (n = 100). Psychophysical assessments following induction of a first degree burn injury (47.0 C, 420 s, 12.5 sq.cm, lower leg) include: - pain during induction of burn injury - thermal thresholds - tactile thresholds - electrical thresholds - areas of secondary hyperalgesia - pressure algometric assessments - assessment of Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) efficiency - assessment of (DNIC) using cold pressor test Psychological assessments include: - HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) - PCS (Pain Catastrophizing Scale) - vulnerability score Genetics include: - A118G SNP Demographics include: - gender - height - weight</detailed_description>
