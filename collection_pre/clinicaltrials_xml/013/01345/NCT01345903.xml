	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To perform a small pilot study that will demonstrate the feasibility of neurosurgical spinal procedures using the da Vinci surgical robot. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare complication rates, operative time and estimated blood loss with historical controls. II. To observe wound healing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, neurological injury and hardware failure. II. Routine imaging of the spinal segment. OUTLINE: Patients undergo robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci robot. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.</detailed_description>
