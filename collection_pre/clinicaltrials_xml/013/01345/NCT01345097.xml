	<brief_summary>The investigators determined whether 1. new short, metaphyseal-fitting cementless anatomical femoral stem provides major functional improvements 2. radiographically secure implant fixation is achieved with this new stem 3. the bone content is preserved at the baseline level or above at the final follow-up 4. these procedures are associated with early failure and complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Short Metaphyseal Fitting Total Hip Arthroplasty in Young and Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To attempt reduction of stress shielding and thigh pain as well as to improve survivorship, a new short, metaphyseal-fitting cementless anatomical femoral stem was developed. The question arises as to whether it is possible to obtain rigid fixation of the stem without diaphyseal fixation in the young as well as in the elderly patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical and radiographic results of the new short, metaphyseal-fitting cementless anatomical femoral stem in the young as well as in the elderly patients.</detailed_description>
