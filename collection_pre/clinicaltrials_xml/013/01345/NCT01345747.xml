	<brief_summary>This study the investigators compare peak airway pressure (PAP), expire tidal volume (TV), end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), SpO2, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) after the insertion of laryngeal tube suction or endotracheal tube in patients undergoing elective gynecological laparoscopic surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Laryngeal Tube Suction Versus Endotracheal Tube for Ventilation in Gynecological Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: For standard procedure, the endotracheal tube is used to ventilate the anesthetized patients who undergo gynecological laparoscopic surgery that increase intrabdominal pressure. Now there is a new supraglottic airway device, laryngeal tube suction (LTs) can be use instead of ETT. Objective This study the investigators compare peak airway pressure (PAP), expire tidal volume (TV), end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), SpO2, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) after the insertion of laryngeal tube suction or endotracheal tube in patients undergoing elective gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Material and methods Prospective single blinded randomized control trial, the patients were divided into two groups, LTs group and ETT group n = 60 for each group. All patients were induced anesthesia with fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg then maintained anesthesia with air : oxygen 30%. Respirator setting are tidal volume 10 ml/kg, I/E 1:2 adjust RR base on ETCO2 keep ETCO2 35-40 mmHg. Results No statistical difference in demographic data between groups. PAP and ETCO2 in the LTs group were significant higher than ETT group in the first 5 and 10 minutes but no statistically significant after 10 minutes until the end of operation. No statistically significant in TV and SpO2 between groups. In ETT group MAP and HR after insertion are significant higher than LTs group, no statistically significant about postoperative complication such as sorethroat, hoarseness and nausea vomiting. Conclusion LTs can be used in gynecological laparoscopic surgery like ETT.</detailed_description>
