	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether maraviroc administered once daily is non-inferior to emtricitabine/tenofovir also administered once daily each in combination with darunavir/ritonavir in the treatment of antiretroviral-naive patients as evaluated at Week 48 of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Trial Of Maraviroc Versus Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Both With Darunavir/Ritonavir In Antiretroviral-Naive Patients Infected With CCR5 Tropic HIV 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was terminated on October 8, 2013 following a preliminary review of the Week 48 primary efficacy data by the study's external independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC assessed the data as demonstrating significant differences between the treatment arms in virologic responses and failures. The DMC recommended and the Sponsor concurred that the study be terminated because of the inferior efficacy of the Maraviroc arm as compared to the comparator arm (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir).</detailed_description>
