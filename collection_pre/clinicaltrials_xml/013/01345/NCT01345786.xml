	<brief_summary>For the contraceptive application a film-coated tablet has been developed which combines nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) with estradiol (E2). This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, four-way, replicate, cross-over study design conducted in 2 parallel parts at two sites, one site per study part. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the bioequivalence of NOMAC and E2 of the drug product manufactured using the commercial process ("commercial batch") versus the Phase 3 drug product ("Batch A"). The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess bioequivalence of NOMAC and E2 of the drug product manufactured using the commercial process ("commercial batch") versus the Phase 3 drug product ("Batch B").</brief_summary>
