	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that CHF 1535 NEXT DPI® is non-inferior to the corresponding dose of CHF 1535 pMDI and superior to marketed beclomethasone DPI 100 µg in terms of average pre-dose morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) in asthmatic adult patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to demonstrate that CHF 1535 NEXT DPI® (beclomethasone dipropionate + formoterol fumarate 100/6 μg), 1 inhalation twice daily, is non-inferior to the corresponding dose of CHF 1535 pMDI in terms of pulmonary function test (change from baseline to the entire treatment period in average pre-dose morning PEF) in asthmatic adult patients ≥ 18 years under treatment with fixed dose combination of Foster® (beclomethasone dipropionate + formoterol fumarate 100 / 6 μg) 1 inhalation bid.</detailed_description>
