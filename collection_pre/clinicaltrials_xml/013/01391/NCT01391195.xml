	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is an increase in muscle performance and a higher aerobic adaptation of young women submitted to chronic endurance training program associated to low level laser therapy when compared to chronic aerobic training alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (808nm) on Muscle Performance of Young Women Submitted to Physical Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study assessed women muscle performance in isokinetic dynamometry, ventilatory parameters such as ventilatory threshold, VO2Peak, VO2Max, Ventilation. Maximal load in cycle ergometer test (Balke's protocol), Borg Scale and Heart rate were assessed too.</detailed_description>
