	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Combined With Iressa for EGFR Mutation Positive Patients With Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide more than half a million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed annually. About 80% of these tumours are of non-small cell histological type. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but only about 20% of tumours are suitable for potentially curative resection. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC. When Iressa was used in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations positive, the 12-month rates of progression-free survival were 24.9%. Therefore, we speculate that the EGFR mutations in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, Gefitinib combined with radiotherapy may be better than chemoradiotherapy. We design the study to access the effect and safety of radiotherapy combined whth Iressa for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer with harboring active EGFR mutations.</detailed_description>
