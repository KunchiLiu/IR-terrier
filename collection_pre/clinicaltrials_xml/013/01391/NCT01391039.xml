	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study designed to investigate new techniques to guide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of Ductal Carcinoma In-situ (DCIS). The microvascularity and stiffness of the lesion may be prognostic factors that can guide the need for more or less extensive therapy or perhaps only imaging follow-up may be needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Study of Early Breast Cancer Using Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women who have imaging findings suggestive of DCIS, who are having breast ultrasound and who are candidates for surgery will be eligible. They will receive a contrast-enhanced breast ultrasound after the intravenous injection of a microbubble contrast agent which will show the microvascularity. A subset of women will also have ultrasound elastography performed of the abnormality to evaluate its stiffness.</detailed_description>
