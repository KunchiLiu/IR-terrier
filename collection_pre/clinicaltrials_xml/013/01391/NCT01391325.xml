Must have had at least 2 gout flares in the past year. Consumption of more than 14 drinks of alcohol per week (eg, 1 drink = 5 oz [150 mL] of wine, 12 oz [360 mL] of beer, or 1.5 oz [45 mL] of hard liquor). History or suspicion of drug abuse.

Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, or stroke within the last 12 months. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure above 160 mm Hg or diastolic pressure above 95 mm Hg). Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min by CockcroftGault formula. Kidney or other organ transplant. Active peptic ulcer disease requiring treatment. History of xanthinuria, active liver disease, or hepatic dysfunction. If unable to take gout flare prophylaxis of either colchicine or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to contraindication (e.g. toxicity, renal function, use of contraindicated medications).
