	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate whether treatment with CRMD001 (unique formulations of the iron chelator, Deferiprone) will reduce morbidity and mortality in subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and additional risk factors. Adult subjects with moderate to severe CKD who are undergoing diagnostic or interventional coronary angiography will be randomized to either placebo or CRMD001 and followed for 90 days. Subjects will receive 8 days of randomized therapy starting 1-3 hours prior to angiography. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the difference in a composite of specified renal and cardiovascular clinical events occurring through Day 90.</brief_summary>
