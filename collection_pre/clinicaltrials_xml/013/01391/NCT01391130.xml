Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry Participants who have or have not had their primary tumor removed by nephrectomy are allowed. Participants who have not had a nephrectomy should not be considered to need a nephrectomy as part of their overall therapy at the time of enrollment Performance status score of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, as assessed by the following laboratory requirements, to be conducted within seven days prior to treatment: (upper limit of normal/lower limit of normal [ULN/LLN]) hemoglobin (greater than) &gt;8.0 g/dL (grams per deciliter) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (greater than or equal to) ≥1.5 × 10^9/L (liter) platelet count (greater than or equal to) ≥100 × 10^9/L (liter) total bilirubin (less than or equal to) ≤ 1.5 × ULN (upper limit of normal) serum creatinine (less than or equal to) ≤2 × ULN (upper limit of normal) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (less than or equal to) ≤2.5 × ULN (upper limits of normal) [or (less than or equal to) ≤5 × ULN (upper limits of normal) for patients with liver involvement of their cancer] Prothrombin Time (PT) or International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) (less than or equal to) ≤1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) For women: Must be surgically sterile (surgical procedure: bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy), postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea), or have a negative pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential should be compliant with a medically approved contraceptive regimen (intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 3 months after the treatment period; must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days before study enrollment, and must not be breastfeeding For men: Must be surgically sterile or compliant with a contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months after the treatment period Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Provide written informed consent/assent prior to any studyspecific procedures No prior malignancies with the exception of stage 1 cancers definitively treated, carcinoma in situ (any primary site), treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis, and T1) or any cancer curatively treated 5 or more years prior to study entry Capable and willing to learn to selfadminister LY2510924, or have a caregiver who is willing to learn and able to administer LY2510924 by subcutaneous (SC) injection and are able to swallow tablets Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to LLN as defined by the institution performing the scan, as assessed by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan, or from echocardiogram to be performed within 28 days prior to start of treatment Received prior treatment with sunitinib or LY2510924 Received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry History of active cardiovascular disease within the previous 12 months, including any of the following: Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery/peripheral artery bypass graft Congestive heart failure Malignant hypertension Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack Symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias (Patients with chronic, stable, rate controlled atrial fibrillation are eligible) Exhibit uncontrolled hypertension ( [greater than] &gt;150/100 [millimeters of mercury] mm/Hg despite optimal medical therapy), or history of poor compliance with antihypertensive treatment Evidence of bleeding diathesis, National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 hemorrhage (less than) &lt;4 weeks of starting the study treatment, coagulopathy, or thromboembolic event Significant surgery (less than) &lt;4 weeks of starting study treatment or a minor surgical procedure (less than) &lt; 7 days prior to study treatment (Placement of a portacath or other venous access device does not require a waiting period) Suffer from medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results Known or suspected allergy to any agent given in association with this trial Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is/are permitted, provided there is at least 1 measurable lesion that has not been irradiated. Radiotherapy must have been completed (greater than) &gt;2 weeks prior to starting study treatment, and radiationrelated side effects must have resolved Pregnant or lactating women Impairment of the gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of sunitinib Current or recent (within 10 days of first dose of study treatment) daily use of aspirin ( [greater than] &gt;325 [milligram] mg/day ) Serious nonhealing wounds, acute or nonhealing ulcers, or bone fractures</criteria>
