	<brief_title>A Trial Estimating The Optimal Radiation Volume Of Postsurgical Radiation For Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Population: Thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after esophagectomy with at least 15 lymph nodes removed for adequate nodal staging. T3-4, any N, M0. Scheme: After esophagectomy, patients are firstly stratified by 2 factors: (1)number of lymph node metastasis (&lt;3 or &gt;=3) and (2)tumor resection status (R1 resection or R2 resection). Note: Pathological R0 resection status is required for this study. So here R1 and R2 resection are not actually pathological status of resection, only clinical judgement by physician based on the chest-CT before esophagectomy. Then patients are randomized to 2 arms: Arm A: Large field radiation (tumor bed + ENI (elective nodal irradiation)) + Sequential chemotherapy (4 cycles). Arm B: Small field radiation (tumor bed only) + Sequential chemotherapy (4 cycles).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 and ≤70 2. Performance status 01 3. Weight is not less than 90% of it before operation 4. Registration within 8 weeks after esophagectomy 5. Histologically proven primary thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 6. R0 resection and number of lymph nodes dissected ≥15 after esophagectomy 7. Pathological stage of T34N03M0 8. Chest and abdominal contrast enhanced CT within 6 weeks prior to registration(PET/CT scan is selective) 9. Without supraclavicular nodes and abdominal regions nodes existed after surgery 10. Without neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy 11. WBC≥ 4.0X109/L ,Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 2.0X109/L 12. Platelets ≥ 100X109/L 13. Hemoglobin ≥ 90g/L(without blood transfusion) 14. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal, Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal 15. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal 16. Sign studyspecific informed consent prior to study entry 1. Multiple primary esophageal tumors 2. Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 2 years (For example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible). 3. Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows: 3.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 3 months 3.2 Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months 3.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration 3.4 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration 3.5 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. 4. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception. 5. Prior systemic chemotherapy, prior radiation therapy or prior target drug therapy</criteria>
