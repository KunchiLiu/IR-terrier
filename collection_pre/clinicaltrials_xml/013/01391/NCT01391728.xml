	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to formulate, implement and evaluate a new type of activity-orientated, evidence-based prevention programme to prevent fall injuries among elderly people. The question examined by the study is whether the intervention programme can: - significantly reduce accidents and incidents involving falling among the participants, - influence variables such as satisfaction with life, confidence in one's own ability and a feeling of involvement, - be shown to be cost effective in terms of the use of resources. The intervention programme - Active lifestyle all your life - is being developed in and for primary care for the cost effective prevention of fall injuries among elderly people using a method that results in continued active life. The aim is to ensure that the elderly person is able to continue living an active life with commitment and involvement, which can in itself prevent fall injuries. This presupposes a knowledge of how to avoid fall injuries and the measures and aids that are available to prevent such injuries. The programme will also provide the participants with a social community in self-supporting groups which, by their own efforts but also with social support, are able to continue some of the activities provided through primary care.</brief_summary>
