	<brief_summary>This reported observational clinical study aims at identifying epigenetic markers in a sample of patients undergoing high dose inpatient psychotherapy suffering from a variety of psychiatric/psychosomatic diseases such as somatoform disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders and eating disorders. The exact epigenetic markers that will be traced are yet to define. The investigators believe that 1. Epigenetic patterns found in the group of psychiatric patients show differences from healthy controls 2. Different diagnosis show differences in epigenetic patterns as well 3. Epigenetic patterns correlate to the severity of the psychosocial disorder as measured in interviews or psychometric ratings 4. Epigenetic patterns can change under inpatient high dose psychotherapy 5. Changes correlate to clinical psychometric variables.</brief_summary>
