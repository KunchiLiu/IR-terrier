	<brief_summary>It is well recognized that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hyperhomocysteinemia appears to be a predictor of future CVD events. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to bo of high prevalence in patients with CKD. The investigators aim to study the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in Thai CKD patients by using Thai Screening and Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease (SEEK) study database and their relationship to CVD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Of Hyperhomocysteinemia In Thai Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety eight subjects were sampling from Thai SEEK study database Traditional Traditional risk factors of CVD such as total cholesterol, triglyceride, age, sex, history of smoking and blood pressure levels were examined and recorded. Stored sera of these subjects were analyzed for the total homocysteine (tHcy) level. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the different of mean tHcy among groups</detailed_description>
