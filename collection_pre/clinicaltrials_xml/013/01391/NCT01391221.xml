	<brief_summary>Major depression is accompanied by cognitive changes as well as alterations in multiple physical functions. The inflammatory system is altered generally toward a pro-inflammatory state. Antidepressants are associated with a decrease in this proinflammatory state. This study aims to generate pilot data concerning a possible link between cognition, inflammation and response to treatment. The cognitive function of subjects with major depression will be tested before and after treatment with duloxetine. Inflammatory markers will be measured at both time points.</brief_summary>
