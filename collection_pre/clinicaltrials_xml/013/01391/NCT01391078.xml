	<brief_summary>This prospective, crossover study is designed to correlate SENSIMED Triggerfish® (TF) continuous IOP monitoring with conventional 24 h intraocular pressure profiles in glaucoma patients. There are two control measurements: The GAT/Perkins profile in the same eye in the second night and the GAT/Perkins profile in the same night in the fellow eye. Therefore, each eye serves as test eye and also as control for the second test eye.</brief_summary>
