	<brief_summary>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Two co-primary objectives are: - To demonstrate that ZOSTAVAX administered by intramuscular route (IM) is non-inferior to ZOSTAVAX administered by subcutaneous route (SC) - To demonstrate that ZOSTAVAX administered by IM route induces an acceptable fold-rise of varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody titres from pre to 4-week post-vaccination SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Immunogenicity objectives - To evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by VZV antibody titres at 4 weeks following ZOSTAVAX administered by IM or SC route - To evaluate the immune response as measured by a second assay, the VZV Interferon gamma Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) at 4 weeks following ZOSTAVAX administered by IM or SC route Safety objective - To describe the safety profile of ZOSTAVAX administered by IM or SC route</brief_summary>
