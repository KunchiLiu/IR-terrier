	<brief_summary>Aims: To assess pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Methods: 51 women were prospectively divided into two groups, according to the symptoms as SUI (G1 = 22) or UUI (G2 = 29). Demographic data, such as number of Pads/ 24 hours, number of micturitions/ 24 hours and nocturia, delay time of urgent void (i.e., the time period for which an urgent void could be voluntarily postponed), number of parity and vaginal deliveries were obtained using a clinical questionnaire. Objective urine loss was evaluated by 60-min Pad Test. Subjective [urine stream interruption test (UST), visual survey of perineal contraction and transvaginal digital palpation] and objective (vaginal manometry) evaluations of PFM were performed in all patients.</brief_summary>
