	<brief_summary>People with disease (PD) tend to walk with short steps, decreased velocity, and increased stride time variability. Short steps and increased variability are related to greater fall risk. In addition, concurrent performance of a cognitive task (dual-task (DT)) has marked effects on gait in people with PD which is considered to reflect an impaired automaticity of gait. Objective: To investigate short and long term effects of high-volume walking with visual spatial cues (VSC) on gait variables, automaticity, and functional mobility, in people with Parkinson´s Disease (PD), compared with walking without VSC.</brief_summary>
