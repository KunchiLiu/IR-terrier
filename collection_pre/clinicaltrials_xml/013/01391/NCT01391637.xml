	<detailed_description>Only subjects who underwent HuCNS-SC transplantation under Protocol CL-N01-PMD will be enrolled in this long term follow-up study. Subjects will return to the site six months and one year after completion of the Phase I study and then annually for a total study duration of four years. Phone calls will also be made by the Investigator to the subject's parent/legal guardian bi-annually to conduct a phone visit through the four-year duration of the study.</detailed_description>
