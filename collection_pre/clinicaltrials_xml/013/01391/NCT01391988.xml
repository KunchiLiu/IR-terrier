	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Electric and Harmonic Scalpel in Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population of this study was formed by women aged older than 18 years old, with breast carcinoma (ductal ou lobular) at any stage, form whom modified radical mastectomy is proposed. Patients were excluded if the present blood dyscrasia, collagen diseases, known uncontrolled chronic disease, infections (mammary or axillary, ulcerated tumors and pregnancy. The women were submitted to modified radical mastectomy consecutive allocated in electric scalpel group and the other group with harmonic scalpel. Electric scalpels were calibrated at 40 watts of cutting and coagulation power and harmonic scalpel with a GEN04 generator calibrated at power levels 3 and 5, using the HP054 handpiece and HF105 curved blade. Local postoperative complications analysed were seroma, hematoma, skin necrosis and infection.</detailed_description>
