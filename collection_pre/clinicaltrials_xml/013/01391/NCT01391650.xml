	<brief_title>Stability of the Knee Joint After Single and Double Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the influence of both bundles on the knee stability - anterior-posterior translation, internal and external rotations after the double-bundle reconstruction of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and to compare the stability after single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction using a computer navigation system. Methods Anterior-posterior translation, internal rotation, and external rotation were recorded in the deficient condition (without ACL), in the anteromedial-reconstructed, posterolateral-reconstructed, and in the whole ACL-reconstructed condition for double-bundle reconstructions and before and after the ACL reconstruction in single-bundle group. KT-1000 was used to evaluate anterior-posterior translation.</detailed_description>
