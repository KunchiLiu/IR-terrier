	<brief_title>Artemisinin With Risperidone for First-Episode and Drug-Naive Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidences of high levels of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with schizophrenia have suggested that this organism might be involved in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that antimicrobial therapy by using an add-on agent together with a well-proven neuroleptic may have favorable effects on a subgroup of schizophrenic patients.</detailed_description>
