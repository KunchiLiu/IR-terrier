	<brief_summary>This study aimed to search whether whole body and subcutaneous adipose tissues increase in PCOS patients and whether these tissues are related to HOMA-IR and plasma adiponectin levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue in Cases With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty-two patients with PCOS and fifty-tree healthy controls who were matched for body mass index (BMI) and age (p=0.430, p=0.112, respectively) were enrolled in the study. Biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (SFT) of all cases were measured via caliper device; mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) via a tape; and body fat distributions via a bioelectrical impedance device. Insulin resistance was calculated via HOMA-IR while ELISA was used to measure plasma adiponectin.</detailed_description>
