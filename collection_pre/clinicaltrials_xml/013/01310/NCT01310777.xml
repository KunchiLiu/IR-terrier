	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) relative to each of its individual active components in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brinzolamide/Brimonidine Twice a Day (BID) Fixed Combination (FC) vs Brinzolamide BID and Brimonidine BID in Patients With Open Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 7 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and a treatment phase, which included 4 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, Month 3, and Month 6 (or early exit). Following washout of any IOP-lowering medication, subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits and who had IOP measurements within the specified range during this period were randomized to 1 of 3 study drug groups: Brinz/Brim, Brinz, or Brim.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and, in the opinion of the Investigator, are insufficiently controlled on monotherapy or are currently on multiple IOPlowering medications. Meet qualifying IOP entry criteria. Able to understand and sign an informed consent form. Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply. Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, test positive for pregnancy at Screening Visit, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study. Severe central visual field loss. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (20/80 Snellen equivalent). Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease. Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months. Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the preceding 3 months. Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease. Other ocular pathology. Intraocular surgery within the 6 months prior to entry. Ocular laser surgery within the 3 months prior to entry. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Any other conditions, including severe illness, which would make the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study. Recent use of highdose (&gt;1 gram daily) salicylate therapy. Recent, current, or anticipated treatment with any medication that augments adrenergic responses, or precludes use of an alphaadrenergic agonist. Concurrent use of glucocorticoid medications administered by any route. Other protocolspecified exclusion crtieria may apply.</criteria>
