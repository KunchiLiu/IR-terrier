	<brief_title>Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities Study in HIV Uninfected Children Born to HIV Infected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications given to a pregnant woman cross the placenta and can be detected in the amniotic fluid and cord blood resulting in substantial fetal exposure. Therefore, there is concern about toxicity of the drugs in the fetus and infant. It is noteworthy that none of the currently approved ART medications for the prevention of maternal to fetal transmission of HIV are in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Category A (no fetal risk ascertained in adequately controlled human studies). Thus, there is continued need to examine the toxicity of ART in HIV transmission prevention for the short-term toxicity of newer agents and combinations as well as the unanswered questions of longer term toxicity and subtle adverse effects. The study will use a registry approach to conduct active surveillance among children &lt; 12 years of age at enrollment. Occurrences of abnormalities from ART exposure in utero and/or in the first two months of life will be sought in multiple domains, including metabolic, growth, cardiac, neurologic, neurodevelopmental, behavior, language, and hearing. Clinical and laboratory data will be examined for abnormalities through a hierarchy of evaluations: adverse events (AE) will be identified → selected AEs will trigger predefined additional evaluations → significant observations will be defined as cases → a pattern of significant study-wide cases will be defined as signals. The incidence of these events of interest will be monitored over time and by ART regimen, and compared with historical data that may be suggestive of a signal. Some signals may be testable using existing and/or previously collected data, while other signals may indicate the need for additional hypothesis-driven studies outside of SMARTT. The objectives of SMARTT are: 1. To estimate the occurrence of potential ART-related toxicities through an ongoing surveillance system among HIV-uninfected children born to mothers with HIV infection with and without exposure to ART in utero and/or in the first two months of life and compare the occurrences of these outcomes with other sources of data as well as by ART exposures; and 2. To actively encourage hypothesis-driven studies to confirm that the signals are due to ART exposure in utero and/or in the first two months of life. Note that the full design and execution of these studies may be beyond the scope of the SMARTT study but will be facilitated by SMARTT. The specific aims of SMARTT are: 1. To create a Static Surveillance Cohort to extend domain-specific data collection in children either 1) previously enrolled in any of the approved studies for enrollment into SMARTT; 2) previously enrolled in another pediatric HIV/AIDS cohort study with SMARTT Protocol Chair approval, or 3) not previously enrolled in an approved study but with equivalent data available in the medical record; 2. To create a Dynamic Surveillance Cohort to examine domain-specific data of children newly exposed to ART in utero and/or in the first two months of life; 3. To create a Young Adult Cohort to study long-term outcomes in SMARTT participants formerly enrolled in the Static and Dynamic cohorts. 4. To identify a set of "triggers" for each domain that define a "signal" of possible ART toxicity and compare the occurrence of these signals with previously collected data and by ART exposure; and 5. To encourage and facilitate the development of hypothesis-driven studies to evaluate whether a "signal" is the result of ART exposure in utero and/or in the first two months of life.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Static Surveillance Cohort: HIVexposed but uninfected infants and children; lack of infection must be documented by medical or research record review. Children exposed and unexposed to ART while in utero and/or in the first two months of life will be enrolled. Previously enrolled in any of the studies included on the list of approved studies for enrollment into SMARTT or another study with SMARTT Protocol Chair approval if the study has data on ART exposure by pregnancy trimester, ART exposure during the first 2 months of life, and pregnancy complication data or availability of ART exposure by pregnancy trimester (including start and stop dates), ART exposure during the first 2 months of life, and pregnancy complication data in the mother and/or child's medical record. Age birth to &lt; 12 years at entry. Willingness of parent/legal guardian to provide written permission for child to participate in study. Dynamic Surveillance Cohort: HIVexposed living fetus greater than or equal to 23 weeks gestation or a live infant born after 22 weeks gestation. Infants exposed and unexposed to ART will be enrolled. Any infant born of an HIVinfected mother may be enrolled pending determination of the infant's HIV infection status. However, infants found to be HIVpositive will be discontinued from the study and will be referred for care outside this study. HIV infection status will be determined using the Diagnosis of Lack of Infection in HIVExposed Children. ART exposure data by trimester of pregnancy must be available if ART exposed. Entry prior to birth through &lt; 72 hours of age. Willingness of parent/legal guardian to provide written permission for child to participate in study. Willingness of biological mother to enroll at initial enrollment of her child. Young Adult Cohort: 18 years of age or older, and aware of their perinatal HIV exposure status. Previously enrolled in the SMARTT Dynamic or Static Cohort. Willingness to provide written consent to participate in the study. Reference Cohort: Participants from clinical settings that are similar to participants enrolled in the PHACS SMARTT Static Cohort. Antiretroviral therapy unexposed children born to a mother HIV uninfected at the time of the child's birth. Ages 1, 3, 5, or 9 years (± 3 months) at the time of the study visit. Willingness of parent/legal guardian to provide written permission for child to participate in study. Static and Dynamic Cohorts: Young Adult Cohort: Participants enrolled in the Adolescent Master Protocol for Participants 18 Years of Age and Older (AMP Up). Current prisoner status. Reference Cohort: Monolingual Spanishspeaking child or parent/caregiver.</criteria>
