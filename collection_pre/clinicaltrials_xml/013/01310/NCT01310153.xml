	<brief_summary>Respiratory Distress is a frequent clinical diagnosis of babies delivered by elective Caesarean birth. There has been no study comparing the efficacy of immediately positioning a newly born infant prone vs. supine for the first 30 60 seconds of life after delivery by Caesarean birth. The investigators hypothesize that when the infant is prone they will have postural drainage, better dorsal lung expansion, less vagal response from suctioning and less agitation secondary to the righting reflex. The investigators will compare 1033 term babies divided by randomization into two groups prone and supine. The investigators will check for incidence and severity of Respiratory Distress, Use of FiO2 or respiratory support, admissions to NICU.</brief_summary>
