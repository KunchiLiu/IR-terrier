	<brief_summary>The global epidemic of obesity in childhood continues to evolve and threaten future health and life expectancy primarily due to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Obesity is strongly related to high blood pressure (hypertension) and both conditions pose a risk for target organ damage, which can follow a subject from childhood into adult life. The AORTA study will investigate central hemodynamics and organ damage in 100 obese children and adolescents in order to gain insight to the complex interplay of hypertension, obesity and subclinical damage in order to intensify more precise prevention, thereby reducing the future development of cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
