	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate effect of whole-body vibration on plasma sclerostin level in healthy young adult women. Fifteen healthy young adult women are planned to include in this study. All cases will be trained on a whole-body vibration (WBV) platform (Power Plate) 5 times a week for one week period. Training duration will be short at the beginning but progressed slowly. The amplitude of vibration will be 2 mm and the frequency of the vibration will be 40 Hz. The subjects will be asked to report negative side effects or adverse reactions in their training diary. Previbration and postvibration (just after, 10.minute and 30.minute) levels of plasma sclerostin will be measured on first, second and fifth day of experiment. Sclerostin levels will be measured by human sclerostin ELISA kit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Whole-Body Vibration on Plasma Sclerostin Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whole-body vibration has a strong osteogenic effect. The cyclic mechanical loading to the bone stimulates the osteocytes. Sclerostin, the protein product of the SOST gene, is an osteocyte-specific cysteine knot-secreted glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Sost/sclerostin levels have been reported to be reduced by mechanical stimulation. The aim of this study is to investigate effect of whole-body vibration on plasma sclerostin level in healthy young adult women.</detailed_description>
