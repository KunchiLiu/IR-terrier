	<detailed_description>RENEWING HEALTH is a project covering 9 different European States. It aims at evaluation of innovative telemedicine services using a patient-centred approach and a common rigorous assessment methodology. In 9 European regions in the implementation of health-related information and communication technologies service solutions are already operational at local level for the remote monitoring and the treatment of chronic patients suffering from diabetes,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular diseases. The services are designed to give patients a central role in the management of their own diseases, fine-tuning the choice and dosage of medications, promoting compliance to treatment, and helping health care professionals to detect early signs of worsening in the monitored pathologies. Every area will designed its own real-life trial with certain common elements.</detailed_description>
