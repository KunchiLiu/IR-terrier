	<brief_summary>Bradyarrhythmia, including sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block, is a major cause necessitating pacemaker implantation. In contrast to familial bradyarrhythmia known as by mutations at particular ion channels, limited information is available for the mechanistic study in non-familial bradyarrhythmia. Possible gene polymorphisms related to non-familial bradyarrhythmia were studied. Comparison of multi-locus analysis and single-locus analysis will be analyzed between the cases and controls. Functional studies will perform to clarify the results of association study.</brief_summary>
