	<brief_summary>To investigate the effect of cervical manual mobilization on head repositioning accuracy and postural balance in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain in a randomized controlled trial. Hypothesis: There is no difference between the intervention group (manual mobilization) and control group head repositioning accuracy and postural balance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manual Therapy on Head-repositioning Accuracy and Static Postural Balance in Neck Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of manual therapy to standing balance and head-neck proprioception sense in patients with chronic neck pain. The study will recruit 120 chronic neck pain patients and randomize the into 2 groups of 60. Group 1 will receive a course of manual therapy and infrared radiation for 15 minutes (twice weekly for 12 sessions). The other group (control) will receive infrared radiation therapy only. Manual therapy will be provided by experienced physiotherapists and assessed by a separate assessor. All outcome measures will be assessed at the beginning of study, upon completion of intervention, 3-month and 6-month after the completion of study. All measurements collected will be analysed by computerized statistical software in order to calculate the effectiveness of manual therapy and relationship among those outcome measurements.</detailed_description>
