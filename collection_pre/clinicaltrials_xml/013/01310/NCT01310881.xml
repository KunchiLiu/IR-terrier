	<brief_summary>This is a subject single blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, single dose, first-time-in-human study with three or more ascending cohorts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of Novel Neurogenic Compound NSI-189</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject will undergo Screening (Day -28 to Day -2). Subjects will return to the clinical site on Day -1, be admitted to the unit, and eligibility will be reconfirmed. Eligible subjects will receive a single dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP, NSI-189 Phosphate or Placebo) on Day 1 and will be followed for safety and PK until discharge on Day 3. Subjects who are experiencing any significant AEs that are considered possibly related to study drug will be kept at the unit for an additional day (or longer) until the event resolves or it is considered medically safe for the subject to be discharged. Subjects will have a telephone Follow-up on Day 4 and return to the unit on Day 7 (± 1) for End-of-study. Participation of an individual subject may last up to 36 days from the time of Screening until the End-of-study.</detailed_description>

Clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) 12lead ECG abnormalities, including corrected QT interval using Bazett's correction method of &gt;450 msec for males and &gt;470 msec for females. 5. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions. 6. Subjects who have plans to undergo elective procedures/surgeries at any time during the study through the followup visits. 7. A positive screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). 8. Serious infection (e.g. pneumonia, septicemia) as determined by the Investigator within 3 months prior to Day 1. 9.

Note: Intermittent treatment with acetaminophen [≤1000 mg/day] and/or ibuprofen [≤400 mg/day] is permitted. 12. Current enrollment in any other drug, biologic, device, or clinical study, or treatment with an investigational product or approved therapy for investigational use within 30 days (or 5 halflives, whichever is longer) prior to Day 1. 13. Any live or attenuated immunization/vaccination within 1 month prior to the study drug administration or planned to occur during the study period. 14. Donation of blood (&gt;500 mL) or blood products within 1 month prior to screening. 15.
