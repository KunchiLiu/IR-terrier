	<brief_summary>Many patients who have lumbar degenerative disease suffer from osteoporosis or reduced bone mass or low bone mineral density. Among patients with lumbar degenerative disease, some need fusion surgery. But conditions of osteoporosis or low bone mineral density slow down the rate of bone fusion, reduce the success of bone fusion, and ultimately affect the overall effectiveness of surgery. Zoledronic acid is an effective anti-osteoporotic. Many researchers dispute if zoledronic acid can promote the healing of long bone fractures. But few researchers focus on the effect of zoledronic acid to lumbar fusion. In this study, we select patients with lumbar degenerative disease who have had lumbar interbody fusion surgery. Three days postoperatively, the patients were randomized to either one infusion of zoledronic acid or sodium chloride intravenously. We follow all these patients for 6 months. During this time, we detect bone metabolism and bone fusion of these patients. At last, we can tell if zoledronic acid can modify bone metabolism and promote bone fusion.</brief_summary>
