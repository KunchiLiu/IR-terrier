	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Cediranib Maleate and gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether cediranib maleate given together with gefitinib is more effective than cediranib maleate given alone in treating patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving cediranib maleate together with gefitinib and to see how well it works compared with giving cediranib maleate together with a placebo in treating patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate With or Without Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To compare progression-free survival, overall survival, radiological response, and safety and tolerability of cediranib maleate in combination with gefitinib versus cediranib maleate in combination with a placebo in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma following standard front-line treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cediranib maleate and gefitinib or cediranib maleate and a placebo once daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and tissue samples are collected from some patients for genetic profiling and biomarker analysis.
