	<brief_summary>Vaginal delivery may cause various levels of damage to the anal sphincter. According to the literature, one third - two third of women diagnosed with 3rd degree rupture during vaginal delivery suffer from fecal incontinence. This has an adverse effect on the quality of life. Different risk factors such as: first births, instrumental delivery, high birth weight, prolonged second stage, epidural anesthesia etc. were assessed and found to be associated with anal sphincter disruption. The purpose of this study is to assess risk factors for anal sphincter disruption by new methods such as three-Dimensional transperineal ultrasound (3D transperineal US).</brief_summary>
