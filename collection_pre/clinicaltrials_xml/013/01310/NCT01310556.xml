	<brief_title>Unknown Glucose Metabolism Disorders In Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context: There are more than 220 million people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) in the world. DM is a serious risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to examine the prevalence of glucose metabolism disorders (GMD) in te patients with coronary artery disease and the relationship between different GMDs and CAD. Settings: 230 patients with coronary artery disease and without any known GMDs were included the study. Coronary angiography was used to diagnose CAD. Patients were administered the 75 g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).</detailed_description>
