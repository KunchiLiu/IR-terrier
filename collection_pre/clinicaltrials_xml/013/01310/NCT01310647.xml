	<brief_title>Antral Follicle Priming Prior to ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) in Previously Diagnosed Low Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), most of the early antral follicles are required to grow coordinately. Marked follicular size discrepancies during COH imply that an important number of follicles undergo unsatisfactory maturation. It has been proved that follicular priming with estradiol during the luteal phase of the cycle prior to COH or testosterone treatment during the early follicular phase of the COH cycle may increase the amount of oocytes and embryos retrieved. Nevertheless there are no prospective studies comparing such approaches. The present study consist of two phases: The present study consists of two different phases: - Phase I: (Non randomized) Identification of confirmed low responder patients. Potential low responder patients will be subjected to an standardized ovarian hyperstimulation protocol - Phase II: (Randomized) those patients, once confirmed as low responders, will be offered the opportunity to enter the interventional part of the study, being randomized to three different treatment groups: estradiol, testosterone or combined progestagens and estrogens prior to the IVF-ICSI cycle. The previous cycle (phase I) will be used as a self-control for each patient.</detailed_description>
