	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to address the effectiveness of a modified cavity prevention protocol for 5-9 year-old children which emphasizes better diet modification, more frequent professional fluoride applications, and xylitol product usage based on individual risk status in a 1-year randomized controlled clinical trial in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Tenderloin Community Pediatric Dental Clinic. The investigators hypothesize that the regimen will help to reduce new cavities in children who are at risk for dental cavities.</brief_summary>
