	<brief_summary>Evidence has been documented for the close relationship between the arrhythmia pathogenesis and the gene expression in renin-angiotensin system. However, it remains unclear for involvement of RAS in the pathogenesis of non-familial sick sinus syndrome. The researchers thus investigated the possible relationship between non-familial sick sinus syndrome and the polymorphism and haplotype of the AGT promoter.</brief_summary>
