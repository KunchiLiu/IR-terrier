	<brief_summary>More recent studies have shown that the HBV-infected population has a greater risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, there are still a significant number of people chronically infected by HBV who do not develop the complication. Hence, there exist biological markers that could be indicator for the disease-inducing and carcinogenic potential of the virus.</brief_summary>
