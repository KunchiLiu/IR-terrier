	<criteria>Diagnosis of primary openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Retinal pathology (eg, retinal degeneration), anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or vascular occlusion resulting in poor vision in the study eye. Able to discontinue all intraocularlowering (IOP) medications according to the minimum washout period, based upon the class of medication. Mean washed out IOP ≥ 24 millimeters mercury (mmHg) to ≤ 36 mmHg at 8 AM in the study eye on two separate Eligibility Visits. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Lens/corneal/vitreal opacity preventing adequate posterior segment visualization of the study eye. Current or recent (within 30 days) use of any drug that may prolong the QT interval. Poor vision resulting from advanced glaucoma in the study eye. Intraocular surgery within the past 6 months in the study eye. Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months in the study eye. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
