	<brief_summary>The investigators aim is to understand the cognitive mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of delusions of control (the belief that one's own actions or thoughts are controlled by an external force). These symptoms are mainly encountered in patients with schizophrenia, and the investigators will distinguish patients with schizophrenia with or without this symptom together with patients with bipolar disorder. Based on the investigators previous studies, this project will help to determine the role of two elementary mechanisms in the ability to feel in control of voluntary actions: (1) the processing of the sensory consequences of action, and (2) the ability to build mental representations for sequenced actions.</brief_summary>
