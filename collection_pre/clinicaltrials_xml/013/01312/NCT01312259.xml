	<brief_summary>Purpose: 1. To demonstrate better symptoms control (pain, urinary urgency and frequency) with sacral neuromodulation (SNM) in patients with interstitial cystitis /painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) using a stimulation frequency of 40 hertz (experimental) compared to a frequency of 14 hertz (standard). 2. The evaluate the efficacy of the two frequency settings on the other associated conditions that often coexist in patients with IC/PBS, such as female sexual dysfunction (FSD), bowel dysfunction, high tone pelvic floor dysfunction (HTPFD, painful spasm of the pelvic floor muscles), Vulvodynia (pain at the opening of the vagina).</brief_summary>
