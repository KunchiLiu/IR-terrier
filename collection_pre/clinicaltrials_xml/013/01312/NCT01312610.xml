	<brief_summary>This study is investigating the effect of 8 weeks of orange juice supplementation on executive function in healthy older adults. The study is a controled, double-blind, crossover trial and involves a 8 week supplementation with a high flavonone orange juice and a carbohydrate-matched control. Volunteers consume 500ml of either the test juice or the control juice per day for an 8 week period. There is then an 8 week washout period before subjects proceed to the other arm of the study. Subjects are randomly assigned to either arm at the beginning of the study. Measures of cognitive function will be administered pre and post both test and control interventions. Blood pressure will also be measured and blood and urine samples will be collected to assess absorption of from the juice. A sub-sample of volunteers will undergo MRI imaging pre- and post intervention to acquire cerebral blow flow information.</brief_summary>
