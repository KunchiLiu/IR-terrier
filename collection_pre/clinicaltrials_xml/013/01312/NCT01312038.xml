	<brief_summary>This study is designed to measure the effects of a chewable Simethicone tablet taken by mouth on middle-ear pressure in adults with a common cold and evidence of abnormal middle-ear pressure. In children and adults, middle-ear diseases such as otitis media (the buildup of fluid within the middle ear) and a form of temporary hearing loss occur if the Eustachian tube does not open, does not open often enough or is always open. Simethicone, available over-the-counter under several brand names including Gas-X, may help break up the bubbles that may block the opening of the Eustachian tube in the back of the nose during a cold, allowing air to pass between the nose and middle ear. This study requires a single visit to the Middle Ear Physiology Laboratory in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. If eligible for the study, Eustachian tube function testing will be done; the Simethicone tablet or placebo (a tablet that looks and tastes like the Simethicone tablet but has no active ingredient) will be given and Eustachian tube function testing repeated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For the Eustachian tube function testing, the subject and a technician are seated comfortably within a pressure chamber, a room-like chamber in which the air pressure can be varied much like in an airplane or submarine. Middle ear pressure will be measured in each ear by tympanometry, a test done by inserting a small probe (an earplug attached to a rubber or plastic tube that measures ear pressure) half-way into the ear canal and changing the pressure in the probe. Then, microphones will be placed in the ear canals and a sound source placed into one nostril. The chamber pressure is then decreased and increased to various pressures and middle ear pressure is measured at these various pressures.</detailed_description>
