	<brief_summary>1. To test whether chronic intermittent cold exposure is more effective in programmed body weight loss when compared to conventional programmed weight loss. 2. To measure the metabolic responses (e.g. in the white and brown adipose tissue, muscle and circulating markers) of treatment with chronic intermittent cold exposure and conventional treatment 3. To measure tissue specific changes of weight loss and the treatment with chronic intermittent cold exposure in glucose uptake rate in adipose organ (white and brown adipose tissue), liver, myocardium, skeletal muscle and brain 4. To measure tissue specific biochemical indicators before and after treatment with chronic intermittent cold exposure from white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. 5. To compare changes in body composition and fat distribution after weight loss using chronic cold exposure or using conventional method</brief_summary>
