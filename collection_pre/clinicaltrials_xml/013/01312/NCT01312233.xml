	<brief_title>Collaborative Care for Older Adults With Back Pain (COCOA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As America ages, cost‐effective care for chronic diseases, such as low back pain, becomes more important. Although estimates vary, 70‐85% of Americans will suffer from back pain at some point in their lives. Back pain is well established as one of the most common reasons for seeking care from a medical doctor. The American public also turns to alternative medicine providers, such as doctors of chiropractic, for back pain care. However, few clinical examples and little scientific evidence exist of care coordination between these two provider groups in general, and none that specifically target older adults above the age of 65. The purpose of the Collaborative Care for Older Adults with Back Pain (COCOA) Clinical Trial is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and feasibility of a collaborative care model (medical and chiropractic care) through a pragmatic, prospective pilot trial conducted with 120 older adults over the age of 65 with low back pain of at least 1 month duration. Participants will be randomized to 3-parallel treatment arms: a) conventional medical care (MED CARE), b) unlinked conventional medical and chiropractic care (DUAL CARE), and c) a co-management model including conventional medical and chiropractic care (SHARED CARE). Participants in all three groups will receive up to 12 weeks of usual back pain treatment from medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy (MD/DO) at Genesis Family Medical Center. Participants in two treatment groups additionally will receive up to 12 weeks of usual chiropractic care for back pain from doctors of chiropractic at the Palmer Research Clinic. Outcomes including pain, disability and secondary outcomes will be measured at 1, 2, and 3 months (primary endpoint) with follow-up assessments completed by telephone at 6, 9, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
