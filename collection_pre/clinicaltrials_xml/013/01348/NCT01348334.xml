	<brief_title>Synthetic Mesh Materials In Sling Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Broad based double forced sling operations were performed in 144 patients by using 3 different types of mesh materials between 2004 and 2007. Group I consisted of 48 patients in whom Vypromesh® (Ethicon,USA) was used; Group II consisted of 48 patients in whom Ultrapromesh®( Ethicon,USA) and Group III consisted of 48 patients in whom Prolene light mesh® (Johnson&amp;Johnson,USA) was used. The data of the patients and the success of the operation were evaluated based on 24hr pad test, ICIQ-SF scoring, and Korman questionnaire analysis. Main outcome measures:The Ultrapromesh® synthetic sling procedures have lower complications incidence and higher success rates than the other synthetic slings in 3-year follow-up.</detailed_description>
