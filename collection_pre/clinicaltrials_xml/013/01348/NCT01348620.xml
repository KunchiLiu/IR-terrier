	<brief_summary>This is a single-institution, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Subjects determined to need a cholecystectomy will be consented for surgery and study participation prior to enrollment in this study. Patients will then be randomized to receive either a single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy or a four port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Port Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Versus Four Port Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: Impact on Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main advantages of laparoscopic surgery are reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and the cosmetic result. Although reduced, however, pain is still substantial and constitutes the main clinical problem after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in particular for future daily planned procedures. Recently, a new technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been developed, in which all instruments are inserted through the same port placed in the umbilical incision. This technique for cholecystectomy has been proved to be feasible and safe by several studies. The purpose of the study is to compare postoperative pain, operating time, cosmetic result, between one port and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
