	<brief_summary>This is a first-in-human trial of spinal derived stem cells transplanted into the spinal cord of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The goal of the study is to see if the cells and the procedure to transplant them are safe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Spinal Cord Derived Neural Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>These stem cells are called Human Spinal Stem Cells (HSSC) and have been engineered from the spinal cord of a single fetus electively aborted after 8 weeks of gestation. The tissue was obtained with the mother's consent. The cells will be transplanted into the ALS patient's spinal cord after laminectomy, an operation that removes bone surrounding the spine. After the spinal cord is exposed, a device manufactured for this purpose will be mounted onto the patient and will hold a syringe filled with the cells. The syringe will have a needle attached and the needle will enter the spinal cord in specified areas. The device will minimize trauma to the spinal cord by the needle by making the puncture precise and steady and injecting the material at a slow and steady speed. ALS is a universally fatal neurodegenerative condition that causes weakness leading to paralysis and death. Life expectancy is 2-5 years. The cause is unknown and there is no effective treatment. Previous research has shown that on autopsy, ALS patients are found to have increased levels of the amino acid glutamate accumulated in the brain and spinal cord. This increase is thought to be caused by a decrease in the glutamate transporter which normally "cleans up" glutamate from the cells. Because the HSSC are human in origin, their transplantation will be handled in some ways like other organ transplants in that patients will receive immunosuppressive medications to prevent the rejection of the cells. Right before and immediately after surgery patients will receive infusions of a drug called basiliximab. After surgery they will take prednisone and be tapered off that medication over one month. They will also be given two other immunosuppressive agents, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil after surgery and it is expected that the patients will take these drugs for the rest of their lives.</detailed_description>
