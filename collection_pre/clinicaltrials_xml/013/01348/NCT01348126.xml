	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining ganetespib (STA-9090) with docetaxel is more effective than docetaxel alone in the treatment of subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ganetespib (STA-9090) + Docetaxel in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary signals of clinical activity of ganetespib as a single agent have been observed in NSCLC. A novel approach to treatment of NSCLC is the combination of Hsp90 inhibitors, such as ganetespib, and taxanes. Such combinations have shown potential for synergy in preclinical and clinical evaluations with other Hsp90 inhibitors. Preclinical studies with ganetespib and taxanes have indicated that the combination of these drugs was more effective than either drug alone at inducing cell death, and an ongoing phase 1 study indicates that the combination is well tolerated and warrants systematic evaluation in a larger study.</detailed_description>
