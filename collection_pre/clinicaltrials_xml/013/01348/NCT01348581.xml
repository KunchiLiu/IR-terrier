	<brief_summary>The clinical study is designed to assess the effectiveness, safety and non-immunogenicity of fish skin wound dressing extracellular matrix (ECM) in treating chronic wounds. The wound dressing is indicated for the management of difficult to heal and chronic wounds. The matrix is cut to fit the wound and is applied to the wound bed. An absorptive secondary dressing is put on top. Further dressing of the wound depends on the etiology. The indications for use are: - partial and full-thickness wounds - pressure ulcers - venous ulcers - diabetic ulcers - chronic vascular ulcers - tunneled/undermined wounds - trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second-degree burns, and skin tears)</brief_summary>
