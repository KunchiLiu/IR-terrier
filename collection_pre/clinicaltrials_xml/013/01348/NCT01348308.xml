	<brief_summary>The objective of the OPTIMAL study is to demonstrate that the adjunction of Maraviroc to a combination of antiretroviral therapy in naive and late diagnosed HIV-1 infected patients counts may accelerate the kinetics of immune restoration and decrease the risk of disease progression and death. It is a randomized, versus placebo, double-blind trial, conducted in France, Spain and Italy.</brief_summary>
