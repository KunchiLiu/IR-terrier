	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, open label, prospective, two phase pharmacokinetic study. Subjects currently attending for HIV care at St. Mary's Hospital, London will be eligible. The study will describe the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters and short term safety of maraviroc/darunavir/ritonavir dosed at 150/800/100 mg once daily with and without tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected subjects. Fifteen HIV-1 infected subjects will be recruited. Eligible subjects will currently be receiving antiretroviral therapy comprising: - tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg daily plus - darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily On day 1, subjects will modify their current antiretroviral therapy to the following: - tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg daily plus - darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily plus - maraviroc 150 mg daily On day 10 subjects will undergo an intensive pharmacokinetic visit. On day 11, subjects will modify their current antiretroviral therapy to the following: - darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily plus - maraviroc 150 mg daily (i.e. tenofovir/emtricitabine will be discontinued) On day 20 subjects will undergo an intensive pharmacokinetic visit. Following completion of this study phase, subjects will recommence their usual antiretroviral treatment regimen and attend for a study follow up visit.</brief_summary>

Male subjects who are heterosexually active must use two forms of barrier contraception (e.g., condom with spermicide) during heterosexual intercourse, from screening through completion of the study. Have no serologic evidence of active HBV infection evidenced by negative hepatitis B surface antigen and no serologic evidence of hepatitis C virus infection evidenced by a negative HCV antibody at screening. Have screening laboratory results (haematology and chemistry that fall within the normal range of the central laboratory's reference ranges unless the results have been determined by the Investigator to have no clinical significance CCR5 tropic HIV virus based on a genotypic tropism assay from either a stored plasma sample where available or fresh plasma current alcohol abuse or drug dependence positive urine drug of abuse screening pregnancy active opportunistic infection or significant comorbidities current disallowed concomitant medication</criteria>
