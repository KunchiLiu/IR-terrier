	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Endologix Fenestrated Stent Graft System for the endovascular repair of juxtarenal or pararenal aortic aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility and Safety Study of the Endologix Fenestrated Stent Graft System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Endologix Fenestrated Stent Graft System that will be used in this study has three components, listed below: 1. Endologix unibody bifurcated stent graft 2. Endologix fenestrated proximal extension stent graft 3. Endologix renal stent graft</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adequate iliac/femoral access compatible with the required delivery systems Nonaneurysmal infrarenal aortic neck &lt;15mm in length Most caudal renal artery to aortoiliac bifurcation length &gt;= 70 SMA to aortoiliac bifurcation length &gt;=90mm Proximal nonaneurysmal aortic neck below the SMA with diameter 18 to 34 mm, length &gt;=15mm and angle &lt;=60° to the aneurysm sac Angle &lt;=60° (clock face) between the SMA and CA Renal arteries both at or below the SMA by &lt;=35mm and within 30mm of each other axially, with 4 to 8mm lumen diameter, and with clockface angle of 90° to 210° to each other Common iliac artery distal fixation site with: distal fixation length &gt;=15mm, with diameter &gt;=10 mm and &lt;=23 mm and angle &lt;=90° to the aortic bifurcation Ability to preserve at least one hypogastric artery Life expectancy &lt;2 years as judged by the investigator Psychiatric or other condition that may interfere with the study Participating in the enrollment or 30day followup phase of another clinical study Known allergy to any device component Coagulopathy or uncontrolled bleeding disorder Contraindication to contrast media or anticoagulants Ruptured, leaking, or mycotic aneurysm Aortic dissection Serum creatinine (SCr) level &gt;2.0 mg/dL Traumatic vascular injury Active systemic or localized groin infection Connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's Syndrome) Recent(within prior three months)cerebrovascular accident Recent(within prior three months)myocardial infarction Prior renal transplant Length of either renal artery to be stented &lt;12mm Significant occlusive disease or calcification of either renal artery (&gt;70%) An essential accessory renal artery Indispensable inferior mesenteric artery Untreated aneurysmal disease of the descending thoracic aorta Clinically significant mural thrombus circumferentially in the suprarenal segment Prior iliac artery stent implanted that may interfere with delivery system introduction Unsuitable vascular anatomy Pregnancy</criteria>
