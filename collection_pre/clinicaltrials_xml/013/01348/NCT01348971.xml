	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral sodium nitrate administration prior to coronary artery bypass surgery can reduce perioperative levels of troponin T. In addition, plasma and urine surrogate markers of renal, hepatic and brain injury will be monitored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Artery Bypass and Nitrate Oral Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator in the cardiovascular system and has been shown to have protective properties in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Inorganic nitrate, an oxidation product from endogenous NO production and also a constituent in green leafy vegetables, can be recycled, via nitrite, back to bioactive NO in the body. Recent research has shown beneficial effects of nitrate and nitrite in animal models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Moreover, dietary nitrate reduces blood pressure and oxygen cost during exercise in humans. During coronary bypass surgery the heart undergoes ischemia-reperfusion injury and troponin T is most often released from the myocardium. The aim of the present study is to investigate if preoperative inorganic nitrate, in doses easily achievable from the diet, can affect troponin T release as well as other surrogate markers of injury to the liver, kidneys and the brain. In addition, plasma and urine samples will be collected for markers of oxidative stress and inflammation (sCRP and cytokines). Patients planned for bypass surgery who give their written informed consent will, the night before surgery, get a standardized, low-nitrate meal where after they receive sodium nitrate on two occasions preoperatively; the night before and in the morning before surgery. Plasma and urine samples will be collected at various time points up to 72 hours after surgery.</detailed_description>
