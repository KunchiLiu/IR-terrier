	<brief_title>Comparing Liquid Versus Solid Forms of Sugars and Whey Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three randomized cross-over design experiments were used to compare the effect of solid and liquid forms of gelatin (6 g) in experiment 1, sucrose (75 g) and a mixture of 50% glucose/ 50% fructose (G50:F50) in experiment 2, and acid and sweet whey protein (50 g) in experiment 3 on healthy normal weight males . The controls were water (experiment 1 and 3) and calorie-free sweetened water with gelatin (sweet gelatin, experiment 1) or without gelatin (sweet control, experiment 2). Subjective average appetite was measured by visual analogue scales frequently over 1 h and ad libitum food intake was measured 1 h after the treatment consumptions.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy lean males with BMI between 18 24.9 kg/m2 and an age range of 19 to 28 years were recruited for the three experiments. Diabetics (fasting blood glucose â‰¥ 7.0 mmol/L), smokers, breakfast skippers or dieters were excluded from the experiments. Individuals under medications or with a history of liver or kidney disease and major medical or surgical event within the last six months were excluded.</criteria>
