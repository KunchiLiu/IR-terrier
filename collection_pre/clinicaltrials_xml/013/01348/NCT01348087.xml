	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data for AFQ056 in eligible adult patients with FXS who have participated in the CAFQ056A2212 (NCT01253629).study and patients who have participated in the previous proof-of-concept study CAFQ056A2204 (NCT00718341).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of AFQ056 in Adult Patients With Fragile X Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 148 patients were enrolled into this treatment extension trial conducted for at least 3 years. This extension trial was terminated after the decision to terminate the AFQ056 development program. The decision was based on the results of two randomized, double blind, placebo controlled phase IIb trials in adult and adolescent FXS patients (CAFQ056A2212 and CAFQ056B2214respectivly), both of which failed to demonstrate efficacy in the FXS population. As this extension trial was terminated, only the primary objective and safety are represented.</detailed_description>
