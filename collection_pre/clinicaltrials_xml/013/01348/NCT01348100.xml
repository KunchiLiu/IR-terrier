	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a 3-part trial to evaluate the safety of a novel depot formulation of iloperidone, compare 2 depot dosage forms, and perform dose ranging of 1 chosen form in support of a monthly depot dosing regimen. In Phase A, the study is designed to evaluate the safety of a crystalline iloperidone depot formulation. In Phase B, the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of 2 depot clinical dosage forms will be compared, and 1 form will be selected for assessment in Phase C. Phase C of this study is designed to define the dose-exposure relationship of the selected form and to provide information that will permit a comparison of the risk-benefit ratio of several doses of the study drug to enable optimal dose selection for later studies.</brief_summary>
