	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Single Rising Oral Doses of BI 137882 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a transition from preclinical investigations to clinical development in this first-in-man trial, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BI 137882 will be assessed in healthy male volunteers using single rising oral doses in order to provide the basis for a potential ongoing clinical development of BI 137882 in the indication of COPD. Healthy male subjects aged 21 - 50 years will be recruited for this study. They provide a relatively stable physiological, biochemical and hormonal basis (steady state) for studying drug effects, they show no disease-related variation and they are not taking concomitant medication. Within each dose group, all actively treated individuals will receive the same BI 137882 dose. The next higher dose will only be administered if the treatment in the preceding dose group was safe and well tolerated.</detailed_description>

History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) 9. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial 10. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial 12. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes /day) 13. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days 14. Alcohol abuse (more than 20 g/day) 15. Drug abuse 16. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) 17. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the trial) 18. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 19. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site 20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms); 21. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de points (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)</criteria>
