	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Dose Proportionality Study of Canagliflozin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study where healthy volunteers will know the name and dose of assigned treatment and will be randomly assigned to take a single oral (by mouth) dose of canagliflozin sequentially in each of 3 treament periods where the dose in each treatment period will be different (referred to as a 3-period crossover study) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of 3 dose levels of canagliflozin. Healthy volunteers will take a single oral tablet of canagliflozin 50 mg (Treatment A), 100 mg (Treatment B), and 300 mg (Treatment C) during the study; a different dose will be taken in each treatment period. Study drug will be taken in the a.m. on Day 1 of Treatment Periods 1, 2, and 3, with a 10- to 14-day washout period between Day 1 of each treatment period. Volunteers will fast (go without food) for at least 10 hours before and up to at least 4 hours after taking study drug.</detailed_description>
