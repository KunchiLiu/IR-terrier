	<brief_summary>This is a non-interventional study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination study drugs in the treatment of participants diagnosed with Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC). CHC participants with confirmed positive hepatitis-C virus (HCV) RNA in plasma, and who have not been previously treated with the Pegylated interferon (PegIntron) Pen, were enrolled into study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety and Efficacy In Hepatitis C Patients After PegIntron Pen Treatment (Study P04896)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with positive genotype-1 HCV RNA received 48 weeks of treatment of PegIntron Pen plus ribavirin and 24 weeks of follow-up. Participants who were non-genotype-1 HCV RNA positive received 24 weeks of treatment of PegIntron Pen plus ribavirin and 24 weeks of follow-up. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to measure the satisfaction and the use of training materials of PegIntron pen using a 1-5 score system provided in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed once at first follow-up visit. Efficacy measurements for sustained viral response HCV RNA was collected at week-24 of treatment and at week-24 of follow-up in positive Non-genotype-1 HCV RNA participants. Efficacy measurements for sustained viral response HCV RNA was collected at week-24 and at week-48 of treatment, and at week-24 of follow-up, for positive Genotype-1 HCV RNA participants.</detailed_description>
