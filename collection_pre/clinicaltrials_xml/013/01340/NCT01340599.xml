	<brief_title>Defined Green Tea Catechin Extract in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the short-term effects of daily Polyphenon E (defined green tea catechin extract) administration (800 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate [EGCG] once daily [QD]) during the interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (approximately 6 weeks) in men with localized prostate cancer. II. Compare the change in levels of intermediate biomarkers (Ki-67, B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl2], cyclin D, KiP1/P27, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and cluster of differentiation [CD]31) in biopsy (pre-treatment) and prostatectomy (post-treatment) specimens collected from subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and prostatectomy. III. Compare the change in pre- and post-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and prostatectomy. IV. Evaluate bioavailability of catechins from Polyphenon E (plasma and tissue catechin levels, catechin metabolites in urine). V. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Polyphenon E in this subject population. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive defined green tea catechin extract orally (PO) QD for 4-10 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical prostatectomy between days 28-70. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 4-10 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical prostatectomy between days 28-70. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
