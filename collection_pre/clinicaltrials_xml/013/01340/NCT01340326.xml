	<brief_summary>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan ameliorate ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). Although the amount of those drugs used in previous clinical trials, therefore recommended in practical guidelines is maximum clinical dose, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether the recommended dose is more efficacious compared to lower dose commonly used in clinical practice. In addition, the impact of genetic polymorphism in neurohormonal system on the pharmacological effect has not been explored in the setting of post-MI remodeling. Therefore, the investigators evaluate whether submaximal dose, which are lower than those in major pivotal trials but typically used in clinical practice, can offer similar benefit in post-MI ventricular remodeling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Dose of Angiotensin-receptor Blocker Valsartan and Genetic Polymorphism on the Post-MI Ventricular Remodeling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 1116 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction following the first episode of acute ST-elevation MI are to be enrolled and randomized to maximal tolerable dose (up to 320 mg/day) or usual dose (80 mg/day) of valsartan for 12 months in 2:1 ratio. Echocardiographic analysis for quantifying post-MI ventricular remodeling and genotyping of blood samples are conducted in central core laboratory. Clinical assessment and laboratory test are performed at fixed times, and genetic polymorphisms of the patients are tested at the time of admission.</detailed_description>
