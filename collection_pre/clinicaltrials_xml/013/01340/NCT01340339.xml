	<brief_title>Reverse Phototherapy With Super Light-emitting Diode(Super-LED) for Hyperbilirubinemia in Term and Late Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with hospitalized infants in the Professor Fernando Figueira Medicine Institute(IMIP), who require phototherapy as an indication of the medical team. Following the sample calculation, 144 patients will be randomized according to gestational age (350/7-376/7 or 380/7-416/7 weeks) to receive super-LED reverse phototherapy or fluorescent reverse phototherapy with spectral irradiance of 8-12 microwatts/cm2/nm.The bilirubin will be determined by micromethod with bilirubinometer, after blood collection in heparinized capillary until bilirubin reaches level that indicates suspension of therapy.</detailed_description>
