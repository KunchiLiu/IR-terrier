	<brief_title>Relationship Between Gestational Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing public health problem owing to its prevalence as well as its high morbidity and mortality rates. The identification of high-risk populations is of great importance particularly because the onset of T2D can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle modifications. Among high-risk populations, women with previously diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at particularly high risk of developing T2D. The success in reducing the occurrence of T2D among women with previous GDM could be achieved only if appropriate preventive measures are undertaken. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing body weight and increasing physical activity are recommended and women are encouraged to be breastfeeding their infants. Certain factors have been suggested as determinants of behavioral practices in women with prior GDM including cognitive and environmental factors. A better understanding of these issues is essential for developing effective preventive strategies and possibly reducing the prevalence of T2D in the population. Moreover, in utero exposure to maternal impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes may increase the risk of developing overweight or diabetes in offspring. Since March 2012 we thus test the presence of childhood metabolic alterations predictive of future T2D in GDM-exposed and unexposed offspring and investigate environmental factors during the postnatal period that are associated with prevention of metabolic alterations.</detailed_description>
