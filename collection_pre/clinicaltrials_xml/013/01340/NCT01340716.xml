	<brief_title>Effects of Tai Chi Chuan in Patients After Recent Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background:Patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) present a reduction in functional capacity expressed as a decrease in peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak). The impact of a Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) cardiac rehabilitation program for patients recovering from recent MI has yet to be assessed. Our goal is to evaluate functional capacity after a TCC-based cardiac rehabilitation program in patients with recent MI. Methods: A single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted. The researchers who performed the tests were blinded to group allocation. Between the 14th and 21st days after hospital discharge, all patients performed a cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a laboratory blood workup. Mean age was similar (56 ± 9 years in the TCC group and 60 ± 9 years in the control group). Patients allocated to the intervention group performed 3 weekly sessions of TCC Beijin style for 12 weeks (n = 31). The control group participated in 3 weekly sessions of full-body stretching exercises (n = 30).</detailed_description>
