	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of vitrectomy, without gas tamponade or laser photocoagulation to the margin of the optic nerve, for the treatment of macular detachment associated with optic disc pits and to characterize retinal manifestations during treatment of optic pit maculopathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Vitrectomy with induction of a PVD at the optic disc without gas tamponade or laser photocoagulation appears to be an effective method of managing macular detachment due to optic disc pits. OCT scanning pre- and postoperatively suggests that peripapillary vitreous traction with the passage of fluid into the retina through the pit is the cause of the schisis-like separation seen in optic disc pit maculopathy.</brief_summary>
