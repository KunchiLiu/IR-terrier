	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this investigation is to describe perioperative thrombin generation in neonates undergoing placement of a Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt to better understand the coagulation changes that precipitate postoperative shunt occlusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Thrombin Generation Changes in Neonates Undergoing Placement of a Blalock-Taussig Shunt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To accomplish our goal, the investigators will measure preoperative levels of one major procoagulant (prothrombin) and one major anticoagulant (Antithrombin). The investigators will also measure preoperative and postoperative thrombelastograms (TEG) and preoperative and postoperative thrombin generation curves (TGC).</detailed_description>
