	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether surgery is more effective with or without radiation therapy in treating nonmetastatic retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy followed by surgery to see how well it works compared with surgery alone in treating patients with previously untreated nonmetastatic retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy in Untreated Nonmetastatic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess whether there is a difference in abdominal recurrence-free survival between retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma patients undergoing curative intent surgery alone and those undergoing preoperative radiotherapy followed by curative-intent surgery. Secondary - To assess whether there is a difference in metastasis-free survival, abdominal recurrence-free interval, and overall survival between these patients. - To assess tumor response in patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy. - To assess toxicity of preoperative radiotherapy given prior to curative-intent surgery in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution and WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor mass within 4 weeks following randomization. - Arm II: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (RT) or intensity-modulated RT within 8 weeks after randomization. RT continues 5 days a week for approximately 5.5 weeks. Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor mass within 4-8 weeks after the completion of RT. Tumor tissue, normal abdominal wall fat, and peripheral blood may be collected during surgery to identify new prognostic factors for translational research. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at day 60 post-surgery and every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) by local pathologist, imagingguided or surgical biopsy, including the following: Primary soft tissue sarcoma of retroperitoneal space or infraperitoneal spaces of pelvis Sarcoma not originated from bone structure, abdominal, or gynecological viscera Unifocal tumor (not multifocal disease) Absence of extension through the sciatic notch or across the diaphragm The following histological subtypes are not allowed: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) Rhabdomyosarcomas Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) or other small round blue cells sarcoma Osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma Aggressive fibromatosis Sarcomatoid or metastatic carcinoma No metastatic disease Untreated disease Tumor must be operable and suitable for radiotherapy, based on the following criteria: Pretreatment CT scan/MRI and multidisciplinary consultation with surgeon, radiation oncologist, and radiologist (anticipated macroscopically complete resection, R0/R1 resection) No surgery anticipated to be R2 on the CT scan before randomization Must have American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score ≤ 2 None of the following unresectable criteria: Involvement of superior mesenteric artery Involvement of aorta Involvement of bone Must have radiologically measurable disease (RECIST 1.1), as confirmed by abdominopelvic CT (with IV and PO contrast) or MRI (with IV contrast) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: WHO performance status 02 WBC ≥ 2,500/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 80,000/mm^3 Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit normal Calculated creatinine clearance normal Functional contralateral kidney to the side involved by the RPS as assessed by intravenous pyelogram Adequate cardiac function (NYHA class III) ECG normal (without clinically significant abnormalities) No history of any of the following disorders: Bowel obstruction Mesenteric ischemia Severe chronic inflammatory bowel disease Negative pregnancy test Not pregnant or nursing concurrently and for at least 1 month after the surgery Fertile patients must use effective contraception during the study treatment period and for at least 1 month after the surgery No coexisting malignancy within the past 5 years, except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix No psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior surgery (excluding diagnosis biopsy), radiotherapy, or systemic therapy No prior abdominal or pelvic irradiation for another prior malignancy or other disease No concurrent systemic anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, moleculartargeted therapy) No postoperative radiotherapy planned</criteria>
