	<brief_summary>This project will modify Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT; n=15) and Alanon/Naranon Facilitation (ANF; n=15) for use with parents who are concerned about an out-of-treatment adolescent. ANF was selected as a comparison because Alanon and Naranon are the most commonly available method for helping family members. The investigators will compare CRAFT for parents (CRAFT-P) (n=77) and ANF (n=77) to determine if there is a significant difference in adolescent treatment entry. Parents will attend a maximum of 18 sessions with a family specialist and also complete questionnaires periodically over a 12-month period. Parents' adolescents will have the opportunity to participate in the study by completing questionnaires at the same time points as their parent. Our primary hypothesis asks whether participants who are enrolled in the CRAFT-P condition will report more adolescent treatment entry than the ANF condition. Our secondary hypotheses examine: 1) reductions in adolescent substance use and behavior problems in the CRAFT-P group compared to the ANF condition, 2) improvements in parenting skills in the CRAFT-P group compared to the ANF condition and 3) significant pre to post treatment effects for improvements in social functioning, mood, and in parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data suggest that as many as 60% of parents who are aware and concerned about their adolescent's substance use are unable to get them into treatment without assistance (Szapocznik et al., 1988) and very little research has examined methods to help them. Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) was developed to help family members foster treatment entry of treatment-resistant adults, but it has not been tested in a controlled trial with parents of substance-abusing adolescents. This project will modify CRAFT (CRAFT-P) and Alanon/Naranon Facilitation (ANF) for use with parents who are concerned about an out-of-treatment adolescent. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the CRAFT-P program in helping parents to: 1) facilitate treatment entry of their child, 2) achieve the outcomes they desire for their adolescents, 3) improve parenting skills in general and in acquisition of CRAFT knowledge in particular, and 4) improve their own mood and functioning. In addition the investigators will examine parents whose child entered treatment to estimate effect sizes of the new CRAFT methods for facilitating parent-supported treatment retention and aftercare engagement in community-based settings. Finally, if the CRAFT program appears efficacious, additional translational work will be initiated in collaboration with the Partnership at Drugfree.org (formerly the Partnership for a Drug-Free America) to provide parents with direct access to components of the CRAFT program. A Stage II two-group randomized controlled clinical trial will compare CRAFT-P vs ANF. The investigators will collect data from approximately 308 participants (154 parents and 154 adolescents) and each participant will be involved in the study for a maximum of 12 months. The total enrollment number is not exact because it is possible that some adolescents will decline to participate. Parents will be screened to determine their eligibility. If eligible and interested in participating in the study, the parent will then provide informed consent and give permission for their adolescent to participate in the study. Parents will be randomized to one of the two interventions, CRAFT-P or ANF. Each session will be audio-recorded and stored so that the investigators can complete on-going monitoring to minimize condition bleeding and protect against trainer drift. In addition to completing screening and baseline assessments, parents and adolescents will complete full assessment batteries at 3-, 6-, &amp; 12-months post-baseline. The adolescents' research participation involves completing the assessment battery only and these data will be compared to parent reports to examine consistency.</detailed_description>
