	<brief_summary>This study hypothesizes that renal transplantation candidates are diagnosed with significant Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) equal with non-invasive modalities as with invasive modalities. Therefore the investigators are investigating the ability of coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), acoustic CAD Patch and combination hereof to detect CAD as defined by invasive Coronary angiography (CAG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACToR-study : Angiographic CT of Renal Transplantation Candidate - Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. After renal transplantation one-half of all deaths are cardiac, usually in the first 5 years in the presence of a functional graft. Because of this renal transplantation candidates are undergoing cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification. There is no consensus regarding which modality should be use for detection of CAD in this cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification. CAG is known as gold standard but is a invasive procedure with risk of complication. The investigators wish to investigate the ability of detecting CAD as defined by invasive Coronary angiography (CAG) by clinical examination, blood test and non-invasive test (cCTA, MPS and acoustic CAD Patch). The investigators hypothesize that a single modality or combination of these with high sensitivity and specificity could diagnose significant CAD without the need of further invasive procedures. This study will include 150 renal transplantations candidate.</detailed_description>
