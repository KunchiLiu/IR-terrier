	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study evaluating the use of tumor derived exosomes as a marker for response to therapy in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer. Tumor derived exosome analysis may be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biosignature in breast cancer, which could prove to be a tool for earlier diagnosis, more effective treatments, and improved markers of response in order to increase survival rates.</brief_summary>
