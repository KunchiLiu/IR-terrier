	<brief_summary>Full conditioning of the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopic surgery will decrease post-operative pain, inflammation and adhesion formation. Full conditioning will decrease an inflammatory response of the peritoneum and decrease pain and adhesion formation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peritoneal Cavity Conditioning Decreases Pain, Inflammation and Adhesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing carbon dioxide to full conditioning (addition of oxygen, nitrous oxide, humidification and temperature control, dexamethasone and Hyalobarrier gel) Women undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis, myomectomy or adhesiolysis will be randomized to either group and will be compared for pain (VAS scores); inflammation (White blood cells, CRP) and adhesions scored by second look laparoscopy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>women undergoing laparoscopic excision of deep endometriosis (stratum 1), excision of endometrioma's (stratum 2) or excision of uterine myoma's (stratum 3) since this is severe surgery, associated with severe postoperative adhesions and since for most of these women fertility is important and hence the second look laparoscopy can be beneficial. Signed informed consent women with a preexisting condition increasing the risk of surgery such as clotting disorders, heart or lung impairment etc.Any condition that might interfere with inflammatory parameters such as immunodeficiency, chronic inflammatory disease as Crohn's disease. Pregnancy Conditions associated with chronic pain as peripheral neuropathy, pathology of the vertebral column and osteoarticular disease. Conditions causing acute pain e.g. abdominal trauma a known allergic reaction to Hyalobarrier Gel EndoÂ® A bowel lesion requiring a single or double layer suture. (given that for none of the antiadhesion barriers safety has been proven following bowel lesions and suture)</criteria>
