	<brief_summary>This observational study will assess factors leading to dose reductions/treatment discontinuations and the effect on sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving a long-acting interferon (e.g. Pegasys/peginterferon alfa-2a) and ribavirin. Data will be collected from each patient for the duration of their treatment and for up to 6 months thereafter.</brief_summary>
