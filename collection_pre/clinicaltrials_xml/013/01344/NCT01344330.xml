	<brief_summary>This research study will assess cruciferous vegetable intake in patients presenting for screening colonoscopy and correlate intake with histone status and histone deacetylace (HDAC) expression in tissue biopsy specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The investigators will also measure sulforaphane (SFN) metabolites in blood as a biomarker of cruciferous vegetable intake.</brief_summary>
