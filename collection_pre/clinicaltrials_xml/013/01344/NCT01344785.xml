	<brief_title>The Effect of Loss of Offset After Pertrochanteric Fracture Treated With a Intramedullary Nail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intertrochanteric fractures are common fractures in which severe complications such as non-union, implant cut-out and postoperative wound-infections occur at very low rates with modern surgical techniques. While severe complications are rare, the patient reported outcome is less satisfactory with roughly half of the patients complain of thigh pain and others failing to regain their walking ability. The current leading methods for osteosynthesis of intertrochanteric fractures are intramedullary (IM) nails and sliding hip screws (SHS). Over the period 1998 to 2007 the use of IM nails for pertrochanteric fractures increased from 5% to 20% in Sweden, at the expense of the use of SHS (5). IM nailing has also become more common at our clinic where we since February 2008 use the 3rd generation of the Gamma nail. In this study we investigate if the increased pain after IM nailing, reduced hip function and life quality may correlate to the compression over the fracture and the lateral protrusion of the intramedullary nail.</detailed_description>
