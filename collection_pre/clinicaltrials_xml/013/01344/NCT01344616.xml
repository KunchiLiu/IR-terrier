	<brief_summary>Timely screening and management of modifiable conditions can reduce preterm births, yet providing effective prenatal risk management systems to meet the unique needs of medically underserved populations is complex. If the proposed system proves to be effective in reducing preterm births it can improve maternal and child quality of life as well as reduce the economic burden of preterm births in the U.S.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a clinic-based, computer-assisted intervention system to significantly reduce preterm births in high-risk populations. This system will: (1) assess a pregnant woman's unique risks in six modifiable areas associated with increased risks of preterm birth including smoking cessation, poor nutrition, domestic violence, maternal depression and stress, urinary and reproductive tract infections and substance use; (2) provide her with tailored advice and action planning tools on reducing her risks; (3) provide her certified nurse midwife or physician with information related to her assessed risks and counseling suggestions tailored for her needs, and [(4) promote effective referrals to, and successful linkages with community-based support organizations.] Because preterm birth rates are much higher for underserved African American women, we are proposing to focus the intervention with this population.</detailed_description>
