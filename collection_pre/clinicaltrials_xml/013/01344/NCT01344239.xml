	<brief_title>Limb Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Reduces Heart and Lung Injury After Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Remote ischaemic preconditioning may confer the cytoprotection in critical organs. We hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce intestinal and pulmonary injury in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.The primary outcomes included the biomarkers reflecting intestinal injury (serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein, endotoxin levels and diamine oxidase activity) and the variables reflecting pulmonary injury (arterial-alveolar oxygen tension ratio, alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference and respiratory index). In addition, the severity of intestinal and pulmonary injury was assessed with different scoring methods, respectively. Markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation were measured as well.</detailed_description>
