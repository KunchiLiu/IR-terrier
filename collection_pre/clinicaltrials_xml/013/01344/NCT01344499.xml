	<brief_title>Clearance Rate of Peritoneal Fluid After Full Conditioning Pneumoperitoneum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoints - to evaluate whether the clearance rate of peritoneal fluid is exponential or linear over time. (absorption rate expected for Adept ~30-60 ml/h) - to evaluate the role of the mesothelial barrier in this clearance rate. Knowing that diffusion to and from peritoneal fluid decreases with increasing molecular weight (MW), our hypothesis is that clearance rate will decrease following peritoneal conditioning. Indeed a decreased mesothelial trauma (either through hypoxia or through denudation) and retraction will expose less the basal membrane Secondary endpoints: -To confirm the decrease in post-operative pain as measured by VAS-score and inflammation as measured by CRP and leucocytosis with the full conditioning of the pneumoperitoneum.</detailed_description>
