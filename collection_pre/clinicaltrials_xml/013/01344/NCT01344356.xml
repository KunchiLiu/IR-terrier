	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the local control rates as well as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of benign and malignant head and neck tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV study includes 3 patient groups to be treated with SBRT: - Benign tumors, such as paraganglioma, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, as the sole treatment or to gross residual disease after maximal safe resection - Malignant tumors, such as nasopharynx cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, after initial external beam radiation (Residual Disease Group) - Unresectable malignant tumors, such as nasopharynx cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinomas, and sarcomas which are recurrent after prior radiation (Primary RT Group) Data collected will include baseline patient demographics, pathology data, radiation therapy procedure, tumor recurrence data, and toxicities. Follow up data will be collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated duration of this study is 5 years.</detailed_description>
