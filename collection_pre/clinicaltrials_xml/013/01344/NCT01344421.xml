	<brief_title>Movement Pattern in Patients With Hip Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital hip dysplasia is a disease characterised by pathological changes in the hip joint. Hip dysplasia is a normal disease with a prevalence of 4.3% in men and 3.6 in woman. Untreated hip dysplasia is a known cause of developing osteoarthritis early in life and symptoms as pain, hip instability together with a changed gait pattern are normal. Symptomatic hip dysplasia is seen in patients between 15 and 55 years and can be unilateral as well as bilateral. Causes of hip dysplasia are described as genetic, mechanic or hormonal. Today patients with hip dysplasia are offered a hip conserving surgery before the osteoarthritis has developed. In 2003 a minimally invasive approach for periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) was introduced at Aarhus University Hospital. An advantage of minimally invasive approach compared to the classical Bernese periacetabular osteotomy is minimal impact of the soft tissues in the hip region. Hip pain and activity limitations highly affect quality of life and physical function. The gait distance is reduced and patients have to compensate to relieve the pressure on the hip joint. Knowledge about the dynamics of the gait and running pattern in patients with dysplasia is important to understand the consequences of the dysplastic hip joint. Furthermore knowledge about gait compensations is relevant for the clinicians in the management and treatment of patients with hip dysplasia. Today, gait and running compensation is unknown after minimally invasive approach The purpose of this study is, therefore, to examine the movement pattern in patients with hip dysplasia preoperative, six and 12 month after minimally invasive approach for Peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO). Secondary to examine the movement pattern in patients compared to healthy controls and historical data.</detailed_description>
