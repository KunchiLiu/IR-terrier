	<brief_title>Anesthetic Efficacy of Gow-Gates Versus Conventional Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management and adequate anesthesia are of critical importance for the endodontist. Traditionally, mandibular teeth are anesthetized via inferior alveolar nerve block (IAN). However, this technique provides a marginal success rate of 19-56% in patients with irreversible pulpitis.Gow Gates technique introduced in 1973 for anesthetizing of mandibular molars with more accuracy, success and safety.</detailed_description>
