	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of whole-body vibration in the presence or absence of localized radiofrequency on body composition in obese female subjects. Moreover, balance and strength tests will be performed. The study hypothesis is that whole-body vibration induces positive changes in body composition i.e., reduction of fat mass and increase of lean mass with associated increase in performance. The possible additive role of radiofrequency will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- recruitment of female obese subjects - baseline assessment (body composition with DXA, blood tests, balance and strength tests) - 3-mo whole body vibration training (2 sessions a week, 30 min per session) with or without local delivery of radiofrequency (two randomly selected groups) - final assessment (body composition with DXA, blood tests, balance and strength tests) - data collation and analysis</detailed_description>
