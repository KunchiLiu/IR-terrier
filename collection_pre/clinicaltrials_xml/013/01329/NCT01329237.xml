	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare strut coverage and neointimal thickness between everolimus eluting (XIENCE-V® or PROMUS® stent) and biolimus A9 eluting NOBORI Stent 14 months after stent implantation and to determine the coronary endothelial function after everolimus eluting (XIENCE-V® or PROMUS® stent) and biolimus A9 eluting NOBORI Stent 14 months after stent implantation by using supine bicycle exercise testing to assess coronary vasomotor response to exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMPARE-II- Vasomotion and Imaging Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN: Imaging and vasomotion Substudy: 50 consecutive patients enrolled in the COMPARE II trial at the University of Fribourg Medical Center will undergo follow-up re-angiography 14 months after index procedure with assessment of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and vasomotion testing. ENDPOINT SUBSTUDY (all at 14 months): Primary endpoint imaging: percentage of uncovered stent struts per lesion and mean neointimal thickness assessed by OCT. vasomotion: coronary vasomotion assessed with quantitative coronary angiography at rest and during supine bicycle exercise.</detailed_description>
