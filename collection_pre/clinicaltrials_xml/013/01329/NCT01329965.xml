	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and feasibility of low dose LPS administration to a small subset of humans in preparation for a larger USDA funded study examining what is the lowest effective dose of EPA + DHA (300, 600, 900 and 1,800 mg/day delivered as fish oil supplements) that significantly attenuates the inflammatory response the investigators wish to examine the effects of an endotoxemia model for inducing inflammation. Based on previous research, low dose LPS administration affects metabolism in humans with only minimal clinical effects (such as "flu" like illness). Therefore, each of the six subjects included in this small pilot study will receive a low dose of LPS and placebo in order to learn more about the metabolic changes that occur during administration and inflammation. The investigators hypothesis that LPS administration will elicit only minimal clinical effects (such as "flu" like illness) when compared to placebo (saline--water with the same amount of salt as in your blood).</brief_summary>
