	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if insulin-like growth factors (IGF) play a role in the development of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study will compare results from genetic testing between patients with AD and two other groups: younger biological family members of the AD patients and individuals without AD matched by age to the AD patients.</brief_summary>
