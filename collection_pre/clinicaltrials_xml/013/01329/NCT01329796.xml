	<brief_summary>Endometriosis is a disease of unknown aetiology that can cause severe dysmenorrhea. An altered immune system with elevated levels of cytokines in the peritoneal fluid as well as increased density of nerve fibres, might explain the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea in endometriosis patients. Lignocaine has anti-inflammatory properties and exerts effect on nerve endings and intra peritoneal macrophages. Pertubation with lignocaine might represent an alternative treatment for endometriosis related dysmenorrhea and avoids the side-effects related to hormonal treatments. A double blind randomized clinical trial, was carried out to evaluate pertubation with lignocaine as a therapy for dysmenorrhea.</brief_summary>
