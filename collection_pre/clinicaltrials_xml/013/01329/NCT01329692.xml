	<brief_summary>Purpose and objective: To identify in the early post-operative period following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients likely to fail to progressively lose weight in expected fashion, and to institute intervention and assess for its efficacy. Study activities and population group: Patients identified to have "poor weight loss" (â‰¤ 11% of excess weight loss) at 1 month will be randomized into a control versus study group. Intervention for subjects randomized to the IV arm will be by enrollment in the Back on Track program. This is a seven-week group education, counseling, nutrition, exercise, and journaling program of the Duke Weight Loss Surgery Center designed to help postoperative bariatric surgery patients who are failing to progressively lose weight resume an expected pattern of weight loss and improved overall outcome. Data analysis and risk/safety: Data will be collected and analyzed by the identified investigators. The goal of data analysis is to uncover any difference in the EWL of subjects who underwent intervention for falling in the lowest EWL quartile when compared with those who did not undergo intervention, and determine the statistical significance of any such difference. There are no physical risks associated with this study. There is, however, the potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential.</brief_summary>
