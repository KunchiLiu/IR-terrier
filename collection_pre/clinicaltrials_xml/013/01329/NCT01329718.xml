	<brief_summary>Epigenomics has identified methylated gene regions that are specific for colorectal cancer (CRC). Through Epigenomics' marker discovery and validation process Septin 9 was identified as a particularly robust methylation marker for detection of CRC. Epigenomics is currently developing a blood based CRC screening test based on Septin 9 and is performing a large prospective clinical trial showing its clinical utility in a population at average risk for CRC. Parallel to this trial further activities are needed to evaluate, optimize, and develop pre-analytical and analytical workflows as well as molecular assays making possible the use of Septin 9 methylation in the clinical routine.</brief_summary>
