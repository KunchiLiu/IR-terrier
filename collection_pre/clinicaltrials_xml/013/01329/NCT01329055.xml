	<brief_summary>Previous studies of the patients treated in RRI clinics suggest that hemodialysis patients undergo a certain consistent predictable pattern at the initiation of dialysis and before death. This pattern can be described as a group of patterns of patients' biological markers over a few months after starting dialysis and several months prior to death. Additional patterns can be observed that occur with changes in seasons or time of day. The aim of this study is to compare these patterns in patients treated in FMC-Asia, FMC-Europe, FMC-South America, and RRI-US populations. Noting that patterns in patient parameters are similar across continents, climates, and geographic variations only further accentuates the importance in the models that can predict patients' survival and provide an opportunity for timely intervention.</brief_summary>
