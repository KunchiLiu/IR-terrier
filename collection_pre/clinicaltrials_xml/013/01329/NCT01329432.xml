	<brief_summary>Spontaneous breathing supported by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is thought to have some advantages compared with mechanical ventilation in premature infants. In addition, early surfactant administration has been shown to be superior to delayed use. The aim of this pilot study was to describe the feasibility of TAKE CARE (early administration of surfactant in spontaneous breathing) procedure and compare its short-term and long-term results with InSurE procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surfactant Administration During Spontaneous Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In TAKE CARE procedure all premature infants who suffered from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) received 100 mg/kg of porcine surfactant preparation via an intratracheal catheter during spontaneous breathing. In the control group infants treated with InSurE procedure were intubated and ventilated to receive surfactant and placed on nCPAP rapidly after surfactant administration. The procedures were compared for short-term efficacy and possible complications.</detailed_description>
