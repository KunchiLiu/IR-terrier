	<brief_summary>The consumption of diets enriched in proteins (legumes and fish) or antioxidant (fruits and vegetables) could have beneficial effects beyond those of the caloric restriction on biomarkers of the inflammatory and oxidative status. OBJECTIVE: To address the effect of a 10-week dietary intervention aimed to weight loss in obese or overweight children (7-15 aged) on genomics, particularly the changes in the expression of genes related to the inflammatory status and oxidative stress. METHODOLOGY: 44 Navarra children and adolescents of both sexes from Pediatric Endocrinology Services at different Hospitals in Pamplona will be recruited. The effect of the intensive consumption of different groups of food will be evaluated: legumes and fish ( diets in proteins) and vegetable and fruits (rich diets in antioxidants). Before and after the intervention, the following items will be analyzed: (1) the diet of the subjects, (2) body composition and 3 magnitudes related to biological and development parameters, being: (3) lipid and metabolic phenotypic profile; (4) markers of the inflammatory status and oxidative stress, and (5) the genomic profile. The dietary programme will be implemented both in group workshops addresseded to patients and their family, and in individual sessions with the pediatricians and/or registered dieticians. Finally, the programme efficacy will be evaluated by the scoreboards integrated in the 5 variables already mentioned.</brief_summary>
