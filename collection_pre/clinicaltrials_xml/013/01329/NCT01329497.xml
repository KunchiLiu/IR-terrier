	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia is highly prevalent in PD patients, and it is an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in these patients. Effective treatments are limited in suppressing plasma phosphorous. Because of the nearly linear relationship between protein and phosphorus intake, high dietary protein intake (DPI, 1.2-1.3g/kg/d recommended by KDOQI) would load high phosphorus burden in PD patients. It is suggested that hyperphosphatemia is hard to avoid under such a DPI level, even as the patients take sufficient phosphorus blinders and receive high PD dosage. The present study is to investigate whether systemic dietary instruction would show effects on control of hyperphosphatemia in PD patients.</brief_summary>
