	<brief_summary>Background : Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are prone to recurrent pulmonary infection have different secreted mucin pattern from healthy subjects. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to influence survival and MUC5B expression in mice model of chronic pulmonary infection. Method : To study the impact of LCPUFA n-3 on MUC5B expression (mRNA level by RT-PCR) collected in airway epithelial cells obtained by nasal brushing. The secondary aim is to assess : MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC7 expression (mRNA level) in airway epithelial cells obtained by nasal brushing; Lund-Kennedy score; TNK-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 in blood plasma. This study is a double parallel, controlled double blind, randomized clinical trial : LCPUFA n-3 (1 g/day) vs placebo for 6 weeks. 30 subjects will be included in this study. Primary and secondary study end point will be assessed two times: before randomization and after 60 days of treatment. Statistical analysis : Treatment group and placebo will be compared using U-Mann-Whitney, intention to treat and per protocol.</brief_summary>
