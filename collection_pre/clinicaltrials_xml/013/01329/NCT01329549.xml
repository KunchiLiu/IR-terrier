	<brief_summary>This phase I, open label dose escalation study will investigate the addition of BIBF 1120 to treatment with the combination of carboplatin and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with advanced, platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients will be treated with BIBF 1120 together with carboplatin and PLD in up to 6-9 repeated 28 days treatment courses until disease progression is observed.</brief_summary>
