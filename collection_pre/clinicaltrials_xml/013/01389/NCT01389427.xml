	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open label, three arms, Phase IB study. A dose escalation phase of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) administered in intravenous (IV) at day 2, day 8 and day 15 in combination with three chemotherapies regimens for patients in relapsed/refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL): - Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide-Doxorubicin-Vincristine-Prednisone (R-CHOP) administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles, - Rituximab-Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (R-FC) administered every 4 weeks for 6 cycles, - Rituximab-Aracytine high dose-Dexamethasone (R-DHA) administered every 4 weeks for 6 cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Escalating Doses of Torisel in Combination With Three Chemotherapies Regimens: R-CHOP, R-FC or R-DHA for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a three arms trial that investigates Temsirolimus (Torisel™) in combination with three chemotherapy regimens (R-CHOP, R-FC or R-DHA). Primary Objective: - To assess the feasibility of these three chemotherapy regimens in combination with Temsirolimus (Torisel™) and to assess the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during the two first cycles of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) in combination with three chemotherapy regimens in order to determine the maximal tolerate dose (MTD) in a dose escalating study design in a population of patients in relapsed/refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Secondary objectives: - To assess the safety of the association Temsirolimus with the three chemotherapy regimens, - To determine the efficacy of the association of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) and these three chemotherapy regimens after 4 cycles and after 6 cycles at the end of treatment: response rate and complete response rate (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), response duration (RD) and overall survival (OS). All subjects who received at least one dose of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) will be considered evaluable and will be included in the safety analysis.</detailed_description>
