To examine the effect of health literacy on self-care skills, including HBP knowledge, adherence to HBP and substance abuse treatment recommendations, communication skills, health care utilization, and BP outcomes in AAs with HBP. Aim 2. To conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial with a delayed intervention control group to test the effectiveness of a health literacy-focused self-help HBP intervention program using CHWs in 100 AAs who reside in Baltimore City.</detailed_description>
