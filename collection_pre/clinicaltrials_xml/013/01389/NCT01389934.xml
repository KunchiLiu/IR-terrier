Currently there is controversy regarding the efficacy of surgery for breast infusion of local anesthetic after surgery. The aim of this study demonstrate the efficacy of administering a local anesthetic into the surgical bed of women operated radical mastectomy for breast cancer for the control of postoperative pain. Material and methods: double-blind randomized clinical trial. The investigators recruited patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The intervention group were infused with L-bupivacaine 0.50% 2 ml/h for 48 hours, and saline control group at 2 ml/h during surgery and anesthetic technique 48 hours. Local anesthetic and rescue medication was identical in both groups. Statistical analysis: The baseline patient characteristics of the patients were analyzed by Chi square or Student t always meet criteria of normality, otherwise it will use the Mann-Whitney. To determine the effectiveness of treatment as well as pain scale adverse events will be held on chi-square test.</brief_summary>
