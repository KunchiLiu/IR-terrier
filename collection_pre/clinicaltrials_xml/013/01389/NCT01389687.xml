	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of SP059 as a three-dose primary and booster vaccination in Japanese infants aged 3 through 68 months. Primary objective: - To assess that the seroprotection rates against polio types 1, 2 and 3 are over 90% approximately one month following the three dose primary vaccination series with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Secondary objective: - To describe the immunogenicity (in terms of seroprotection / seroconversion vaccine response rates and Geometric Mean Titers) of IPV before and after the primary vaccination and before and after the booster vaccination. - To describe the safety after each dose of IPV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of SP059 Given Subcutaneously as a Three-dose Primary and Booster Vaccination in Infants in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will receive three doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (at each visit and given 3-8 weeks apart) as a three-dose primary vaccination starting at 3-68 months of age and followed by a single dose of IPV as a booster vaccination 6-18 months after completion of the three-dose primary vaccination. Subjects will be observed by the Investigator or sub-Investigator for 30 minutes following the vaccine injection. The duration of each participant's participation in the trial will be approximately 1 year.</detailed_description>
