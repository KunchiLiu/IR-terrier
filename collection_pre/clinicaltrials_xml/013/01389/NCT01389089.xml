	<brief_title>Effective Treatment of Posttraumatic and Postoperative Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After ankle- and hindfoot fractures, edema has a major impact on the time point of surgical intervention and may increases the risk of wound complications and infection postoperatively. Effective treatment of edema, therefore, is of great importance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the multi-layer compression therapy and of the A-V Impulse compression (AVI) in reducing ankle- and hindfoot edema as compared to the standard treatment with ice.</detailed_description>
