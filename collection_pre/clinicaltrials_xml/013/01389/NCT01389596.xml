	<criteria>Subjects and/or parent(s)/legally acceptable representative must be considered willing and able to sign consent, and complete daily seizure diaries and monitor seizure frequency. Male and female epilepsy subjects, 4 to 16 years of age inclusive on the date of the Screening Visit. Diagnosis of epilepsy with partial onset seizures classified as simple partial, complex partial or partial becoming secondarily generalized, according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Diagnosis criteria. Must have a partial onset seizure frequency of at least 3 seizures per 28 day period prior to screening. Must have a partial onset seizure frequency of at least 6 seizures and no continuous 4 week seizure free period during the 8 week baseline phase prior to randomization. Currently receiving a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs (stable within 28 days prior to screening). Primary generalized seizures (including in the setting of coexisting partial onset seizures) which include, for example: Clonic, tonic and clonictonic seizures (note that partial onset seizures that become secondarily generalized are not exclusionary); Absence seizures; Infantile spasms; Myoclonic, myoclonic atonic, myoclonic tonic seizures. Lennox Gastaut syndrome, Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS) and Dravet syndrome. A current diagnosis of febrile seizures, or seizures related to an ongoing acute medical illness. Any febrile seizures within 1 year of screening. Status epilepticus within 1 year prior to screening. Seizures related to drugs, alcohol, or acute medical illness. Any change in AED regimen (type of medication or dose) within 28 days of the Screening Visit or during the Baseline Phase. Progressive structural CNS lesion or a progressive encephalopathy.</criteria>
