	<brief_summary>Priming with either rocuronium or MgSO4 is known to accelerate the effect of rocuronium on muscle relaxation. The purpose of this study is to define the effect of MgSO4 on the rocuronium-priming.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MgSO4 Combined With Rocuronium Priming</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acceleration of muscle relaxation is beneficial in rapid-sequence intubation. If MgSO4 combined with priming is efficient in accelerating muscle relaxation, it would be an interesting alternative to rapid-sequence intubation.</detailed_description>
