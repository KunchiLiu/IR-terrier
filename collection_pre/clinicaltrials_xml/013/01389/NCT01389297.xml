	<brief_summary>The objective of this research project is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate an Internet-based (web) application for SMART Recovery: Overcoming Addictions (OA). OA will be based on the four point cognitive-behavioral program for SMART Recovery (www.smartrecovery.org). The goal of the OA program is to help users learn cognitive and behavioral skills to abstain from drinking, drug use, and problem gambling. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the OA web application for heavy drinkers in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with follow-ups at 3- and 6-months. The study design has three conditions: 1) participation in face-to-face SMART Recovery meetings alone; 2) use of the OA web application as a stand-alone intervention; and 3) combining the OA web application with participation in face-to-face SMART Recovery meetings. Study Hypotheses: 1. All three groups will reduce their alcohol consumption, drug use (if any), and alcohol/drug-related problems relative to their baseline levels at the 3- and 6-month post-baseline assessments. 2. The OA only group (Experimental group 1) will show a greater reductions in drinking, drug use (if any), and alcohol/drug-related problems relative to the face-to-face only (Control) group. 3. The OA + face-to-face group (Experimental group 2) will have better outcomes on drinking and drug use variables compared to the Control group.</brief_summary>
