	<brief_summary>All experimental group patients of 100 patients accept a treatment course stem cell transplantation, including one time stem cell transplantation through intravenous injection way at the 10-21th day of cerebral hemorrhage, and the 7—14th day of cerebral infarction incidence; the second time transplantation through lumbar puncture way at the 7th day after the First time transplantation. The control group gives injection through intravenous and lumbar puncture ways separately in the corresponding time, but the transplantation matter is physiological saline not the stem cell.</brief_summary>
