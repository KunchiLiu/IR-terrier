	<brief_summary>Women with compromised ovarian reserve requiring in vitro fertilization (IVF) still represent a demanding challenge for clinicians. It has classically been claimed that using higher dosages of gonadotropins may overcome the scarce ovarian responsiveness to hyper-simulation and increase the chances of success. However, scientific evidence supporting this view is scanty and costs are inevitably much higher. In this study, the investigators hypothesized that similar chances of pregnancy may be achieved with a mild stimulation using exclusively Clomiphene citrate (CC).</brief_summary>
