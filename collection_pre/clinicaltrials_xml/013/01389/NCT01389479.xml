Planned administration of any other vaccines 30 days before study immunization or during the course of the study. Immunization on an emergency basis, such as Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed for adult use, will be allowed provided the vaccine is not administered within two weeks prior to study immunization. Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine or participation in an investigational study within 30 days prior to administration of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months of screening or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Receipt of a depot injection or an implant of any drug within 3 months prior to administration of study vaccine. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral™ S/F or Fluzone®. A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. History of anaphylactic type reactions to consumption of eggs. Any other condition or social circumstance that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for or unable to complete the study. Breastfeeding subject.
