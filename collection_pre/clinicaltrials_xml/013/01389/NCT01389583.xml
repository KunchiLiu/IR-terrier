	<brief_summary>A Phase II Study of AUY922, Novel HSP Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced GIST Failed to or Intolerance of Imatinib and Sunitinib Therapy Primary endpoint: •The primary endpoint of this study is to assess disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease≧4 months) of AUY922 in patients with advanced GIST failed to imatinib and sunitinib Secondary endpoints: - To determinate the objective response rate (ORR, complete response + partial response) - To determinate the time to tumor progression (TTP) - To evaluate the safety and toxicity profiles of AUY922 - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of AUY922 in Taiwan GIST population - To access the pharmacodynamic effect of AUY922 on HSP client proteins in blood and tumor if feasible , i.e. HSP70, in Taiwan GIST population - To access the tissue biomarkers pre-treatment and 4wks post treatment if feasible, i.e. HSP70, c-KIT, PDGFRA mutation, ...etc in Taiwan GIST population Exploratory endpoints: •PET imaging; sSUVmax</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of AUY922 for GIST(Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic phase II study of AUY922 in patients with advanced GIST failed to or intolerance of imatinib and sunitinib therapy. AUY922 is a novel HSP90 inhibitor and will be administered at dose of 70 mg/m2 i.v. infusion on D1 every week. The Simon one sample two-stage minimax design was used with 15 suitable patients to be accrued to the first stage. If at least two patients meet our primary endpoint (complete response＋partial response＋stable disease≧4 months), an additional 10 patients would be recruited to the second stage. AUY922 would be considered active in this patient population, if there were more than 5 cases of non-progressive disease in the total cohort of 25 patients.</detailed_description>
