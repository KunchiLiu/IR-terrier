	<brief_title>Instrumental Sealing of Arterial Puncture Site Closure Device Versus Manual Compression Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular closure devices have been shown to be safe and effective in reducing the time to hemostasis and immobilization when compared to manual compression following coronary angiography. This effect is beneficial in patients presenting with chronic back pain, prostate enlargement, mental impairment or other disorders that preclude prolonged bed rest. However, adequately powered large scale randomized trials with vascular closure devices remain a gap in the scientific literature. This trial compares, in a randomised design two novel vascular closure devices (FemoSeal &amp; ExoSeal) versus manual compression after coronary angiography. This study is aimed to investigate if novel vascular closure devices are noninferior to manual compression regarding access site complications.</detailed_description>
