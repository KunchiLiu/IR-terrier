	<brief_summary>Objectives: The primary objective of the research project is to investigate how declining health status influences the end-of-life (EOL) treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and to examine if and how these preferences are modified by predisposing characteristics (i.e., acculturation, education, medical mistrust, perceived racism) and/or provider-related characteristics (i.e., ethnicity, language used, provision of interpreters, or patient navigators). The specific aims are: 1. To determine if declining functional status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences of older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. 2. To determine if predisposing characteristics (i.e., acculturation, age, education, medical mistrust, perceived racism) and/or provider-related characteristics (i.e., ethnicity, language used, provision of interpreters, or patient navigators) modify the association between end-of-life treatment preferences and declining health status in older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. 3. To identify if the end-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer differ from those of older Medicare beneficiaries without cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Latino Medicare Beneficiary With Cancer: This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors (such as language of choice) and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients influence end-of-life treatment choices over time. If you decide to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire once a month for 9 months, over the telephone. The questionnaire asks you about your end of life and decision making preferences, as well as questions about your health status and other basic questions about you such as your education level, age, and health insurance. The first phone questionnaire, the one you will answer today, will take about 30 - 40 minutes to complete. The monthly surveys after today will take about 20 - 30 minutes to complete each month. You will be considered off of the study in nine months. To compensate your time and efforts, we will send you $20 for your first survey and then $60 over the next 8 months for additional surveys ($20 for surveys 2-3; $20 for surveys 4-6; and $20 for surveys 7-9), totaling $80.00 over the course of nine months. Should you become too ill and are unable to complete the surveys we will ask a proxy to respond on your behalf. A proxy in this case, should be someone you trust, who knows you well enough to know how to answer the health questionnaire on your behalf. A proxy is usually a spouse, child, other close family member or friend. This person will only have to answer questions about you. He or she will not answer any questions about him or herself. We will ask you to provide us with the contact information of the person you select as your "questionnaire proxy" today at the end of this consent form. If you are able to complete all 9 surveys, we will not contact the proxy. Information from this study will be used only for research purposes. All identifying information such as your name and address will be kept private. This information may be kept at MD Anderson and University of Houston (UH) forever. You will be assigned a code number so that your name will not be used. The research team at MD Anderson and UH will be able to link the code number to your name. We will take appropriate steps to keep your survey responses confidential. However, there is no guarantee of absolute confidentiality. Your information will be protected according to state and federal law. The research team may share study information with certain individuals including the National Institutes of Health and institutional study monitors who verify the accuracy of the information to see that the research is being conducted in a safe and correct manner. Answering the survey questions over the phone may cause you to feel tired. The questionnaires may involve topics that are sensitive in nature. You may refuse to answer any question that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you have concerns after completing the survey, you are encouraged to contact your doctor, the study chair, or MD Anderson's Institutional Review Board. Although there may be no benefits for you in this study, future patients may benefit from what is learned in this study. Your participation in this research study is strictly voluntary and you may choose not to take part in this study and/or stop the interview at any time or to not answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable. If you choose not to take part in this study, you will not be penalized or lose benefits that you are entitled to. You may choose to withdraw your consent to participate in the study at any time, without loss of benefit to you. Latino Medicare Beneficiary Without Cancer: This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors (such as language of choice) and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients (provider ethnicity, use of interpreters), influence end-of-life treatment choices over time. If you decide to take part in this study, you will complete a one-time questionnaire today, over the telephone. The questionnaire asks you about your end of life and decision making preferences, as well as questions about your health status and other basic questions about you such as your education level, age, and health insurance. This questionnaire will take about 30 - 40 minutes to complete. You will be considered off the study after you complete this one-time questionnaire. Upon completion of the questionnaire, you will be mailed a $20 gift card. Information from this study will be used only for research purposes. All identifying information such as your name and address will be kept private. This information may be kept at MD Anderson and University of Houston (UH) forever.
