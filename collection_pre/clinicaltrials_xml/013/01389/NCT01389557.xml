	<brief_summary>Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been known to be controversial for stopping malaria transmission. The addition of primaquine (PQ) - the only drug commercially available that kills mature transmission stage - to such treatments might be necessary to eliminate this stage. A study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) regimens with PQ on malaria transmission on a community wide level in Lempasing, Lampung, Sumatra.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine Plus Primaquine on Malaria Transmission in Lampung Province, Sumatra</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A mass screening baseline survey enabled the description of malaria prevalence (P. falciparum and P. vivax). Malaria infected asymptomatic (from the mass screening) and symptomatic (malaria infected people attending the health center) people were enrolled in the study. Enrolled malaria infected subjects were treated with DHP and PQ according to the treatment regimen. The community was mass screened for malaria infections every 3 months and an incidence cohort screened every month for infections. The 3 aims were to look at malaria antibodies, haemoglobin levels and the incidence of malaria before and after the drug intervention.</detailed_description>
