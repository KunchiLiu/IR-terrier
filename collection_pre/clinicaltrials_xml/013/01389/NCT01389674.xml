	<brief_title>Hybrid Intraprocedural Imaging Based on 2 Different Imaging Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After myocard vitality diagnostics with MRI patients will underwent additionally an stress echocardiography within the exploration. By this ultrasound we will measure the LV mass and the ejection fraction per apical 2-, 3- and 4-chamber view. In addition a 2D-strain-analysis will be done to measure the systolic and diastolic strain and also the circumferential and radial strain rate parameter (by depicting three parasternal short axis views in the basal, mid-ventricular and apical plane). These measurements will be compared with the studies-conditioned MRI-finding (as reference) to find the optimal strain-parameter and the optimal cut-off-data for an intraprocedural vitality diagnostics of the single layers (endocardial, myocardial, and epicardial) for this patient group. The data upraised through this are compared off-line to the MRI findings.</detailed_description>
