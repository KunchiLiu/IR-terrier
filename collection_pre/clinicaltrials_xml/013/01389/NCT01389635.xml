	<brief_summary>Abdominoplasty is one of the most popular body-contouring procedures, yet it is also among the most hazardous aesthetic procedures currently performed. It was shown, in many studies, to be associated with a significant complication rate, some of which are life-threatening. This study describes the investigators experience with a series of abdominoplasties performed under epidural anesthesia. Outcomes are presented, especially in terms of complication, and the practical advantages of this method are discussed.</brief_summary>
