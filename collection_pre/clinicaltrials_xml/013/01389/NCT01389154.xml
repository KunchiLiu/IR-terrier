	<brief_summary>The objective of the prospective, multi-center study is to evaluate the ease of use and effectiveness of the SPiN Drive Electromagnetic (EM) Tip Tracked Steerable Devices as a method of sampling subsegmental, less than 3.0 cm, lung lesions through the airway, and beyond the bronchus. Measures of diagnostic yield will be compared to the diagnostic yield of similar published historical controls using conventional bronchoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Measure Lung Biopsy Diagnostic Yield Using Always On Electromagnetic Tip Tracked Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Always On EM Tip Tracked Steerable catheters and biopsy devices used with the Veran Medical Technologies system are Food and Durg Administration 510K approved for use in diagnostic pulmonary procedures to locate and sample subsegmental peripheral, less than 3.0 centimeter lung lesions or solitary pulmonary nodules(SPN). Up to 20 subjects with radiographically confirmed peripheral lung lesions will be asked to participate in the study and proceed with informed consent. An interim analysis of the data will be conducted to determine the need to include an additional 10 patients to achieve statistically significant results at the ninety five percent confidence interval.</detailed_description>
