	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) will allow to lower the ventilator pressure at equivalent fractions of inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) and partial pressure of CO2 of capillary blood in preterm infants in comparison with currently used standard ventilation (synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure-support ventilation, SIMV+PSV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Crossover Study of Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will apply crossover comparison in preterm infants who received a ventilatory support. In patient whose frequency of mandatory support is under 25, the two ventilatory modes (SIMV+PSV and NAVA) are delivered by the same ventilator (Servo-I; Maquet Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden) and will set to maintain similar blood gas analysis results. Determination of the type of ventilatory mode used is performed using a cluster randomization. The randomized order of ventilatory mode will be used during total 9 hours; one mode for 4 hours and another mode for 5 hours. To rule out carry-over effects, a 1-hour interval for washout was guaranteed between modes. Recordings will be obtained over a total 8 hours.</detailed_description>
