	<brief_summary>Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery has greatly advanced over the last 20 years. However, data in the literature reveal that approximately 15-25% of patients undergoing surgery still do not present optimal outcomes, which suggests that there is room for improvement of the procedure. A possible explanation for this fact is that most ACL reconstructions consider only one of the functional bundles of the ligament. Our hypothesis is that the ACL reconstruction with the double-bundle technique will be effective in reducing the patients' rotation of the knee joint for high-demanding tasks compared to the patients who had ACL reconstruction with the single-bundle technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Single Bundle and Double Bundle Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare the ACL reconstruction with only one bundle (one tunnel in the tibia and femur) with the procedure to reconstruct the the ACL with two bundles with 2 tunnels in the tibia and 2 in the femur (considered closest to the normal anatomy of of the ACL), both in terms of objective and subjective results.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Male or female. 2. Body mass index (BMI), which corresponds to the ratio between weight in kilograms (pounds) and height in m2 (square meters) between 18.5 and 24.99. 3. Anterior instability alone or associated with chondral lesions of up to 1cm or associated with meniscal injuries that do not alter the postoperative rehabilitation. 4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirming the ACL injury. 5. Aged between 20 and 45 years. 6. Not having asymmetric varus alignment, greater than or equal to 5 degrees (to eliminate cases with indication for osteotomy of the tibia), using panoramic radiographic comparison of the lower limbs in standing position. 7. Absence of associated ligament instabilities (medial, lateral or posterior). 8. No previous surgery on the affected knee. 1. New postsurgical trauma after 12 months. 2. Interruption of treatment / followup. 3. Postoperative infection.</criteria>
