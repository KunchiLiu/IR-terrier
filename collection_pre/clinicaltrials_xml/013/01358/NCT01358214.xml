	<brief_title>Quality of Life After Tension Free Transvaginal Sling / Tape Operation With a Titanized Surgical Tape (TiLOOP® Tape)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of urinary incontinence in the adult female population has been estimated between 10% and 40%. Several treatment alternatives have been suggested until now. Nevertheless, the ideal treatment has not been identified yet. On the one hand this is related to the low amount of valid scientific information regarding different treatment methods. On the other hand the impact of patients' quality of life, which plays a major role, has not been fully considered. To date, there is no established Questionnaire on Quality of Life that provides physicians an assistance to obtain information on the subjective effects caused by stress urinary incontinence. In the present study the patients' Quality of Life will be assessed by use of two questionnaires, that is a new one and an already validated questionnaire. The study population consists of patients who already received an implantation of a sub-urethral surgical mesh (TiLOOP® Tape), of symptomatic patients before an operation, and of a group of non-symptomatic women. Subjects will be asked in a single visit only to fill in both questionnaires. Furthermore the safety and effectiveness of the TiLOOP® Tape mesh will be evaluated in the study arm of treated patients. Study has been terminated after major recruitment failure (only 21 instead of 240 patients has been included).</detailed_description>
