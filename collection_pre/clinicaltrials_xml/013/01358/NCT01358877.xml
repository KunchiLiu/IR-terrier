	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm study will assess the safety and efficacy of pertuzumab in addition to chemotherapy plus trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy in participants with operable HER2-positive primary breast cancer. After surgery, participants will be randomized to receive either pertuzumab or placebo intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) for one year, along with 6-8 cycles of chemotherapy and 1 year of trastuzumab IV every 3 weeks. This study will be carried out in collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG).</brief_summary>
