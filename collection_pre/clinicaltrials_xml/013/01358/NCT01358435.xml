	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is is to test for bioequivalence based on AUC0-24h and Cmax between Wosulin 70N/30R and Novolin 70/30.The study also compares the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles as well as assessing safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy male or female subject. 2. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years. 3. Considered generally healthy upon completion of medical history, physical examination and biochemical investigations as judged by the Investigator. 4. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 27.0 kg/m2, inclusive. 5. Nonsmoker, defined as no nicotine consumption for at least one year. 6. Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trialrelated activities. (Trialrelated activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during normal management of the subject.). 1. Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 30 days. 2. Pregnant, breastfeeding or intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate contraceptive measures (defined as intrauterine device (IUD) that has been in place for at least 3 months, double barrier contraception, sterilization or abstinence, or oral contraceptive pill, which should have been taken without difficulty for at least 3 months, or an approved hormonal implant). 3. Clinically significant abnormal haematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged by the Investigator. In particular, subjects with elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal) or impaired renal function (elevated serum creatinine values above the upper limit of normal) or fasting glucose at screening outside the range of 7099 mg/dl will not be allowed to enter the trial. 4. Any serious systemic infectious disease during the four weeks prior to the first dose of test drug, as judged by the Investigator. 5. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (haemoglobin below the lower limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the trial. 6. History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past five years. 7. Any positive test for drugs of abuse and /or alcohol at screening. 8. Hepatitis B or C or HIV positive. 9. Use of prescription drugs within 3 weeks preceding the first dosing of insulin, except for oral contraceptives/hormonal implants. 10. Treatment with any insulin product in the past. 11. Use of nonprescription drugs, except routine vitamins, within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of the test drug. Occasional use of acetaminophen is permitted. 12. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate understanding or cooperation. 13. Blood donation of more than 500 ml within the last 12 weeks. 14. History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction. 15. Known or suspected allergy to trial product or related products</criteria>
