	<brief_summary>This study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MK-8353 (formerly SCH 900353) given as single agent oral therapy for participants with advanced solid tumors will be done into two parts. In Part 1a, there will be a dose escalation to find the preliminary maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and in Part 1b, dose confirmation to find out the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) that will be used in Part 2 of the study. In Part 2 of the study, participants with certain types of metastatic melanoma or metastatic colorectal cancer will be treated to see if MK-8353 is effective as single agent therapy.</brief_summary>
