	<brief_title>Seroma at the Donor Site of the TRAM Flap, With or Without Quilting Suture: A Comparative Study Using Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluated seroma formation at the donor site of the TRAM patients who underwent breast reconstruction. Forty-eight breast reconstructions were performed using the bipedicled TRAM flap. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 16 participants each: DN group, use of suction drains but no quilting sutures between the remaining abdominal flap and musculoaponeurotic layer of the anterior abdominal wall; QS+DN group, use of quilting sutures and suction drains; and QS group, use of quilting sutures but no suction drains. In order to determine seroma formation, ultrasound examinations were performed on postoperative days 7 and 14 in 5 regions of the abdominal wall: epigastric, umbilical, hypogastric, right iliac, and left iliac regions.</detailed_description>
