	<brief_title>Glycemic Control and Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the visual and anatomical response to therapy in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in relation to their glycemic control. Patients with DME with central foveal thickness (CFT) &gt; 250µm with no proliferative disease had their glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured at baseline and 3 months. CFT by optical coherence tomography, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMARs were measured at baseline, 1, and 3 months. Exclusion criteria: laser or intravitreal injections within 6 months, hard exudates within 500um of the foveal center, or macular traction. Therapy included laser and intravitreal anti VEGFs. HbA1c graded as: G1=&lt;7%, G2= 7-7.9%, G3= 8-8.9%, G4 = &gt;9%; and as: low &lt;8%, high ≥ 8%.</detailed_description>
