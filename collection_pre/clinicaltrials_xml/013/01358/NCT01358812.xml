	<brief_summary>The GONO-FOLFOXIRI regimen demonstrated higher activity and efficacy compared to FOLFIRI in a phase III trial. Panitumumab with oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based doublets is feasible and associated with improved activity in KRAS codon 12-13 wild-type patients. BRAF and other RAS rare mutations have been suggested as additional potential biomarkers for anti-EGFR agents in metastatic colo-rectal cancer. The present study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and the activity of the first-line combination of the GONO-FOLFOXIRI regimen and Panitumumab in molecularly selected metastatic colo-rectal cancer patients.</brief_summary>
