	<brief_summary>This research study is studying biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from young patients with neuroblastoma. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) expression is an indirect cancer stem cell marker in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma. Correlate UCHL1 expression with staging information and patient's outcome. Study Subtype: Observational Observational Study Model: Case-control Time Perspective: Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: None Retained Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study Population Description: Tissue microarray samples from patients with Neuroblastoma supplied by the COG Biopathology Center Sampling Method: Probability OUTLINE: Archived tissue microarray samples are analyzed for ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) expression by UCHL1 monoclonal antibody and peroxidase technique. Results are then compared with patients' clinical data, including age at diagnosis, race, date of diagnosis, histology, stage and location at diagnosis, presence of cancer predisposition, date of completion of treatment, surgery performed, type of chemotherapy received, history of recurrence, and status (alive with disease, alive without disease, dead), if available.</detailed_description>
