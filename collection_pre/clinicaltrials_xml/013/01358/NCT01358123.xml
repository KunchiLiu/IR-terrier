	<brief_summary>In patients with liver cirrhosis elevated levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF-Ag) are found frequently but the clinical significance is unclear. vWF-Ag plays an important role in primary haemostasis and development of thrombotic vascular obliteration is discussed as a possible mechanism leading to portal hypertension. Invasive measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of portal hypertension. The investigators hypothesize that vWF-Ag levels in plasma may correlate with portal pressure and predict clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH, HVPG &gt;=10mmHg) and its complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Value of Von Willebrand Factor in Portal Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with alcoholic, viral (chronic hepatitis C), and cryptogenic liver cirrhosis are included. Portal hemodynamics are assessed by HVPG measurement, vWF-Ag levels were measured by ELISA. Results will be compared. 3 and 6 months mortality will be recorded.</detailed_description>
