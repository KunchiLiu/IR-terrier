	<brief_summary>Soy protein is a high quality, plant-based protein that is comparable to milk, meat and eggs. Soy protein has a digestion rate (intermediate) compared to whey (fast) and casein (slow). This intermediate rate may allow soy protein to have an extended window of muscle protein synthesis that has not been monitored in previous studies. While most of the sports nutrition "recovery" products are dairy-based protein blends (high in branched-chain amino acids), soy protein offers additional benefits that can make an important contribution to these types of sports nutrition products. Soy protein contains approximately 300% more arginine and 30% more glutamine compared to whey protein and these two amino acids may bring additional benefits (immunity and hydration, respectively) to athletes. A "blend" of high-quality proteins (soy and dairy) may be the optimal sports nutrition product for athletes to consume following training.</brief_summary>
