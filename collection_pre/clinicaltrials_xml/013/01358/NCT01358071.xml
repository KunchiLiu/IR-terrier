	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients randomized to NGR-hTNF plus an anthracycline versus patients randomized to an anthracycline alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considering the safety/toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF characterized by mild-to-moderate constitutional symptoms, the reversibility of these adverse events generally occurring only during the infusion time; the absence of overlapping toxicities with chemotherapeutic agents; the safety and preliminary antitumor activity observed in previous trial with doxorubicin; and the objective response rate (RR) registered in a phase II trial in previously treated ovarian cancer patients seems justified to evaluate in a randomized phase II trial the efficacy of NGR-hTNF against a doxorubicin-based option in advanced ovarian cancer patients progressing or recurrent after a standard platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
