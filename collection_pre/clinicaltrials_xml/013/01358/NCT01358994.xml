	<brief_summary>From a central registry at the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden collect all patients in the city of Malmö prescribed metformin during two years. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated from the CKD-EPI formula (n=5408) and compared to a control material (n=2815) from the same town. All cases of severe lactic acidosis rendering ICU admission were also sought. The study hypothesis is that metformin is prescribed to patients with lower GFR than anticipated with very few cases of lactic acidosis registered.</brief_summary>
