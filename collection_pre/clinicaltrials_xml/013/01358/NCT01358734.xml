	<brief_summary>The study aim is to compare safety and efficacy of high-dose lenalidomide regimen, sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide and an azacitidine in persons ≥65 years with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Being Conducted at Multiple Locations to Compare Safety and Efficacy of Three Different Regimens; (1) High-Dose Lenalidomide; (2) Lenalidomide + Azacitidine; or (3) Azacitidine in Subjects ≥ 65 Years With Newly-Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On September 11, 2013, randomization into the continuous 50 mg lenalidomide only arm was temporarily suspended based on review of the data from the first 13 participants and a high rate of discontinuation (11/13 participants). The Data Monitoring Committee assessed the study data on September 20, 2013 and reported no safety concerns. The high rate of early discontinuation is inconsistent with the treatment duration required for testing the study primary endpoint of survival at one year. Consequently, Celgene has decided not to reopen the lenalidomide only arm.</detailed_description>
