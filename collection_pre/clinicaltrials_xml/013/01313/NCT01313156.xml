	<brief_summary>Prospective, non-randomized cohort study to analyse genetic variations, dietary patterns, perceived stress and anxiety and early changes in lipid metabolism leading to the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LUPS-Lipids and Glucose Under Prospective Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LUPS-study is a collaboration between Asklepios Clinics Hamburg GmbH and University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf, Germany. This study is assessing a multitude of serum biomarkers, anthropometrics, dietary habits, physical activity, perceived stress along with genetic information from "healthy workers" (25-60years) to better understand phenotype-genotype associations leading to MetS and type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
