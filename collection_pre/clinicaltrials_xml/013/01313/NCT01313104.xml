	<brief_title>Colposcopy and High Resolution Anoscopy in Screening For Anal Dysplasia in Patients With Cervical, Vaginal, or Vulvar Dysplasia or Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the risk of anal dysplasia in women with cervical or vulvar dysplasia. OUTLINE: Patients undergo colposcopy and cervical Papanicolaou test with Human papillomavirus (HPV) test followed by anal Papanicolaou test and high resolution anoscopy.
