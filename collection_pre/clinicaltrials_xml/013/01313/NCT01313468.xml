	<brief_summary>It has been reported that obese individuals are seated 2 Â½ hour more than lean individuals and that non exercise thermo genesis (NEAT) may vary with as much as 2000 Kcal/day between equal size people due to different occupational and leisure time activities. The primary aim of the study is to investigate if 10 weeks of exercise training increase NEAT in sedentary men. Subject will be randomized to three different training intervention, with 3 exercise session each week for 10 weeks.
