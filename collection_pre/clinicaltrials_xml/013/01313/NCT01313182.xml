	<brief_summary>We hypothesize the application of mupirocin or povidone-iodine to the nares is equally effective in short term Staphylococcus aureus(SA)suppression. Our overall study objective is to measure the rate of deep and superficial Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) after primary hip, knee, shoulder and elbow arthroplasty surgery and primary spinal fusion surgery requiring implantation of prosthetic material, when the patient receives either nasal mupirocin or nasal povidone-iodine prior to surgery. Secondary study objectives include: 1. Measure hospital length of stay and re-admission rates in the mupirocin and povidone-iodine groups. 2. Measure adverse events related to mupirocin and povidone-iodine. 3. Measure rate of SA resistance to mupirocin.</brief_summary>
