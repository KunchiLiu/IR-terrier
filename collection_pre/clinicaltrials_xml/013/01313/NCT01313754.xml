	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare different skin closure materials for the transobturator suburethral sling procedure. Currently the investigators are using monocryl suture material as the standard for skin closure. This material has anecdotally show to be very irritating to patients who have had this type of surgery. Our study will compare the monocryl suture material with vicryl (polyglactin 910) and dermabond (2-octyl cyanoacrylate) skin glue. The investigators believe that vicryl suture material will be superior in comfort when compared to monocryl and dermabond for this type of procedure.</brief_summary>
