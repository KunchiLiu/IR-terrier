	<brief_title>The Effect of IV Amantadine on Freezing of Gait (FOG) Resistant to Dopaminergic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling symptoms of Parkinson`s disease. We experienced that severe FOG was markedly improved by IV amantadine in the patients who had Parkinson`s disease. But IV drug may have placebo effect. Therefore, We designed double blind, placebo controlled study to know whether IV amantadine is effective in the patient with dopaminergic-drug-resistant freezing of gait(FOG). 2. Cross over study design - Compare the change of FOGQ(freezing of gait questionaire) score from the baseline to IV amantadine and placebo drug - randomized assigned order of amantadine and placebo drug. - investigator of FOG: blinded to the order of drugs - each patient has IV drug for 2 days for each drug</detailed_description>
