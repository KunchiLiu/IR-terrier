	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving everolimus together with docetaxel is more effective than giving docetaxel alone in treating patients with head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus given together with docetaxel in treating patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Locally Advanced, or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of everolimus and docetaxel in treating patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. (Phase I) - To determine the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of everolimus when combined with docetaxel in these patients. (Phase I) - To examine the response rates in patients receiving the combination of docetaxel and everolimus and those receiving docetaxel alone. (Phase II) Secondary - To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between docetaxel and everolimus in these patients. (Phase I) - To investigate the effect of everolimus on downstream targets of mTOR in tumor in these patients. (Phase I) - To examine the time to progression after docetaxel and everolimus in these patients. (Phase II) - To perform a pilot study to attempt to identify predictors of response, including evaluation of EGFR family member expression, mutations, or amplifications. (Phase II) - To attempt to identify downstream targets of the EGFR pathway including phosphorylation of S6 and phosphorylation of AKT. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus with docetaxel followed by a randomized phase II study. - Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and escalating doses of oral everolimus on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses of therapy, patients may continue to receive everolimus weekly as a single agent until evidence of progressive disease. - Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: - Arm A: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease are eligible to cross over into the everolimus arm at the investigator's discretion. - Arm B: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm A and oral everolimus (at a dose determined in the phase I portion of the study) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the completion of combination therapy, patients may continue to receive maintenance everolimus weekly, at the investigator's discretion. Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic monitoring in the phase I study. Tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during the study for biomarker and other laboratory analysis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for at least 1 year. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for phase I and a total of 100 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.</detailed_description>
