	<brief_summary>This study is being done because peripheral neuropathy, a condition that interrupts sensation in your limbs, is a common side effect of paclitaxel. There is some evidence that alpha lipoic acid (ALA), an antioxidant compound, protects neurons after exposure to paclitaxel. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ALA and to find the best dose of ALA in patients that receive chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
