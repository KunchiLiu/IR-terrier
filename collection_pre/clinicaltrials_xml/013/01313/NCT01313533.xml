	<criteria>1. Subjects must be 2595 years of age and able to give informed consent 2. Use of an approved statin and antiplatelet medication for at least 24 months. 3. Agreeable to Cardiovascular imaging at 12 months postcoronary artery bypass graft (CABG). 4. First time coronary artery bypass surgery,redo coronary artery bypass surgery and combined valve repair/replacement surgery and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are eligible to participate in study. 1. Acute traumatic injury, vasculitis or planned concurrent ventricular surgical restoration, automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICD) placement or valvular surgery. 2. Hypercoaguable state. 3. Comorbid illness making 2 year survival unlikely. 4. Participation in another interventional investigative study of a cardiovascular drug or device within 30 days prior to CABG. May participate concurrently in other studies where the intervention/observation will not hinder execution of this study. 5. Patients with any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, makes the patient ineligible or places the patient at undue risk (e.g. conditions that preclude standard invasive follow up procedures such as angiography, i.e. renal failure, bleeding diathesis or peripheral vascular disease preventing catheterization via the groin). 6. Subject has clinical evidence of infection that the Investigator deems significant to the completion of the procedure or that could compromise the subject's safety. 7. Any patient was has undergone more than 20 computerized tomography (CAT) scans. 8. Any patient who is pregnant.</criteria>
