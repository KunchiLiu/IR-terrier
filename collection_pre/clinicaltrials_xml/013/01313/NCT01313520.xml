	<brief_summary>This is a study to compare the effect of infliximab versus placebo on synovial inflammation as measured by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI of one wrist. The primary hypothesis is that over 14 weeks of therapy, the change from baseline in the volume transfer rate in enhancing synovium is larger due to treatment with infliximab than with placebo.</brief_summary>
