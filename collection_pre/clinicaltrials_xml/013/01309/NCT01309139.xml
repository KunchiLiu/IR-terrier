	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the systemic exposure to tiotropium and CD 1857 after treatment with the fixed dose combination (fixed dose combination (FDC), Treatment A) of tiotropium plus BI 54903 (ethanolic solution for inhalation (EIS), Respimat (RMT) B) with the systemic exposure following inhalation of the free combination (Treatment B) of tiotropium (aqueous solution for inhalation (AIS), RMT A) plus BI 54903 (EIS, RMT B), when administered once-daily over 21 days via Respimat(R) (RMT). The secondary objectives are: to compare the systemic exposure to tiotropium and CD 1857 after single dose administration of FDC and of the free combination of tiotropium/BI 54903 to compare the systemic exposure to BI 54903 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses of the FDC and of the free combination of tiotropium/BI 54903 to compare the safety and tolerability of tiotropium and BI 54903 when administered as FDC and as free dose combination, respectively</brief_summary>
