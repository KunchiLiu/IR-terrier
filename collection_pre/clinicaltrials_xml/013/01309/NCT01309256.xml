	<brief_summary>Minimally invasive surgery revolutionized the field of gastric cancer surgery. The surgical robot was introduced to alleviate the difficulty of laparoscopic surgery. Although many studies have reported successful outcomes for robotic surgery, there is no multicenter prospective analysis regarding the advantage of the robotic gastrectomy. The aim of this study is to analyze the surgical outcomes of the robotic gastrectomy focusing on the learning curve, cost-effectiveness, quality of life, and acute-inflammatory reaction in comparison with laparoscopic gastrectomy.</brief_summary>
