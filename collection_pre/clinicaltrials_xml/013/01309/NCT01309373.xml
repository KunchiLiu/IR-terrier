	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate the level of symptomatic and psychosocial remission of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in standard clinical practice as a function of the degree of adherence to antipsychotic treatment. The secondary objectives are to study the level of community integration of the patients included in the study, and its influencing factors, to analyze the role of various sociodemographic factors, factors related to the course of disease and the psychopathological status of the patient in community integration and remission, to analyze the potential predictors of a favorable course (symptomatic and psychosocial remission) and a poor course (no symptomatic or psychosocial remission), to assess the impact of treatment adherence on the change in the functional and community integration status of patients (based on the occupation, independence level, and degree of disability variables), to assess the significance of premorbid (academic and social) adjustment in the symptomatic and functional remission and the community integration status of patients and to correlate the level of insight to the remission and integration status of patients.</brief_summary>
