Clinically important abnormalities on baseline physical examination, or any unresolved clinically significant abnormalities on ECG, laboratory test results, or vital signs recorded in a previous phase 3 DVS233 SR shortterm study for the indication of MDD. Any exception must be discussed with and granted by the sponsor. Significant risk of suicide based on clinical judgment, including common suicidal thoughts, and suicide being considered as a possible solution, even without specific plans or intention. Presence of clinically important hepatic or renal disease or other medical disease that might compromise the study or be detrimental to the subject (eg, clinically important cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, seizure disorder, myocardial infarction, neurologic disorder, acute illness, neoplastic disorder).</criteria>
