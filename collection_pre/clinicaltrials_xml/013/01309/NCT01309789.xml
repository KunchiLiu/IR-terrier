	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin sequentially and in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in front-line treatment for CD30-positive mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms, including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It is a phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study in three arms designed to define the MTD, PK, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in sequence and in combination with multi-agent front-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
