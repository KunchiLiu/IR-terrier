	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib, in the neoadjuvant treatment of non-metastatic erbB2-positive breast cancer. Secondary objectives include: - To determine the safety and tolerability of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, combined with lapatinib, in an Asian population - To determine breast conservation rates following neoadjuvant paclitaxel/ carboplatin/ lapatinib - To determine clinical response rates and relapse-free survival of patients treated with neoadjuvant paclitaxel/ carboplatin/ lapatinib - To identify predictive tumour biomarkers for pathologic complete response The investigators hypothesize that pathologic complete response rates will be improved from 15% to 35% with the neoadjuvant regimen of carboplatin/ paclitaxel/ lapatinib compared to standard chemotherapy alone in HER2 positive early stage breast cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Preoperative Weekly Paclitaxel and Carboplatin With Lapatinib (Tykerb®) in Patients With ErbB2-Positive Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent, strong predictor of disease-free and overall survival in operable breast cancer - The addition of neoadjuvant trastuzumab to chemotherapy results in a 2-3 fold increase in pCR rates in operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer - Lapatinib is being explored as an alternative to trastuzumab in large clinical trials in operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer - In a randomised phase III adjuvant trial, BCIRG 006, non-anthracycline chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin) has been shown to be as effective as conventional sequential anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and docetaxel, in combination with trastuzumab, but with improved cardiac safety - Weekly paclitaxel has been shown in a randomized phase III study to be the optimal adjuvant taxane regimen - Weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in Phase I/II clinical studies of metastatic breast and ovarian cancer - The investigators aim to assess the efficacy of a non-anthracycline containing regimen, weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib in inducing pCR in the neoadjuvant treatment of ErbB2-positive non-metastatic breast cancer. The investigators hypothesize that this combination will achieve pCR rates of at least 35%</detailed_description>
