	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Transfer of Fospropofol and Its Active Metabolite, Propofol, to Breast Milk Following Administration of LUSEDRA to Lactating Women Undergoing a Needed Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>E2083, or LUSEDRA® (fospropofol disodium) Injection, is an intravenous (IV) sedative-hypnotic agent indicated for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation in adult patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.1 It is a water-soluble, phosphono-O-methyl prodrug of propofol. Upon IV injection, the inactive fospropofol undergoes metabolism, most notably by alkaline phosphatase enzymes, to yield the active metabolite (propofol), phosphate, and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is quickly converted to formate in vivo, and formate is further metabolized by a folate-dependent mechanism.</detailed_description>
