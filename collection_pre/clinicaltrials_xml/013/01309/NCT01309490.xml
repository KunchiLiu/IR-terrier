	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether oral Ribavirin is safe and effective in treating patients with solid tumour cancers, that have high levels of the protein eIF4E.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Ribavirin Given as Monotherapy in Solid Tumour Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose escalating, open-label, Phase I/II study of single agent oral ribavirin administered daily in solid tumour cancer patients who have failed standard treatments, overexpress eIF4E, and have easily accessible disease for serial biopsies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Phase I part of study : Histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer at diagnosis, with advanced, incurable disease at the time of screening, who have progressed on or are not suitable for standard therapy. Phase II part of study: Histologically or cytologically confirmed BC or HNSCC at diagnosis, with advanced, incurable disease at the time of screening, who have progressed on or are not suitable for standard therapy. 2. Willing to have a screening biopsy performed from an easily accessible lesion (ex. skin, superficial lymph node) AND whose tumour must overexpress eIF4E. 3. Easily accessible lesion for serial biopsies (ex. skin, superficial lymph node, or other easily accessible site). 4. At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion (based on the RECIST criteria) outside the CNS. 5. ECOG 0, 1, or 2. 6. Adequate recovery (excluding alopecia) from previous surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. 7. Adequate washout period from last therapy (at least 3 weeks). 8. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. 9. Age ≥ 18 years old. 10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (betaHCG) pregnancy test within 14 days of starting protocol and must not be breastfeeding. Men and women of childbearing potential (including men who have had a vasectomy and women who have had tubal ligation) must agree to use two effective means of contraception throughout the study and for at least 6 months after completion of protocol. Postmenopausal women (defined as 12 or more consecutive months of amenorrhea, or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range), or surgically sterile women (defined as removal of the uterus or ovaries), do not require methods of contraception. 11. Adequate renal and hepatic function: serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN; AST or ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN if liver involvement with metastases); serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN. 12. Adequate hematopoietic function: neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L. 13. Provide written consent after the investigational nature, study design, risks and benefits of the study have been explained. 14. Accessible for treatment and follow up. 1. Symptomatic brain metastases. 2. Active cardiovascular disease as defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIIV categorization. 3. Intercurrent illness or medical condition precluding safe administration of the planned protocol treatment or required followup. 4. Use of any investigational anticancer drug within 2 weeks before start of study treatment or inadequate recovery from any toxic effects of such therapy. 5. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 6. Concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy. Bisphosphonates are allowed as long as they were started prior to screening (at least 4 weeks before study entry). 7. Known infection with HIV. 8. History of other malignancy in the past 5 years. Subjects who have been diseasefree for 1 year or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.</criteria>
