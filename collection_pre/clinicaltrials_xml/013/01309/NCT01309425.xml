	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Dose-proportionality of Tapentadol (CG5503) in Healthy Japanese and Korean Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-dose, open-label, single-center, randomized, four-way crossover study, ie, participants and investigator know the identity of the drug, which is assigned by chance, like flipping a coin, and participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the study. The study will consist of 4 treatment periods. A single dose of tapentadol (CG5503) will be administered orally with 240 mL of water under fasted conditions. All participants will receive 1 of the following 4 oral treatments in each period. Treatment A: One 25-mg tablet (25 mg) of tapentadol (CG5503) Treatment B: One 50-mg tablet (50 mg) of tapentadol (CG5503) Treatment C: One 100-mg tablet (100 mg) of tapentadol (CG5503) Treatment D: Two 100-mg tablets (200 mg) of tapentadol (CG5503) Each period will be separated by 7 - 14 days.</detailed_description>
