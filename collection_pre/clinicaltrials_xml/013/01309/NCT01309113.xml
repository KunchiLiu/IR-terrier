	<brief_summary>Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 parallel groups, multi-center study in 180 patients with cyclic mastodynia with premenstrual syndrome. 225 patients will be screened to achieve 180 patients eligible for randomisation, 60 to each treatment group, of which 150 are expected to complete the study per protocol. Study objectives: Identification of the optimal dosage of VAC BNO 1095 (product name) film coated tablets for treatment of cyclic mastodynia and premenstrual syndrome. To prove the efficacy of VAC BNO 1095 film coated tablets in the treatment of cyclic mastodynia. Dose regimen: Group 1: VAC BNO 1095 1x10 mg: 1 tablet of verum in the morning, 1 placebo tablet in the evening Group 2: VAC BNO 1095 2x10 mg: 1 tablet of verum in the morning, 1 tablet of verum in the evening Group 3: Placebo: 1 tablet placebo in the morning, 1 tablet placebo in the evening The study consists of a 2-cycle run-in period, followed by 3 cycles of treatment. After first screening further visits are scheduled after the end of each of the first and second run-in cycle, and after the first, second and third treatment cycle, respectively. Visits will be performed during the menses at day 3 (-1+3 days), i.e. 2 days after day 1 of menstruation number n, with exception of the first screening visit which can be performed at any time prior to the first run-in cycle. Subsequently the time between the first study visit and the onset of the first run-in cycle menses T shall be added to the overall study duration. In case that the next menstruation does not commence as expected, the patient should contact her investigator immediately in order to schedule a new appointment, approximately on the actual day 3 of the menses.</brief_summary>
