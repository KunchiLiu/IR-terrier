	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical efficacy has been shown in adults with head and neck cancer. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. This is a randomized, muti-center sites trial of this treatment.</brief_summary>
