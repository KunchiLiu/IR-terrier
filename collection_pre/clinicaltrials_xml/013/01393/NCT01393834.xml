	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate if delaying cord clamping or milking the umbilical cord of the preterm infant has health benefits for the baby. Timing of clamping of the cord varies among doctors, but there is information that shows that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in premature infants may reduce the rate of the baby needing a blood transfusion, decrease the risk of infection and bleeding in the head.</brief_summary>
