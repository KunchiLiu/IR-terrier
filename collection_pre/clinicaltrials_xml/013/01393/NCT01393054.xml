	<brief_summary>Despite of the development of new anti hypertensive agents, hypertension in elderly is still a big health problem. Nigella sativa seed extract, derived from a small plant originating in Middle east which can be found abundantly in Asia, has shown small antihypertensive effect in adult. Diuretic effect of Nigella sativa is thought to be the main mechanism for the effect but as it also shows anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory activity which are important contributors in arterial stiffness, the main pathogenesis of hypertension in elderly, thus it has a superior potential benefit for this population. We will conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to prove the effect of Nigella sativa seed extract in elderly patients with hypertension. Our hypothesis is 300 mg Nigella sativa seed extract twice daily will have anti-hypertensive effect in the blood pressure of elderly with hypertension.</brief_summary>
