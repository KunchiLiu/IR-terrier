	<brief_title>Study of the Relationship Between Serum Adiponectin and Clinical Prognosis in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adiponectin, an adipose tissue derived protein, is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes. Since its discovery, adiponectin has garnered considerable attention for its role in cardiovascular pathology. It has been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular events in both the general population and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In this study,we are planning to investigate the relationship between serum adiponectin and clinical prognosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
