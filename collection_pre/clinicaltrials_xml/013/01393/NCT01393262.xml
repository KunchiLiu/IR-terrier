	<brief_summary>The purpose of the research is to investigate multiple facets of non-traumatic and traumatic health issues. The majority of our research deals with mind-body aspects of health. The investigators often correlate different psychological measures against one another or match psychological and depression scores against standard of care objective measurements (grip strength and range of motion). The data repository also serves to streamline our studies and amalgamate many studies that are no more than minimal risk and do not involve randomization in any way.</brief_summary>
