	<brief_summary>The morbidity of spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing significantly in China. The methods to treat SCI patients in sequela stage update are poor. Though traditional rehabilitation therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, its effect to improve the neurological disorders of these patients, such as the dysfunction of sense, motor, autologous adjustment of blood pressure control of urination and defecation, perspiration , etc. is unsatisfying. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function. Studies show that mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can remarkably improve the neurological function of SCI in animals without any severe side effect. In this study, the investigators use mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord to treat 40 SCI patients (20 cases in early stage and 20 cases in sequela stage). The investigators also follow-up ten patients who only receive rehabilitation and another ten outpatients who accept neither stem cell therapy nor rehabilitation. On this basis, the investigators can compare the efficacy of these two treatments.</brief_summary>
