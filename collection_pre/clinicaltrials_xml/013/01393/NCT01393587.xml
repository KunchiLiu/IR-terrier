	<brief_summary>Recently, a new synthetic marker was developed, based on a molecule that is composed of Amino Acids and Linoleic Acid and Neucleic Acid, which is capable of detecting even minor changes of oxidative stress. The investigators would like to assess the usefulness of this marker during positive pressure pneumoperitoneum, during laproscopic surgery, with or without intenstinal resection (ischemia induced by intra-abdominal pressure and vascualr compromise).</brief_summary>
