	<criteria>Disease severity of Moderate, Severe, or Very Severe by Investigator Global Assessment. Disease severity must be greater than or equal to 6 on the RajkaLangeland Severity Scoring system corresponding to moderatesevere disease. Baseline EASI score must be greater than or equal to 11. A previous validation study for the EASI scoring system revealed patients with moderate to very severe disease had mean EASI scores ranging from 1130. Candidate for, or previously on systemic therapy, including cyclosporine, methotrexate, or other immunosuppressant and treatment with ultraviolet light. Specifically, subjects are considered candidates for systemic therapy when their disease is not adequately controlled using topical therapies or sideeffects prevent the further safe use of topical therapies. Subjects must meet the washout requirements History of active mycobacterial infection with any species (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis) within 3 years prior to screening visit. Subjects with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection more than 3 years prior to screening visit are allowed if successful treatment was completed at least 3 years prior to randomization and is documented and available for verification. At least 3 major bacterial infections resulting in hospitalization and/or requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment within the past 2 years. Clinically significant abnormality on the chest Xray (CXR) at screening. Chest Xrays performed within 3 months prior to start of study drug are acceptable. Use of any investigational medication within 4 weeks prior to start of study drug or 5 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic halflives (whichever is longer). Any clinically significant abnormality on 12lead ECG (electrocardiogram) at screening. History of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., Common Variable Immunodeficiency [CVID]). Hepatitis B surface antigen positive or Hepatitis B core antibody positive at screening. History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Antibodies to Hepatitis C at screening. History of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and thin melanoma. Systemic corticosteroiddependent asthma. Active infection of any type at the time of enrollment.</criteria>
