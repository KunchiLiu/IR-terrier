	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of endoscopic valve implantation in patients with COPD and PH on hemodynamics, symptoms, exercise tolerance and quality of life in 10 patients in a prospective study. An improvement of objective parameters may also have a prognostic significance</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ELVR in PH Patients With Severe Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>So far there is no treatment of COPD in addition to the established treatment of concomitant PH. Administration of PH-specific medication outside of clinical trials is not recommended in new guidelines for PH of the ERS/ESC. The influence of endobronchial valve implantation on the PH has not been studied in detail. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of endoscopic valve implantation in patients with COPD and PH on hemodynamics, symptoms, exercise tolerance and quality of life in 10 patients in a prospective study. An improvement of objective parameters may also have a prognostic significance</detailed_description>
