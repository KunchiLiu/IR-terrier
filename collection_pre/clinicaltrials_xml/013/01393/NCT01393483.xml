	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether a protein, called mesothelin, found in the blood and tissue can be used as "marker" for esophageal cancer. Doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center would like to compare levels of this protein in patients with abnormal cells or tissue of the esophageal to the levels of this protein in patients being treated for cancer for the esophagus.</brief_summary>
