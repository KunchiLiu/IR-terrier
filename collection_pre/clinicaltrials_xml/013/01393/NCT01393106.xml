	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of idelalisib in participants with relapsed of refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). The primary objective will be to assess the overall response rate. Eligible participants will initiate oral therapy with idelalisib at a starting dose of 150 mg twice daily. Treatment with idelalisib will continue until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
