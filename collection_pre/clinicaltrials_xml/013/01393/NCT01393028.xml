	<brief_summary>Direct non-invasive coronary imaging by computed tomography (CT) has the potential to improve the workup of patients with stable chest pain complaints. The objective of the study is to compare in a randomized fashion the effectiveness and efficiency of a CT angiographic driven workup of suspected coronary artery disease in comparison to the standard workup using stress testing.</brief_summary>
