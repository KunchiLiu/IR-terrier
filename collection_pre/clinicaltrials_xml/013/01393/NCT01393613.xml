	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of OPC-34712 in Adults With Acute Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the world population. Hallucinations and delusions are the most striking characteristic positive symptoms of schizophrenia; however, more subtle negative symptoms (eg, social withdrawal and lack of emotion, energy, and motivation) may also be present. The first antipsychotics developed for the treatment of schizophrenia were effective against positive symptoms, but showed little efficacy for negative symptoms and were also associated with a high incidence of side effects. Second generation antipsychotics, represent a significant advancement in the treatment of psychotic disorders because they are effective and at the same time exhibit fewer side effects than first generation antipsychotics. Although generally safer than first generation antipsychotics, the second-generation antipsychotics are not devoid of undesirable side effects such as Hyperprolactinemia and weight gain. In addition, the safety of these drugs vary considerably.</detailed_description>
