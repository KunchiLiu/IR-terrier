	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if the addition of dutasteride to a regimen with abiraterone acetate and prednisone will improve on therapy in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic disease. This study will also help determine the side effects of the study treatment and how often they occur.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate Combined With Dutasteride for Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone orally, once daily for 2 months (2 cycles) on an outpatient basis. At the start of cycle 3, dutasteride will be taken once daily. Patients will return to the clinic on Day 14 of the first 3 cycles for routine blood tests. Patients will come to the clinic every 12 weeks for a CT scan and/or x-ray of the chest, CT scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, bone scan, and blood test for testosterone and other specialized blood test.</detailed_description>
