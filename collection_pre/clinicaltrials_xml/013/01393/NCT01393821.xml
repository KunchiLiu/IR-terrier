	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore the effectiveness of a menadione topical lotion to the face to prevent cutaneous and psychological discomfort from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Explore the adverse event profile of a menadione topical lotion to the face to prevent rash from EGFR inhibitors. II. Explore whether rash or adverse events worsen over a 4 week period after this 4-week intervention. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients apply menadione topical lotion twice daily (BID) for 28 days. ARM II: Patients apply topical placebo lotion BID for 28 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
