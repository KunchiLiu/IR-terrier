	<criteria>Subjects with Multiple Myeloma (MM) and renal function fitting one of three categories: 1. Severe renal impairment: estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 ml/min, but not requiring dialysis 2. Endstage renal disease: requiring hemodialysis 3. Normal renal function: estimated CrCl ≥90 ml/min Documented evidence of symptomatic MM, either newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory Prior Lenalidomide exposure is permitted only if the subject did not discontinue Lenalidomide due to a Grade ≥3 related Adverse Event (AE) Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or smoldering myeloma Active plasma cell leukemia All adverse events of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy not resolved POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) Acute renal failure</criteria>
