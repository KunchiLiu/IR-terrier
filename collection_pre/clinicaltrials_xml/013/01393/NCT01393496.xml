	<brief_title>Effects of Transfusion Thresholds on Neurocognitive Outcome of Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants uniformly develop anemia of prematurity and frequently require multiple red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) during neonatal intensive care. The criteria currently applied to indicate RBCT in this population are based on expert opinion rather than evidence and conclusive data of long-term effects of RBCT practices do not exist. Both, giving RBCT to improve oxygen carrying capacity and restricting RBCT to avoid RBCT associated risks and costs potentially impair long-term development. The proposed blinded randomized controlled trial was designed and will be powered to compare the effect of restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion guidelines on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in ELBW infants. ELBW infants will be randomized to receive RBCT according to liberal or restrictive RBCT guidelines, which both reflect current practice in Germany and aim for a clinically relevant difference in mean hemoglobin concentrations. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of death or major neurodevelopmental impairment determined at 24 months of age corrected for prematurity. Key secondary outcomes are the incidences of individual components of the composite primary outcome, the mental and physical developmental index scores of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (II edition), and growth. Safety analyses will assess the incidences of all major diseases of prematurity. The results of this trial may help to improve the quality of life of these patients and reduce long-term health care costs.</detailed_description>
