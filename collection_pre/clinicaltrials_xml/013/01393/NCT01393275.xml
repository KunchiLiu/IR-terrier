	<brief_summary>The purposes of the study are - to determine if a supervised exercise intervention is improving the metabolic parameters in type 2 diabetes patients - to investigate what kind of intervention (strength endurance training versus combined strength endurance training and rehabilitation exercise intervention)is more effective in improving the metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes - to assess which exercise intervention induces higher effects to the metabolic rate and cardiac and pulmonary capacity - to investigate what kind of intervention includes highest effects in long term persistence of these positive effects</brief_summary>
