	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug SOM 230 in addition to standard therapy of gemcitabine can shrink or slow the growth of pancreatic cancer. The safety and tolerability of different doses of SOM 230 will also be studied. The participants' physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us (the study doctor and Moffitt Cancer Center) decide if SOM 230 is safe and effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SOM 230 and Gemcitabine in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study of combination therapy with SOM 230 LAR and standard treatment with gemcitabine. We will utilize a staggered, sequential dose-escalation design to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SOM 230 LAR when combined with standard doses of gemcitabine. Cycle will be defined as 28 days. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Gemcitabine is administered by IV infusion. The dose should be based on the patient's actual baseline body weight; the dose will be recalculated if there is a weight change of &gt; 10% from baseline. The dose of gemcitabine will be given over 30 minutes, weekly every 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest period. SOM 230 LAR will be administered as an intramuscular dose determined by the dosing schema, every month.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytologically or histologically confirmed evidence of epithelial cancer (adenocarcinoma) of the exocrine pancreas Metastatic or locally advanced disease. Patients with measurable and with non measurable disease, as per RECIST criteria are eligible. Minimum of 4 weeks since any major surgery, completion of radiation Prior treatment with gemcitabine alone or 5fluorouracil (5FU) with radiation as an adjuvant therapy will be allowed if &gt; 6 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function as shown by: serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and serum transaminases activity ≤ 3 x ULN, with the exception of serum transaminases (&lt; 5 x ULN) if the patient has liver metastases. Adequate renal function as shown by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days of the administration of the first study treatment. Women must not be lactating. Both men and WOCBP must be advised of the importance of using effective birth control measures during the course of the study. Signed informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from patients after they have been fully informed of the nature and potential risks by the investigator (or his/her designee) with the aid of written information. Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) with a time from electrocardiogram Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole [QT] corrected for heart rate (QTc) &lt; 450 msec Prior treatment with any cytotoxic chemotherapy except as an adjuvant therapy Have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment Chronic treatment with steroids or any other immunosuppressant drugs Should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines during study period or within 1 week of study entry. Untreated brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or a fasting plasma glucose &gt; 1.5 ULN or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;8%. Note: At the principle investigator's discretion, noneligible patients can be rescreened after adequate medical therapy has been instituted Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis QT related exclusion criteria: Fridericia Correction Formula (QTcF) at screening &gt; 450 msec; History of syncope or family history of idiopathic sudden death; Sustained or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias; Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, cardiac failure, clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia, or highgrade atrioventricular (AV) block; Concomitant medication(s) known to prolong the QT interval (patient must be off the drug for 2 weeks to be eligible) Patients who have congestive heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV], unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block or a history of acute myocardial infarction within the 6 months preceding enrollment Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/ disorders; Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the treatment with the study therapy Women who are pregnant or breast feeding, or women/men able to conceive and unwilling to practice an effective method of birth control. (WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to administration of pasireotide). Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Known hypersensitivity to somatostatin analogues or any component of the pasireotide or octreotide LAR formulations History of noncompliance to medical regimens Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol</criteria>
