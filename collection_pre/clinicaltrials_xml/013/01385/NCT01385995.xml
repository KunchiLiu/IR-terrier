	<brief_summary>The investigators performed a randomized, cross-over controlled clinical trial comparing 8 weeks of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) to 8 weeks of sham-CPAP in patients with moderate to severe Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and impaired glucose tolerance. A rigorous assessment of metabolic responses to SDB treatment in this group is of great clinical significance because this sample is at high risk for developing diabetes. The paradigm shift of CPAP as a mode of prevention can affect clinical practice in the fields of both primary care and sleep medicine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are few controlled studies that address whether treatment of sleep apnea improves glucose tolerance. This is a randomized, double-blind cross-over study of subjects with sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index &gt; 15) and impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects will be randomized to 8 weeks of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or sham-CPAP, followed by the alternate therapy after a one month wash-out. After each treatment, subjects will undergo 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing, polysomnography, actigraphy, and measurements of indices of glucose control. The investigators intend to analyze the changes in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in patients with sleep apnea with CPAP intervention.</detailed_description>
