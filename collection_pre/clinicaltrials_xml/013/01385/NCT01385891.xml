	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis. combination chemotherapy with Clofarabine VP16 and Cyclophosphamide is able to induce remission in resistant/refractory acute leukemias in pediatric. Forty children with relapsed or refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) entered the study and received the association of clofarabine (40 mg/m2/day) in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m2/day) and Cyclophosphamide (440 mg/m2/day) in 1 or 2 induction cycles End point were complete remission (CR)or CR without platelet recovery (CRp) and toxicity</brief_summary>
