	<brief_summary>This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of grass sublingual tablet (SCH 697243) versus placebo in the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic hayfever symptoms. Participants will receive either the sublingual grass tablet or a placebo tablet during the study. It is expected that those participants receiving the active sublingual grass tablet will have less hayfever symptoms and need less medications to treat hayfever symptoms during the grass pollen season.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must have a clinical history of significant allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to grass (with or without asthma) Must have a positive skin prick test response to Phleum pratense (Timothy grass) Must be positive for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) against Phleum pratense (Timothy grass) Must have an forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of at least 70% of predicted value at Screening Safety laboratory tests and vital signs conducted at the Screening Visit must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/sponsor Has a clinical history of symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or asthma due to another allergen during or potentially overlapping the GPS Has a clinical history of significant symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma due to an allergen to which the participant is regularly exposed Has received an immunosuppressive treatment within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit Has a clinical history of severe asthma Has a history of anaphylaxis with cardiorespiratory symptoms Has a history of selfinjectable epinephrine use Has a history of chronic urticaria and angioedema Has a clinical history of chronic sinusitis during the 2 years prior to the Screening Visit Has current severe atopic dermatitis Is breastfeeding, pregnant, or intending to become pregnant Had previous treatment by immunotherapy with any grass pollen allergen for more than 1 month within the 5 years prior to the Screening Visit Ongoing treatment with any specific immunotherapy at the time of the Screening Visit Has a known history of allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to the ingredients of the study drug (except for Phleum pratense), rescue medications, or selfinjectable epinephrine Has any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study evaluations or optimal participation in the study. Specific examples include but are not limited to hypertension being treated with beta blockers, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, stroke, ocular conditions requiring topical beta blockers, any condition requiring the use of beta blockers Has used any investigational drugs within 30 days of the Screening Visit Is participating in any other clinical study Is a family member of the investigational study staff conducting this study Is unable to meet medication washout requirements Is unlikely to be able to complete the trial, for any reason, or likely to travel for extended periods of time during the GPS, which in the opinion of the investigator will compromise the data Has a clinically significant abnormal vital sign or laboratory value that would preclude participation in the study</criteria>
