	<brief_summary>Patients with active acute leukemia have dismal prognoses even with allogeneic transplantation.Thus,new measures to enhance graft versus leukemia effect and reduce relapse rates are needed. Relapse risk after double umbilical cord transplantations have been shown to be significantly lower compared to matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplantations due to better graft versus leukemia effect. The investigators hypothesize, that concomitant transplantation from 2 matched siblings may improve GVL effect and reduce relapse rate in patients with high risk acute leukemias and other high risk hematological malignancies.</brief_summary>
