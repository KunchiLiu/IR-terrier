	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of the cholesterol lowering agent Ezetimibe when used in addition to optimal treatment with Atorvastatin in patients with acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) who have not been in prior statin therapy. An area with arteriosclerosis not demanding intervention in a coronary vessel other than the infarct related is used as measuring point and is examined at time of the infarction and after 12 month using intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography. At the same time the same techniques are used to examine the implanted stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ezetimibe In Addition To Atorvastatin Therapy On The Plaque Composition In Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) with tissue characterization (IVUS-TC) are relatively new expansions to intravascular assessments, and has the capacity to assess plaque composition and, potentially, to identify vulnerable plaques. One of the mechanisms by which statins improve patient outcomes may be by changing the composition of a "vulnerable" plaque. The main effect is believed to rely on a lowering of LDL-c. The question is whether a further reduction of LDL by adding ezetimibe to optimal cholesterol lowering therapy using statins may result in further plaque stabilization or reduction. This is the hypothesis of the current study. 100 patients are randomized to Ezetimibe 10 mg per day or placebo. All patients are treated with Atorvastatin 80 mg. OCT and IVUS are performed at inclusion (typically the day after Primary PCI) and again at follow-up after 12 month.</detailed_description>
