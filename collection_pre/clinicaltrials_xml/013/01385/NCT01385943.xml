	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to test a protocol that uses clinical pictures, confocal reflectance microscopy images and dermoscopic information in a telemedicine platform. This protocol will test the technologies and diagnostic performance of dermoscopy and confocal reflectance microscopy in a randomized prospective multicenter study in five different centers in Europe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VivaNet Study. A Multicenter Study of Confocal Reflectance Microscopy in Telemedicine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In vivo confocal reflectance microscopy (CRM) is a non-invasive method for the in vivo (without cutting into the skik) examination of skin tumors. CRM produces cellular images with resolution comparable to histopathology. The procedure is painless, takes about ten minutes and has no documented side effects. Studies performed in the past decade have correlated CRM features in benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) skin lesions such as moles and melanomas, as well as features of inflammatory lesions (such as allergic skin reactions) to histopathology. Dermoscopy is a complementary technique that has been proven to be superior to the naked eye for the diagnosis of melanoma as well as some non-melanocytic skin tumors. Recently, correlation of dermoscopic and CRM structures has focused interest in the research in different groups that show that both are complementary and render in combination a better understanding of skin disease. In this study, patients from several research centers in Europe, with lesions suspicious for malignancy and scheduled for biopsy will be asked if they would like to participate in the study. If they consent to the study, first, a clinical photograph will be taken of the lesion. Second, a dermoscopic image will be taken of the lesion, and third, CRM images will be taken of the lesion. Finally, the biopsy will be performed as per the standard of care. The images will be sent over a secure, private internet connection to physicians specially trained in the interpretation of dermoscopic and CRM images. An electronic report will be completed and returned to the Study Coordinator, who will correlate the results with the histopathologic diagnosis.</detailed_description>
