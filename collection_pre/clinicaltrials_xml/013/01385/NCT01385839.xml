	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the safety, as well as the efficacy of hair transplantation compared with irritation with hypodermic needles in the treatment of subjects with refractory alopecia areata. With this study, the investigators hope to demonstrate that trauma is just as effective as hair transplant in the treatment of recalcitrant alopecia areata of the scalp.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Hair Transplantation Compared With Hypodermic Needle Irritation in Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata is a recurrent, non-scarring type of hair loss that can affect any hair-bearing area. This disorder can present in many different manners. Though medically benign, alopecia areata can result in severe emotional and psychosocial stress in affected individuals. This disease can be treated by hair transplantation. Hair transplantation is a procedure in which donor hair follicles are harvested from a section of a patient's scalp, and transplanted in another bald recipient area, at which time it will take root and continue to grow. Hairs generally continue to grow indefinitely During this study, subjects with alopecia areata will have one area (or ½ of a large area) treated by hair transplant and another (or the other ½) treated by simple irritation with a large gauge sterile hypodermic needle.</detailed_description>
