	<criteria>Diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy confirmed by at least genetic testing, theoretically treatable by exon 53 skipping. Age between â‰¥ 12 and &lt;20 years old. Non ambulant patients (i;e; inability to walk more than 10 meters without any of assistance). Patients covered by a national health insurance scheme. Signed informed consent. Patient incapable of sitting upright in a wheelchair for at least one hour. Patients with severe intellectual impairment preventing them from fully understanding the exercises to be performed. Recent (less than 6 months ago) upper limb surgery or trauma This criteria is however no definitive. Patients who have undergone upper limb surgery or trauma may nonetheless be enrolled once the 6 month period is over. Known immune deficiency. Contraindications to NMR exams</criteria>
