	<brief_summary>Clinically significant test results require timely clinician follow-up including the non-urgent clinically significant, or actionable, test results that have received less standardized management and attention. Unfortunately, failure to correctly manage actionable test results is not infrequent and may be associated with important delays in diagnosis and treatment and patient harm. The investigators have designed a safe practice intervention to improve the management of actionable test results for ambulatory patients in a large healthcare system.</brief_summary>
