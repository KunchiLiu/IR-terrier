	<brief_summary>Permanent dependency of breathing apparatus due to spinal cord injury is traditionally treated with different types of mechanical ventilation. However, the electric ventilation became a possibility through their most current versions, such as diaphragmatic pacemakers. Diaphragmatic pacemakers rhythmically stimulates the diaphragm to replace the functions of the respiratory center that doesn't works well or is inaccessible. However, this modality has the prerequisite that the phrenic nerve and diaphragm muscle are normal. The reason for the development of diaphragmatic pacemaker freeing the patient from the ventilator. By using the mechanical energy of the diaphragm of the patient, the patient may come not need the ventilator tubing, tracheostomy, and with the help of their caregivers, the inconvenient mechanical ventilators.</brief_summary>
