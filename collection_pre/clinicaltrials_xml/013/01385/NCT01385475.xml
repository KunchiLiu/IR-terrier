	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current resistance training guidelines for older adults proposed by ACSM/AHA to improve physical function in individuals with reduced physical abilities. A randomized controlled intervention trial will be used to compare change in physical function pre- and post-intervention between a treatment group receiving the minimum recommendations of the guidelines and a control group asked not to change their physical activity participation. To better understand the clinical significance of such an occurrence, a secondary purpose was to determine if older adults with reduced physical abilities who adhere to the recommended intervention dosage will experience a change such that they can be reclassified to a more favorable level of functioning. It is hypothesized that the minimum recommended dosage of the guidelines would be sufficient to both improve physical function and improve functional classification in older adults with reduced physical abilities.</brief_summary>
