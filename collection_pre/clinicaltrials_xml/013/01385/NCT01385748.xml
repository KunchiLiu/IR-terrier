Patient eligible to receive concurrent chemoradiation defined as: 1. A continuous course of conventional external beam irradiation (IMRT eligible) with a minimum cumulative radiation dose of 50 Gy or a maximum of 70 Gy, based on a daily dosing between 1.8 and 2.2 Gy combined with platinum based chemotherapy on a weekly or triweekly cycles. 2. Planned radiation treatment fields must include at least two oral tissue sites (among right or left buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, tongue, right or left soft palate) with each site receiving a total of 50 Gy or a maximum of 70 Gy. The radiation treatment plan will be reviewed by a designated radiation oncologist. ECOG performance status ≤2 Screening laboratory tests: 1. Haemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL 2.
