	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of GS-6624 (Formerly AB0024) in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK of GS-6624 after multiple IV administrations in patients with IPF. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the formation of anti-GS-6624 antibodies and to measure the effects of GS-6624 on FVC, DLCO, and SGRQ score. A total of 48 patients will be enrolled. In the double-blind phase (Part A), a total of 18 patients were enrolled at 3 dose levels. Part A was completed in October 2011. In Part B, 30 patients will be enrolled at 2 dose levels. Part B is open-label and is currently enrolling.</detailed_description>
