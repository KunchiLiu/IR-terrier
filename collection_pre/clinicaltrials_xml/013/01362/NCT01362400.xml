	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of IPI-504 in combination with docetaxel to placebo in combination with docetaxel on life expectancy in patients with Non Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC). Docetaxel is an approved chemotherapy for NSCLC. An additional goal of the study is to determine the effect of IPI-504, in combination with docetaxel, verses placebo in, combination with docetaxel, on the growth of cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-blind Study Evaluating IPI-504 and Docetaxel in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC designed to compare IPI-504 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel. All patients will have at least a 15 pack year smoking history. Tumor samples will be assessed by a central pathology reviewer to confirm pathology that is documented at baseline; this review need not occur in advance of randomization.</detailed_description>
