	<brief_title>Spinal Cord Stimulation For Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients remain relatively high, even with recent advances in therapies. Previous studies show that the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF)and sudden cardiac death. SCS is a neurostimulation therapy, which involves the stimulation of selected nerve fibers and intends to create end-organ responses characterized by changes in blood flow, decrease of catecholamines and reduction in inflammation. These changes that occur due to SCS are shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of chronic angina and pain secondary to peripheral vascular disease where both situations are characterized by decreased blood flow and inflammation. The SCS system consists of an implantable pulse generator(IPG) and lead(s). Each lead has electrodes on the distal end. Electrical impulses travel from the IPG through the leads to the electrodes positioned at the selected nerve fibers to provide the therapeutic stimulation. By virtue of its potential in augmenting blood flow, decreasing catecholamines and reducing inflammation, SCS may further benefit patients with heart failure (HF).</detailed_description>
