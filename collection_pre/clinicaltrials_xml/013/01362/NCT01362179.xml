	<brief_summary>This is an observational study of unstimulated bone marrow (BM) and filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors. The primary goal is to evaluate the hypothesis that the incidence of targeted malignant, thrombotic and autoimmune disorders after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donation are similar between unstimulated BM and filgrastim-mobilized PBSC donors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an observational study of unstimulated bone marrow (BM) and filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors. The primary goal is to evaluate the hypothesis that the incidence of targeted malignant, thrombotic and autoimmune disorders after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donation are similar between unstimulated BM and filgrastim-mobilized PBSC donors. Donors will undergo biennial surveys until study completion. Cases of targeted disorders will be reviewed by the medical monitors to confirm the veracity of the report.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Unrelated donor who donated either unstimulated BM or filgrastimmobilized PBSC between July 1, 1999 and approximately five years post study activation. 2. Unrelated donor who received at least one injection of filgrastim or more, but did not donate filgrastimmobilized PBSC between July 1, 1999 and approximately five years post study activation. 3. Donation was managed by a U.S. NMDP donor center. 4. Signed informed consent for participation in this longterm donor followup study. Concurrent enrollment on other studies is permitted. 1. Unrelated donor who donated filgrastimmobilized bone marrow. 2. Donation was managed by a nonU.S. donor center. 3.
