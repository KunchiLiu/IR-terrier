	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to assess the superiority of darbepoetin alfa versus placebo on the incidence of red blood cell transfusions during the 24-week double-blind treatment period in anemic patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Darbepoetin Alfa in Patients With Anemic Low or Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of a 3-week screening period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, and a 48-week active treatment period and the long-term follow-up period. An end of treatment period (EOTP) visit occurs at week 25, or 3 weeks after last dose of investigational product (IP) for participants who withdraw from the study. After entering the active treatment period, an end of active treatment period (EOATP) visit occurs at week 72 / 73, or 3 weeks after the last dose of darbepoetin alfa. Long-term follow-up (LTFU) will occur every 26 weeks (± 4 weeks) from the EOATP visit (or EOTP visit if the participant does not enter the active treatment period) and will continue for a minimum of 3 years from the first dose of IP. Follow-up may occur through clinic visit or telephone contacts. Information on the participant's survival and progression to AML status will be collected during LTFU.</detailed_description>
