	<criteria>Moderate to severe active RA with an inadequate response to existing therapies (DMARDs and/or antiTNFs) Considered eligible for tocilizumab therapy by the treating physician as per routine clinical practice Pregnant or breastfeeding females Immunization with live/attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to baseline Participants with clinically significant raised liver enzyme, abnormal lipid profile, platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell and neutrophil count History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to human, humanized or murine monoclonal antibodies Participants with active tuberculosis (TB). Participants with latent TB should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating tocilizumab and have a negative chest x ray for active TB at enrolment History of diverticulitis, chronic ulcerative lower GI disease such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or other symptomatic lower GI conditions that might predispose to perforations then the benefit risk ratio should be considered by treating physician Know active current or history of recurrent bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial or other infection History of or currently active primary or secondary immunodeficiency or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status Any other condition which puts the participant to undue risk for tocilizumab therapy as per local prescribing information or Investigator's judgement</criteria>
