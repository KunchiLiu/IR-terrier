	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Study of Golimumab in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 1, randomized (study drug route of administration assigned by chance), open label (both physician and patient know that golimumab has been assigned), study of golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (how the body effects the drug) and pharmacodynamic (how the drug effects the body) effects of golimumab administered through a vein in the arm or by injection under the skin. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure), and the occurrence and severity of adverse events. The study will also assess the clinical effects of golimumab on RA. The study is planned for approximately 45 patients, which are randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive golimumab SC or IV. Male or female patients who have been diagnosed with RA for at least 3 months and who are 18 years of age or older may be able to participate. Subcutaneous (SC) injections of 100 mg golimumab every 4 weeks through Week 20 or intravenous (IV) administrations of 2 mg/kg golimumab on Days 1 and 85.</detailed_description>
