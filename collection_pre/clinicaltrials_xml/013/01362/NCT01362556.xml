	<brief_summary>The debate over the administration of sodium bicarbonate in cardiac arrest has been going on for several decades, swinging like a pendulum from "first-line drug" to "not indicated" to the recent guidelines advocating "a small bolus under special conditions (metabolic acidosis, intoxication, long-term resuscitation)". A targeted, blood-gas controlled application under optimised ventilation conditions has not yet been evaluated prehospitally. Our preliminary studies have shown that an arterial puncture/line as well as measurement of blood gases is feasible in preclinical conditions. This multicentre trial including 5 centres and 10 physician-staffed emergency systems is designed to compare, in a prospective randomised controlled study, the effect of a calculated dosage of sodium bicarbonate based on the patientÂ´s base deficit and weight, on ROSC (= return of spontaneous circulation) and on the secondary survival of cardiac arrest patients. The null hypothesis is that there is no or negative impact on survival.</brief_summary>
