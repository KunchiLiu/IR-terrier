	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral GDC-0068 administered in combination with either docetaxel (Arm A), or oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy) (Arm B), or paclitaxel (Arm C), in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for which standard therapy either does not exist or has proven ineffective or intolerable. Arm D will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0068 administered in combination with enzalutamide in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There will be two stages within each arm of this study: a dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) and a cohort-expansion stage (Stage 2). In Stage 1, approximately 3 to 6 cohorts in Arms A and B and 1 to 2 cohorts in Arms C and D will be evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GDC-0068 in a given combination. Additional participants will be enrolled in Stage 2 (cohort expansion), to further characterize the safety and tolerability of GDC-0068 in these combinations and to confirm a potential recommended Phase II dose of GDC-0068 for each regimen.</brief_summary>
