	<brief_summary>In the European Union (EU), plerixafor is indicated in combination with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the peripheral blood (PB) for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) whose cells mobilise poorly. This is a clinical outcome analysis of a prospectively defined cohort of patients with data reported retrospectively to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) who have lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM), whose cells mobilize poorly, and who have undergone autologous haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation during the years 2008 up to and including 2012. The EBMT is a non-profit, scientific society representing more than 600 transplant centers mainly in Europe. The EBMT promotes all activity aiming to improve stem cell transplantation or cellular therapy, which includes registering all the activity relating to stem cell transplants. Data are entered, managed, and maintained in a central database with internet access; each EBMT center is represented in this database. The analysis of data from a well established registry like the EBMT registry allows for follow up of a large number of patients who are representative of the patient population receiving plerixafor.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For inclusion in the cohort analysis, patients must have data in the EBMT registry that meet the following criteria: Adults diagnosed with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) Received first autologous transplants of peripheral blood (PB) non exvivo manipulated stem cells in the time period listed above using cells mobilised with one of the following regimens: plerixafor plus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) plerixafor plus GCSF plus chemotherapy GCSF alone or GCSF plus chemotherapy Note: Patients included in the plerixafor groups will be those treated according to the label Provision of informed consent (i.e., all patients with data in the EBMT registry will have signed consent at the time of transplantation for the potential use of their data for analysis) Patients treated with plerixafor NOT according to the European Union (EU) label. Patients whose graft product underwent ex vivo manipulation will be excluded from analysis</criteria>
