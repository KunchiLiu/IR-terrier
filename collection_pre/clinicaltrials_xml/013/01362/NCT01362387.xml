	<brief_summary>Purpose: This randomised trial will compare outcomes and acceptability of an alternative medical abortion follow-up protocol using standardised text messaging, on-line questionnaire, or a phone interview and a low sensitivity pregnancy test with the current standard of care which consists of either a clinic visit and ultrasound scan or a telephone call and high sensitivity pregnancy test. Hypothesis: The use of "alternative" methods to assess outcomes after early medical abortion will achieve a higher rate of follow-up than women undergoing "standard" follow-up Primary aim: To determine the follow-up rate after early medical abortion with an alternative protocol as compared to a standard follow-up protocol Secondary aims: - To assess complication rates and receipt of further treatment among women in the two study arms - To ascertain women's preferences for mode of communication regarding their post-medical abortion status - To determine provider opinions and preferences for different follow-up modalities</brief_summary>
