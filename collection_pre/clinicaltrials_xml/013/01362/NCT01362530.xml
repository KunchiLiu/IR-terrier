	<brief_summary>This study will compare the safety and efficacy of a three-day oral aprepitant regimen (aprepitant plus ondansetron) to ondansetron alone in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the 120 hours following the initiation of chemotherapy in pediatric participants. Those who complete this first cycle of treatment and meet certain eligibility criteria will have the option of continuing for 5 additional cycles of open-label aprepitant.</brief_summary>
