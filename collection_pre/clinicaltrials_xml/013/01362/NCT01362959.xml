	<brief_title>Nicotine Replacement Therapy in the Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and premature death worldwide. There are about 1.2 billion smokers in the world, half of whom will die from diseases caused by smoking. Smoking causes 5 million deaths per year, and if present trends continue, 10 million smokers per year are projected to die by 2025. Furthermore, abstinence from the highly addictive tobacco products can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Although these symptoms are non-life threatening in healthy and hospitalized adults they are not well described in the mechanically ventilated active smoking patient. Retrospective studies found a higher, lower or equal mortality in critically ill patients receiving nicotine replacement therapy compared to patients receiving no nicotine replacement. Because of these conflicting results and the absence of a randomized controlled trial studying the efficacy and safety of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy in the critically ill smoking patient a clinical study will be conducted.</detailed_description>
