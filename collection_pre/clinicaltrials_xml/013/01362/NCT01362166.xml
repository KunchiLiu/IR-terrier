	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to detect the frequency response in the electric wave transmission through the channels inside human body. With the electric signals in different frequencies, analyzed by the digital signal processing technique, the adaptability of the channel for different frequencies may be revealed. With this study there will be a feasible connection between the physiological signals and the channel theory in Chinese medicine, and the basis of the physiological signals can be drew out for the description of the internal organs, the strong or weak, the truth or falsity. The Zu-San-Li is the open acupoint on foot-Yangming channel, the stomach channel. Qi, the main concept in TCM, will flow from the open acupoint to go into deep internal organs. Xian-Gu is another Yu acupoint on foot-Yangming channel. The inborn original Qi flows from the Yu acupoint infuse into blood vessels. So in this study the investigators will take these two acupoints for the acupuncture. Since the direction of the channel is from Zu-San-Li to Xian-Gu, the investigators pick Zu-San-Li as the input and Xian-Gu the output for the electrical signals. For this experiment, the investigators planned enrolling 30 male sub-healthy volunteers, aged in 20-35 years old, to finish the whole experiment procedures. After the acupuncture, the electric signals of different modes will be input from the subject's open acupoint (Zu-San-Li), and measure the frequency respond voltage from the output acupoint (Xian-Gu). Each subject must complete the acupuncture of Zu-San-Li and Xian-Gu, and be input 5 sets of the electric signals of different modes two times on the trial. The variety conditions of the wave form and electric voltage will be recorded and measured respectively. The investigators plan to obtain the data in six months, and complete the data analysis and sorting in two months.</brief_summary>
