	<brief_title>Characterization of Interventricular Conduction Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to characterize how right ventricular (RV) to left ventricular (LV) conduction delays are altered by pacing site in patients with a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) system. The study will be performed in conjunction with a CRT implant.</detailed_description>
