	<brief_title>Paliperidone Palmitate Effectiveness Assessment Registry - Longitudinal (PEARL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves the establishment of PEARL, an Australian Quality Use of Medicine clinical registry designed to collect clinical and social data on up to 300 patients with schizophrenia for a 12-month period after initiating treatment with intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate as part of their routine clinical care. Continuous feedback of clinical outcomes will be via regular reports to all registry sites. Enrollment in PEARL should be considered only after the clinical decision to prescribe IM paliperidone palmitate has already been made because the treating physician has determined that this treatment is the best option for the patient. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered</detailed_description>
