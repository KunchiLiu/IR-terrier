	<brief_summary>In many surgical procedures, anaesthesiological care is provided according to the best scientific and clinical information available. However, since hemodynamic monitoring until recently did not allow for beat-to-beat information of the haemodynamical changes, many fast-changing events may have been unnoticed or have not been investigated as precisely as is possible today. Moreover, in several surgical procedures - like eye surgery - the invasiveness of the classical haemodynamical monitoring devices was of such a degree that until now, in these circumstances these vital parameters were not investigated yet. Therefore, the availability of this new device, which allows for noninvasive beat-to-beat assessment of these haemodynamical parameters gives a unique opportunity to investigate our anaesthesiological management and to elucidate whether improvements are desirable and possible. The Nexfin monitor consists of a cuff-micromanometer that is located around the third finger. It simultaneously uses continuous pressure readings and light-absorption spectrometry to determine valuable haemodynamical information. Data is recorded and available for subsequent offline analysis.</brief_summary>
