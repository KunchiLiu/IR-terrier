	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a three-armed randomized clinical trial. A total of 750 clients will be randomly assigned (using a random number table) to the interviewer-administered intervention, the self-administered intervention, and waitlist control conditions upon completion of screening, informed consent, HIV pretest counseling and test administration, and collection of baseline risk behavior data. Outcomes will be measured at 3, 6 and 12 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the 5-year study are to: 1. identify the covariates of baseline substance abuse and sexual risks (including demographics, social risk measures, peer norms, abuse history, and mental health status) among a sample of 750 heterosexually active, not-in-treatment, club and prescription drug users ages 18 to 39 in Miami, Florida. 2. evaluate, through random assignment, the relative effectiveness of two intervention conditions and a waitlist control in reducing sex risks and drug use, as measured at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups: - Arm 1, an interviewer-administered comprehensive health and social risk assessment intervention (CAPI Intervention) similar to the baseline instrument used in the parent grant; - Arm 2, an identical self-administered comprehensive assessment intervention (ACASI Intervention); and - Arm 3, a waitlist control condition (Control). Outcome measures, including past 90-day counts of unprotected sex acts and days' drug use, will be obtained from brief risk behavior inventories at baseline and follow-ups. 3. conduct qualitative process evaluation research with 40 participants in each study arm to contextualize the study findings and intervention outcomes.</detailed_description>
