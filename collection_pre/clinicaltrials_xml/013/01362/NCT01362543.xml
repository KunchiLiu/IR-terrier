	<brief_summary>The Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry is a clinic specialised in the treatment of traumatised refugees. There is a lack of studies on treatment effect in traumatised refugees. There are several studies indicating an effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). A few studies point to that CBT could be effective in traumatised refugees. There are no studies examining if some methods used in CBT are more useful than others in traumatised refugees. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of CBT with focus on Stress Management versus cognitive restructuring. Patients included in this study will be randomised to either Stress Management or cognitive restructuring. All referred patients will receive medical treatment as usual (described in the clinic's manual for medical doctors, 2011). All patients that fulfill the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. Hopefully this study will contribute to improve the psychotherapeutic treatment offered to traumatised refugees.</brief_summary>
