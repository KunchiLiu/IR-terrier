	<brief_summary>This study is ancillary. Participants will be recruited as part of a separate clinical trial on effects of two intensive behavioral training programs that evaluates feasibility and efficacy of a behavioral treatment that includes mindfulness techniques (MT) in comparison to traditional behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation. The investigators propose to compare the effect of MT to that of traditional CBT on a physiological marker of stress, salivary cortisol concentration, and physiological responses to smoking cues in tobacco smokers. The investigators will use electrophysiological reactivity to smoking cues in the form of audio recordings of personalized scripts describing the scenarios associated with the strongest urges to smoke that will provide a physiological validation to a behavioral intervention. The investigators will also explore correlations between these biological markers and self report of stress, craving and negative affect to supplement self report and behavioral outcome measures with biological and physiological markers to represent improvement attributed to the intervention.</brief_summary>
