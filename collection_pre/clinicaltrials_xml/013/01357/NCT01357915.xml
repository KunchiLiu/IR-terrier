	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of the vaccine induced immune responses at Month 48 (Year 4) and Month 60 (Year 5) in healthy subjects who received 3 doses of GSK Biologicals' candidate CMV vaccine according to a 0-1-6 month schedule during the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396) (vaccine group). The immune response to CMV infection in naturally infected subjects who participated in the screening visit of the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396) and who were tested CMV-seropositive, will be used as a reference value (seropositive reference group). In addition, this study will continue to assess the occurrence of CMV infections as well as the continued development and validation of read-outs in the CMV project. The primary vaccination phase and Year 2 follow-up were posted as a separate protocol posting (NCT00435396).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., return for followup visits) should be enrolled in the study. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects as established by clinical evaluation (medical history and physical examination) before entering in the study. Subjects of the vaccine group should in addition satisfy the following criterion: • Subjects who participated in the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396), having received 3 doses of the GSK's CMV candidate vaccine and having completed the Year 2 followup study 109211 (NCT00435396). Subjects of the seropositive reference group should in addition satisfy the following criterion: • Subjects who participated in the screening visit of the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396), and whose blood sample taken at this visit was tested CMV positive. Use, or planned use, of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to study visit(s). For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, 20mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months preceding study visit(s). Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). For subjects in the vaccine group, the following exclusion criterion should be checked in addition: • Administration of any additional CMV vaccine since end of primary study 108890 (NCT00435396). For subjects in the seropositive reference group, the following exclusion criterion should be checked in addition: • Administration of any CMV vaccine since the screening visit of primary study 108890 (NCT00435396).</criteria>
