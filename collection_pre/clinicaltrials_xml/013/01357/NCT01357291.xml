	<brief_title>Evaluating New Mexico's Recidivism Reduction Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The New Mexico Department of Corrections Recidivism Reduction Program (RRP) is designed to provide offenders with knowledge and skills that are transferable to the community setting and to address issues that offenders will invariably face upon release to the community. Transitional coping skills, offender expectations upon release, family issues, and dealing with authority figures are a few of the challenges facing offenders upon reintegration. The Recidivism Reduction Program is aimed at preparing offenders for the potential obstacles that they may encounter upon release to the community and providing them skills to overcome the challenges that they will face. The RRP curriculum focuses on belief systems, self-esteem, and rational thinking. The RRP is a twenty-one module clinician-led program (approximately 100 hours) delivered in a group setting within months of release. Outcomes focus on measures of transition readiness, successful transition into the community, and recidivism.</detailed_description>
