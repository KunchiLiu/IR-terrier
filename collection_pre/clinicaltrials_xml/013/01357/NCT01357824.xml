	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of Sellick´s Maneuver, a firm pressure on the throat, just below the Adams apple, to occlude the esophagus, in order to prevent aspiration of gastric contents, on intubation with a flexible fiberscope. The result of this study will be participate in the discussion of the importance of Sellick´s Maneuver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fibreoptic Intubation With and Without Sellick´s Maneuver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients included in this study has volunteered after sufficient information, and must be ASA-class I-II, 18 years or more, and must not have indications for a rapid sequence induction. The patient will be intubated twice, with and without Sellick´s maneuver. It is blinded to the intubating physician, in which order this pressure is applied. The outcomes measures will be time of intubation, oxygen saturation before and after intubation and a Cormack Scale graduation of the visibility of the vocal cords. The intubation will be failed, if it cannot be performed under 120 seconds, or if the patients desaturate to 95% or less.</detailed_description>
