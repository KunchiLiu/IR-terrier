	<brief_summary>This is a study of the safety and efficacy of MK-1775 in combination with paclitaxel + carboplatin in the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal tumors with the P53 mutation. In Part 1, a small group of participants will receive MK-1775 along with paclitaxel and carboplatin to find the maximum tolerable MK-1775 dose for this combination. Pharmacokinetics will also be assessed during this period. In Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either MK-1775 + paclitaxel + carboplatin or placebo + paclitaxel + carboplatin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed nonlow grade, nonborderline (low malignant potential) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer which has progressed after paclitaxel / platinumbased therapy. Platinumsensitive disease. Radiological progression must have occurred 6 months or more after the completion of the most recent platinumbased treatment. Measurable disease. Available tumor sample(s). Performance status of ≤1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale. Adequate organ function. Pregnancy or the intention to become pregnant during the course of the study. Participation in a study with an investigational compound or device within 28 days of receiving first dose of study medication. Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Primary CNS tumor. Known hypersensitivity or contraindications to the components of potential study therapy (paclitaxel, carboplatin, MK1775) or its analogs (i.e. cremophor, mannitol, etc.). Participant requires the use of medications or products that are metabolized by, or inhibit, or induce Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A4). Ongoing peripheral neuropathies ≥Grade 2 and related to previous treatment. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders. Regular use (including "recreational use") of any illicit drugs or recent history (within the last year) of drug or alcohol abuse. HIV positive. Active Hepatitis B or C. Symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. Clinical history suggestive of Li Fraumeni Syndrome.</criteria>
