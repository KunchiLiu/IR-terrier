	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is evaluated if the Botulinum Toxin Type A is superior to 0,9% saline in treatment of cranial Allodynia in patients with headache. Hypothesis H(0): Botulinum Toxin Type A is not superior to 0,9% saline in treatment of cranial Allodynia in patients with headache H (1): Botulinum Toxin Type A is superior to 0,9% saline in treatment of cranial Allodynia in patients with headache</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin Type A in Treatment of Cranial Allodynia in Patients With Headache</brief_title>

The people are randomized with block permutation, security of equal distribution in two groups (number previous determined). One group with 0,9% saline and the other Botulinum Toxin A. Finishing the application by the Researcher (Who doesn't know the result of randomization and the infiltrated containing). The patients will be submit to three evaluations: the first, 30 days after infiltration, with a doctor who didn't participate of the anterior steps and will analyze the pain intensity by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), an episode of headache and use of painkiller trough Headache Diary. The Doctor will ask to the patient localize, if exist, the allodynia points. The others evolution visit will happen 60 and 90 days after application, with this same doctor using the same methods. Another professional, who doesn't know about the anterior steps of the study, will do the statics data analyze.</detailed_description>
