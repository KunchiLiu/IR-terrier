	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of suspected prostate cancer. Men with suspected prostate cancer based on serum prostate-specific antigen antigen (PSA) value are included. Men are randomized to pre-biopsy MRI or no MRI groups in ratio 1:1. Standard transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies will be taken in addition to extra biopsies from lesions suspicious based on MRI evaluation. Hypothesis is that more prostate cancers will be found after MRI evaluation.</brief_summary>
