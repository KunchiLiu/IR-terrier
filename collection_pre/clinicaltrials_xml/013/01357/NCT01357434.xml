	<brief_summary>Rating systems are intended to guide consumer choices. This project will determine if a previously developed scale that evaluates the "healthiness" of a restaurant is correlated with the actual choices consumers make when they patronize the restaurants. The study will also assess whether a restaurant marketed as "healthy" (Subway) rates higher on this scale than another restaurant that makes no such claims (McDonald's). Finally, the investigators will compare the calorie purchases from these two restaurants among youths and their families who eat at each of the restaurants.</brief_summary>
