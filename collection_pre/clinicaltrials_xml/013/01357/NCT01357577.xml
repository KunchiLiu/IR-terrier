	<brief_summary>With this research, the investigators hope to learn if cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) works in people who have both PTSD and problems with drugs or alcohol. In the past, people who had problems with drugs and alcohol were not given treatment for their PTSD. It was believed that PTSD treatment would get in the way of their drug and alcohol treatment. Now the investigators believe that the PTSD symptoms may make it harder to avoid using drugs and alcohol, so the investigators want to see if people can get treatment for both problems at the same time. One hundred-sixty Veterans from 3 VA sites will be in this study. All Veterans will be getting outpatient substance abuse treatment. In order to know if the PTSD treatment is helpful, half of the Veterans in this study will receive PTSD treatment and half will continue to get their usual substance abuse treatment. Who gets which treatment will be decided by a random process. The investigators will then compare the 2 groups to see if there are differences in their PTSD symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for PTSD in Veterans With Co-Occurring SUDs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively simple, manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD in patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). One hundred sixty outpatients with comorbid PTSD and SUDs from three VA outpatient addiction treatment settings will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT for PTSD in conjunction with standard treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 80) or TAU only (n = 80) without additional individual treatment. All treatments will be delivered in the addiction setting by clinicians working in these programs.</detailed_description>
