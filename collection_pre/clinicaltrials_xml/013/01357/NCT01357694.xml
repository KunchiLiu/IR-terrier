	<brief_title>BRIA - Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of psychotherapeutic contacts that aim at motivating and supporting surgical patients with psychiatric disorders in participating in subsequent psychosocial treatment options like psycho- and addiction therapy (RCT). The secondary objective is to investigate whether preoperatively assessed psychosocial factors are associated with surgical outcomes (preoperative computer-assisted self assessment). The Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology (BRIA) has been designed as a feasible treatment option to reach patients from all surgical fields. Implemented in the preoperative anesthesiological assessment clinic this therapy program comprises two major elements: (1) A computer assisted self assessment of social, lifestyle and psychological factors including a comprehensive battery of psychiatric screening tests; (2) Psychotherapeutic contacts with the objective to motivate patients with psychiatric disorders and support them in participating in subsequent psychosocial treatment programs. The self assessment will be offered to all adult surgical patients of the preoperative anesthesiological assessment clinic during inclusion period (current 5104 patients). Data on surgical outcomes will be collected prospectively during a 6-month-follow-up, and regression analyses will be performed to determine the extent of associations between psychosocial factors and outcomes. Patients with clinically relevant psychological distress (i.e. scoring above the cut-off of one of applied standardized screening questionnaires) will be offered to participate in the RCT on the psychotherapy part of BRIA (220 patients). Data on primary and secondary outcomes will be collected 6 months and 24 months, respectively, after baseline assessment.</detailed_description>
