	<brief_title>Effects of TT301 on Cytokine Levels Post Endotoxin Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LPS human endotoxemia model results in a well characterized, transient acute inflammatory response. The model has been widely used for decades as a system to study new therapeutic agents for inflammation before wider clinical studies are undertaken. This study will evaluate the effects of TT301 on cytokine levels in healthy male volunteers participating in an endotoxin challenge.</detailed_description>
