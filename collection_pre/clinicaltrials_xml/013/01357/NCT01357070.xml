	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis is the disease process that leads to hardening of the arteries which causes them to become narrowed. This occurs because fat is first deposited on the inside walls of the arteries, then becomes hardened by fibrous tissue and calcium deposition forming a semi-hardened accumulation of material known as plaque. As this plaque grows, it narrows the channel within the artery and causes a reduction in blood and oxygen supply to the affected organ - such as the heart and brain. The investigators now understand that this process is caused by inflammation and activation of the immune cells over a period of time. It has been proposed that targeting these immune cells and reducing the levels of immune activation can protect against cardiovascular diseases. Previously it has been observed that consumption of fruit and vegetables rich in anti-oxidants can confer a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. The use of anti-oxidants experimentally has shown protective benefits against activation. The investigators suggest that inducing anti-oxidant enzymes indirectly may be an effective means of providing vascular protection. Sulforaphane, a naturally occurring compound found in green vegetables (including broccoli, brussel sprouts and cauliflower) is able to protect against cell inflammatory stress by inducing a number of anti-oxidant molecules. Targeted studies on the consumption of broccoli and related vegetables have been shown to be associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease. In the present study the investigators want to test whether the consumption of a "broccoli smoothie" containing sulforaphane can protect white blood cells from becoming activated in the presence of an experimental stress and how long this protective effect lasts for. To do this, the investigators will be analysing inflammatory changes in blood samples taken at different times during the study.</brief_summary>
