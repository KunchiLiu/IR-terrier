	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of AZARGA™ (Brinzolamide 1%/Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Suspension), dosed twice daily versus AZOPT® (Brinzolamide 1% Ophthalmic Suspension) and Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, each dosed twice daily, in Chinese patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were insufficiently responsive to monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fixed Combination Brinzolamide 1%/Timolol 0.5% Versus Brinzolamide 1% + Timolol 0.5% in Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of 2 sequential phases. Phase I was the Screening/Eligibility Phase, with a Screening Visit followed by an Eligibility Visit. Phase II was the treatment phase and included Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 visits. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Brinzolamide 1%/Timolol 0.5% or Brinzolamide 1% plus Timolol 0.5% two times a day for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with open angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension and not sufficiently responsive to monotherapy. Meet qualifying IOP criteria in at least 1 eye, including 2135 mmHg at the Eligibility visit. Willing to sign an Informed Consent form. Contact lens wearer who is willing to remove lenses before instillation of study medication and wait a minimum of 15 minutes following drug instillation before reinserting the lenses. Able to discontinue use of current IOPlowering medications per the minimum washout period. Other protocolspecific inclusion criteria may apply. Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, test positive for pregnancy at Screening/Enrollment visit, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study. Diagnosed with any form of glaucoma other than openangle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension. Diagnosed with severe central visual field loss in either eye. History of chronic, recurrent, or severe ocular infection, inflammatory eye disease in either eye. History of ocular trauma within the past 6 months in either eye. Current ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 3 months in either eye. Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months. Intraocular surgery within the past 3 months. Bestcorrected visual acuity score worse than 55 ETDRS letters read (equivalent to approximately 20/80 Snellen, 0.60 logMAR or 0.25 decimal). History of, or current clinically relevant or progressive retinal disease in either eye. History of, or current other severe ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) in either eye, that would preclude the administration of a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) or betablocker. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. History of, or current condition or disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical beta blocker or topical betaadrenergic blocking agent. History of spontaneous or current hypoglycemia or uncontrolled diabetes. History of severe or serious hypersensitivity to CAIs, betablockers, or to any components of the study medication. Less than 30 days stable dosing regimen before the Screening Visit of any medications or substances administered by any route and used on a chronic basis that may have affected IOP. Recent use of highdose salicylate therapy. Anticipated use of any additional topical or systemic ocular hypotensive medication during the study. Not safely able to discontinue all glucocorticoid medications administered by any route. Currently on therapy or have been on therapy with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit. History of, or current evidence of severe illness or any other conditions which would, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the subject unsuitable for the study. Other protocolspecific exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
