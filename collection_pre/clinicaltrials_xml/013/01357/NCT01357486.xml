	<brief_summary>The incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is currently increasing in Europe and in France and about 2 / 3 of patients, are not eligible for curative treatment at the time of diagnosis. The palliative management of patients with advanced and symptomatic disease is complex and requires treatment combining anti-tumor activity and safety in patients with impaired liver functions. Sorafenib is the standard of care in a palliative setting, but the benefit of sorafenib in patient with altered liver function is uncertain. The aim of this trial is to study the interest of sorafenib in patients with HCC and impaired liver function compared to pravastatin (a drug with anti-tumoral activity in HCC) or to the combination sorafenib/pravastatin or to best supportive care (usually used in these patients).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patient With CHILD B Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is currently increasing in Europe and in France. It almost always occurs on liver disease and in 80 to 90% of cases, at least in France, on liver with cirrhosis. If curative treatment may be proposed for some "small" HCC (transplantation, resection, percutaneous destruction), about 2 / 3 of patients, which represents nearly 4,000 new cases per year in France, are not eligible for such treatment. The palliative management of patients with advanced and symptomatic disease is complex and requires treatment combining anti-tumor activity and safety in patients with impaired liver functions. Indeed, in most cases the palliative treatment of HCC is applied to patients with altered liver function (stage B of the Child-Pugh classification). To date, the proposed treatment in France for such patients is based on best supportive care. The objective of this study is to assess the interest in this situation of 2 molecules - taken alone or in combination: - Sorafenib, the reference in the palliative treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Stage C of the BCLC classification). Yet the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with altered liver function (CHILD B) are not clearly defined and its use remains discouraged by French recommendations in these patients. - Pravastatin whose interest in the palliative treatment of HCC was suggested by several phase II studies with a good safety profile in cirrhotic patients. In this French multicenter open randomized study, 160 patients will be included in 4 arms (40/arms): sorafenib, pravastatin, pravastatin + sorafenib, and supportive care. The aim of this phase II multicenter study is to select the two best arms for further Phase III study in order to identify a reference treatment in this palliative situation.</detailed_description>
