	<brief_title>Lower Leg Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been demonstrated that protection from ischemia reperfusion can be achieved by brief periods of ischemia applied at a remote site during an injurious ischemic event (remote postconditioning). The purpose of this study is to investigate if the combination of brief periods of limb ischemia in combination with electric muscle stimulation at the same site could exceed the preconditioning effect of limb ischemia alone. Therefore the investigators thought to perform 2 different forms of remote ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty. In the first patient group a blood pressure cuff will be applied at the lower leg. Ischemia will be induced by inflating the cuff to a pressure of 200 mmHg for 5 minutes. Afterwards reperfusion will be allowed for further 5 minutes. This cycle will be repeated 3 times. In a second patient group electric muscle stimulation at the same site (HiToP 191) will be performed additionally throughout the whole preconditioning cycle. After preconditioning, the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be performed by 3 PCI-ballon inflations, each lasting for 2 minutes. Between the inflations coronary reperfusion will be allowed for 5 minutes. The Effects of preconditioning will be evaluated by analysing the ST-deviation, caused by angioplasty in an intracoronary (derived by PCI wire) and surface ecg. Also the maximum of chest pain during the 3 inflation cycles and troponin levels 24 h after PCI will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
