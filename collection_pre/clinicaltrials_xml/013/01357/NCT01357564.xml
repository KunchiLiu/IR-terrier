	<brief_summary>This proposed study addresses this call by testing the efficacy of a transformative patient-centric intervention designed to reduce the burden of NPS in Veterans with dementia who live at home with family caregivers. The innovative intervention, the Tailored Activity Program (TAP-VA), involves 8 sessions over 4 months in Veterans' homes. An occupational therapist conducts a systematic assessment to identify a Veteran's preserved capabilities and deficit areas, and previous roles, habits and interests from which to develop and introduce activities tailored to the Veteran's profile. Family caregivers are then trained to incorporate tailored activities into daily care routines. The intervention was pilot tested in an NIMH funded study with 60 community-living individuals with dementia. Findings from this pilot showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in NPS, specifically agitation and less time being on "duty" by family caregivers. Results of this pilot phase support moving forward with a full-scale Phase III efficacy trial. The investigators plan to test TAP-VA in a randomized two-group parallel design in which 160 racially and ethnically diverse Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (dyads) will be randomly assigned to receive TAP-VA or an attention control group. All dyads will be evaluated at baseline and 4-months (main trial endpoint), and then reassessed at 8-months to evaluate long-term treatment effects (baseline to 8 months), including continued activity use, caregiver well-being, and costs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Veterans with dementia include: English speaking diagnosed with dementia as above able to participate in at least two activities of daily living ADLs bathing dressing grooming toileting transferring from bed to chair not currently participating in any other dementiarelated intervention. If the Veteran with dementia is on any of four classes of psychotropic medications: antidepressant benzodiazepines antipsychotic anticonvulsant an antidementia medication (memantine or a cholinesterase inhibitor) We will require that he/she have been on a stable dose for 60 days prior to enrollment to minimize possible confounding effects of concomitant medications (the typical time frame used in clinical trials). Caregivers of Veterans must be: English speaking selfidentify as the primary member of the family caring (handson or supervision) for the Veteran and 21 years of age or older (male or female) living with the Veteran accessible by telephone to schedule interview, intervention sessions and followup interviews planning to live in area for 8 months (to reduce loss to followup) indicate willingness to learn activity use report one or more NPS in the Veteran in the past month not currently participating in any other caregiverrelated intervention. Finally, we will require that caregivers taking a psychotropic medication (antidepressant, benzodiazepines, antipsychotic, or anticonvulsant) at time of telephone screen be on a stable dose of the medication for 60 days prior to enrollment. Non English speaking NonVeteran No caregiver No diagnosis of dementia</criteria>
