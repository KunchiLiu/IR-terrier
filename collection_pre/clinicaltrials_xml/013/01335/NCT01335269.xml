	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of BI 853520 monotherapy by defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommending the dose for further trials in the development of this compound. Secondary objectives are - determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile; - exploratory pharmacodynamic analysis; and - collection of preliminary data on anti-tumour efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria 1. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of advanced, measurable or evaluable, nonresectable and/or metastatic nonhematologic malignancy, which has shown to be progressive in the last 6 months as demonstrated by serial imaging 2. Patients who have failed conventional treatment or for whom no therapy of proven efficacy exists or who are not amenable to established treatment options 3. Tumour tissue must be available for the determination of Ecadherin expression (archived tissue or fresh biopsy). 4. Recovery from reversible toxicities (alopecia excluded) of prior anticancer therapies (CTCAE grade &lt; 2) 5. Age = 18 years 6. Life expectancy = 3 months 7. Written informed consent in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice (ICH/GCP) and local legislation, including consent for PK samples, for using an archived tumour sample for determination of Ecadherin status, for reviewing previous tumour scans (and for providing skin biopsies, in patients in dose finding phase enrolled before protocol amendment 03) 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), R010787) performance score 01 Additional inclusion criteria in the expansion phase: 9.

Patients must be willing to provide paired tumour biopsies for PD determination. Refer to section 5.6.3 12. Patients should fit into one of the categories described below: I. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Patients should have preferably received at least one line of systemic treatment for metastatic disease and preferably not more than 2 prior regimens for metastatic disease. II. Platinumresistant ovarian carcinoma, defined as recurrence within 6 months after completion of prior platinumbased chemotherapy Patients should have received preferably no more than 5 previous lines of systemic treatment for metastatic disease. III. Oesophageal carcinoma Patients with oesophageal carcinoma of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell histology who have received preferably not more than 2 previous lines of systemic treatment for metastatic disease. IV. Soft tissue sarcoma Patients should preferably have received no more than 2 previous lines of systemic treatment for metastatic disease.
