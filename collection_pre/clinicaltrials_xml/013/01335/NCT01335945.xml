	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Cryoablation for Abdominal Pain Associated With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CUC10-PAN09 is a Supportive Care, Phase 1 multicenter, prospective, single arm study with subjects serving as their own control. This study is to enroll patients who will undergo cryoablation of the Celiac Plexus. Subjects will be followed for 3 months post their cryoablation procedure. Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of extremely cold temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool in the fields of general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery (including lung), Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology (colon/rectal) and urology (kidney).</detailed_description>
