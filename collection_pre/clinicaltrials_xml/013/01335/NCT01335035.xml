	<brief_summary>This study has been designed to establish the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in patients with iron overload from 6 to 18 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The purpose of this study is to assess the mean change in serum ferritin after 52 weeks of treatment with deferasirox, in patients with iron overload (defined with serum ferritin levels ≥ 1000 ng/ml and receiving &gt; 20 RBC concentrates) after allogeneic HSCT.</brief_summary>
