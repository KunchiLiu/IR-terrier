	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if tablets containing extended release (ER) niacin, laropiprant, and simvastatin (ERN/LRPT/SIM) are as effective as tablets containing ER niacin and laropiprant taken with simvastatin tablets (ERN/LRPT + SIM) for lowering high cholesterol and high lipid levels in the blood. The primary hypothesis is that ERN/LRPT/SIM 2 g /20 mg is equivalent to ERN/LRPT 2 g coadministered with simvastatin 20 mg in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholestrol (LDL-C).</brief_summary>

Consumes more than 3 alcoholic drinks per day (14 per week). Is a high risk CHD patient on lipid modifying therapy (LMT). Is on any LMT with equivalent or greater LDLClowering efficacy than simvastatin 40 mg. Has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus that is poorly controlled, or on statin therapy. Currently engages in vigorous exercise or is on an aggressive diet regimen. Has uncontrolled endocrine or metabolic disease, uncontrolled gout, kidney or hepatic disease, heart failure, recent peptic ulcer disease, hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to niacin or simvastatin, recent heart attack, stroke or heart surgery.

Note: Fish oils, phytosterol margarines and other nonprescribed therapies are allowed provided participant has been on a stable dose for 6 weeks prior to Visit 2 and agrees to remain on this dose for the duration of the study. Is currently receiving cyclical hormonal contraceptives or intermittent use of hormone replacement therapies (HRTs) (e.g., estradiol, medroxyprogesterone, progesterone). Note: Participants who have been on a stable dose of noncyclical HRT or hormonal contraceptive for greater than 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 are eligible if they agree to remain on the same regimen for the duration of the study.
