It has been a common practice in China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea and is becoming increasingly popular worldwide in recent decades However, there is no general consensus for treatment of many diseases among TCM practitioners. In some specialties, such as neurology, there is not enough well documented case reports for practitioners to make reference with. Different practitioners may give different opinions according to their own experience and patients often feel frustrated about that. Therefore, it is worth recording cases of neurological diseases, with accurate western medicine diagnosis and TCM theory explained. Possible TCM treatments can be suggested accordingly. Being an academic research supervised by western medicine doctor, this study can help to suggest more objective opinion with least conflict of interest.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of more than two millenniums. It has been a common practice in China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In recent decades, it is becoming increasingly popular worldwide(Victor S. Sierpina 2005). Studies in Hong Kong, showed that TCM is quite common among children in Hong Kong, with about a quarter of children consulting a pediatrician are concurrently using Chinese Medicine.(Lee 2006; Li 2006). However, there is a lack of standardized protocol for treatment of many diseases among TCM practitioners. In some specialties, such as neurology, there is not enough well documented case reports for TCM practitioners to make reference. Different TCM practitioners may give different opinions according to their own experience and patients often feel frustrated about that. Therefore, it is worth recording cases of neurological diseases, with accurate western medicine diagnosis and TCM theory explained. Possible TCM treatments can be suggested accordingly. Being an academic research supervised by western medicine doctor, this study can help to suggest more objective opinion with least conflict of interest.</detailed_description>
