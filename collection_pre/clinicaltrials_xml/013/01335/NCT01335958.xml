	<criteria>Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for women of childbearing potential Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with Ovarian Cancer: Advanced, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has progressed or relapsed during or within 6 months of the most recent treatment with a platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen, and for which no standard therapy exists For patients in the doseexpansion cohort of the study only, no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of platinumresistant ovarian cancer Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with Pancreatic Cancer: Incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease for which no standard therapy exists, consisting of unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including recurrence of previouslyresected disease that is considered unresectable with curative intent No more than one chemotherapy regimen (approved or experimental) administered in the metastatic setting Antitumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic, experimental, or hormonal therapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 Palliative radiation to bone metastases within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including HIV and atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of the nail beds) Current Grade &gt;1 toxicity (except alopecia and anorexia) from prior therapy or Grade &gt;1 neuropathy from any cause History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy (or recombinant antibodyrelated fusion proteins) Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Patients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that they meet all of the following criteria: evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS, radiographic demonstration of improvement upon the completion of CNSdirected therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNSdirected therapy and the screening radiographic study, and the screening CNS radiographic study is &gt;= 8 weeks since completion of radiotherapy and &gt;= 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids and anticonvulsants. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (including stroke, New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, unstable arrhythmias, and unstable angina); nervous system, pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease and history of symptomatic bronchospasm), renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders; or a serious nonhealing wound or fracture Pregnancy or breastfeeding</criteria>
