	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease causes significant morbidity and mortality in the African American community. Among African Americans adults almost 1/3 have hypertension, 1/10 have heart disease, 1/20 have coronary heart disease, and 1/30 have had a stroke. Compared to their Caucasian American counterparts, African Americans are 3 times more times as likely to die from cardiovascular diseases than Caucasians, 1.5 times more likely to die from heart failure, and 1.8 times more likely to die from stroke. In addition, both lower socioeconomic position and minority race/ethnicity are associated with poorer health and shortened survival. These alarming statistics highlight the health disparities in the African American community. In our study, the investigators propose that interactive physician-led education through partnership with an African American church will improve awareness and knowledge of CVD in the African American community and will result in objective improvement in major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.</detailed_description>
