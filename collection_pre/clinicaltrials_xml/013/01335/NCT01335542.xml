	<brief_summary>There are 2 common ways to manage pain after total knee arthroplasty at our institution. Some patients receive an epidural analgesia, a femoral nerve block and pills for pain. More recently, some surgeons have replaced femoral nerve blockade with peri-articular injections. These patients receive a peri-articular injection (injection of pain medication around the knee), pills for pain and a pain patch on the skin. The purpose of this research project is to find out if one of these ways to treat pain is better than the other. The investigators will look at this question in many ways, but the main way is how long it takes for you to be judged ready for discharge from the hospital.</brief_summary>
