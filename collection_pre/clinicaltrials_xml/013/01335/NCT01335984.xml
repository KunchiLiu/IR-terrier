Objectives : To evaluate superiority in blood pressure lowering effect of the Smart Care Service compared to the conventional treatment in hypertensive patients receiving any conventional antihypertensive medication 2. Test and control group - Control group : The subject group who is receiving any conventional treatment (hospital visit). - Test groups Conventional treatment + remote monitoring group: The subject group who is receiving the health care services using conventional treatment (hospital visit) and remote monitoring.
