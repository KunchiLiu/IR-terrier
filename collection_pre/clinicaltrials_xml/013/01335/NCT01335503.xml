	<brief_summary>The aim is to demonstrate how fast and to what extent AN-PEP can degrade gluten in vivo in the stomach and how much gluten enters the small intestine. A second question is whether the caloric density of a meal can influence the efficacy of AN-PEP breakdown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of AN-PEP Enzyme on Gluten Digestion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this trial, the effect of AN-PEP enzyme on gastrointestinal breakdown of gluten will be investigated in healthy subjects. In addition, it will be assessed if meal calories can affect the efficacy of AN-PEP. Subjects receive intragastrically, either AN-PEP or placebo, with either a high or a low caloric meal in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over fashion. Gastrointestinal fluid will be sampled to measure breakdown of gluten.</detailed_description>
