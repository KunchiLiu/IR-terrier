	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to explore what role immune cells within the gut (the sigmoid colon) have locally and on the immune system of patients infected with HCV, HIV or HCV/ HIV co-infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Gut Associated Lymphocytes in HIV and HCV/HIV Co-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective 1: Characterization of the Gut Associated Lymphocytes (GALT) in HIV, HCV and coinfected patients regarding the role of Th17 and cytokine profiles. Hypothesis 1a: HIV and HCV/HIV coinfection is associated with changes in Th17 numbers and functions in GALT. Hypothesis 1b: HIV and HCV/HIV coinfection is associated with changes in cytokine profiles in intestinal mucosa. Objective 2: Identify the relationship between changes in Gut Associated Lymphocytes (GALT) in HIV, HCV and coinfected patients and markers of microbial translocation. Hypothesis 2a: Changes in GALT are associated with increase in microbial translocation in HIV, HCV and coinfected patients.</detailed_description>
