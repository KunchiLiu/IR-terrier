	<brief_summary>Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced liver cancer but often shows dose-limiting toxicities with the need to reduce the applied dose of the compound. As this limits the overall response rate of the therapy, a combination with temsirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling, will be investigated regarding safety and tolerability in patients with advanced liver cancer under a reduced dose of sorafenib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus + Sorafenib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling pathway have recently been established as novel potent anti-cancer agents for solid and hematologic malignancies. Several pre-clinical reports have shown a good anti-tumor activity in different HCC models and first reports from clinical trials in HCC promise a good efficacy in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell growth. mTOR inhibition has also been shown to enhance the activity of other cytotoxic agents. Sorafenib also interferes with tumor cell survival, proliferation and angiogenesis by inhibiting molecular pathways independent of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. We therefore expect an at least additive effect by inhibiting two parallel but independent intracellular pathways in HCC tumor cells that will prolong overall survival and time to progression.</detailed_description>
