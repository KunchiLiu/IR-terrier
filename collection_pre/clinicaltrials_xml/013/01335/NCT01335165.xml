	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to understand the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of TT30 (ALXN1102 and ALXN1103 formulations) when given IV (through a vein) or SC (under the skin) to patients with PNH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of TT30 in Subjects With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of TT30 given as an IV infusion and as a SC injection in subjects with PNH or evidence of circulating PNH cells. Eligible subjects with PNH will be vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine at least two weeks prior to dosing (if not previously vaccinated or if revaccination is required). On study day 1, the subject will receive the single dose of TT30 as an IV infusion over 60 minutes or as a SC injection, and be followed with additional study evaluations over the next 59 days.</detailed_description>
