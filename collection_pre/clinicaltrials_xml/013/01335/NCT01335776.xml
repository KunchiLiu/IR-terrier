	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance in cancer patients is often overlooked despite its documented high prevalence and negative impact. There are few empirically validated non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia and many patients are unwilling to rely on sleeping medications. This study will determine whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (a program that teaches meditation and yoga) produces equivalent results with the additional benefits of reduced stress and mood disturbance, to an already established treatment for insomnia, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. This will allow for the expansion of treatment options for insomnia beyond what is currently available and improve quality of life for millions of cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
