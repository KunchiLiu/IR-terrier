	<brief_title>Total Knee Arthroplasty Comparing Cementless to Cemented Fixation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out comes measures were to determine: 1. whether the knee and function scores and the radiographic results of the knees with a Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis would be better than those with an Nexgen cementless prosthesis. 2. whether the patients with a Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis would have a better range of knee motion than those with an Nexgen cementless prosthesis. 3. whether patient satisfaction and preference would be better in the patients having a Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis than those of patients having an Nexgen cementless knee prosthesis 4. whether complication rate would be less in the knees with a Nexgen cemented knee prosthesis than in the knees with an Nexgen cementless prosthesis.</detailed_description>
