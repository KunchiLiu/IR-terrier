	<brief_summary>This study tests two different incentive mechanisms to induce members of a particular urban senior center to attend more exercise classes. Coupons for future use are given to participants who attend an exercise class and will be redeemable within either a one week or three month time period, depending on which experimental group the participant is assigned to. Frequency of exercise class attendance at the end of 2 months will be the primary outcome.</brief_summary>
