	<brief_title>Effects of Acute Ingestion of Dark Chocolate on Endothelial Function in Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent findings indicate an inverse relationship between cardiovascular disease and consumption of flavonoids. We aimed to identify clinical and vascular parameters of treated hypertensive patients who present beneficial effects of dark chocolate for one-week period on vascular function. Twenty-one hypertensive patients in drug therapy, both genders, aged 40-65 years, were included in a prospective study with measurement of blood pressure, brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT) and central hemodynamic parameters by SphygmoCor. After seven days of eating dark chocolate (70% cocoa) 75g/day, the clinical and vascular evaluation were repeated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the response in FMD: responders (increase in FMD, n=12) and non-responders (no improvement in FMD, n=9).</detailed_description>
