	<brief_summary>In recent years, the increasing number of breast cancer patients shows the fact breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women in China. However, the mortality rate has seen a dramatic decline mainly due to early detection of breast cancer and the use of effective multimodel treatment. Recent studies suggest breast cancers are heterogeneous and recognized by biological subtypes, which lead to markedly different clinical outcome. Adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in the treatment for primary breast cancer patients. Different types of breast cancer cells are sensitive to different types of drugs.There is no data to support the information about the adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for different subtypes breast cancer patients， especially for Chinese women. The investigators hypothesized to confirm the possibility of finding the adjuvant chemotherapy aimed to different subtypes of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Chinese Primary Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligibility Female adults(&gt; 18 years old) are eligible if they had histologically confirmed primary breast cancer. Patients also had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1, absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt; 1500/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 8.0g/dL, and platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal(ULN)）, transaminases &lt; 2.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase &lt; 4 times ULN if transaminases was normal, and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 times ULN. Exclusion criteria were active infection, pregnancy, other primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of cervix or adequately treated nonmelanomatous carcinoma of the skin), any documented distant metastasis and uncontrolled systemic diseases. This study protocol was approved by institutional ethic review boards and conducted according to guidelines for good clinical practice and the Helsinki Declaration. All patients provided written informed consent. Outcome Measures Primary Endpoint：5 year Disease Free Survival（DFS） Second Endpoints：5 year distant disease free survival （DDFS） 5year event free survival （EFS） 5year overall survival （OS）</detailed_description>
