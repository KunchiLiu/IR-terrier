	<brief_summary>Purpose: To demonstrate the efficacy of Beneflaxâ„¢ flaxseed lignan (SDG) concentrate to lower serum cholesterol levels. Background: Flaxseed has been studied for various health benefits in humans, including prostate health, glucose control, and cardiovascular health. Cholesterol levels and high blood pressure are known to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Whole flaxseed has had variable effects on serum lipid levels, perhaps a consequence of variations in the amounts of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) found in different flax cultivars, making the study of this bioactive compound difficult. Hypothesis: Flaxseed lignan (SDG) extract (Beneflax) significantly lowers total and LDL cholesterol. Flaxseed lignans also lower blood pressure and fasting glucose levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men, 4065 yrs/old, postmenopausal women 5065 yrs/old not &gt; 5 yrs post menopause. All subjects were hypercholesterolemic with either total cholesterol &gt;240 mg/dl and &lt; 320 mg/dL or LDL cholesterol &gt;140 mg/dl and &lt;190 mg/dl at the screening visit. Excluded subjects included diabetics, people being actively treated with niacins, fibrates, statins, insulin, ACE inhibitors or other cholesterol/ blood pressure pharmaceutical treatments, people who consumed large amounts of soy, flax, rye breads, pumpkin seeds, hydrolyzed milk products, sterols, and/or berries (strawberries/blueberries) or supplements aimed at cholesterol reduction such as spruce lignans, sytrinol (poly methoxylated flavanols), polycosinols, people consuming flaxseed on a regular basis.</criteria>
