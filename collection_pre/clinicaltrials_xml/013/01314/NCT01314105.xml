	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Female patients, age 18 years or older, with a first, second or third relapse of histologically (on initial diagnosis) confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal cancer 2. Up to three lines of prior chemo (chemotherapy before and after interval surgery to be counted as one line therapy), with treatment free interval of &gt; 6 months (= time between last administration of prior anticancer treatment, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy, and diagnosis of progressive disease) 3. Platinum based chemo in immediately preceding line 4. Eligibility for treatment with i.v. chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin AUC 5 and PLD 30 mg/m2 every 4 weeks 5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months 6. Written informed consent that is consistent with International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH)Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0 or1 8. Prior treatment with angiogenesis inhibitor (bevacizumab, TKI inhibiting VEGFR2) is allowed provided treatment with bevacizumab has been discontinued = 28 days prior to start of therapy and treatment with the TKI has been discontinued = 3 months prior to start of therapy, provided antiangiogenic therapy was added to only one of the preceding lines of therapy Exclusion criteria: 1. Prior chemotherapy with doxorubicin (any formulation, liposomal or nonliposomal doxorubicin). 2. Any contraindications for therapy with PLD or carboplatin, e.g. a history of hypersensitivity reactions to platinumcontaining compounds and their excipients. 3. Hypersensitivity to active substance or to any of the excipients of BIBF 1120. 4. Treatment with other investigational drugs or participation in another clinical trial testing a drug within the past four weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with this trial (exception: for previous treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, cf. inclusion criterion #8). 5. Laboratory values indicating an increased risk for adverse events. 6. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment. 7. Patients for whom surgery is planned, e.g. interval debulking surgery. 8. Clinically relevant nonhealing wound, ulcer (intestinal tract, skin) or bone fracture. 9. Clinical symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal obstruction that require parenteral nutrition or hydration. 10. Gastrointestinal disorders or abnormalities that would interfere with absorption of the study drug. 11. History of clinical symptoms of brain metastases. 12. Prior thrombosis or thromboembolic event in the presence of an inherited coagulopathy. 13. History of a cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack or subarachnoid haemorrhage within the past 6 months. 14. Known inherited or acquired bleeding disorder. 15. Significant cardiovascular diseases. 16. Serious infections in particular if requiring systemic antibiotic (antimicrobial, antifungal) or antiviral therapy. 17. Other malignancy diagnosed within the past 5 years. 18. Known serious illness or concomitant nononcological disease. 19. Patients unable to comply with the protocol. 20. Patients with preserved reproductive capacity who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception. 21. Pregnancy or breast feeding.</criteria>
