	<brief_title>The PARTNER II Trial: Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective multi-center trial of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis. Patient cohorts will include the following groups based on operative risk for surgical aortic valve replacement: inoperable, high surgical risk (STS ≥ 8%), and intermediate risk (STS = 4-8%). The Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve (THV) system will be studied in patients deemed inoperable or intermediate risk. A subset of inoperable patients will be randomized to receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with either the SAPIEN XT THV or the SAPIEN THV. The SAPIEN XT will be studied in intermediate risk patients randomized to receive TAVR with the SAPIEN XT or surgical AVR. The Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV will be studied in a non-randomized fashion in patients from all three risk groups. Data will be collected from all patients for up to five years following the valve replacement procedure.</detailed_description>

Patient has senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis with echocardiographically derived criteria: mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of ≤0.8 cm2 or indexed EOA &lt; 0.5 cm2/m2 Qualifying echo must be within 60 days of the date of the procedure. 2. Patient is symptomatic from his/her aortic valve stenosis, as demonstrated by NYHA Functional Class II or greater. 3. The heart team agrees (and verified in the case review process) that valve implantation will likely benefit the patient. 4.

The study patient agrees to comply with all required postprocedure followup visits including annual visits through 5 years and analysis close date visits, which will be conducted as a phone followup. Once eligibility in accordance to the above criteria is established, patients are assessed for operability (inoperable, high risk, intermediate risk).
