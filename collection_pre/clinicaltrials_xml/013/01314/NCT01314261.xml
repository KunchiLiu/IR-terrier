	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 4-week rapid virologic response (RVR) of 3 different doses of ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir) in combination with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) compared with pegIFN/RBV alone (ABT-267 placebo) in treatment naïve, hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1-infected participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ABT-267 in Treatment Naive Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 1 Infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study consisting of 2 substudies. In substudy 1, participants received 1 of 3 doses of ABT-267 or placebo + pegIFN/RBV for 12 weeks. In substudy 2, participants received pegIFN/RBV for 36 weeks. Participants were followed for 48 weeks post ABT-267 treatment for evaluation of efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>
