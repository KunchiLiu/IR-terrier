	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the orthostatic hypotension reported among subjects during bortezomib-containing regimen is caused by a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Hypotension and Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction in Multiple Myeloma (MM) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To gather pilot data on the incidence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Multiple Myeloma prior to treatment with Bortezomib. 2. To characterize the changes in the ANS including the fluctuations in blood pressure (hypotension /hypertension) associated with bortezomib. 3. To determine the duration of the ANS dysfunction if present. This is not a treatment study, only an evaluation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) among subjects receiving antimyeloma therapy which includes bortezomib (Velcade).</detailed_description>
