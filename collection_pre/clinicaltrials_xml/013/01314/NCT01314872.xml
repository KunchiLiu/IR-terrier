	<brief_summary>This is a 2-part study to assess if vibegron (MK-4618) reduces the number of daily urinations more effectively than placebo in participants with overactive bladder (OAB). The primary hypothesis of the base study is that administration of vibegron demonstrates a dose-related reduction, compared with placebo, in average number of daily micturitions in participants with OAB after 8 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
