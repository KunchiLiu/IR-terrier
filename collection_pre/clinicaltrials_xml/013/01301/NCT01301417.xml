	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a post marketing, observational, retrospective data collection intended to gather and record data on patients treated with the ColonRing™ device in routine clinical practice at a single center. The data will assist in further evaluating the performance of the ColonRing™ device in regards to the creation of a colorectal anastomosis. Hypothesis:The performance of the ColonRing™, determined by the rate of complications, will be within the acceptable range reported in the literature for alternative treatment modalities.</brief_summary>
