	<brief_summary>This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Herceptin (trastuzumab) in combination with a taxane as first line therapy in participants with HER2-positive breast cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant or adjuvant Herceptin treatment. Participants will receive Herceptin (loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously [iv], 2 mg/kg iv weekly thereafter) with 6 3-week cycles of either docetaxel (100 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks) or paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 every week). Herceptin treatment will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
