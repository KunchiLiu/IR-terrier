	<brief_summary>Phase II Multicentric Trial Open Label, Multicenter, randomized to evaluate the efficacy of a Maintenance Therapy in First Complete Remission After Induction for Elderly (≥ 60) Fit Patients With Poor Prognosis Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients included in this study will be compared to the ones of the two previously reported groups of patients treated with the same LIA induction therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Maintenance Phase After Complete Remission (CR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The primary objective of this study will be to improve the DFS with an alternate schema combining azacitidine and lenalidomide in elderly fit patients with previously untreated AML and with high risk cytogenetics or secondary AML, who achieved either a complete remission after an LIA induction therapy - The secondary objectives will be to determine the relapse incidence, overall survival, event free survival at 1 and 2 years of follow-up, toxicities of the treatment, incidence of infectious events. - To define a gene expression and promoter methylation signatures associated with CR and absence of relapse when patients received azacitidine and lenalidomide. Gene promoter methylation and gene expression profiling will be performed at diagnosis, at CR, and after 2 courses of azacitidine and lenalidomide in order to give insight within the mechanisms involved by the use of these 2 drugs and to identify new epigenetic prognostic markers.</detailed_description>
