	<brief_title>Study Of Oral PHA-848125AC In Patients With Malignant Thymoma Previously Treated With Multiple Lines Of Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical trial design with an early stopping rules. PHA-848125AC will be administered to patients with recurrent metastatic unresectable B3 thymoma or thymic carcinoma who have received more than one line of prior systemic therapy for advanced / metastatic disease. The intent of the study is to assess the antitumor activity of PHA-848125AC and ultimately to improve the outcome of the patients. The primary end point for this study is a progression free survival rate of 3 months.</detailed_description>
