	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Safety Study of RetinoStat in Advanced Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two parts to the study. A dose-escalation phase looking at three doses of RetinoStat starting with the lowest dose, three patients will be recruited at each dose level. The escalation phase will be followed by a dose confirmation phase where the highest dose that is safe and well tolerated will be examined in 9 patients.</detailed_description>

Treatment with steroids within three months of screening. Treatment with antiVEGF therapy to either eye within one month of screening.
