	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies filgrastim (G-CSF) with or without plerixafor in treating patients with multiple myeloma (MM) previously treated with lenalidomide. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and plerixafor helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Filgrastim With or Without Plerixafor in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With Lenalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Ability to reach target collection of 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/Kg with =&lt; 2 days of leukaphereses using one of two mobilization regimens. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Percentage of patients achieving target goal CD34+ cell dose (as above) in =&lt; 5 days of leukaphereses. II. Compare collections between different mobilization regimens in those patients who are crossed over from one mobilization regimen to the other. III. Compare days of apheresis, need for hospitalization during mobilization, and need for remobilization between mobilizing groups. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-8. ARM II: Patients receive G-CSF SC QD on days 1-7 and plerixafor SC QD on days 4-7. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days.</detailed_description>
