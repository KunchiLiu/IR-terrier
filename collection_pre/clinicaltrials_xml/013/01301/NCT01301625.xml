	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is to gather real-world clinical and health-economic outcome data to support the long-term safety, efficacy and economic value of the MitraClip System in the continuum of therapies for treating MR. Specifically, the following clinical and economic data will be collected: New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class, Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance, quality of life (QOL) information, echocardiographic measures of left ventricular size and function, and data associated with the index hospitalization, rehospitalizations, concomitant medications and discharge facility to support the MitraClip System economic analysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is a prospective, observational, single arm, multicenter trial to evaluate the MitraClip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR). Patients will be enrolled at up to 15 investigational sites throughout Australia and New Zealand. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be considered enrolled when local or general anesthesia is administered for the MitraClip procedure. Patients will be followed at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Investigational sites will recruit consecutive patients who meet trial enrollment criteria. Until enrollment in the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial is closed, all patients who undergo a procedure for placement of a MitraClip device at an investigational site should be enrolled in the MitraClip System ANZ Clinical Trial.</detailed_description>
