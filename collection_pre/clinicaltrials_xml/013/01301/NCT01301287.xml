	<brief_summary>Chlorella, a type of unicellular fresh water algae, has been a popular foodstuff in Asia, especially in Taiwan. Recent studies have shown the hypoglycemic effects of Chlorella through increasing glucose uptake in the liver and muscle, lowering serum free fatty acid levels, or activation of PPAR gamma receptor. However, the hypoglycemic effect in diabetic patients have not been studied. In order to clarify the hypoglycemic effects and mechanism of Chlorella in diabetic patients, the investigators conducted a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-control trial on diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
