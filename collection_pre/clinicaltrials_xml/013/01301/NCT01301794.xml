	<brief_summary>High levels of triglycerides is a common abnormality found in patients with diabetes and also cardiovascular disease, and may contribute to the risk for both. Omega 3 fatty acids, as found enriched in fish and also in the commercial agent called Lovaza lower triglyceride levels. Prior work from the investigators group demonstrated that an enzyme responsible for the break down of triglycerides - lipoprotein lipase - generates molecules that can activate a specific nuclear receptor known as PPAR-alpha. This study investigates the hypothesis that taking Lovaza shifts the specific fatty acid content of triglyceride containing lipoproteins and increases the ability of those lipoproteins to activate PPAR-alpha.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will investigate changes in lipid and other metabolic parameters as well as the ability of isolated lipoproteins to activate PPARs in the presence or absence of lipoprotein lipase in a cohort of normal healthy individuals with modest hypertriglyceridemia before and after a course of Lovaza.</detailed_description>
