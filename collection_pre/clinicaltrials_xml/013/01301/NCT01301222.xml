	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims at assessing the influence of octreotide on pancreatic fistula or complications following pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with soft pancreas. Previously reported trials have included all types of pancreatic resections and have include all types of pancreas and have shown no clearcut benefit of octreotide after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Soft pancreas and normal sized duct are the risk factors for fistula following PD. This study's focus is on this select group of patients and aims to assess the role of octreotide in patients with soft pancreas.</brief_summary>
