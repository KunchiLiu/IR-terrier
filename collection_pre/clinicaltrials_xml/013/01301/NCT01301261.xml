	<brief_summary>Sugammadex is used to reverse the neuromuscular blocking effect of steroid neuromuscular blockers. Its cardiovascular effects and effect on brain cortex, if any, may be associated to the reversal of the neuromuscular block. The aim of the study was to investigate the pure effects of sugammadex in the absence of the agonist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sugammadex: Effect on the Awareness Monitoring and Hemodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three groups of patients undergoing elective major surgery and given cis-atracurium for muscle relaxation are studied. Group 1 receives 2 mg/kg of sugammadex when a count of two of the train of four appears Group 2 receives 4 mg/kg of sugammadex when a posttetanic count 1-3 appears Group 3 receives 16 mg/kg of sugammadex three minutes after administration of cis-atracurium. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2, entropy and bispectral index are recorded every three minutes</detailed_description>
