	<brief_title>Cinnamon Trial-lIfestyle iNtervention Plus Water-soluble Cinnamon Extract On loweriNg Blood Glucose in Pre-diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are studying whether water-soluble cinnamon extract (Cinnulin PF) plus standard of care aggressive lifestyle therapy is effective in lowering blood glucose when compared to placebo plus standard of care aggressive life style therapy. Eligible subjects will be recruited from any form and any stage of "standard" lifestyle intervention for pre-diabetes at an individual base. "Standard" lifestyle intervention for pre-diabetes could include Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB), nutrition classes, Better Body/Better Life, or anything an investigator certifies as standard practice at that base. Subjects will take either 1 gram (2-500 milligram (mg) capsules) of water-soluble cinnamon extract (Cinnulin PF) or 2 placebo pills (gelatin capsule filled with wheat bran) once a day for 1 year plus 1 additional year of follow-up. This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study which will enroll subjects at the Mike O'Callaghan Federal Medical Center (MOFMC), Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center (WHASC), David Grant Medical Center (DGMC), Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin), and Offutt Air Force Base (Offutt). All subjects will be MOFMC, WHASC, DGMC, Eglin, and Offutt DoD beneficiaries. Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization will be obtained. After randomization, subjects will receive either 1 gram (2-500 mg capsules) of water-soluble cinnamon extract or placebo from the pharmacy--thus investigators and subjects will be blinded as to if they are taking Cinnulin PF or 2 placebo pills. Subjects will be permitted to have usual medical care for other co-morbid, preventive, and acute conditions. Analysis will be performed using intention-to-treat principles for missing data (the carry-forward method to impute missing data will be used). Subjects will bring in any remaining water-soluble cinnamon extract or placebo to determine adherence rates to the study protocol.</detailed_description>
