	<brief_summary>After the fourth protocol amendment two study arms are evaluated in this clinical protocol: PD-0325901 (oral MEK inhibitor) plus PF-05212384 (intravenous PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and PF-05212384 plus irinotecan. The study will assess safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these combinations in patients with advanced cancer. Once the maximum tolerated doses are identified, further assessment of these combinations will be done in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancer for the PF-05212384 plus irinotecan arm and in patients with ovarian cancer or KRAS mutated non small cell lung cancer for the combination of PF-05212384 plus PD-0325901.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study was prematurely discontinued as a result of an internal portfolio review on April 1, 2015. The decision to terminate was not due to any safety or efficacy data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which there is no currently clinically effective treatment. All tumor types for patients enrolled in Stage 1 of Arm C. For patients enrolled in Stage 2 of Arm C, advanced colorectal cancer (both KRAS mutated and KRAS wild type), which has progressed on irinotecanbased regimens, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after progression on first line treatment for metastatic/advanced disease. For patients enrolled in Stage 1 of Arm D, tumors with KRAS or BRAF mutation (archived or fresh biopsy). Patients with tumors harboring other mutations that activate the MAPK pathway may be enrolled upon agreement with the Sponsor. For patients enrolled in Stage 2 of Arm D, ovarian cancer which has progressed on prior platinum containing regimen or KRAS mutated non small cell lung cancer which has progressed on one prior regimen. Patients with colorectal cancer enrolled to both Arms must: 1. have received at least 6 weeks of irinotecanbased therapy (either as single agent or in combination with cytotoxic drugs or in combination with targeted therapies) as the last prior treatment 2. have progressed on or within 1 month of completing this irinotecanbased regimen All patients must provide an archived or fresh tumor sample. For a subset of patients fresh tumor biopsies are mandatory: a. All patients with CRC enrolled to Stage 2 of Arm C must provide a fresh tumor biopsy at baseline. A subset of patients (10 or more) with at least 5 evaluable patients with CRC KRAS wild type must also provide tumor biopsy during treatment. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) must be 0 or 1 Adequate Bone Marrow, Renal, Cardiac, and Liver Function Patients with known active brain metastases Chemotherapy, radiotherapy (other than palliative radiotherapy to lesions that will not be followed for tumor assessment on this study, ie, non target lesions), biological or investigational agents within 4 weeks of the start of the study treatment (6 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosoureas). Any surgery (not including minor procedures such as lymph node biopsy, needle biopsy, and/or placement of portacath) within 4 weeks of start of the study treatment; or not fully recovered from any side effects of previous procedures. In Arm D only: Patients with glaucoma, intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mmHg, history of retinal vein occlusions, ocular ischemia or any other clinically significant abnormality in the ophthalmologic exam which would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study For patients enrolling in Stage 2 prior therapy with an agent that is known or proposed to be active by action on PI3K and/or mTOR. Prior high dose chemotherapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 12 months of study treatment start. Known impaired pulmonary function or demonstrated to be impaired by Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) for patients who present with clinical suggestion of impairment. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease Current use or anticipated need for food or drugs that are known potent CYP3A4 inhibitors Current or anticipated need for food or drugs that are known potent CYP3A4 inducers</criteria>
