	<brief_summary>The Breathe NIOVâ„¢ System will reduce the work of breathing in subjects with chronic respiratory insufficiency who require long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The Breathe system will accomplish this by providing oxygen under pressure and augmenting the subject's spontaneous tidal volumes. The combination of efficient oxygen delivery, assisted ventilation, and a comfortable low-profile device, will result in a mean improvement in perceived well-being and ability to perform ADLs, as measured by patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In-home Evaluation of a Noninvasive Open Ventilation System in Patients With Severe Respiratory Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, open-label, crossover study in up to 12 stable subjects with chronic respiratory insufficiency who require LTOT. Each subject's standard oxygen therapy will be used as the control treatment and compared to the test ventilator system during selected activities of daily living. Subjects will participate in the study for up to 9 home visits, with Visits 1 and 2 each lasting for approximately 4 hours, and Visits 3-9 lasting approximately 1-2 hours each. Subjects may discontinue study participation at any time.</detailed_description>
