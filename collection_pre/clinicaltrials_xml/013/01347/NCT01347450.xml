	<brief_summary>Background: Cocoa is rich in flavonoids such as (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin; these compounds have displayed both in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity. Objective: This trial evaluate the regular ingestion effect of both, dark chocolate and cocoa powder, over plasma lipids of young males subjected to ex vivo lipid peroxidative conditions. Design: Single-blind, controlled and randomized clinical trial including 100 healthy men, divided into two groups: 50 subjects received 30 g of cocoa powder and 50 g of dark chocolate/d for 1 wk, and the other 50 subjects received placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult young males were enrolled at the Universidad Industrial de Santander by publicity at the university food service centre. Those who respond (n=136) were selected after the normal blood lipid profile was verified by laboratory testing of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL and triacylglycerols, as well exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied. Within the exclusion criteria we included diagnosed coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, use of any prescribed medication, restrictive diets and any migraine or cocoa products allergic antecedents. Finally enlisted subjects were 120 non-smokers, normolipemic, ages were between 20 and 30 years old, who underwent anthropometric measurements like weight, height, BMI (among 16.0 and 27.4 kg/m2) and regular nutritional and toxicological habits using standardized surveys. Subjects received 3 meals a day from the Food Nutritional Service of Universidad Industrial de Santander, in order to ensure the same diet conditions for all subjects along the experimental period. An average colombian diet, based on 2287 calories as a total caloric value (protein 15%, fats 35% and carbohydrates 60%) was used. The study protocol and the informed consent were approved by the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá Institutional Ethical Committee (Santa Fe de Bogotá D.C., Colombia). We got written informed consent from all participants and they received money compensation for its participation in the study. Outcome measures: Susceptibility of plasma lipids to oxidation Determination of plasma lipids oxidation resistance Determination of oxidative protection</detailed_description>
