	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training in Patients With End Stage Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic renal failure commonly have weak respiratory muscles leading to problems in everyday activities and respiratory infections. This project aims to investigate if threshold inspiratory muscle training improves the strength, everyday function and participation of patients on haemodialysis. Forty eight patients will be recruited in a randomized controlled trial of inspiratory muscle training vs sham training. Outcome measures include the maximal inspiratory pressure and the Frenchay activities index. Initial data will be collected by a blinded assessor; the patients will train at 40 % of initial maximal inspiratory pressure for six weeks and be reassessed. If the inspiratory muscle training is effective, it will improve both the physical and functional components of the patient's lives and be recommended for all renal patients.</detailed_description>
