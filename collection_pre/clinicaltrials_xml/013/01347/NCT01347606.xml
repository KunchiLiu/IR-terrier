	<detailed_description>Thyroid surgery has potential risks. Intraoperative organ (such as parathyroides) extraction and vascular or neural (such as recurrent nervus) injuries are most important ones. This research is aim to prevention of these via intraoperative methylene blue using. In the operation when thyroid lobes manipulated to medially, methylene blue will be sprayed to this area. Dying patternes of tissues (thyroid tissue, oparathyroid tissues, arteries, venules and neural structures) will ensure to identification the tissues.</detailed_description>
