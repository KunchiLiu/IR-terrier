	<brief_title>Assessing the Effectiveness of Two Treatment Strategies for Tension-type Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the pilot data proposal is to compare usual care (medications) versus multi-disciplinary treatment in TMD patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache (TTH) with pericranial tenderness involving the temporalis muscle at reducing the intensity of TTH pain at 1 and 6 months. The hypothesis is that a team approach will reduce the intensity of headache more than usual care in this group of patients.</detailed_description>
