	<brief_summary>The respiratory sleep disorders are a major cardiovascular risk factor. In fact there is enough scientific evidence that supports the association between apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SASH) and cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, heart failure ....The objective of this study is to estimate the effectiveness of the continuous positive pressure airway (CPAP) in patient with chronic heart failure with normal ejection fraction but dyastolic dysfunction and sleep disordered breathing during the sleep.</brief_summary>
