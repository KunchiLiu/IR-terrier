	<brief_summary>Adhesive bridges are becoming popular in patients with congenitally missing teeth and these are type of bridges that can be done with only minimal or with no preparation to replace the missing tooth/teeth. The best clinical gain is the minimal tooth preparation or no need for the removal of tooth substance. Treatment for this type of bridges does not usually require anaesthesia. In addition, adhesive bridges can provide reasonable aesthetical outcome with minimal cost and reduced chair time. The biggest issue is that high failure rate in the long term, and gray colour shining through the metal wing cemented onto the abutment tooth. This can compromise the aesthetical outcome. The aesthetical problem can be solved by the use of zirconia all ceramic material to construct the bridge.</brief_summary>
