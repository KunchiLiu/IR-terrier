	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of OSASH requires expensive sleep tests that generate long waiting lists, so we need simplified and rapid diagnostic tools. The ApneaLinkTM, is a device that allows the assessment of respiratory events by measuring the flow ventilation with a nasal cannula connected to a pressure transducer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients 18 to 75 years of both sexes. 2. clinical suspicion of OSAH defined as subjects with breathing pauses during sleep and / or asphyxiated sounds, with or without excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth scale and who have asked for a sleep test to rule out OSAH. 3. Informed consent signed by the patient. 1. Place of residence more than 100 km from the hospital. 2. inability to perform psychophysical study at home. 3. cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular or respiratory or acute severe unstable as to preclude the proper conduct of studies at home and / or PSG in the laboratory. 4. Patients with chronic insomnia or recognize sleep less than six hours. 5. Patients with depression (both point 4 and 5 are the potential causes of false negatives in a PR for lack of sufficient sleep time). 6. nasal obstruction complete or nearly complete, which prevents obtaining a quality signal with MicroMESAM</criteria>
