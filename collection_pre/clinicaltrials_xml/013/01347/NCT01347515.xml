	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: A functional olive oil tailored to provide the best relationship between phenolic compounds (amount and type) phenolic bioavailability and bioactivity (antioxidant and anti-endothelial dysfunction) will be a useful tool for increasing not only circulating HDL cholesterol concentration, but also the functionality (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and reverse cholesterol transport capacity) of human HDL in vivo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioactivity of Olive Oils Enriched With Their Own Phenolic Compounds (VOHF1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first step is to determine, in healthy human subjects in postprandial condition, the best relationship between phenolic compounds (amount and type) / bioavailability and bioactivity (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-endothelial dysfunction) using olive oils enriched with its own broad-spectrum phenolic compounds.</detailed_description>
