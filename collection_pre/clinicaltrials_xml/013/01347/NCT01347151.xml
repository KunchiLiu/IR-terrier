	<brief_summary>Both Glide scope and Pentax laryngoscope are video laryngoscope that provide the better view with minimal cervical spine movement. This study wants to compare cervical spine movement during intubation when using these two devices. The C-spine motion will be recorded by using fluoroscopic video to measure the angular displacement of the vertebrae.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Cervical Spine Movement During Tracheal Intubation Using the Pentax or the Glidescope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary outcome is the angular displacement of the vertebrae and secondary outcome is the hemodynamic changes after intubation.</detailed_description>
