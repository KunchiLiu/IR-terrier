	<brief_summary>Cabozantinib (XL184) is a new drug that is being developed to treat cancer. Cabozantinib works by blocking the "angiogenesis," or the growth of new blood vessels, to the tumor. This is similar to how several other cancer drugs work but in addition Cabozantinib also blocks other pathways that may be responsible for allowing cancer cells to become resistant to these other "anti-angiogenic" treatments. So far cabozantinib has been investigated in treating brain cancer and a rare form of thyroid cancer. This study will explore lower doses of cabozantinib with the goal to find the most effective, safe, and tolerable dose without undesirable side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib (XL184) in Men With Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cabozantinib will be taken by mouth daily. The first five treatment cycles will be 21 days. All cycles after that will be 42 days long. Patients will keep a diary to record study drug dosing. During the screening phase patients will receive a physical exam, blood and urine tests, a bone scan, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and an MRI scan of total body. On Day 1 of each cycle patients will receive a physical exam and blood and urine tests. Bone scan, CT and MRI scans will be performed at the start of cycles 3 and 5, and then repeated once every 12 weeks. Patients will continue to receive study treatment as long as they are receiving benefit from the treatment, do not experience any severe or unmanageable side effects, and disease does not get any worse.</detailed_description>
