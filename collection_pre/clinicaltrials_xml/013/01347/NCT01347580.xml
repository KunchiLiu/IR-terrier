	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether initiation of ticagrelor as early as in the ambulance setting leads to a rapid reperfusion of the infarct-related artery therefore facilitating the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and optimizing the outcome for the patient. The study will assess the efficacy and safety of pre-hospital compared to in-hospital administration of ticagrelor in co-administration with aspirin, on restoring the blood flow in the occluded heart artery and improving the myocardial perfusion in patients suffering from myocardial infarction and planned to have a PCI. Patients can be randomised in either one of the 2 arms: re-hospital ticagrelor arm: Patients will receive a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor for the pre-hospital administration and placebo for in-hospital administration. or In-hospital ticagrelor arm: Patients will receive a placebo for pre-hospital administration and 180 mg ticagrelor loading dose for in-hospital administration. Patients are initially managed by ambulance physician/personnel in pre hospital settings. They are then transferred into a Catheterization room to undergo a PCI. After the administration of the loading dose of ticagrelor (double blind), patients will continue on ticagrelor 90 mg bid and be followed in study for 30 days post randomisation.</brief_summary>
