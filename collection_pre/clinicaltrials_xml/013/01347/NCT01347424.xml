	<brief_summary>Contrast enhancement ultrasonography（CEUS）could be used to evaluate the blood flow perfusion liver cancer. In this clinical trial, CEUS was used to evaluated the changes of blood flow perfusion of Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver after treated with endostatin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma or NSCLC With an evaluable secondary malignant neoplasm of Liver, diameter≥2cm Without transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment Performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale. Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months Patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate followup. Adequate organ function including the following: Bone marrow: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;or= 1.5x10^9/L, platelets &gt;or= 100x10^9/L, hemoglobin &gt;or= 9g/dL. Hepatic: bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN (alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT &lt; 5 x ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement). Renal: calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 45 ml/min. Men or women of at least 18 years of age. Signed informed consent from patient. Women who are pregnant or in lactation Systemic treatment for another cancer within the year prior to study entry Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs with similar chemical structures Use of investigational agents within 28 days of the Baseline visit, or participating simultaneously in any other clinical studies Severe comorbidity of any type that may interfere with assessment of the patient for the study</criteria>
