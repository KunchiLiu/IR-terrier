	<brief_title>Scrambler Therapy in Treating Pain and Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To record the types of patients that we treat, along with the reported efficacy and potential toxicity associated with scrambler therapy. II. To get experience with patient reported outcome measurement tools that we use in this trial, including a report of analgesic use. OUTLINE: Patients undergo scrambler therapy for 30 minutes daily for up to 10 consecutive days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 10 weeks. III. To explore neurologic testing changes in patients receiving scrambler therapy.</detailed_description>

Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance Ability to provide informed written consent Pregnant women Patients with implantable drug delivery systems, e.g. Medtronic Synchromed Patients with heart stents or metal implants such as pacemakers, automatic defibrillators, aneurysm clips, vena cava clips and skull plates; (metal implants for orthopedic repair, e.g. pins, clips, plates, cages, joint replacements are allowed as are central venous access devices) Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within the past six months Patients with history of epilepsy, brain damage, use of anticonvulsants for seizure prevention, concurrently using ketamine, symptomatic brain metastases; Note: anticonvulsant use is allowed for neuropathy and heart failure (HF) if on a stable dose Skin conditions such as open sores that would prevent proper application of the electrodes Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigators might compromise the objectives of the study Currently on gabapentin or pregabalin Note: (because of data that support that patients don't do as well when on gabapentin or pregabalin, all patients on these medications will be weaned off of them prior to study initiation. The study team will provide instructions on how to do this).</criteria>
