	<brief_title>Transcranial Laser Therapy in the Rehabilitation of Hemiplegic Patients From Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcranial laser therapy is applied with an InGa(Al)As diode laser.The laser in automatic scanning is applied over both cerebral hemisphere during 15 sessions. Patients simultaneously performed a program of therapeutic exercises 3 days a week. Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale, which assessed upper limb motor function, and the Barthel index, which assessed general functional disability.</detailed_description>
