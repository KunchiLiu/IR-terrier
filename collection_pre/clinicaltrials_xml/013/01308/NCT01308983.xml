	<criteria>Prehypertensive: Having systolic BP between 120 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP between 80 to 89 mmHg during screening visit.

Male or female of Caucasian or AfricanAmerican origin. No history of any major past and current medical illness (such as diabetes, renal disease, liver disease etc.) Not taking any medication that affects blood pressure. HbA1C &gt; 7.0 % during screening visit. Serum potassium &gt; 5.5 mEq/L during screening and/or any testing visit due to risk of developing hyperkalemia. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/100 ml and/or creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min* (Glomerular Filtration Rate Estimate by Abbreviated MDRD Study Equation)35 during screening and/or any testing visit due to risk of developing renal dysfunction. Female having positive pregnancy test during screening and/or any testing visit.</criteria>
