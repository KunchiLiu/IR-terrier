	<brief_title>Clinical Study of INFUSE® Bone Graft Compared to Autogenous Bone Graft for Vertical Ridge Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate INFUSE® Bone Graft as an alternative to autograft for alveolar ridge bone formation in the posterior mandible prior to dental implants. A subject must have a defect behind the canine of 2-4 teeth for at least 2 months and be a candidate for dental implants.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Alveolar Bone Loss</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Has been edentulous for at least 2 months with an alveolar ridge defect affecting 24 teeth in the posterior mandible, posterior to the canine. 2. Has an alveolar ridge defect with a minimum starting height of 5 mm above the superior cortex of the inferior alveolar canal in the posterior mandible. 3. Is a candidate for dental implants (24 teeth) in the affected posterior mandibular alveolar ridge area. 4. Has a prosthodontic treatment plan in place. 5. Has no known condition that would interfere with collecting autogenous bone at either the tibia or the iliac crest for a bone grafting procedure. 6. Is 2175 years of age (inclusive). 7. If female of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test, is not lactating, and agrees not to become pregnant for at least 12 months after surgery. 8. Is able to comply with all studyrelated procedures, including exercising good oral hygiene. 9. Is able to provide written informed consent. 1. Has bilateral alveolar ridge defects requiring simultaneous augmentation or a second augmentation planned during the course of the study. 2. Has an active infection at the planned augmentation site. 3. Has active periodontal disease of Grade III or higher. 4. Has had a dental extraction procedure at the planned augmentation site within the 2 months prior to Day 0. 5. Has had a soft tissue graft at the planned augmentation site within less than 2 weeks of Screening. 6. Is expected to require any additional bone graft material (e.g., allograft and xenograft) at the planned augmentation site in addition to the investigative treatment or autogenous bone, as determined by the investigator prior to surgery. 7. Has a history of a failed alveolar ridge augmentation procedure. 8. Has a pathology finding that would either compromise a bone grafting procedure or interfere with obtaining quantitative measurements from postoperative CT scans. 9. Is an insulindependent diabetic. 10. Has an overt or active systemic infection, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), bacteremia, or hepatitis C virus (HCV). 11. Has a planned augmentation site in the area of a resected or extant tumor. 12. Has presence of an active malignancy or prior history of malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin). 13. Is actively using any nicotinecontaining products such as, but not limited to, smoking and chewing tobacco, nicotine patch, nicotine gum, etc. within 2 weeks prior to Screening. 14. Is alcohol or drug dependent, as determined by the investigator. 15. Is taking medications or having treatment known to have an effect on bone metabolism, such as, but not limited to: calcitonin within the past 6 months; fluorides for 30 days or more within the past 12 months; cumulative use of oral bisphosphonates for less than 5 years within the past 6 months; cumulative use of oral bisphosphonates for 5 years or more; any previous use of intravenous bisphosphonates; chronic tetracycline (e.g., ongoing within the past month) or tetracycline analogs within the past 12 months; estrogen replacement therapy within the past 2 months; or methotrexate within the past 12 months. 16. Has a disease that affects bone metabolism, such as: congenital connective tissue disease (e.g., EhlersDanlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta); hyperthyroidism; or hyperparathyroidism. 17. Has a history of autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). 18. Has any previous exposure to any recombinant BMPs of either human or animal extraction. 19. Has a known history of prior exposure to silicone or injectable collagen implants. 20. Has a known hypersensitivity or allergy to collagen or protein pharmaceuticals (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or gamma globulins). 21. Has a known hypersensitivity or allergy to titanium. 22. Has a history of allergy to bovine collagen products. 23. Has chronic or acute renal failure 24. Has chronic or acute liver failure. 25. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy (drug, device, and/or biologic) within 30 days prior to bone graft implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 12month period following the study surgery. 26. Has any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the results of the study.</criteria>
