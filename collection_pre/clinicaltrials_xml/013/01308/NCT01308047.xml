	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the non-inferiority between Heavy Levobupivacaine with Enantiomeric Excess of 50% and Heavy Racemic Bupivacaine During Spinal Anesthesia for Orthopedic Procedures in the Lower Limbs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Heavy Levobupivacaine With Enantiomeric Excess of 50% and Heavy Racemic Bupivacaine.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Heavy Levobupivacaine with Enantiomeric Excess of 50% was developed to be a safe local anesthetic replacing the Heavy Racemic Bupivacaine. This study will evaluate the non-inferiority regarding efficacy and safety of spinal anesthesia in orthopedic procedures.</detailed_description>
