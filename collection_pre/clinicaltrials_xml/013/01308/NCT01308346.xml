	<brief_summary>The target enrollment goal for the trial was to enroll 36 subjects. However due to a challenging protocol inclusion/ exclusion criteria, only one subject was enrolled since the trial was initiated in June 2011. To evaluate the following in participants undergoing coronary artery scaffolding/stenting for significant coronary artery disease: - The acute (post-implantation) effect of an implanted bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) or metallic drug eluting stent (mDES) on coronary blood flow and physiological responsiveness of the target coronary artery - The long-term (2 years) effect of an implanted BVS or mDES on coronary blood flow and physiological responsiveness of the target coronary artery</brief_summary>

Participant must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 5. Participant must agree to undergo all clinical investigation planrequired followup visits. 6. Participant must agree not to participate in any other clinical investigation for a period of 2 years following the index procedure. This includes clinical trials of medications and invasive procedures. Only questionnairebased studies are allowed. Angiographic 1. A single de novo native coronary artery lesion suitable to be treated by either a BVS or a mDES. 2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery in which the mean proximal and distal vessel diameter of the target lesion (Dmean) fall within the range of ≥ 2.25 mm and ≤ 3.25 mm and the target lesion length measures ≤ 22 mm as assessed by IVUS. 3. Target lesion must be located in the main branch of a major epicardial vessel (i.e., LAD, LCX, or RCA) with a visually estimated diameter stenosis of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 1. 4. Participant must have an additional angiographically smooth (&lt; 40% diameter stenosis) nontarget vessel to act as an intraparticipant control vessel (selfcontrol vessel). The selfcontrol vessel must be the main branch of a major epicardial vessel (i.e., LAD, LCX, or RCA). 5. Coronary anatomy must be suitable for IVUS, OCT, and pressure and flow wire instrumentation. General 1. Participant has a known diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 14 days preceding the index procedure. 2. Participant has highrisk acute coronary syndrome (e.g., dynamic STT wave change on ECG or recurrent chest pain/nitrateunresponsive prolonged chest pain at rest within 48 hours prior to the index procedure). 3. Participant has any evidence of myocardial infarct in the territory subtended by the proposed target vessel or selfcontrol vessel. 4. Participant has current unstable arrhythmias. 5. Participant has chronic atrial fibrillation. 6. Participant has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40%. 7. Participant has received a heart transplant or any other organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant. 8. Participant has previously had CABG or mitral or aortic valve repair/replacement. 9. Participant is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30 days prior to or after the index procedure. 10. Participant is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). 11. Participant has a chronic systemic condition or medication likely to interfere with coronary physiology and/or conduit artery function (e.g., chronic inflammatory condition, chronic renal failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). 12. Participant has known renal insufficiency. 13. Participant is receiving or scheduled to receive any planned radiotherapy. 14. Participant is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, coumadin) at the onset of the clinical investigation. 15. Participant has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, antiplatelet medications specified for use in the study (clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticlopidine, inclusive), everolimus, poly (Llactide), poly (DLlactide), cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers, or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. 16. Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the index procedure that will require discontinuing aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticlopidine. 17. Participant has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis) within 7 days prior to the index procedure. 18. Participant has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. 19. Participant has had a cerebrovascular accident/stroke (CVA) or transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) within the past 6 months. 20. Participant has had a significant gastrointestinal or significant urinary bleed within the past 6 months. 21. Participant has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion. 22. Participant has a history of paradoxical exerciseinduced vasoconstriction that is consistent with myocardial bridging in the coronary anatomy. 23. Participant has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that in the judgment of the Investigator may cause noncompliance with the clinical investigation plan, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy. 24. Participant is currently participating in another clinical investigation that has not yet reached its primary endpoint. 25. Percutaneous interventions for lesions in the third major epicardial vessel (the one that does not contain the target or the selfcontrol vessel) were performed within 30 days preceding the index procedure or are planned to be done within 6 months following the index procedure. 26. Planned PCI procedures in the target vessel (and/or any of its side branches) or the selfcontrol vessel (and/or any of its side branches) within 2 years following the index procedure. 27. Participant who does not suspend drugs that will influence vasofunction. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria 1. Target lesion meets any of the following criteria: 1. Left main location; 2. RCA aortoostial location (within 10 mm from expected proximal stent/scaffold edge); 3. LAD or LCX ostial location (within 10 mm from expected proximal stent/scaffold edge); 4. Involves a bifurcation with a side branch ≥ 2 mm in diameter, an ostial lesion &gt; 40% stenosed by visual estimation, or a side branch requiring predilatation; 5. Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0) prior to wire crossing; 6. Excessive tortuosity proximal to or within the lesion; 7. Extreme angulation (≥ 90°) proximal to or within the lesion; 8. Heavy calcification in the lesion; 9. Located in a side branch. 2. Participant has a high probability that a procedure other than predilatation, scaffold/stent implantation, and postdilatation (if applicable) will be required at the time of index procedure for treatment of the target vessel (e.g., atherectomy, cutting balloon or brachytherapy). 3. The target vessel (and/or any of its side branches) or the selfcontrol vessel (and/or any of its side branches) contains visible thrombus. 4. The target vessel or the selfcontrol vessel has previously been treated by any PCI procedures. 5. A side branch of the target vessel or a side branch of the selfcontrol vessel has received any percutaneous interventions within 30 days prior to the index procedure. 6. Another clinically significant lesion is located in the target vessel (and/or any of its side branches) or the selfcontrol vessel (and/or any of its side branches) that may require PCI treatments within 2 years following the index procedure. 7. Participant has evidence of myocardial bridging in the coronary anatomy during the angiographic evaluation.</criteria>
