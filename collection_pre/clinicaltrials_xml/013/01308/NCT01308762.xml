	<brief_title>A Clinical Study, to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Intradermal IMM-101 in Adult Melanoma Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a first-in-man, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three different doses of IMM-101 administered intradermally to melanoma patients. Additionally, the study aims to characterize local responses to this vaccine in order to delineate unexpected / unacceptable local reactions from those indicative of appropriate immunological response in this patient group.</detailed_description>
