	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether vaccination with tumor antigenic peptides and both IMP321/LAG-3 and Montanide adjuvants can induce an immune response in melanoma patients and to assess the safety and tolerability of this vaccination. Tumor responses following this vaccination will also be documented.</brief_summary>
