	<brief_summary>Fentanyl is expected to suppress tracheal tube-induced cough during emergence from general anaesthesia through binding to its receptors in the brainstem. However, it has not been proven if fentanyl has a complication-free, dose-dependent effect on cough suppression during emergence from sevoflurane anaesthesia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between fentanyl doses and cough suppression during emergence from sevoflurane anaesthesia.</brief_summary>
