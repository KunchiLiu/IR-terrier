	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, multi-center trial to demonstrate an inequality between IVUS-guided versus angiography-guided implantation of everolimus-eluting stents(EES) at long lesions(&gt; 28 mm) in clinical outcomes at 12 months as a primary objective and safety of 6- month dual antiplatelet therapy following EES implantation in comparison with a 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy.</brief_summary>
