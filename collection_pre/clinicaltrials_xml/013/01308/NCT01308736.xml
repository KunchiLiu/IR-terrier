	<brief_summary>The investigators will randomize smokers to receive 1) Varenicline + smoking cessation/reduction counseling or 2) Placebo pill + smoking cessation/reduction counseling. Neither the participants nor the research therapists/evaluators will know to which condition (active or placebo pill) the participants have been assigned i.e., a double-blind study). The medication and weekly counseling will occur for 28 days. Participants will complete assessment measures just before the start of treatment (baseline), at the end-of-treatment, at 1-month, 3-month, and at 6-months to determine if there are differences in tobacco use between treatment groups.</brief_summary>
