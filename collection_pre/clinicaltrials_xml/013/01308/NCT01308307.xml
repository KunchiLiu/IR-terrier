	<brief_summary>Purpose: : This study was performed to compare the accuracy of non-cycloplegic photorefraction with cycloplegic refraction in detection of refractive amblyopia risk factors and determine some corresponding beneficial cut points. Method: In this diagnostic accuracy study, right eyes of 185 children (1 to 14 years) underwent first non-cycloplegic photorefraction (with PlusOptix SO4 photoscreener) and then cycloplegic refraction from October 2009 to August 2010. Based on the cycloplegic refraction results, hyperopia (≥+3.5D), myopia (≥-3D), astigmatism (≥1.5D), and anisometropia (≥1.5D) were set as criteria based on AAPOS guidelines. The difference in detection of refractive amblyopia risk factors between the two methods was the main outcome measure.</brief_summary>
