	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of RO5323441 in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In the dose-finding part, patients will receive intravenous escalating doses of RO5323441 in combination with 10 mg/kg Avastin once every two weeks. In the efficacy-finding part, patients will be randomized to receive the established dose (from the dose-finding part) of RO5323441 plus Avastin or Avastin alone. Patients in the dose-finding part may continue treatment with RO5323441 and Avastin on the study until evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable adverse events happen. In the efficacy-finding part, patients will receive study treatment until disease progression or death.</brief_summary>
