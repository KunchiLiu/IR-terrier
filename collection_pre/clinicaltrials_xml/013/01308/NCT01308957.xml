	<brief_title>Fish Oil and Muscle Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss of muscle mass is a normal consequence of aging in many older adults, worsened by chronic illness, poor appetite and diet, and reduced physical activity. The ensuing decline in physical function is a major cause of frailty, disability and death. Treatments that can reverse or reduce the age-associated loss of muscle mass are therefore much needed. Evidence is emerging that consumption of fish or fish oil derived long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) may be important for maintenance of muscle mass and physical function throughout the life-span. However, the effect of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength and overall physical function is not known. The goal of this study therefore is to determine the effect of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function in older adults.</detailed_description>

Subjects with allergies to sea food, Subjects who regularly consume fish oil or consume &gt;2 servings of fish with a high LCn3PUFA content (e.g. salmon, mackerel, sardines, etc) per week. Physical performance test score less than 17 out of 36.</criteria>
