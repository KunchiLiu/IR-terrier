	<brief_summary>Conjunctival Mullerectomy is a well known procedure used to correct upper lid ptosis via a posterior approach. Patients who undergo this procedure are often given local anesthesia to alleviate intraoperative and postoperative pain. Local anesthesia can be given via frontal nerve block or subconjunctival injection combined with sedation in most cases. Both techniques are currently acceptable options for local anesthesia, however postoperative pain has not been systematically evaluated between these two techniques. The investigators aim to compare intra-operative and postoperative pain with these two techniques in patients undergoing conjunctival Mullerectomy for ptosis repair. Patients will be randomized to receive local anesthesia via frontal nerve block or via subconjunctival injection. In addition, the investigators will measure the surgical outcomes of the ptosis surgery with standard measures.</brief_summary>
