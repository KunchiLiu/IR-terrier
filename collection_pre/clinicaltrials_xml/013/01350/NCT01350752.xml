	<detailed_description>NIGERIA Two interventions will be evaluated: (i) provider intervention including introducing RDTs with detailed instructions, one-off training, job aides and on-the-site supportive supervisory visits and (ii) combined provider intervention [as under (i)]and community-based intervention (using primary and secondary schools as focal points)including school malaria events with drama, peer-health education, distribution of health education materials. Types of facilities include: public primary health facilities, private pharmacies and private Patent Medicine Dealers (PMDs)in Enugu State. The two sites in Enugu State are: Enugu urban (comprising of Enugu East, Enugu South and Enugu North Local government areas (LGA) and Udi LGA. The impact of the interventions will be evaluated using a 3-arm stratified, cluster randomized trial with a cluster defined as a geographical community and the two study sites as the strata. The three arms of the trial are: - Intervention - Provider intervention - Intervention - Provider plus school-based malaria activities - Control - Expected practice (once RDTs have been introduced) CAMEROON Two interventions will be evaluated: (i) the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) with basic provider training on malaria diagnosis and treatment; and (ii) the basic provider training [as under (i)] plus enhanced provider training to improve the quality of care that includes aspects of interactive self awareness, communication modules between health workers and also between health workers and patients. Types of facilities include: public district hospitals, public health centres (including integrated health centres), mission hospitals and mission health centres (including integrated health centres)in Yaound√© and Bamenda Health Districts. A stratified, cluster randomized trial will be used in which health facilities are the cluster and the two study sites are the strata. The three arms of the trial are: - Intervention - RDTs with basic provider training; - Intervention - RDTs with basic plus enhanced provider training; - Control - which represents current practice and neither intervention will be implemented.</detailed_description>
