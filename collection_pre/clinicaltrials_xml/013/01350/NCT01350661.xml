	<brief_summary>This observational study aims to assess the correlation between many questionnaires designed to assess the level of control of asthma. The five questionnaires will be submitted, at the same time and in a random order, to asthma patients. Some other parameters will be recorded (e.g. lung function, epidemiological data). The hypothesis is that the results of the questionnaires will be the same. If not, we will try to understand why. The investigators will include 100 patients, stratified with relation to their level of asthma severity (25 patients for each level of severity - described by the GINA guidelines).</brief_summary>
