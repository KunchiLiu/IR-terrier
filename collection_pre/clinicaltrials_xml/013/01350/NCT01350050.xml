	<brief_summary>Topical Pharyngeal anesthesia (TPA) is widely used during upper endoscopy. Articaine is local anaesthetic that have not been previously evaluated in pharyngeal anesthesia for upper endoscopy. The aim of this study was to compare pharyngeal anesthesia with 4% articaine to placebo (Na0,9%) during gastroscopy in terms of benefit on patients` and endoscopists` satisfaction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Pharyngeal Anesthesia With Articaine for Gastroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical Pharyngeal anesthesia (TPA) is widely used as an adjunct to sedation during upper endoscopy. TPA improves patient tolerance and the ease of endoscopy.1 Methemoglobinemia and anaphylactic reactions are serious complications of such topical anaesthetic agents, as lidocaine, tetracaine, and benzocaine. Articaine is as a unique amide local anaesthetic that possesses both an amide and an ester linkage and this is of clinical significance in minimizing the risk of overdose (toxic reaction). In routine dental procedures, articaine is a superior anaesthetic to lidocaine. Also, in comparison to lidocaine articaine acts faster and its duration of action is shorter what may be an advantage in such relatively fast procedures as gastroscopy. Articaine have not been previously evaluated in pharyngeal anesthesia for upper endoscopy. The aim of this randomised double-blind placebo controlled study was to compare pharyngeal anesthesia with 4% articaine to placebo (Na0,9%) during gastroscopy in terms of benefit on patients` and endoscopists`satisfaction.</detailed_description>
