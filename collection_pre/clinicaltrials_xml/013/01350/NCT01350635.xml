	<brief_title>Skin Test Study of BM32</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BM32 is a hypoallergenic grass pollen allergy vaccine which consists of an aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed equimolar mix of four active ingredients, BM321, BM322, BM325 and BM326. The four active ingredients are purified recombinant proteins containing non-allergenic peptides from the four major timothy grass pollen allergens, Phl p 1 (BM321), Phl p 2 (BM322), Phl p 5 (BM325) and Phl p 6 (BM326) which are fused to the PreS domain of hepatitis B virus, a protein used in childhood vaccines. BM32 holds promise not to induce IgE mediated immediate type (e.g. anaphylactic reactions) or T-cell mediated late phase side effects during immunotherapy. The aim of the present skin test study CS-BM32-001 is to evaluate whether the BM32 proteins due to their low/absent IgE- and T cell-reactivity exhibit low/no allergenic activity when applied by skin prick- and atopy patch testing to grass pollen allergic patients (n=60). This study will therefore provide important information for immunotherapy studies based on BM32.</detailed_description>
