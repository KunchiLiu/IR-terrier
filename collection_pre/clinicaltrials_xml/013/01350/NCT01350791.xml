	<brief_summary>This study is a non-randomized, prospective, open-label registry to compare the efficacy and safety of Promus Element stents versus first-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) in patients with coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Effectiveness and Safety of PROMUS Element Stent (IRIS-ELEMENT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Element Stent platform features a proprietary Platinum Chromium Alloy, designed specifically for coronary stents. This alloy, coupled with a new stent architecture, is designed to enable thinner struts, increased flexibility and a lower profile while improving radial strength, recoil and visibility. In addition, the PROMUS Element Stent System incorporates the new Apexâ„¢ Dilatation Catheter technology, designed to enhance deliverability to complex lesions. Currently, there have been limited data regarding comparison of PROMUS Element stent with first-generation DES in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we perform large-scale real-world registry of PROMUS Element stents.</detailed_description>
