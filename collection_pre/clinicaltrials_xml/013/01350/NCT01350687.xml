	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension is a new complication described in hemodialysis patients. in the last year these patients were treated by calcium carbonate orally to control serum phosphor. Calcium phosphor deposits in pulmonary artery can explain this phenomena. The investigators want to investigate the new phosphor non calcium containing agents in hemodialysis patients and to measure the pulmonary pressure.</brief_summary>
