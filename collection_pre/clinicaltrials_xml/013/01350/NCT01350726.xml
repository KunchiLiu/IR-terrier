	<brief_summary>The aims of this study were divided into three parts: 1. To develop a new software to carry out the functional-three- dimensional-reconstruction of the liver by 99mTc-GSA-SPECT scintigraphy 2. To probe a new dynamic model of the metabolism of the 99mTc-GSA. 3. To evaluate the liver function by 99mTc-GSA-SPECT scintigraphy before surgical treatment. Study design: 1. Collectivity type: Prospective，randomized, controlled, multi-central clinical study. 2. Patients: The subjects were from different hospitals including: Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Study arrangement: This study was consisted of three parts:</brief_summary>
