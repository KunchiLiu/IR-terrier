	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study to Assess the Safety and Activity of Enhanced TCR Transduced Autologous T Cells in Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous genetically modified T cells. Genetic material is transferred into the subject's previously harvested autologous T cells to redirect them to target melanoma cells rather than their usual target. Study subjects must have histologically or cytologically melanoma stage 3/4 and their tumor must express HLA Class 1 allele HLA-A*0201 for NY-ESO-1/LAGE. Subjects must also have measureable disease on study entry, as defined by at least one lesion that can be measured in at least one dimension &gt;= 10mm with spiral CT scan.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma stage III/IV, unresectable Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan One prior cytotoxic therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease is allowed. Unlimited regimens using biological agents (vaccines), immunotherapy, or targeted agents is permitted. For example, BRAF inhibitors and ipilimumab are permitted. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities related to any prior therapy. Prior therapy must be completed ≥28 days before the first dose of cyclophosphamide. Age ≥18 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl Or Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal The patient must express HLA class I allele HLAA*0201 for NYESO1/LAGE. Patient must have proven positive tumor sample for NYESO1 as determined by an H score for immunohistochemistry staining. Positive expression is defined as an H score ≥ 100 where the H score = [2 x (% cells 2+) + 3 x (% cells 3+)]. NOTE: The percentages of negative or weakly stained nuclei (i.e. 1+) are not to be included in the calculation of the H score. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and both male and female (of childbearing potential) subjects must agree to use reliable methods of contraception during the study. Ability of the patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Exclusion Criteria Patients who have had 2 or more regimens containing cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cyclophosphamide or other agents used in the study. Active infection Prior malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) within 3 years. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. All patients will undergo a cardiac stress test for evaluation of cardiac function. Pregnant or nursing females Active infection with HIV, HBV or HCV as defined below, due to the immunosuppressive effects of cyclophosphamide used and the unknown risks associated with viral replication. Positive serology for HIV Active Hepatitis B infection as determined by test for hepatitis B surface antigen. Active Hepatitis C. Patients will be screened for HCV antibody. If the HCV antibody is positive, a screening HCV RNA by any RTPCR or bDNA assay must be performed at screening by a local laboratory with a CLIA certification or its equivalent. Eligibility will be determined based on a negative screening value. The test is not required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60 days prior to screening is provided.</criteria>
