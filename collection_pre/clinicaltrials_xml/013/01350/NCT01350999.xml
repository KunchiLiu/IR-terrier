	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of TAK-085, once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), compared to ethyl eicosapentaenoate (EPA-E), three times daily (TID) in participants with hypertriglyceridemia undergoing lifestyle modification.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study of TAK-085 in Participants With Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAK-085 is an oral capsule medicine licensed to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. TAK-085 contains omega-3 fatty acid ethyl (mainly, ethyl eicosapentaenoate (EPA-E) and ethyl docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-E)). This is a phase 3, open-label, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-085. In addition, EPA-E is also administered for 52 weeks for reference to evaluate the safety of TAK-085 in participants with hypertriglyceridemia who are undergoing lifestyle modification. The study period is a total of 56 weeks, comprised of a 4- week screening period and 52 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
