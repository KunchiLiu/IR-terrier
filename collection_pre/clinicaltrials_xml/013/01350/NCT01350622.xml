	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the pain relieving effect and speed of onset of PENNSAID to that of standard oral diclofenac under double blind conditions using a growth curve approach to pain measurement. The investigators will test the hypothesis that PENNSAID will provide more rapid pain relief than oral diclofenac during the ED visit. The secondary goal of the proposed work is to discover and model the onset and course of pain relief during the emergency department (ED) visit.</brief_summary>
