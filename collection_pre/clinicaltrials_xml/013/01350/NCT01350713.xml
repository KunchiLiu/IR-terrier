	<brief_summary>Skin burns are one of the causes of disability, suffering and death in humans. Anecdotal, uncontrolled studies have shown the efficacy of povidone-iodine ointment in human skin burns, provided the preparation was applied shortly after the exposure to the heat source. The proposed study will conduct a controlled study in which the effect of povidone-iodine ointment will be tested in large group of patients and will be compared with standard cold water treatment.</brief_summary>
