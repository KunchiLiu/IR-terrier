	<brief_summary>This 2 arms study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with sequential erlotinib plus docetaxel therapy versus docetaxel alone as second line treatment in patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive in group 1(experimental arm): docetaxel :75 mg/m² IV day 1 every 3 weeks with erlotinib:150 mg/d per os d2-d16 and group 2 (control arm): docetaxel :75 mg/m² IV day 1 every 3 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression. Target sample size is 156. The main of this study is to determine the relevance of the association sequential erlotinib and docetaxel in terms of progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib and Docetaxel in Second Line of Treatment in Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the patient will be randomized in group 1(experimental arm): docetaxel :75 mg/m² IV day 1 every 3 weeks with erlotinib:150 mg/d per os d2-d16 and group 2 (control arm): docetaxel :75 mg/m² IV day 1 every 3 weeks. Assessment during treatment: Physical examination, ECG,: every 3 weeks, laboratory tests: weekly, every 3 weeks pulmonary X-ray .The CT scans:. Measurable targets are assessed by RECIST compared to the beginning of treatment: at 6 weeks (day 42 EVA 2), 12 weeks (D84 EVA 3), 15 weeks (D105 EVA 4: Evaluation of the SSP) and then every 6 weeks until progression. Quality of life will be assessed Day 42 then every 6 weeks during chemotherapy, Tolerability will be assessed at each visit based on CTC v4.0 criteria.</detailed_description>
