	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are 1) to investigate the influence of different fluid regimen (Liberal regimen versus Goal directed therapy regimen) on postoperative outcome such as weight gain, delayed gut function recovery, pneumonia and 2) to ascertain the reliability of USCOM monitoring using serum lactate and base deficit as control parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liberal Versus Goal-directed Intraoperative Fluid Therapy in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liberal regimen = maintenance fluid(4/2/1) + deficit fluid + replacement of third space loss (&gt;,=10ml/kg/h) Goal directed therapy regimen = maintenance fluid + deficit fluid + fluid replaced by hemodynamic monitoring guided.</detailed_description>
