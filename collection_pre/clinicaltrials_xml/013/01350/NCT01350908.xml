	<brief_title>Study of Circulating Tumoral DNA in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Technique development: In a first step, the different available techniques will be evaluated for specificity and sensibility using serial dilutions of cell lines with or without TP53 mutation. Validation: The tumor DNA detection rate will be estimated from patient's blood with ovarian cancer. The investigators will study 25 patients to obtain at least 15 patients bearing a TP53 mutation that could be characterized in the primitive tumor or metastasis. With those 15 patients, the investigators will determine the most sensitive technique and the best cost/efficiency ratio.</detailed_description>
