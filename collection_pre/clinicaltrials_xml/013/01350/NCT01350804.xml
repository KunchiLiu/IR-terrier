	<brief_summary>The core and extension studies assessed the safety and efficacy of secukinumab when added to a background therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are intolerant to or have had an inadequate response to anti-TNF-α agents. Patients received either secukinumab, placebo or abatacept (active comparator). The core study was completed. However, the extension study was prematurely terminated after the primary endpoint analysis of the core study at week 24 had demonstrated numerically higher efficacy for the active comparator abatacept compared to secukinumab.</brief_summary>
