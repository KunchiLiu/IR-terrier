	<brief_title>Three Care Models for Elderly Patients With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture in the elderly is associated with excess mortality of 5 to 20%, and mobility problems that usually results in costly hospital stays and lengthy rehabilitation procedures. With this increase in the aging population, hip fracture represents a major and a fast growing health care problem in Taiwan. Currently, the incidence rate of hip fractures is 10 times of the incidence rate for the general population. Despite the use of advanced treatment, the one-year mortality rate (15.4%) remains significant, and many of the patients never recover completely in terms of activities of daily living functions. Many studies in the United States have proved that elderly patients with hip fracture can benefit from post-operative rehabilitation, early discharge planning programs, or transitional care programs. However, little is known about what intervention should be attempted for these patients and their families in Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and effectiveness of three care models- acute/sub-acute, comprehensive, and routine care models for hip fractured elders in Taiwan.</detailed_description>
