	<brief_title>Clinical and Biochemical Presentation of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in Different Age Group</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent endocrine disorder of reproductive age women, affecting an estimated 9-18% of all women in this age group. To diagnose of PCOS in early life is especially important because it is now thought to increase metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Investigating PCOS is crucial as it is now considered to increase metabolic and cardiovascular risk, thereby impacting the health of women to a much greater extent than previously thought. We are plan using retrospective analysis to evaluate the clinical and biochemical presentation of PCOS in different aged groups.</detailed_description>
