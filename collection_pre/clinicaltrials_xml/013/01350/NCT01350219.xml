	<brief_summary>The translational potential to the clinical applications of cord blood stem cells has increased enormously in recent years, mainly because of its unique advantages including no risk to the donor, no ethical issues, low risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), rapid availability, and large resource worldwide. Human cord blood contains several types of stem cells such as the umbilical cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells (CB-SC). CB-SC possess multiple biological properties including the expression of embryonic stem (ES) cell characteristics, giving rise to different types of cells and immune modulation. Specifically, CB-SC can function as an immune modulator that can lead to control of the immune responses, which could in turn be used as a new approach to overcome the autoimmunity of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in patients1 and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Here, the investigators develop a novel Stem Cell Educator therapy by using CB-SC and explore the therapeutic effectiveness of Educator therapy in T1D patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients were screened for enrollment in the study if both clinical signs and laboratory tests meet the diagnosis standards of American Diabetes Association 2010. Other key inclusion criteria were presence of at least one autoantibody to the pancreatic islet Î² cells. Exclusion criteria were any clinically significant diseases in liver, kidney, and heart. Additional exclusion criteria were no pregnancy, no immunosuppressive medication, no viral diseases or diseases associated with immunodeficiency.</criteria>
