	<detailed_description>Each eligible patient will be screened from de SHCS database. Each refusal and drop-out will be documented. A pre-visit (V-1) will be scheduled for informed consent, V0 for inclusion (V-1 and V0 may occur on the same day), V1 one month post-inclusion and V2 4 to 7 months post-inclusion. V0, V1 and V2 will be planned during regular medical visits. Eligible patients either get their cART in their usual pharmacy according to standard of care, or take part in a routine adherence-enhancing program(adherence subgroup)run by the pharmacists of the outpatient medical clinic. In the adherence subgroup, adherence is assessed electronically by MEMS (Medication event monitoring system) monitors on a regular basis.</detailed_description>
