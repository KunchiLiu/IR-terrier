	<brief_title>Weaning Using Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation by Means of Helmet in Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical efficacy of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been demonstrated. Interest has emerged in using NPPV to facilitate earlier removal of an endotracheal tube and decrease complications associated with prolonged intubation. Studies assessing NPPV in weaning are not enough and generally are performed with face masks as device for NPPV. This study assesses the efficacy of helmet as device for NPPV during weaning from mechanical ventilation in an ICU and compares this procedure with invasive mechanical complication (IMV) by analyzing respiratory parameters, clinical course and complications.</detailed_description>
