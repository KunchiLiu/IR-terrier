	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a cross sectional study intended to be conducted at each of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Units (AMTUs) newly participating in ATN III and to enroll all participating patients followed at each site. This approach will allow for the examination of the broad spectrum of youth participating in the ATN, including those newly entered into care. Psychosocial and risk-taking behavioral data will be collected using Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) for English-speaking participants, or a paper-and-pencil Spanish-language survey with identical measures to the ACASI for Spanish-speaking participants; biomedical information will be collected through medical chart abstraction.</detailed_description>
