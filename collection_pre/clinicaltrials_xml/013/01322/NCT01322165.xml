	<brief_summary>The National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC) was initiated in 2006 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). GenTAC established a registry of 3706 patients with genetic conditions that may be related to thoracic aortic aneurysms and collected medical data and biologic samples. The study ended in September 2016. Data and samples are available from NHLBI and requests should be made to BioLINCC. See the NHLBI website for more information: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/resources/gentac/.</brief_summary>
