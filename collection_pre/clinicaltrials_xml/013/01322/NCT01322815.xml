	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of GI-4000 and see what effects (good and bad) it has against cancer over time. This study is also being done to measure the immune response to GI-4000. Study drug will be given in addition to a standard of care which is a standard therapy given to patients with your type of cancer (colon).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial of GI-4000 Plus Bevacizumab and Either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject visits will occur 1-4 weeks prior to initiation of GI-4000, then - In newly diagnosed (Group A) patients, at every FOLFOX/FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab visit, bevacizumab and GI-4000 dosing visit, GI-4000 dosing visit and then quarterly after completion of therapy - In patients with stable disease who have completed a first line therapy with an oxaliplatin or irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab containing regimen (Group B), at every bevacizumab and GI-4000 dosing visit, GI-4000 dosing visit and then quarterly after completion of therapy Group A patients (N=26) will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of first line therapy with bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX (N=13) or FOLFIRI (N=13) - Subjects will receive 1 40 yeast units (YU) dose of GI-4000 prior to initiation of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, then intercycle doses of GI-4000 will be given 7 days after each cycle while first line therapy is given (up to 8 cycles) - After completion of first line therapy, subjects will enter the maintenance phase in which bevacizumab and GI-4000 will be given concurrently every 2 weeks for as long as therapy can be tolerated or until progression - If a subject discontinues bevacizumab therapy due to intolerance, the subject will continue GI-4000 every 2 weeks until progression, intolerance or withdrawal from the study Group B patients (N=26) with stable disease who have completed a first line therapy with an oxaliplatin or irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab containing regimen ) will enter the trial prior to receiving therapy with bevacizumab - Subjects will receive 40 yeast unit (YU) GI-4000 concurrently with each bevacizumab dose for as long as therapy can be tolerated or until progression - If a subject discontinues bevacizumab therapy due to intolerance, the subject will continue GI-4000 every 2 weeks until progression, intolerance or withdrawal from the study</detailed_description>
