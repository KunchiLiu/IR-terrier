	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient nasal outcome following endo-nasal surgery. This type of surgery is conducted for pituitary and skull base tumors. There is no published data on trauma to the nose during surgery and how it impacts nasal functioning. The investigators propose to develop a survey and administer it to patients before and after surgery to learn about their perception of nasal functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Barrow Nasal Inventory Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 9-item patient survey (the ASK Nasal Inventory) focusing on the most common postoperative complaints, such as crusting, sinusitis, pain, and ease of breathing, was developed by the anterior skull base team at the Barrow Neurological Institute. Content was validated in structured patient interviews by four subject-matter experts with both endonasal and control groups. Eligible patients for the control group included patients undergoing any neurosurgical procedure requiring anesthesia that did not involve the endonasal corridor, such as spinal decompression procedures, craniotomies for trigeminal neuralgia, and shunting procedures. This survey was self-administered pre- and 3 months post-surgery.</detailed_description>
