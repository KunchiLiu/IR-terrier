	<brief_summary>Elective open aortic aneurysm repair has an overall reported 30 day mortality of 2-6 percent, but in patients more than 65-70 years the mortality is reported to be more than 10 percent. The phenomenon of acute lung injury (ALI)/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after infra renal abdominal aneurysm repair caused by ischemia-reperfusion is well established. The degree of disability varies from a light degree of acute respiratory failure to mortality for patients with the same profile of risk. Primary aim is to develop a model that monitors inflammatory marker molecules collected from the bronchial epithelial lining fluid by microdialysis. The method with examination of the bronchial epithelial lining fluid by microdialysis and analysis of multiple inflammation markers as previously done by the investigators group.</brief_summary>
