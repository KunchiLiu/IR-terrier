	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: a new, low polymerization stress flowable composite performs no differently to a conventional, highly filled composite filling material when used as a restorative in small cavities in back teeth. Study will evaluate the clinical performance of a low shrinking flowable composite filling material, compared with a conventional, highly filled composite restorative when used to permanently fill small cavities in molar and premolar teeth in adult patients.</brief_summary>
