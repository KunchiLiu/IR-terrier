	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Etching the enamel followed by use of a self-etching adhesive on enamel and dentin is as effective as a one-step etch and rinse approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of a Self-etch Adhesive Using a Selective Etch Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is scant evidence available on the performance of self-etching dental adhesive systems. This study aims to clinically evaluate a self-etch adhesive used either with an extra enamel etching step, or in a self-etch stand alone technique with no extra enamel etch.</detailed_description>
