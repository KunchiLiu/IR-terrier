	<brief_summary>Study Objective: To investigate potential drug-drug interactions (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) of morphine and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Drug Interactions of Aspirin and P2Y12-inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Opiates reduce the intestinal resorption of orally administered drugs such as paracetamol. Because morphine is often injected to relieve pain in patients with myocardial infarction, it is of particular interest if morphine may decrease the rate of absorption of antiplatelet drugs. Results of this study will provide essential information for the use of morphine and antiplatelet drugs in clinical practice, in particular in myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
