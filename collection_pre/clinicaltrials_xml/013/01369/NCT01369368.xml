	<brief_summary>Patients with relapse of acute leukemia often only receive supportive therapy. Our hypothesis is that a combination therapy can stabilize the disease for patients with early relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The investigators will combine 5-azacitidine 100 mg daily subcutaneously (days 1-3), valproic acid (continuous therapy from day 1), All-trans retinoic acid (days 1-14) and hydroxurea (continuous treatment from day 15 of first cycle. Azacitidine and ATRA can be repeated with 5 weeks intervals, donor leukocyte infusions on day 10 is allowed from the second cycle.</brief_summary>
