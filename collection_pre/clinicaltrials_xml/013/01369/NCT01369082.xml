	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide patients who have received at least one islet transplant as a previous participant in a Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium (CIT) clinical trial with maintenance immunosuppressive medications and to collect information about the safety of the medications and islet function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended Follow-Up After Islet Transplantation in T1D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After islet-cell transplantation in the CIT studies*, each subject receives maintenance immunosuppressive medications. The purpose of this protocol is to collect additional follow-up for safety and efficacy from CIT subjects with graft function after their completion in their CIT parent study. It is expected that most subjects will retain measurable islet function and, in the islet-alone studies, continue to receive immunosuppressive medications at the time of completing their CIT parent study. *CIT parent studies: CIT02 (NCT00464555), CIT03 (NCT00434850), CIT04 (NCT00468403), CIT05 (NCT00468442), CIT06 (NCT00468117), and CIT07 (NCT00434811)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who have received an islet transplant during participation in the following Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) parent studies: CIT02 (NCT00464555), CIT03 (NCT00434850), CIT04 (NCT00468403), CIT05 (NCT00468442), CIT06 (NCT00468117), and CIT07 (NCT00434811) A functioning pancreatic islet graft (e.g., absence of graft failure as defined in parent study) requiring immunosuppression Willingness of participants to continue to use an approved method of contraception during and 4 months after study participation Ability to provide written informed consent Resident of the United States of America Documentation of the existence or lack of health insurance coverage and whether immunosuppressants are covered. For female subjectsPositive pregnancy test, presently breastfeeding, or unwillingness to use effective contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and 4 months after discontinuation For male subjectsIntent to procreate during the duration of the study or within 4 months after discontinuation or unwillingness to use effective measures of contraception. Oral contraceptives, Norplant®, DepoProvera®, and barrier devices with spermicide are acceptable contraceptive methods; condoms used alone are not acceptable. Received an islet transplant in a nonCIT research study Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with safe participation in the trial.</criteria>
