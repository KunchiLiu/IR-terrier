	<brief_summary>Moderate exercise is thought to be one of the best known means to improve how insulin works in people. Taking vitamin C and vitamin E is also thought to have the same effect. This study is being done to see if taking vitamin C and vitamin E improves or hinders how insulin works when people do not exercise and when they do exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Vitamin E and Vitamin C and Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to determine in humans whether anti-oxidant supplementation with ascorbate (vitamin C) or R,R,R-Î±-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) improves insulin sensitivity in the untrained state but blocks exercise-induced increases in insulin sensitivity and other adaptations to exercise. The results will provide new information on the roles of anti-oxidant supplementation in modifying insulin sensitivity, and will inform guidelines for anti-oxidant supplementation as an adjunct to exercise.</detailed_description>
