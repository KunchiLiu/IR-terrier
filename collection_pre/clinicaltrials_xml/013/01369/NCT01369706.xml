	<brief_summary>Patients with implanted pacemaker (PM) or cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) systems are restrained in daily life by possible electromagnetic interference (EMI). Case reports suggest EMI between PM or ICD systems and hand-held metal detectors that are intensively used as part of security screening processes in e.g. airport controls. The objective was to determine the safety of screening procedures for ferrous materials with regard to possible in vivo EMI between hand-held metal detectors and PM and ICD systems.</brief_summary>
