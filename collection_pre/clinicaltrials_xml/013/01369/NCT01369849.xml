	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt) inhibitor MK2206 when given together with bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving Akt inhibitor MK2206 with bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab may be an effective treatment for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206, Bendamustine Hydrochloride, and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in combination therapy with bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride)-rituximab in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients. (Phase I) II. To assess the rate of complete response (CR) of MK-2206 in combination with bendamustine-rituximab in relapsed CLL or SLL patients. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess clinical efficacy of MK-2206 in combination with bendamustine-rituximab as demonstrated by analysis of overall response rate (CR, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi], clinical complete response [CCR], near partial response [nPR] and partial response [PR]), duration of response, and treatment free survival. II. To assess the toxicity profile of MK-2206 in combination with bendamustine-rituximab. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluation of whether the established CLL prognostic factors (cluster of differentiation [CD]38, CD49d, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable [IGHV], fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 [ZAP-70]) predict responses to the combination therapy of MK2206, with bendamustine-rituximab. II. Minimal residual disease will be evaluated after treatment in patients who achieve a clinical response; minimal residual disease (MRD) status will be explored in relation to both the quality and duration of response. III. Evaluation of the effects of the addition of MK-2206 to bendamustine-rituximab on B cell receptor initiated, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt downstream signal pathways, apoptosis analysis and leukemic cell activation status, as well as multiple cytokine profiles and key gene expression analysis with focus on leukemic cells. IV. Evaluation of marrow stromal cells (MSC)-CLL biology including the effects of the addition of MK-2206 to bendamustine-rituximab on CLL marrow stromal cell (MSC) proliferation, migration and cytokine production, as well as the adhesion capacity between MSC and leukemic cells. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK2206 followed by a phase II study. Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 of course 1); rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (day 8 of course 1); and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-2 (days 8-9 of course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days (35 days for course 1 and 84 days for course 6) for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 or 12 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
