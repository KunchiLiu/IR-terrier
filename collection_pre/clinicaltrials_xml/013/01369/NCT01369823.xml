	<brief_title>Diabetes Multicenter Observational Study (DIAMOND-1-)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 100 subjects, users of Paradigm 522/722 Infusion Pump and Self- Monitoring Blood Glucose finger sticks for the control of their glucose levels for at least 3 months prior enrollment will participate. Moreover the subjects won't have achieved the best blood glucose control, with an average HbA1c above 7% and should meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The HbA1c value for screening purposes can be taken from the medical chart, while in the enrollment visit according to current medical practice of each investigational center, the sample taken for HbA1c measurement will be analyzed centrally by HPLC, in a lab in Germany. In all enrolled patients a continuous glucose monitoring system will be provided. Since this is an observational study, the provision of the glucose monitoring system will be based on medical justification and will not be done per protocol requirement. All subjects will be followed for 3 months according to the current medical practice of each investigational center. All other visits, e.g. patient comes into the hospital because of symptoms, will also be recorded as unscheduled visits. These visits are usually linked to Adverse Events.</detailed_description>
