Male and female patients aged 6 to 17 years, inclusive, who completed the 4week study drug treatment in study OTR3001 and who, based on the investigator's judgment, will benefit from continuing treatment with oxycodone HCl CR 20 to 240 mg/day for the management of moderate to severe malignant or nonmalignant pain; 2. Patients must have tolerated the oxycodone HCl CR therapy in OTR3001 as demonstrated at the start of the study; 3. Patients must be willing and able to swallow the oxycodone HCl CR tablets whole.

Patients requiring opioid at doses equivalent to &lt; 20 mg/day or &gt; 240 mg/day oxycodone for treatment of their malignant or nonmalignant pain; 4.
