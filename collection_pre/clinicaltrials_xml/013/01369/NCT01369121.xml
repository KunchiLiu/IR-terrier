	<brief_title>Tolerability Study of Xerecept® in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Steroid-related side effects are much more severe in a pediatric population than they are in adults. The side effects appear more quickly and are often apparent in as few as 14 days. Dexamethasone side effects in children include rounding of the face, acne, increased body hair, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, mood changes, weight gain, fluid retention, glucose instability, high blood pressure, increased susceptibility to infection, stunted growth and aseptic necrosis of the hip joints14-16. Although extensive studies have been performed with Xerecept® in adults, no studies have been performed with Xerecept® in pediatric subjects. Therefore, this study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xerecept® in children with central nervous system tumors and to identify appropriate doses of Xerecept® to be used in subsequent pediatric clinical trials. The study will also explore if Xerecept®, when administered to pediatric patients, is effective in allowing decreases in dexamethasone dosing</detailed_description>
