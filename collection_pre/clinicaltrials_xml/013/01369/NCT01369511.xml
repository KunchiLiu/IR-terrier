	<criteria>Males with a female partner of childbearing potential should use contraception during the treatment period of the trial and up to 15 weeks after the last dose of investigational product Females should be of nonchild bearing potential Elective total hip arthroplasty (eTHA) is scheduled Have a body mass index of &lt;40 kilogram per square meter (kg/ mÂ²) and a weight &lt;136.4 kg Can climb at least 6 stairs with or without holding the handrail (but without human assistance), according to the participant at screening Can stand up from a chair and walk more than 10 meters without human assistance Take at least 12 seconds to perform the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test at screening Another inpatient surgical procedure is planned in the 6 months following randomization Lower extremity amputation Lower limb fracture within 6 months prior to screening or any major lower limb surgery within 3 months prior to randomization Simultaneous bilateral eTHA The planned surgical procedure will preclude weight bearing for at least 4 weeks postoperatively (for instance, the planned procedure will involve extensive bone grafting). "Partial weight bearing" and "weight bearing as tolerated" are acceptable, but "non weightbearing," "touch weight bearing," or "feather weight bearing" are exclusive Underlying muscle disease (for example, polymyositis or muscular dystrophy) or a history of muscle disease other than ageassociated muscle waste or disuse atrophy Recent neurologic injury (&lt;6 months prior to randomization) such as stroke or spinal cord injury, or unstable neurologic disorders that are likely to confound physical performance tests during the course of the study (such as unstable Parkinson disease or hemiplegia) History of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Current use or previous use of any drugs known to influence muscle mass or performance within 6 months prior to randomization (this includes anabolic steroids, replacement therapy for gonadal deficiency,antiandrogens, luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone [LHRH] agonist and antagonists, growth hormone, InsulinLike Growth Factor 1 [IGF1], or creatinine supplements), or systemic corticosteroid use for at least 3 months (in the last year) prior to randomization at a daily dose greater than or equal to 10 milligram (mg) prednisone equivalent Severe Vitamin D deficiency defined as 25hydroxyvitamin D levels &lt;9.2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) or &lt;23 nanomole per milliliter (nmol/mL) at screening History of a malignant neoplasm in the 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of superficial basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively treated. Participants with carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix treated definitively more than 1 year prior to screening may enter the study History of any of the following conditions within 90 days of screening: Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous coronary intervention (eg, angioplasty or stent placement) Any current supraventricular arrhythmia with an uncontrolled ventricular response (mean heart rate &gt;100 beats per minute [bpm]) at rest despite medical or device therapy, or any history of spontaneous or induced sustained ventricular tachycardia (heart rate &gt;100 bpm for 30 seconds) despite medical or device therapy, or any history of resuscitated cardiac arrest or the presence of an automatic internal cardioverterdefibrillator Any history of congestive heart failure within 6 months of screening Systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or &lt;90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 or &lt;50 mm Hg at screening, or malignant hypertension An abnormality in the locally read 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that in the opinion of the investigator increases the risk of participating in the study Have either or both of the following: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or alkaline phosphatase &gt;1.5 times ULN, or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN. Known history or presence of severe acute or chronic liver disease History of significant renal insufficiency, defined as receiving renal dialysis or having an estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 milliliter per minute (mL/minute) at screening Current evidence or recent history of significant psychiatric disease such as dementia/Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days (or 5 half lives whichever is longer) from a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or offlabel use of a drug, or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Regularly uses known drugs of abuse and/or shows positive findings on urinary drug screening (physician prescribed narcotics are allowed) Have a positive fecal occult blood (FOB) test at screening or the participant cannot provide a stool sample for FOB testing prior to randomization Have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Have had ocular trauma, opthalmologic surgery, or eye laser treatment within 6 months prior to randomization</criteria>
