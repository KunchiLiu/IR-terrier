	<brief_summary>Term and near term newborns can present acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Surfactant treatment has been shown effective in reducing mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment durations in the preterm newborn. Whether surfactant treatment is beneficial for term and near term newborns is unknown. The purpose of this study is to compare surfactant treatment vs. nasal continuous positive airways pressure in the newborn between 35 and 41 weeks of gestation with RDS within the first 24 hours of life. The study's primary endpoint is "survival with no oxygen treatment at 72 hours of life". The secondary endpoints are: death, surfactant treatment, pneumothorax, secondary infections, pulmonary hypertension, inhaled nitric oxide treatment, fluid loading treatment, vasopressive amines treatment, mechanical ventilation duration, nCPAP treatment duration, Oxygen treatment duration, Oxygen treatment at 28 days of life, hospitalization duration and treatment strategy cost.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Newborn between 35 and 41 weeks of gestation with RDS within the first 24 hours of life, treated with nCPAP and a FiO2 ≥ 30% are eligible. Randomisation is stratified by centre and 2 age groups (35-36 weeks of gestation and 37-41 weeks ogf gestation). One arm will receive surfactant treatment after tracheal intubation. The second arm will continue nCPAP. A rescue treatment is used in the second arm if FiO2 &gt; 60%. In each arm the newborn is weaned from mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment as soon as possible. The primary outcome of the study is the success of the procedure defined as "survival without any oxygen treatment" at 72 hours of life.</detailed_description>
