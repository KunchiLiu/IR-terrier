	<brief_summary>The adhesive capsulitis is a disease of the shoulder characterized by pain and limitation of movement amplitude. It is defined as for etiology, having discordant theories that related it to an inflammatory condition or to an algoneurodystrophy process. There is not yet a consensus about the best option of treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, where the mechanism of action is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The antidepressants have been increasingly used in the control of chronic pain and the major action mechanism to have the analgesic effect seems to be based on inhibition of neurotransmitters reuptake noradrenaline and/or serotonin) in nerve cell endings. Literature studies associate the practice of the nerve suprascapular blockade with anaesthetics to good results of clinical improvement of the pain, however, so far, no clinical studies comparing the efficacy of the non-steroidal antiinflammatories or tricyclic antidepressants to nervous blockage were registered in the acute treatment of adhesive capsulitis.</brief_summary>
