	<brief_summary>The national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Guinea-Bissau focuses its efforts exclusively on children below 12 months of age; children who have reached 12 months of age are no longer entitled to vaccines through the EPI program. This has affected the measles vaccination coverage, approx. 30% of the children in the rural area do not receive measles vaccine (MV). Studies from the Bandim Health Project (BHP) have shown that MV has a profound impact on survival, reducing mortality by approximately 50% - far more than can be explained by prevention of measles deaths. Hence, MV seems to have non-specific beneficial effects on survival, and the current policy may have important consequences for overall child mortality. To test the implications of the current policy of only vaccinating children below 12 months of age, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial, in which children will receive their vaccines according to the current national EPI policy (National policy) or receive MV regardless of age and whether some doses of MV may be lost (MV-for-all policy). The investigators hypothesise that among children enrolled after 12 months of age, mortality is 50% lower in children randomised to receive MV compared with children randomised to follow the national policy and not receive MV.</brief_summary>
