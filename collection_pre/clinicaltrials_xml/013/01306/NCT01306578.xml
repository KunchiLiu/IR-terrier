	<brief_title>Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) Versus Plasma Exchange (PE) for Ventilated Children With Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) admitted to PICU at Mansoura University Children Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt with the need for mechanical ventilation were prospectively enrolled in the study. Cases were diagnosed according to clinical criteria. The decisions to initiate, wean and terminate mechanical ventilation were made independently by the attending consultant in accordance with the unit guidelines. Outcome variables measured were duration of mechanical ventilation, length of PICU stay and ability to walk unaided 4 weeks after PICU discharge.</detailed_description>
