	<brief_summary>Background: - The experimental cancer treatment drug ABT-888 (Veliparib) works by preventing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair in tumor cells. Cyclophosphamide is a cancer treatment drug that works by causing DNA damage in cells, including cancer cells, resulting in cell death. However, because cyclophosphamide has strong and unpleasant side effects, researchers are interested in finding drugs that can be given in combination with cyclophosphamide that will allow a lower dose of cyclophosphamide to be given with similar effects. The combination of ABT-88 and cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for some types of cancer, such as certain kinds of breast or ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that often do not respond to standard therapies. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide in ovarian and breast cancer and in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with (1) (Breast cancer 1/2) BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer; (2) triple-negative breast cancer (not responsive to hormone-related therapy); or (3) low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Design: - Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will be divided into two groups with different treatment subgroups. - Group 1: Participants who have BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer - Participants will receive either the combination of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide alone. - Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day for 21-day cycles of treatment, and will keep a diary to record drug doses and any side effects. - Participants will have clinic visits with blood and urine tests, imaging studies, and other examinations on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 of cycle 1, and on the first day of all other cycles. - Group 2: Participants who have triple-negative breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - Participants will receive either the combination of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide alone. - Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day for 21-day cycles of treatment, and will keep a diary to record drug doses and any side effects. - Participants will have clinic visits with blood and urine tests, imaging studies, and other examinations on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 of cycle 1, and on the first day of all other cycles. - Participants receiving only cyclophosphamide who show signs of disease progression after tumor imaging studies can receive the combination of ABT-888 with cyclophosphamide. - Treatment will continue as long as participants tolerate the drugs and the disease does not progress.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II ABT-888 With Cyclophosphamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is critical for maintaining genomic stability by regulating a variety of DNA repair mechanisms. - Individuals with deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers due to impaired or defective DNA damage repair; these individuals have an increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging agents and PARP inhibitors. Inhibition of PARP inhibits the repair of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide. - Metronomic cyclophosphamide has demonstrated efficacy in several tumor types. The PARP inhibitor ABT-888 has been shown to potentiate the action of cyclophosphamide in xenograft models. This combination is well tolerated in a Phase I study and showing promising activity. Objectives: - Compare the response rate (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) of the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide to the response rate (CR+PR) of metronomic oral cyclophosphamide in patients with deleterious BRCA mutations and refractory ovarian cancer or patients with primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma or fallopian tube cancer. - Compare the response rate (CR+PR) of the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide to the response rate (CR+PR) of single-agent oral cyclophosphamide in patients with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer, stratified for deleterious BRCA mutation. - Compare the response rate (CR+PR) of the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide to the response rate (CR+PR) of single-agent metronomic oral cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory low-grade lymphomas. Secondary Objectives: - Determine PAR levels in tumor biopsies, evaluate in archival tissue whether patients tumors have mutations in genes involved in DNA damage repair (e.g., BRCA/Fanconi anemia/protein 53 (p53)), perform exploratory gene expression profiling to correlate PARP messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels or BRCA mutation status with response to therapy, count circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and determine H2AX levels in CTCs and tumor biopsies (National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical center only). Eligibility: -Adults with refractory BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma, fallopian tube cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, or low-grade lymphoid malignancies (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) whose disease has progressed following at least one line of therapy. Study Design: - This is a randomized, multi-histology Phase II trial with patients enrolled into 3 cohorts: BRCA-positive ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma or fallopian tube cancer (A); triple-negative breast cancer (B); or low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (C). Patients in cohort A will be randomized to the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide or metronomic oral cyclophosphamide alone. Patients in cohort B will be randomized to the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide or metronomic oral cyclophosphamide alone. Patients in cohort C will be randomized to the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide or metronomic oral cyclophosphamide alone. - Cyclophosphamide (50 mg) and ABT-888 (60 mg) will be administered orally once a day, continuously in 21-day cycles.</detailed_description>

Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a Phase 0 study, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities. Patients who have had prior treatment with any PARP inhibitors are eligible unless the PARP inhibitor was administered in combination with cyclophosphamide. Patients with bone metastases or hypercalcemia on bisphosphonate treatment are eligible to participate Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of ABT888 in patients less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric Phase I combination trials. Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70%. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

The effects of ABT888 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because cyclophosphamide hydrochloride is known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (abstinence; female use of hormonal methods, or barrier methods of birth control; male use of a condom) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of study. Because there is a risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cyclophosphamide, breastfeeding should be discontinued while the patient is on this trial and for 30 days after completion of treatment on this trial. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients with germ cell and borderline ovarian epithelial tumors. Patients who have received prior cyclophosphamide should not be excluded solely because of receiving prior cyclophosphamide. Patients with history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases who have received treatment and who have been on stable doses of antiseizure medicine and had no seizures x 3 months will be eligible. Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded. Subjects with ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel obstruction are also excluded, as are any patients who cannot swallow the capsule whole. Capsules must not be crushed or chewed; nasogastric or gastrostomy tube (Gtube) administration is not allowed.
