	<brief_summary>Niemann Pick Syndrome Type C is a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by a pathological overload of cells with unesterified cholesterol as a result of impaired lipid transport into the cell, has still the problem of the difficulties of a simple and reliable analysis for the primary diagnosis but also for the follow-up of the disease. Therefore the primary aim of our project called "BioNPC" is the development of a new plasma biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of the disease. The secondary aim is the testing for clinical robustness, specificity and long-term stability of the biomarker. Within the scope of the study the investigators would like to collect in the next 12 months from about 80 patient's plasma and parallel a simple documentation of the clinical data.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lipid storage disease that can present in infants, children, or adults. Neonates can present with ascites and severe liver disease from infiltration of the liver and/or respiratory failure from infiltration of the lungs. Other infants, without liver or pulmonary disease, have hypotonia and developmental delay. The classic presentation occurs in mid-to-late childhood with the insidious onset of ataxia, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP), and dementia. Dystonia and seizures are common. Dysarthria and dysphagia eventually become disabling, making oral feeding impossible; death usually occurs in the late second or third decade from aspiration pneumonia. Adults are more likely to present with dementia or psychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of NPC is confirmed by biochemical testing that demonstrates impaired cholesterol esterification and positive fillipin staining in cultured fibroblasts. Biochemical testing for carrier status is unreliable. Most individuals with NPC have NPC1, caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene; fewer than 20 individuals have been diagnosed with NPC2, caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene. Molecular genetic testing of the NPC1 genes detects disease-causing mutations in approximately 94% of individuals with NPC. Such testing is available clinically. NPC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. The phenotype (i.e., age of onset and severity of symptoms) usually runs true in families. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible when the two disease-causing mutations have been identified in the family. Since the only accepted and easily accessible lab test, Fillipin staining of skin fibroblasts, is invasive and has a rather low sensitivity and specificity and genetic sequencing is tome-consuming and expensive there is an urgent need for the improvement of diagnostic biomarkers. New methods, like mass-spectometry give a good chance to characterize in the blood (plasma) of affected patents specific metabolic alterations that allow to diagnose in the future the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. The development of new biochemical markers from the plasma of the affected patients is the goal of the study.</detailed_description>
