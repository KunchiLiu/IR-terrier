	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Combined Parent-student Programme for Smoking Prevention in Berlin Schools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hazardous health effects of smoking and second hand smoke are well known and published. Despite wide spread tobacco prevention campaigns and initiatives, the proportion of children and adolescents who smoke remains high, especially in Germany. Current research indicates that comprehensive strategies, especially with a parental involvement component, appear to be the most effective school-based smoking prevention programs. A popular smoking prevention program in the city of Berlin is the Karuna interactive show jumping course "Still smoking or already alive?" ("Rauchst du noch oder lebst du schon?" Mitmach - Parcours). This parcours was designed to teach facts about smoking and its health-damaging effects, its negative effects on physical appearance, to promote communication and to enhance participants' awareness of social pressure and their self-efficacy to deal with these situations. No study to date has evaluated its effectiveness in reducing smoking rates among participating students. The study aim is to test the effectiveness of an interactive combined student-parent intervention in 7th graders regarding the reduction of smoking rates among secondary school children aged 12-15 compared to no smoking prevention intervention using self-reported questionnaires. In addition, it will be tested whether the program that involves the combination of a student and a parent intervention is more effective in the reduction of smoking rates in comparison to a program without a parental intervention.</detailed_description>
