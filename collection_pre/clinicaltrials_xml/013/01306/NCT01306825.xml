	<brief_summary>Bone and joint infections are commonly due to Gram-positive bacteria. Treatment of these infections is difficult because of the need of prolonged duration of antimicrobial agents in combination with surgical procedure. Moreover, in recent years, a growing resistance pattern to various antimicrobial agents has been observed for Gram-positive bacteria. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new drugs with high bone penetration for the treatment of those infections. The investigators hypothesized that daptomycin allow to achieve high concentrations in bone compartments.</brief_summary>
