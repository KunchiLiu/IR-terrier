	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Kinetics and Efficacy Study of Hoodia Gordonii Purified Extract (PYM50717)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two stage randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, kinetics and efficacy of twice-daily repeat intake of formulated Hoodia gordonii purified extract (H.g.PE) (PYM50717) administered twice daily for 2 or 15 days to healthy, overweight females aged 18 to 50 years with a body fat of 25-45%. Stage 1 (pilot): Placebo controlled, double blind comparison to assess the effect of timing of product administration (i.e. breakfast and lunch vs breakfast and dinner). Stage 2 (main study): Placebo controlled double blind comparison with product administered with breakfast and dinner. A total of 64 subjects were included in this study; stage 1: n=15, stage 2: n=49. Treatment groups in stage 2 were matched for percentage body fat. Stage 1: - H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and lunch (n = 4). - Placebo product, twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and lunch (n = 3). - H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and dinner (n = 5). - Placebo product, twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and dinner (n = 3). Stage 2: - H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice daily (n=25)for 15 days - Placebo product , twice daily (n=24),for 15 days</detailed_description>
