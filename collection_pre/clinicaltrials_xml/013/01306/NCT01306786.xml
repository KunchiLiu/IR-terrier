	<brief_title>Five Days Quadruple and Clarithromycin Containing Triple Therapy as Treatment for Helicobacter Pylori Eradication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients with H pylori infection were randomized to receive either five-day QUAD (esomeprazole 20mg b.d., bismuth subcitrate 120mg q.i.d., tetracycline 250mg q.i.d. and metronidazole 250mg q.i.d.) or EAC (esomeprazole 20mg b.d., amoxicillin 1g b.d. and clarithromycin 500mg b.d.). H. pylori status was rechecked by 13C urea breath test 8 weeks after treatment. Patients who failed their respective therapy were invited to undergo H. pylori susceptibility testing and crossover to receive the alternative regimen for the same duration.</detailed_description>
