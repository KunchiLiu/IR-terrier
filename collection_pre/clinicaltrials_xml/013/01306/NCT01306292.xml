	<brief_summary>This is an intra-subject crossover comparative safety study to evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) bolus injection of SonoVue on pulmonary hemodynamics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of SonoVue on Pulmonary Hemodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be divided into two groups based on their baseline mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Each subject will receive two injections in randomized order during right heart catheterization: one administration of SonoVue and one administration of placebo, either SonoVue followed by Placebo or Placebo followed by SonoVue. The purpose is to provide direct evidence on the presence or absence of pulmonary hemodynamic effect following IV administration of SonoVue versus any effects following IV administration of the same volume of placebo.</detailed_description>
