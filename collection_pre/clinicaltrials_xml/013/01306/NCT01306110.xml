	<brief_title>Screening for Liver Fibrosis by Using Non-invasive Methods in Patients With Diabetes. A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with diabetes are at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leading to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. However, liver fibrosis screening in this large population needs non-invasive methods. Recently, FibroScan was shown to be a good method for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients. We examined the efficacy of a screening strategy with a noninvasive fibrosis biomarker (FibroTest) and transient elastography (FibroScan) in patients with diabetes.</detailed_description>
