	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy on the nasal congestion of a twice-daily fexofenadine HCl 60 mg - pseudoephedrine HCl 60 mg combination (FEX60/PSE60) and fexofenadine HCl 60 mg - pseudoephedrine HCl 120 mg combination (FEX60/PSE120) versus fexofenadine HCl 60 mg (FEX60) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the efficacy of a twice-daily FEX60/PSE60 and FEX60/PSE120 versus FEX60 on nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), eye symptom, and daily activity impairment. - To assess the safety of a twice-daily FEX60/PSE60 and FEX60/PSE120 versus FEX60.</brief_summary>
