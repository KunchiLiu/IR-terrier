	<brief_summary>The standard heart-lung machine is a major trigger of systemic inflammatory reactions, hemodilution, coagulopathy or organ failure. The strict reduction of blood-artificial surface and blood-air contact might represent meaningful improvements of the extracorporeal technology with respect to organ preservation. The aim of this study is the evaluation of potential differences between a minimal extracorporeal circuit (MECC) and a conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (MOPS) system.</brief_summary>
