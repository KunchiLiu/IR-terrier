	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study of tivozanib administered in combination with capecitabine. During the dose-escalation portion, sequential cohorts of subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in order to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is not reached, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. In the expansion cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast or colon cancer will be enrolled at MTD (or RP2D) to further evaluate safety and activity of this combination in these tumor types.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Tivozanib (AV-951) in Combination With Capecitabine (Xeloda®) in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of orally administered tivozanib in combination with capecitabine to approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid tumors and, in the expanded MTD cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast or colorectal cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic, and antineoplastic activity. The number of cohorts evaluated and the maximum doses to be administered will depend upon the observed tolerability. Dose level "0", tivozanib HCl 1.5 mg and capecitabine 1000 mg/m² BID, is the starting dose level. Once assigned to a cohort, each subject will continue to be treated at the same dose level and schedule throughout the course of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 18 years or older, of either sex, and of any race. 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy. 3. Dose escalation cohorts: Advanced solid tumor malignancy (locally advanced or metastatic) that has recurred or progressed following standard therapy or for which no standard therapy currently exists, or for which subject is not a candidate for standard therapy, or is unwilling to undergo standard therapy. 4. MTD expansion cohort: Subjects must have locally advanced or metastatic breast or colorectal cancer with or without prior systemic therapy. 5. ECOG performance ≤ 2 (Appendix B) and life expectancy ≥ 3 months. 6. Disease that is not amenable to curative surgical intervention, due to either nonresectability of the tumor or medical contraindications. 7. Subjects enrolled in the MTD expansion cohort must have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0. 8. At least 4 weeks since : • Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor directed therapy Chemotherapy (6 weeks since prior mitomycin C or nitrosoureas) Immunotherapy (eg, IL2, IFN, etc.) or biological therapy (eg, monoclonal antibodies) Investigational agents 9. At least 2 weeks since: Systemic hormonal therapy (with the exception of hormone replacement therapy or low dose steroid therapy as described in Drugs and Treatments to be Excluded) Herbal preparations (including daily multivitamin/mineral supplements containing herbal components) 10. At least 2 weeks since prior radiotherapy to ≤ 25% of bone marrow, or at least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy to &gt; 25% of bone marrow. 11. If female and of child bearing potential, documentation of negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment. 12. Sexually active premenopausal female subjects (and female partners of male subjects) must use adequate contraceptive measures, while on study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. All fertile subjects (and their partners) must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception. Effective birth control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm). (Note: Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are not considered effective for this study.) 13. Adequate hematologic function as evidenced by Hg ≥ 9g/dL, WBC ≥ 3000 per mm3, ANC ≥ 1500 per mm3 and platelet count ≥ 100,000 per mm3. 14. Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by a serum bilirubin level ≤1.5 × ULN (except with known Gilbert's Syndrome) and serum AST/ALT levels ≤2.5 × ULN (or ≤5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastasis). 15. Adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 × ULN (subjects with a serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 x ULN with a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min according to CockcroftGault equation will be eligible). 16. Proteinuria ≤3+ by urinalysis or urine dipstick (subjects with proteinuria &gt;3 + may undergo a 24hour urine protein and will be eligible if protein is &lt;2 g/24hrs) 17. Adequate coagulation parameters: PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN and INR ≤ 1.5 18. Ability to give written informed consent and comply with protocol requirements. 1. Primary CNS malignancies or CNS metastases; subjects with previously treated brain metastasis will be allowed if the brain metastasis has been stable without steroid treatment for at least 3 months following prior treatment (radiotherapy or surgery). Subjects with symptoms of CNS metastases or history must have a CT or MRI scan including the brain during Screening. 2.

Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted during the screening period, in order to control a subject's BP prior to initiating treatment. Blood pressure must be reassessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 1 hour. The SBP / DBP values from each blood pressure assessment must be ≤ 140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within 6 months prior to administration of first dose of study drug History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic medications History of coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft within 6 months 3.
