	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Exposure Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project seeks to lay the foundation for an effectiveness trial that will lead to the advancement of treatments for PTSD among Spanish-speaking Latinos, particularly Puerto Ricans. This area of research is important in light of the limited treatment options currently available for Spanish-speakers with PTSD and the long-term negative consequences of this condition. Participants in this study are recruited by referral from mental health providers in a general health setting. Patients meeting criteria for enrollment will be randomly assigned to receive either Prolonged Exposure therapy or treatment as usual. Assessments for all participants will be collected at baseline, week 8, and week 16 after randomization.</detailed_description>
