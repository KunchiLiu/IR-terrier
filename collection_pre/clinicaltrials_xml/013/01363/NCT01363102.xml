	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that by applying a validated algorithm to accomplish early mobilization in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients, these patients will achieve a higher level of mobility which translates to shorter ICU length of stay and improved functional status at discharge. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms related to muscle strength and sleep will also explain some variance in these outcome variables.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systematic Team Approach to Guide Early Mobilization in Surgical Intensive Care Unit Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trauma literature consistently shows that early mobilization improves patients' outcome after a localized trauma such as hip fracture, or blunt solid organ injuries. In addition, in critically ill patients on the medical ICU, early mobilization improves patients' functional outcome and decreases ICU length of stay (1). This study evaluates if critically ill patients in a surgical ICU can safely and effectively be mobilized early after trauma and surgery. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled study in surgical intensive care unit patients to evaluate the effects of mSOMS guided early mobilization. Additionally, the study will examine known genetic polymorphisms as related to sleep quality and muscle strength and how it relates to early mobilization of surgical ICU patients. In particular, the study will focus on the following polymorphisms: CLOCK, NPAS2, PER2 and PER3, PDE4D,MUC1, ATP2B1, DCDC5, TRPM6, SHROOM3, and MDS1 genes.</detailed_description>
