	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate if endogenous Glucagon Like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) has an effect on brain satiety and reward systems and if there are alterations in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Secondly, the aim is to investigate whether treatment with a GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, restores these signals in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, also the endogenous GLP-1 effects will be investigated in obese individuals before and after gastric bypass surgery on brain satiety and reward systems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Glucagon Like Peptide-1(GLP-1) and Liraglutide on Brain Satiety and Reward Circuits and Feeding Behavior in Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First aim will be addressed in a cross-sectional randomized study. 20 healthy, lean and 20 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) will be exposed to food cues and with concomitant infusion of glucagon Like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist or saline, to assess the involvement of endogenous GLP-1, secreted in response to a meal. Measurements activation of CNS circuits involved in satiety and reward will be performed using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The second aim will be addressed in cross-over randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in the T2DM patients only. Patients will be randomly assigned liraglutide vs insulin glargine treatment, during a treatment period of 12 weeks each with a 12-week washout period in between. The investigators will perform the same fMRI protocol. The third aim will be addressed in a study with obese individuals who are scheduled for a gastric bypass surgery. The same protocol as for the first aim will be performed and this will be before and after the surgery in the same individuals.</detailed_description>
