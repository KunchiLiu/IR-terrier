	<brief_summary>This was an open-label PK study in pediatric subjects who had undergone general surgery. Each subject's study participation consisted of a screening visit, a single-dose treatment with intranasal ketorolac (IN) tromethamine, and a follow-up visit. Following surgery, subjects received IN ketorolac 15 mg (weight &lt; 50 kg) or 30 mg (weight &gt; or = 50 kg) when pain relief was indicated. For pain not relieved by the study drug, the subjects had access to an opioid analgesic administered by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained at specified time points following the dose of ketorolac.</brief_summary>
