	<brief_title>The Effect of Remote Postconditioning on Graft Function in Patients Undergoing Living-related Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic reperfusion injury after kidney transplantation is a common clinical problem associated with a high morbidity and mortality. To reduce the adverse effect of ischemic reperfusion injury after organ transplantation, various strategies including ischemic preconditioning or postconditioning. Remote ischemic postconditioning is one of such strategies where brief ischemic reperfusion injury of one organ protects other organs from sustained ischemic reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic postconditioning of the limb with a tourniquet is a safe and convenient method of postconditioning organs against ischemic reperfusion injury. However, the efficacy of remote ischemic postconditioning in patients undergoing living donor kidney transplantation needs to be established. Therefore, we investigate the efficacy of remote ischemic postconditioning of the upper limb with a tourniquet in recipients of kidney transplantation by measuring the markers of acute kidney injury.</detailed_description>
