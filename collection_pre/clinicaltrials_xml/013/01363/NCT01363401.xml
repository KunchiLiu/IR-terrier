	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells("HYNR-CS inj"), through intrathecal delivery for the treatment in patients with ALS. This study consists of 2 steps. First step is a safety study of the intrathecal(IT) injection of "HYNR-CS inj" in 8 patients with ALS. In this phase 1 study, AE, laboratory test, physical examination, vital signs, Electrocardiogram, and Chest X-Ray examination were evaluated in terms of safety. Second step is to compare the efficacy and safety between test group and control group of total 64 patients with ALS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cell Treatment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. Despite of many trials for disease-modifying, no treatment has so far changed natural course of disease. We have performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells in ALS. We could get the evidence that autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells have dose-dependent effects on SOD1 mice via intrathecal injection. In our results of clinical trial, intrathecal injection of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells could slow down disease progression and might be used as a disease modifying strategy in patients with ALS. This study was designed as a single center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 2-stage study, and targeted at patients diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(Lou Gehrig's disease). The study consisted of Stage-1 study for safety evaluation and Stage-2 study for efficacy and safety evaluation of the study drug, and at Stage 1, 7 subjects eligible for the inclusion/exclusion criteria received safety evaluation for 28 days of study drug administration in twice under the protocol, and then followed Stage 2. To decide whether the study can be proceeded in 2 stages, ADR(CTCAE Version 3.0, ≥grade 3) should not appear in initial 7 subjects. Data obtained from subjects of this study were analyzed into three: Safety Analysis, ITT(Intent-To-Treat) Analysis, and PP(Per Protocol) Analysis. However, in case of phase 1, only safety analysis was conducted, and in case of phase 2, all of safety, ITT, and PP analyses were conducted. For ITT Analysis, all the subjects whose data on primary efficacy endpoint could be obtained following the administration of investigational drug were analyzed in analysis among subjects who were administered the investigational drug once at least. Also, Modified ITT Analysis, including 7 subjects at Stage 1, was carried out.</detailed_description>
