	<brief_title>A Study Looking at Kidney Function in Kidney Transplant Recipients Who Are Taking Anti-rejection Medication Including Tacrolimus and With or Without Sirolimus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the potential to reduce nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) therapy by lowering tacrolimus exposure from Advagraf® in combination with the non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressant sirolimus to avoid the risk of acute graft rejection, compared with an Advagraf® and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) immunosuppressive regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>End stage kidney disease and a suitable candidate for primary renal transplantation or retransplantation (unless the graft was lost from rejection within 6 months) Receiving a kidney transplant from a deceased or living (non Human Leukocyte Antigen [HLA] identical) donor with compatible ABO blood type Female subject of childbearing potential has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at enrollment Female and male subjects agree to maintain highly effective birth control during the study and for 90 days after discontinuation of dosing with study drugs. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (CPMP/ ICH/ 286/ 95 modified) of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some Intrauterine Devises (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner Receiving or having previously received an organ transplant other than a kidney Cold ischemia time of the donor kidney &gt; 30 hours Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) &gt;20% Receiving a graft from a nonheartbeating donor other than of Maastricht category 3 (withdrawal of support awaiting cardiac arrest) Significant liver disease, defined as having continuously elevated SGPT/ ALT and/ or SGOT/ AST and/ or total bilirubin levels ≥ 2 times the upper value of the normal range of the investigational site or is receiving a graft from a hepatitis C or B positive donor Requiring initial sequential or parallel therapy with immunosuppressive antibody preparation(s) Requiring ongoing dosing with a systemic immunosuppressive drug prior to transplantation (other than minimal levels of immunosuppression following failure of previous transplantation without nephrectomy) Significant, uncontrolled concomitant infections and/ or severe diarrhea, vomiting, active upper gastrointestinal tract malabsorption or active peptic ulcer Pregnant woman or breastfeeding mother Subject or donor known to be HIV positive Known allergy or intolerance to tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics, corticosteroids, sirolimus, MMF or any of the product excipients or iodine Evidence of malignant disease within the last 5 years, not including nonmalignant skin cancers Currently participating in another clinical trial, and/ or has taken an investigational drug within 28 days prior to enrollment Unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol</criteria>
