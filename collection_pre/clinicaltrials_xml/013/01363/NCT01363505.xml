	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that more than 30% of the overall acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients develop renal dysfunction. Several studies have tried to find a correlation between hemodynamic Parameters (blood pressure , heart rate, central venous pressure CVP) and worsening of renal function in acute decompensated heart failure patients. Results showed that there were no correlation between baseline hemodynamics or change in hemodynamics and worsening of renal function. Another study showed that intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measuring was a better corollary to renal failure status then measuring cardiovascular hemodynamics using pulmonary artery catheterization in ADHF patients.. An increased IAP was associated with worse renal function and that level of IAP far below abdominal compartment syndrome may adversely affect renal function in patients with ADHF.</brief_summary>
