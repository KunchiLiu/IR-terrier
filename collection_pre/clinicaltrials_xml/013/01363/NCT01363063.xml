	<brief_summary>This was a Phase 1, double blind, two part study in healthy male and female volunteers. Each subject participated in only one part of the study. In Part A subjects received one dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine with a lidocaine hydrochloride free formulation in one nostril and one dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine containing 6% lidocaine hydrochloride in the other nostril, in a randomized manner. In Part B subjects were randomized to receive a single intranasal dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine containing 0% lidocaine hydrochloride into one nostril and either placebo or a single intranasal dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine containing 0%, 4% or 6% lidocaine hydrochloride into the other nostril. During the study, subjects remained resident from the morning of Day 1 until the afternoon of Day 1, when a post-study medical was performed prior to discharge. The objective of this study was to compare the tolerability of formulations of ketorolac tromethamine with differing concentrations of lidocaine hydrochloride (0% and 6% in Part A and 0%, 4%, 6% and placebo in Part B) following intranasal administration to healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
