Note: At the Screening visit participant also agrees to refrain from the practices listed above for at least 5 days prior to enrollment. Participant report of any of the following at Screening: Known adverse reaction to silicone, titanium dioxide, or to any of the components of the study products Use and/or anticipated use during the period of study participation of CYP3A inducer(s) and/or inhibitor(s) Chronic and/or recurrent candidiasis Nontherapeutic injection drug use in the 12 months prior to screening Postexposure prophylaxis for HIV exposure within 6 months prior to screening Last pregnancy outcome 90 days or less prior to screening Currently breastfeeding Hysterectomy Intends to become pregnant within the next 4 months Has plans to relocate away from the study site area in the next 4 months Reports participating in any other research study involving drugs, medical devices, or vaginal products 60 days or less prior to enrollment At Screening or Enrollment, as determined by the IoR/designee, any significant uncontrolled active or chronic cardiovascular, renal, liver, hematologic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic disorder or infectious disease, or at increased risk of cardiovascular events Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at Screening: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) Grade 1 or higher as per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) Calculated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft Gault formula, where creatinine clearance (female) in mL/min = (140 age in years) x (weight in kg) x (0.85)/72 x (creatinine in mg/dL) Hemoglobin Grade 1 or higher as per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) Platelet count Grade 1 or higher as per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test result may be retested during the screening process. If a participant is re tested and a nonexclusionary result is documented within 45 days of providing informed consent for screening, the participant may be enrolled. At Screening or Enrollment, is pregnant Diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) at Screening or Enrollment Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening will be offered treatment and may be enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms have resolved. If treatment is completed and symptoms have resolved within 45 days of obtaining informed consent for screening, the participant may be enrolled.

At Screening, severe pelvic relaxation such that either the vaginal walls or the uterine cervix descend beyond the vaginal introitus with valsalva maneuver Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving study objectives.</criteria>
