	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis/septic shock are serious complications of infection with high morbidity and mortality. Recent information showed that early and aggressive resuscitation with goal directed therapy help improving survival and outcome especially the resuscitation within the first 6 hours. In surgical patients, either severe sepsis/septic shock bought them to the operating room or this sepsis might be found after surgery resulting in higher morbidity and mortality. Not only knowledge management, others possible risk factors should also be identified and corrected for outcome improving. This prospective observational study will be done in 800 adult surgical patients admitting to the general surgical intensive care unit. Incidence of severe sepsis/septic shock on admission along with risk factors associated with poor outcomes [organ failure (AKI, ALI, PMI, liver failure, stroke), prolonged ICU length of, stay, ICU death] will be recorded especially effect of amount and type of fluid replacement in the first 6 hours, 24, 48 and 72 hours after diagnosis. Knowledge about severe sepsis/septic shock was implemented among the associated personal, outcome as major organ failure, ICU length of stay, ICU death will also be compare between this prospective study and historical controlled.</brief_summary>
