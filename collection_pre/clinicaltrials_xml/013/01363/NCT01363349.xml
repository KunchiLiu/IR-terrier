	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 6 month study designed to evaluate the cognitive effects of treatment with CYP-1020 compared to risperidone. The primary efficacy endpoint will occur after 6 weeks of treatment; additional (secondary) efficacy endpoints will occur after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Up to 450 patients will be randomized to CYP-1020 or risperidone in a 1:1 ratio. The study will utilize a flexible dose escalation scheme designed to allow patients to titrate to their maximally tolerated dose; doses of CYP-1020 may range from a minimum of 15 mg to a maximum of 35 mg, whereas doses of risperidone will range from a minimum of 1 mg to 3 mg BID (2-6 mg daily). To ensure effective blinding across all treatment groups, all patients will be treated twice daily with study drug and/or placebo, as indicated (i.e., double-dummy design).</brief_summary>

Prior history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome 5. Prior history or current evidence of moderate or severe tardive dyskinesia (mild is acceptable). 6. Abnormal ECG evaluation 7. History of confirmed epilepsy or prior seizure disorder (history of a single febrile seizure is not exclusionary) 8.
