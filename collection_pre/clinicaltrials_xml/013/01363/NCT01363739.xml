	<brief_summary>-1498C/T VEGF polymorphism, as suggested by a recent retrospective analysis, seems to have a role in predicting the efficacy of Bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The present study aims to prospectively evaluate the predictive role of this polymorphism in metastatic colorectal patients receiving the same treatment.</brief_summary>
