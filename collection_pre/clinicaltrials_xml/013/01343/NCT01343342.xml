	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to examine whether n-3 PUFA-induced changes in metabolic risk factors are influenced by genetic variations within genes acting as fatty acids sensors. To do so, the metabolic risk factor response to an n-e PUFA supplementation will be compared in carriers and non-carriers of polymorphism within genes acting as fatty acids sensors.</detailed_description>
