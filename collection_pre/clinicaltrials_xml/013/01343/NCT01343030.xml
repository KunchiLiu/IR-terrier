	<brief_summary>Breast implants are currently used for cosmetic breast augmentation and in breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. Fat grafting is a technique where fat is injected around the periphery of a breast implant to camouflage the transition between implant and the body. The investigators propose to show mammography images of women who have had breast implants with fat grafting to informed and blinded radiologists and evaluate their readings of the images. Hypothesis: with mammographic screening, radiologists will be able to distinguish between findings associated with fat grafting and those which are suspicious for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
