	<brief_title>The Effect of Food on the Administration of Canagliflozin in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label (volunteers will know the identity of assigned treatment), randomized (one of 2 study drug sequences assigned by chance) study to evaluate the oral bioavailability (the degree to which the drug is absorbed in the body when taken orally by mouth) of canagliflozin when taken with and without food in healthy volunteers. Healthy Volunteers will take 1 canagliflozin tablet orally for 1 day in 2 treatment periods (canagliflozin will be taken with food in 1 treatment period and canagliflozin will be taken without food in 1 treatment period); the 2 treatment periods will be separated by a 10- to 14-day washout period.</detailed_description>
