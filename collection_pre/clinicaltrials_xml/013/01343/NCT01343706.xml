	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 409306 in healthy male genotyped volunteers following oral administration of single rising doses. The secondary objectives are: (1) to explore dose proportionality of BI 409306 as immediate release solid oral dosage, (2) to explore the relative bioavailability of BI 409306 when administered as immediate release solid oral dosage compared to oral drinking solution and (3) to compare the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles between two different groups of genotyped subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Healthy males according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests 2. Age &gt; 21 and Age &lt; 50 years 3. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 18.5 and BMI &lt; 29.9 kg/m2 Exclusion criteria: 1. Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance 2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease 3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 4. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) 5. Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of seizures, stroke or psychiatric disorders) within the past 6 month 6. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts. 7. Chronic or relevant acute infections 8. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) 9. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 10. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 11. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms); 12. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de points (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)</criteria>
