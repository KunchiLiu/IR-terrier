	<brief_summary>The role of surgical resection in the management of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is still controversial. The selection criterion to perform either Extrapleural Pneumonectomy (EPP) or Pleurectomy/Decortication (P/D) is dependent not only on the cardio-pulmonary status of the patient, tumor stage and intraoperative findings but also on surgeons' decision and philosophy. There are no established guidelines. Radical Pleurectomy (RP) competes against EPP as surgical therapy modality. Both surgical approaches are cytoreductive treatment options. The aim is to remove all gross disease and to achieve macroscopic complete resection. Originally P/D was a palliative option for controlling pleural effusion. But lung-sparing surgery for MPM seems to be an alternative to patients unsuitable or unwilling to undergo EPP in a multimodality therapy concept. Most studies evaluating multimodality therapies for MPM are based on retrospective analyses and their interpretation is difficult because of inhomogeneous patient groups studied. The aim of our study was to analyze the feasibility and results of RP as surgical therapy modality in a standardized trimodality therapy concept.</brief_summary>
