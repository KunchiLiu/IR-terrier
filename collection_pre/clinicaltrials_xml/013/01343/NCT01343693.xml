	<brief_title>MaxAn Post Market Surveillance Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this Post Market Surveillance Validation is to document the performance and clinical outcomes of the MaxAn® Anterior Cervical Plate System. Dr. Park, et.al conducted a retrospective review and found a positive association between adjacent-level ossification following anterior cervical plate procedures and the plate-to-disc distance. 1 They concluded that when the anterior cervical plates were placed at least 5mm away from the adjacent disc spaces, there was a decrease in the likelihood of moderate-to-severe adjacent-level ossification. The design of the MaxAn Anterior Cervical Plate and accompanying technique allows this type of plate placement; therefore we will be looking at the radiographic outcomes of these subjects and comparing them to the retrospective chart review conducted by Dr. Park using the MaxAn Technique allows you to achieve plate placement of 5mm from the supraadjacent level which will help minimize the risk of adjacent level ossification.</detailed_description>
