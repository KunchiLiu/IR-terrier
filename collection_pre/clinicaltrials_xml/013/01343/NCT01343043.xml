	<brief_summary>The purpose of this early (pilot) clinical trial is to test the effects (both good and bad) of chemotherapy and adoptive immunotherapy with T cells engineered to recognize NY-ESO-1 peptide in patients with unresectable, metastatic or recurrent synovial sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Genetically Engineered NY-ESO-1 Specific NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T in HLA-A2+ Patients With Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design - Patients will undergo apheresis at the enrolling institution. PBMC will be shipped to a central manufacturer for gene transduction, activation and expansion, then cryopreserved and shipped back to the enrolling institution. - The trial seeks to enroll up to 65 patients, that is, up to 20 patients in Cohort 1 and up to 15 patients in Cohorts 2-4. Depending on the cohort patients are enrolled in, patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide with or without fludarabine. - Cohort 1: Complete - Cohort 2: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine on Days -3 and -2, and without fludarabine on Days -5 and -4. - Cohort 3: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide only on Days -3 and -2. (Cohort Complete) - Cohort 4: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 5 evaluable patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine on Days -7 to -5. On Day 0, patients ≥40 kg will receive the minimum cell dose of at least 1x10⁹ transduced NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells with a maximum of 6x10⁹ transduced cells. The target dose for this protocol is 5x10⁹ transduced NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells. Patients &lt;40 kg will be dosed per body weight with a minimum 0.025x10⁹ transduced cells/kg, with a target dose of 0.125 x10⁹ transduced cells/kg. - Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and immune endpoints. - Patients who have a confirmed response, or have stable disease for &gt;3 months then progress may receive a 2nd T cell infusion, provided eligibility criteria are met. The 2nd treatment cell infusion will be administered in the same manner as the first. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria may receive a 2nd infusion of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T no sooner than 60 days and no later than 2 years following completion of the first treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Synovial sarcoma that has been treated with standard chemotherapy containing ifosfamide and/or doxorubicin and remains: unresectable or metastatic or progressive/persistent or recurrent disease Measurable disease Patients must have proven positive tumor sample for NYESO1 as follows: Cohort 1 Positive expression is defined as 2+ and/or 3+ by immunohistochemistry in ≥ 50% of cells. Cohort 2 Positive expression is defined as ≥1+ by immunohistochemistry in ≥1% cells, but not to exceed 2+ and/or 3+ in ≥ 50% of cells. Cohort 3 Positive expression is defined as 2+ and/or 3+ by immunohistochemistry in ≥ 50% of cells. Cohort 4 Positive expression is defined as 2+ and/or 3+ by immunohistochemistry in ≥ 50% of cells. HLAA*02:01, HLAA*02:05, and/or HLAA*02:06 by high resolution testing at a local or central laboratory Weigh more than 18 kg All previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, or immune therapy must be washed out 3 weeks before apheresis and must be completed at least 3 weeks prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. Systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy should be washed out 2 weeks before apheresis and must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. Biologic or other approved molecular targeted small molecule inhibitors should be washed out 1 week or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before apheresis and must be completed at least 1 week or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. Any grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity of any previous therapy must have resolved to grade 2 or less prior to apheresis and any grade 3 or 4 toxicity must have resolved to grade 2 or less prior to preinfusion lymphodepletive chemotherapy. ECOG 01, or for children ≤10 years of age, Lansky &gt; 60 Life expectancy &gt; 3 months Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40% or fractional shortening ≥ 28% T. bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl (Patients with Gilbert Syndrome total bilirubin &lt;3xULN and direct bilirubin ≤ 35%) AST, ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10⁹/L Platelets ≥ 75 x 10⁹/L Ageadjusted normal serum creatinine or a creatinine clearance ≥ 40 ml/min Ability to give informed consent for patients greater than 18 years of age. For patients less than 18 years of age the legal guardian must give informed consent. Male patients must be willing to practice birth control (including abstinence) during and for 4 months after treatment. Female patients must be willing to practice birth control (including abstinence) during treatment and for 4 months after gene modified cells are no longer detected in body. Active HIV, HBV, HCV or HTLV 1/2 infection (due to increased risk of complications during lymphodepleting regimen and confounding effects on the immune system). Active hepatitis B or C infection is defined by seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg) or hepatitis C antibody.</criteria>
