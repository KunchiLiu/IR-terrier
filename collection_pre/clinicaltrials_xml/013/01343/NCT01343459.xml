	<brief_summary>Title: HIOB - Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Irradiation preceded by Intraoperative Radiotherapy with Electrons as anticipated Boost ISIORT- 01 HIOB is defined as hypofractionated WBRT (40,5 Gy in 2,7 Gy per fraction) preceded by an Intraoperative Boost to the tumor bed ( 90 % reference dose of 10 Gy, 11,1 Gy Dmax IOERT). Primary endpoint is the proof of superiority of a new treatment regimen. The HIOB study concept is supposed to test the hypothesis whether such a combined schedule is superior (or iso-effective) towards "standard" RT in terms of local control and cosmetic outcome. In the vast majority of all publications, annual and 5 year in-breast recurrence rates following BCT showed a clear dependency on patient age within the following boundaries (primary references): Age &gt; 50: Bartelink (standard): 0,7% (annual) 3,5% (5y) START B (best): 0,4 %(annual) 2,0% (5y) Age 41-50: Bartelink (standard) 1,2% (annual) 6,0% (5y) Whelan (best) 0,72%(annual) 3,6% (5y) Age ≥ 35-40 Bartelink (standard) 2% (annual) 10% (5y) Whelan (best) 0,72% (annual) 3,6% (5y) long these three different age groups, benchmarking will be performed against the best published results following `Golden Standard`RT, usually defined as conventionally fractionated WBRT with 50 Gy (25 x2) plus external tumor bed boost with 10-16 Gy electrons (5-8x2Gy). Superiority is defined as going below the lower limit of the estimated 5 year local recurrence rate within the respective age group Inferiority is defined as crossing the respective upper limit . Secondary endpoint: Disease free survival Tertiary endpoint: toxicity assessment (acute and late) including long term cosmetic evaluation Study design and statistics: - Prospective multicenter single-armed - Sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) - Separate analysis within three different age groups Estimated Accrual time: strongly dependent on recruitment per year within the respective age group . Due to the statistical estimation of Szenario A and B the study will close after max. Time-period of 10 years in case of A or 6,4 years in case of B..

	<detailed_description>Study population: See Points 4.1 und 4.2 Inclusion/Exclusion criteria of the entire protocol Operation: - Lumpectomy / segmentectomy / tumorectomy with sufficient safety margins (see above). Lymph node assessment must follow a sentinel node concept. - Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory - After IORT, radio-opaque clips have to be fixed at the tumor bed. Histology: R0-Resection is mandatory Chemotherapy: neoadjuvant:allowed adjuvant: allowed. There are no limitations towards special chemotherapeutic schemes and schedules. Radiotherapy: IOERT - IOERT is performed on mobile or fixed linacs - Reference dose: 11 Gy specified as maximum dose, with a minimum target volume dose of 90% encompassing the PTV (i.e. 10 Gy). WBRT - must start within day 36- 56 postoperatively (week 6 - 8 p.o.) in case of adjuvant hormonal treatment (or no further tumor specific medication) - In case of adjuvant chemotherapy, a time - gap between IOERT and WBRT up to 9 months is allowed. - Single reference dose per fraction: 2,7 Gy (ICRU) - Number of fractions: 15, Number of fractions per week: 5 - Total WBRT dose: 40,5 Gy RT of regional lymphatics: exclusion criterion Diagnostics of Local recurrence: - yearly mammographies, - optional breast sonography, MRI - LR has to be histologically confirmed Follow-up screening for detection of metastases (minimum requirements): - Chest X-Ray, optional - abdominal sonography, optional - lab tests incl. tumor markers, optional Assessment of acute toxicity of WBRT according to CTC-toxicity Scoring-systems: Assessment of late toxicity according to LENT-SOMA scoring-systems Assessment of cosmetic outcome according to 5-point- Scoring System (vanLimbergen) starting before WBRT, including photo documentation in standardized positions</detailed_description>
