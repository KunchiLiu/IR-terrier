	<brief_summary>The investigators are measuring hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)stiffness using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) technique to enhance the diagnostic accuracy for HCC stratifications and treatment efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stiffness Measurement of Liver Tumors and Visceral Parenchyma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regression modelings as well as validity testings including cut-off identification will be acquired by performing both qualitative and quantitative measurements of HCC using reference diagnostic modalities e.g. pathology grading, dynamic CT scanning, etc.</detailed_description>
