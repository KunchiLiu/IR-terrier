	<brief_summary>2. Objectives 1. To determine the vitamin D status of African-American HIV patients who are HIV-treatment na√Øve. 2. To compare the effects of an efavirenz-containing regimen to a protease inhibitor regimen on 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels. 3. To compare the effect on bone density of a tenofovir- and efavirenz-containing regimen to a regimen that does not contain these drugs. 4. To compare the efficacy of an alternative regimen (raltegravir, darunavir, ritonavir) to a standard once-daily regimen (tenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz). Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving efavirenz will be more likely to have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3levels based on the fact that efavirenz is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP24 enzymes that degrade 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, respectively, to inactive metabolites. The investigators speculate that patients on a tenofovir-containing regimen will be more likely to have progression of bone density loss compared to those in the non-tenofovir-containing regimen.</brief_summary>
