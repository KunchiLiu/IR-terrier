	<brief_summary>Part I of the study will verify optimal execution of the procedures and acquisition of satisfactory samples that will be utilized in the main study (Part II); no drug will be administered. Part II will assess the effect of multiple doses of MK-1029 on the changes in allergen-induced sputum eosinophils and changes in allergen-induced late asthmatic response (LAR) when compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
