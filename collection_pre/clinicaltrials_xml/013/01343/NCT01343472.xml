	<detailed_description>This study entails an evaluation of the Washington Intensive Supervision Program (WISP). WISP is a program targeting high-risk parolees in Seattle, and is modeled after the HOPE program in Hawaii. The purpose of the evaluation is to test whether subjects assigned to WISP perform better than those assigned to parole-as-usual (PAU) on a number of outcomes, including drug use, missed appointments, recidivism, prison and jail stays, and parole revocations. WISP uses regular random drug testing and close community supervision, paired with swift and certain, but modest sanctions for every detected violation.</detailed_description>
