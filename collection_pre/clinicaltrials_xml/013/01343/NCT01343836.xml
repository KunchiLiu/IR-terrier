	<brief_title>Autologous Tenocyte Implantation in Patients With Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overuse injury of the Achilles tendon is a common entity. When the exact origin of tendon pain is unclear, the term tendinopathy is preferred. Most accepted treatment at this moment is an eccentric exercise programme, according to the Dutch guidelines. However, a recent systematic review on the effectiveness of eccentric exercises to treat lower extremity tendinoses concluded that it is unclear whether eccentric exercises are more effective than other forms of treatment. Recent studies described new treatment strategies in tendinopathies, such as the use autologous Tenocyte Implantation (ATI). This treatment option can participate actively in tissue repair processes on cell level. The only published clinical pilot study in tendon research reported 60% improvement in all scores after 6 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
