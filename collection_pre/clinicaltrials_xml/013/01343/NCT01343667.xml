	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to provide an ongoing evaluation of clinical outcomes associated with the GORE Flow Reversal System and the GORE Embolic Filter when used for embolic protection during carotid artery stenting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GORE Flow Reversal System and GORE Embolic Filter Extension Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physicians will have the opportunity to select which embolic protection device, the GORE Flow Reversal System or the GORE Embolic Filter, to use during the carotid artery stenting procedure. This study is not designed to compare study endpoints between the two treatment arms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient, or patient's legal representative, is able and willing to provide informed consent. Patient must be at least 18 years of age or older. Patient will be selected and treated according to the GORE Flow Reversal System Instructions for Use (IFU) or the GORE Embolic Filter IFU. Patient is contraindicated for the embolic protection device arm they are selected by the investigator to receive: Either Per the GORE Flow Reversal System IFU if the GORE Flow Reversal System is selected OR Per the GORE Embolic Filter IFU if the GORE Embolic Filter is selected If the patient is contraindicated for both arms (devices) they may not be enrolled.</criteria>
