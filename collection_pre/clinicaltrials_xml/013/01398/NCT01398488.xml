	<brief_title>Patient Education After Lung Transplantation Via Tablet Computers Versus Conventional Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications after organ transplantation is thought to be a leading cause of allograft rejection, graft loss, and death. Immunosuppressant medy to prevent graft rejection after lung transplantation. Reported non-compliance rates with calcineurin inhibitors are ranging between 13 and 22 % after lung transplantation. Incidence of non-compliance increases over time after transplantation. Increased health care costs, decreased quality of life, and organ failure (incl. the need for re-do transplantation) are possible consequences of immunosuppressant noncompliance. Therefore, medication compliance defined as the extent to which a patient's medication taking behaviour coincides with the prescribed regimen, is a critical issue in transplantation. Repeated patient education is one option to overcome non-adherence and immunosuppressive medication non-compliance. Immunosuppressive therapy is monitored by measurement of drug levels. Fluctuating drug levels increase the risk for rejection and drug toxicities. In addition, frequent dose adjustments, case management and frequent monitoring of drug levels are cost-intensive.</detailed_description>
