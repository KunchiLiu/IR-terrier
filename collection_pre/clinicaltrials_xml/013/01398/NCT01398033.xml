	<brief_summary>There is both a poor life expectancy and a poor prognosis of limb salvage in those patience with stenoses or occlusions of the lower limb. To date only a small number of these patients could be helped through medication or surgery. The indications for stent placement are poor primary results following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or evidence of a flow-limiting dissection. The primary success rate after a stent placement is between 80% and 90%. One so far inconsistent discussed problem is the occurrence of in-stent restenosis which is expected in 20% to 78% of treated lesions, depending on the stent used. Using only percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of an in-stent restenosis, restenosis reoccurs in 70% to 80% of cases. The aim of this study is to analyse the primary success and the long term results of angioplasty using the drug-coated balloon (paclitaxel) compared to an non-coated balloon in the treatment of in-stent restenosis of lower limb arteries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel-Coated Versus Uncoated Balloon for Treatment of Below-the-Knee In-Stent-Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre study the use of the already certified coated balloon and an uncoated balloon is evaluated in patients with in-stent restenoses/reocclusions of the lower limb artery. The whole lesion length should be covered by the balloon so that proximal and distal overlap of the lesion by a minimum of 5mm is assured. Based on the current literature the average restenoses rate of the lower limb arteries after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of an in-stent restenosis is 70% after 6 months. Assuming the restenosis rate reduces to 30% after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using a drug-coated balloon, with a significance level of Alpha=0.05 (bilateral) and a power Beta=0.8, the enrolment of 100 patients is required in order to show a significant difference between treatment groups, considering a dropout rate of 30%. The choice of treatment will be distributed in a randomised, double blind procedure. The study duration per patient is 2 years. Clinical follow-up evaluations will take place after 3 and 6 months and after 1 and 2 years. After 3 month and 12 months an angiography of the target vessel will be performed.</detailed_description>
