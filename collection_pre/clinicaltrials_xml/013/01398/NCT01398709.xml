	<brief_title>Effect of Rewarming Rate During Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Clinical Prognosis of Infants Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There have been many studies indicating that rewarming management plays an important role in cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between rewarming rate during cardiopulmonary bypass and clinical prognosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass are randomly assigned to either a slow rewarming strategy (0.24 degrees C/min) or a fast rewarming strategy (0.5 degrees C/min).</detailed_description>
