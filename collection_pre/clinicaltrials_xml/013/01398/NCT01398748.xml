	<brief_summary>Excessive free radical formation and depletion of the brain's primary antioxidant, glutathione, are established components of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. While there is rationale for the therapeutic use of reduced glutathione (GSH) in PD, and even some preliminary evidence to suggest the use of GSH can lead to symptomatic improvement, obstacles surrounding currently employed delivery methods have hindered the clinical utility of this therapy. Intranasal GSH, (in)GSH, is a novel method of delivery for this popular CAM therapy in patients with PD, and bypasses the obstacles associated with other delivery methods. It has been used in clinical practice since 2005. The aim of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary absorption data of (in)GSH in volunteers with PD in a Phase I single ascending dose escalation study.</brief_summary>
