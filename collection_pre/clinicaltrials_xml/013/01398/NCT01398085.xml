	<brief_title>IoN- Is Ablative Radio-iodine Necessary for Low Risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase II: to determine if recruitment into a phase III trial is feasible, with a target of 10 patients per month during a minimum of 6 months (evaluated within months 7-18 of the trial). Phase III: to determine whether the 5-year disease-free survival rate among patients who do not have routine Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is non-inferior to those who do.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>R0 total thyroidectomy (in one or two stages, no residual disease present; Rx at the discretion of the MDT) within the last 6 months Negative pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential Aged 16 or over WHO performance status 0 2, selfcaring Histological confirmation of differentiated thyroid carcinoma: MDT decision for inclusion based on overall clinicopathological assessment Papillary thyroid cancer Non aggressive histological features (small foci of aggressive histology allowed at the discretion of the MDT) pT1a(m): all individual foci ≤1cm pT1b and pT1b(m): &gt;12cm pT2 and pT2(m): &gt;24cm pT3 and pT3(m): &gt;4cm pT3 R0: any size with minimal extrathyroidal extension recommended by the MDT pN0 pN1a pNX Encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer (EFVPTC) with capsular invasion only Follicular thyroid cancer/ Hurthle cell cancer minimally invasive with capsular invasion only (or up to four foci of possible invasion of intra capsular vessels at the discretion of the MDT only) pT1b: &gt;1 4 cm pT3 R0: (up to 4cm only) with minimal extrathyroidal extension recommended by the MDT Histological material available for Central Review Willing to use contraception for the duration of the trial until 6 months post radioiodine treatment (for females) or 4 months post treatment (for males), if allocated to the ablation group. N.B. Multifocal tumours (≥2 foci) of all histological types should be designated with "(m)", and the size of the largest focus determines the classification (as described in the TNM 7th edition). For example, if there are two foci, one 0.8cm and the other 3cm, the classification is based on the 3cm focus; i.e. pT2(m). pT1a Papillary and Follicular carcinoma which is unifocal and ≤1cm in size &lt;4cm Encapsulated Follicular Variant of Papillary Thyroid Cancer (EFVPTC) with no capsular invasion Anaplastic or medullary carcinoma R1/R2 Thyroidectomy Patients with: pN1b M1 Aggressive Papillary thyroid cancer with any of the following features: Widely invasive Poorly differentiated Anaplastic Tall cell Columnar cell Diffuse sclerosing variants Follicular thyroid cancer/ Hürthle cell cancer with any of the following features: Anaplastic Widely invasive Poorly differentiated Tumours greater than 4cm Incomplete resection or lobectomy pT4 or macroscopic and microscopic tumour invasion of locoregional tissues or structures Pregnant women or women who are breast feeding Patients who have CT performed with iv contrast less than 23 months before ablation Previous treatment for thyroid cancer (except surgery) Previous malignancies with limited life expectancy or likely to interfere with the patient's ability to be able to comply with treatment and/or followup at least for 5 years Dysphagia, Oesophageal stricture, Active gastritis,Gastric erosions, Peptic ulcer, Suspected reduced gastrointestinal motility MDT decision against ablation or suitability for trail in the light of severe comorbid condition/s: Unstable angina Recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) Severe labile hypertension Any patient who cannot comply with radiation protection including: patients with learning difficulties patients with dementia patients with a tracheostomy that require nursing care patients requiring frequent nursing/ medical supervision</criteria>
