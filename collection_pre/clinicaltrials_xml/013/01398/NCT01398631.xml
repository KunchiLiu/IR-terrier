	<brief_summary>Various elements of patient history are checked and entered in the admission Case Recor Form (CRF). Three risk scores are calculated out of these elements, combined with physical examination, laboratory values and ECG-findings. The primary aim is to assess the positive and negative predictive values for a cardiovascular event of the three risk scores for chest pain patients. Secondary aim is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of various elements in the patient history for an acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of the TIMI, GRACE and HEART Scores</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational study in patients admitted to the emergency room for chest pain. All patients are checked by the resident in charge immediately on admission, before any lab values are known, by means of an admission Case Report Form (CRF), consisting of classical elements of patient history, risk factors, medication and physical examination. This CRF is filled out immediately by the resident. No additional effort will be asked of the patients. Patient data during a follow up of at least 6 weeks are gathered from hospital charts. The predictive value of the three scoring systems: HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin), TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) for both the discharge diagnosis and the occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) is calculated. The primary hypothesis of the study is that the HEART score is a significantly better predictor than the TIMI and/or GRACE score for cardiovascular events during a six week period following admission to the emergency room.</detailed_description>
