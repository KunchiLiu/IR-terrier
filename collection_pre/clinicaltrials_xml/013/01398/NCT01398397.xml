	<brief_summary>This study is being done to collect information about people who have or may have Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) or X-linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED). This study will allow Edimer Pharmaceuticals to know more about HED/XLHED so that hopefully the investigators can develop a drug to treat this condition. In this study Edimer will retrospectively review and abstract (summarize) medical records of people that have or may have HED/XLHED in order to further understand the natural history and disease characteristics.</brief_summary>
