	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the outcome of patients with recurrent CDI treated with fresh HBT versus frozen-and-thawed HBT in a randomized controlled trial. The specific objectives are to evaluate the safety of both types of HBT and to compare the clinical response, treatment failure and relapse rate in patients treated with fresh HBT compared to those treated with frozen-and-thawed HBT; also to assess the functional health and well-being of patients in each arm using a validated tool. The metagenomics will also be conducted from the stool samples collected from select patients from each arm: pre and post treatment and the matching donors. The metagenomics data will be used to determine the bacteria which may have contributed to the cure of CDI.</brief_summary>

Severe underlying disease such that the patient is not expected to survive for at least 30 days. 11. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, that the treatment may pose a health risk to the subject. Donor inclusion 1. Able to provide and sign informed consent. 2. Able to complete and sign the donor questionnaire 3. Able to adhere to fecal transplantation stool collection standard operating procedure. Donor exclusion 1.

History of gastrointestinal comorbidities, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation or diarrhea 6. Receipt of blood transfusion from a country other than Canada in preceding 6 months 7. Antibiotic use or any systemic immunosuppressive agents in the 3 months prior to stool donation 8. Receipt of any type of live vaccine within 3 months prior to stool donation 9. Ingestion of nut or shell fish 3 days preceding donation if the recipient has known allergies to these food. 10. Any current or previous medical or psychosocial condition or behaviours which in the opinion of the investigator may pose risk to the recipients or the donor</criteria>
