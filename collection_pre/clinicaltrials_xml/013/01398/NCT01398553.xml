	<brief_summary>The Armeo Spring has proven its effectiveness in the rehabilitation of acute stroke patients. It neutralizes limb weight, enabling patients to use residual control in both arm and hand and to follow exercises guided by simulations of real-life challenges. The Armeo Spring incorporates wrist pronation and supination, allowing patients to enhance functional reaching patterns. Aim of the study is to compare the Armeo device with standard physiotherapy in chronic patients with acquired brain lesions. The result of the trial should show which treatment is more effective in the clinical practice. A significant better outcome of one arm should suggest to follow one treatment strategy more than the other.</brief_summary>
