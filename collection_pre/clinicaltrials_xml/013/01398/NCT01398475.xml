	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the effect of three formulations on the relative bioavailability of LY3009104. Subjects will receive single dose of LY3009104 on 4 separate occasions with and without food. Safety evaluation and serial Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected during each treatment period. Approximately 5-7 days of washout period between each treatment and a follow-up visit will occur approximately 5 to 7 days after the last dose of study drug.</brief_summary>
