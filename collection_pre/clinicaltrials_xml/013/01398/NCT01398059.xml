	<brief_title>The Metabolic Effects of Breaks in Sedentary Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>North American children spend the majority of their waking hours engaging in sedentary behavior (e.g. sitting). Research in adults and animal models suggests that even short bouts of uninterrupted siting may result in acute changes increases in cardiometabolic risk, although to date no studies have investigated this relationship in children and youth. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a protocol which will expose participants aged 10-14 years to a full day of uninterrupted sitting, and to determine the impact of this protocol on markers of cardiometabolic risk (insulin, glucose, triglyceride, HDL-C and LDL-C) as well as subsequent food intake and physical activity. The impact of uninterrupted sitting will be compared to the impact of interrupted sitting, with and without the inclusion of moderate physical activity.</detailed_description>
