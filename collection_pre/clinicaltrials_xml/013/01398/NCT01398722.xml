	<brief_title>Effect of Intensive Insulin Therapy on Clinical Prognosis of Infants Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies showed that tight blood glucose control with insulin during intensive care reduced morbidity and mortality of surgical and medical intensive care patients. Blood sugar control with intravenous insulin may improve prognosis of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is not clear what the best insulin regimen is or what is the best blood sugar target in these patients. So far, most of researches have focused on adult patients but little on infants. The current prospective, randomized, controlled study will assess the impact of intensive insulin therapy on the outcome of infants undergoing cardiac surgery. On admission, patients will be randomly assigned to either strict normalization of blood glucose ( 110-150 mg/dl) with intensive insulin therapy or the conventional approach, in which blood glucose levels are maintained between 150 and 180 mg/dl.</detailed_description>
