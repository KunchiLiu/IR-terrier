	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to analyse the concentration dopamine and serotonin in thrombocytes of patients with renal cell carcinoma and neuro-endocrine tumours compared to the concentrations of these catecholamines in healthy volunteers. The concentration dopamine and serotonin in thrombocytes with and without medication will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
