	<brief_title>INV-144 Versus Losartan in Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients With Macroalbuminuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-control trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INV-144 versus losartan plus placebo co-administered once daily for 12 weeks in subjects who have type 2 diabetes and hypertension with nephropathy as evidenced by albuminuria. Approximately 92 adult subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either INV-144 or losartan plus placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The goal is to have approximately 80 subjects complete the entire study. The trial will consist of a 4-week open-label losartan run-in period, a 12-week double-blind active treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up period. Efficacy will be evaluated by measurement of UACR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the HOMA-IR ratio. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by evaluation of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations (PEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained in a subset of approximately 22 subjects, at 2 to 4 sites, to ensure that PK data are obtained from a minimum of 9 subjects in each treatment arm.</detailed_description>
