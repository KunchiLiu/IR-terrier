	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to learn more about the metabolic consequences of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a in children, adolescents and adults with this condition. People with pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a are at risk for development of obesity. To better understand the cause of overweight or obesity, investigators are measuring body composition and resting energy expenditure (REE), which is the amount of calories burned while completely at rest. The investigators also want to determine the amount of body fat.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in Pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a (PHP1a) is a disorder that is associated with many endocrine problems. People with PHP1a are at risk for the development of obesity. The objective of the study will help determine if obesity is related to abnormalities energy expenditure, meaning that people with PHP1a may not burn as many calories while at rest as those without the disorder. In order to further evaluate obesity in PHP1a, investigators are planning to measure resting energy expenditure (REE), which is the amount of calories burned while completely at rest. Investigators will also evaluate body composition by looking at measures of growth and development and determining the amount of body fat using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as well as blood and urine biologic markers of obesity. The investigators plan to evaluate people with PHP1a at all weights.</detailed_description>
