	<brief_summary>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism, resulting in excessive iron overload. Phlebotomy is currently the standard therapy. More recently Therapeutic Erythrocytapheresis (TE) has become a new therapeutic modality, which potentially offers a more efficient method to remove iron overload with fewer procedures.In the proposed clinical trial the investigators will examine whether TE can keep the ferritin levels in patients requiring maintenance therapy below 50 microg/L, with minimally half the number of treatment procedures when compared to current standard therapy by P.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erythrocytapheresis Versus Phlebotomy as Maintenance Therapy in Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research population exists of patients with HH ( by genetic analysis confirmed as homozygous for C282Y) living in south-east of the Netherlands and currently treated with phlebotomy as maintenance treatment to keep their serum ferritin levels &lt; 50 ug/l. Ferritin level at start of the inclusion between 30-50ug/l. Exclusion criteria are: patient receiving other therapies such as chelating therapy or forced dietary regimen, further patients with excessive overweight (BMI&gt;35). After enrollment the patients will be randomized to start either with TE or continue with P. After a year of treatment and being at a serum ferritin level &lt;50ug/l, patients will continue the study but then being treated with the other of the two treatments. Randomization will be done by blocked randomization.</detailed_description>
