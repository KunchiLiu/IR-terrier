	<brief_summary>Background —Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with restricted physical capacity, limited quality of life, and a poor prognosis because of right heart failure. The present study is the first prospective randomized study to evaluate the effects of exercise and respiratory training in patients with severe symptomatic PH. Methods —Patients with PH on stable disease-targeted medication will be randomly assigned to a control and a primary training group. Medication will remain unchanged during the study period. Primary end points will be the changes from baseline to week 15 in the distance walked in 6 minutes and in scores of the Short Form Health Survey quality-of-life questionnaire. Changes in WHO functional class, Borg scale, and parameters of echocardiography and gas exchange also will be assessed. Prospects —We hope this study will indicate that respiratory and physical training are a promising adjunct to medical treatment in severe PH.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with severe chronic PH who were stable and compensated under optimized medical therapy (such as endothelin antagonists, iloprost, sildenafil, calcium channel blockers, anticoagulants, diuretics, and supplemental oxygen) for at least 3 months before entering the study will be invited to participate. Additional inclusion criteria will be age of between 18 and 75 years and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II to IV. Patients with recent syncope or skeletal or muscle abnormalities prohibiting participation in an exercise program won't be included.</criteria>
