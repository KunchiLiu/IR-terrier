	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Cosmetic Performance of AIR OPTIX® COLORS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this non-dispensing trial, each participant wore 4 pairs of color contact lenses (gray, blue, green, hazel) sequentially for less than 10 minutes each in a contralateral fashion (test lens in one eye, control lens in the other eye). Randomization took place for each of the 4 pairs of lenses as to which eye (left or right) wore the test and which wore the control. Participants were selected based on eye color (dark vs light/medium). The primary analysis population (AP1) was pre-specified as participants of any eye color who habitually wore FRESHLOOK® COLORBLENDS lenses in one of the four colors tested in this trial. Pair 1 lenses were dispensed per the participant's habitual lens color.</detailed_description>
