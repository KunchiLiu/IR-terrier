	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-evaluator study that will evaluate the effectiveness of a surgical sealant (CoSeal) composed of biocompatible polyethylene glycol on the formation of mediastinal and pericardial adhesions in children undergoing staged surgical reconstruction (potential procedures include: Blalock-Taussig Type Operation, Classical Glenn Procedure, Bidirectional Glenn Procedure, Norwood). Additionally, bleeding will be evaluated by drainage post-operatively through surgical site drainage output.</brief_summary>
