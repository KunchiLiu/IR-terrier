	<brief_title>Single Agent Armodafinil for Patient-Reported Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Armodafinil is designed to stimulate the central nervous system, which may increase wakefulness and reduce fatigue. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect. Study Groups: If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 will take armodafinil. Group 2 will take a placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredients. Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving. Study Drug Administration: You will take the study drug/placebo every day for 4 weeks starting the morning after you have enrolled in this study. You will take the study drug/placebo in the morning with a full glass (8 ounces) of water. You may take the study drug/placebo with or without food. If the dose causes an upset stomach, you should take it with food. If you have trouble swallowing the dose of study drug/placebo, the study staff will tell you of different ways of taking it. You will be given a pamphlet with more information about how to take the study drug/placebo. Symptom Questionnaires: Before you start taking the study drug/placebo, the following tests and procedures will be performed: Â° You will complete 6 questionnaires about your fatigue, sleepiness, and other symptoms as well as your quality of life and your ability to work. These questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete total. Throughout the study, you will complete 2 of the symptom questionnaires listed above 2 times every week while you are on study, including during the Open-label Extension Phase (described below). You may complete the questionnaires over the phone using the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or with a member of the study staff. Another option is to complete the questionnaires during a routinely scheduled visit outside of this study. If you complete the questionnaires over the phone, the study staff or the IVR system will call you at a time that is convenient for you. If the questionnaires are completed through the IVR system, the study staff will give you the information you need to report your symptoms by using the system. If the questionnaires are completed with the study staff, she/he will ask you the questions and record your answers on paper or enter them into a computer. When you complete the questionnaires for the second time each week, you will also be asked if you are taking your study drug/placebo as instructed and you will be asked about any side effects you may be having. If the questionnaires were completed through the IVR system, the study staff will contact you and ask you if you are taking your study drug/placebo as instructed and about any side effects you may be having. At the end of Week 4, you will complete the same set of 6 questionnaires that you completed at the beginning of the study. You will also complete a questionnaire about your thoughts on the study drug/placebo. You will also be asked about any changes in drugs (both prescribed and over the counter) that you may be taking. This should take about 30 minutes. Open-label Extension: At the end of Week 4, if you were in Group 1 and you did not have any intolerable side effects, you will be able to continue taking armodafinil for an additional 4 weeks. If you were in Group 2 and you did not have any intolerable side effects, you will be given the option to begin receiving armodafinil for 4 weeks. No matter what you choose, you will not be told whether you were taking the study drug or the placebo during the first 4 weeks of the study. If you are in the open-label extension phase, at the end of Week 8, you will complete the same set of 6 questionnaires that you completed at the beginning of the study. You will also complete a questionnaire about your thoughts on the study drug/placebo. This should take about 30 minutes. Length of Treatment: You will receive the study drug/placebo for either 4 or 8 weeks. You will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur or if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Follow-Up: After your last dose of the study drug/placebo, you will continue to complete 2 symptom questionnaires for another 4 weeks. The last time you complete the 2 questionnaires, you will complete an additional 3 questionnaires that you completed at the beginning of the study. This is an investigational study. Armodafinil is FDA-approved and commercially available to treat narcolepsy (falling asleep at unexpected times), obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. It is also FDA-approved and commercially available to treat sleepiness in patients with excessive sleepiness. Its use in this study is investigational. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. Up to 25 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
