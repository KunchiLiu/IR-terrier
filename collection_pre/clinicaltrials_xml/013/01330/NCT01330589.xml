	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients post PCI receiving clopidogrel who are carriers of at least one CYP 2C19 loss-of-function allele may achieve improved pharmacodynamic efficacy of clopidogrel when treated with the CYP 2C19 enzyme inducing agent, St. John's wort, as compared with placebo. Hypothesis 1. Reduced platelet reactivity is present in patients receiving St. John's wort as compared to placebo when utilized in combination with clopidogrel 2. The combination or St. John's wort and clopidogrel results in enhanced platelet inhibition</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients post PCI receiving clopidogrel who are carriers of at least one CYP 2C19 loss-of-function allele may achieve improved pharmacodynamic efficacy of clopidogrel when treated with the CYP 2C19 enzyme inducing agent, St. John's wort, as compared with placebo. Specific Aims 1. To identify the difference in platelet reactivity in patients receiving St. John's wort or placebo 2. To characterize the difference in platelet inhibition in patients receiving St. John's wort or placebo Hypothesis 1. Reduced platelet reactivity is present in patients receiving St. John's wort as compared to placebo when utilized in combination with clopidogrel 2. The combination or St. John's wort and clopidogrel results in enhanced platelet inhibition Study Design The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of patients post PCI who require dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Approximately 84 patients will be enrolled and undergo pharmacogenetic testing to assess clopidogrel responsiveness utilizing CYP P450 2C19 genotyping (PlavitestÂ®). Based upon an assumption of 30% genetic non-responsiveness and a dropout rate of 20%, to achieve a final sample size of 20 subjects in the randomized crossover portion of the study, the investigators need to enroll approximately 84 subjects. Patients identified as carriers of at least one CYP 2C19 loss-of-function allele (i.e. clopidogrel reduced-metabolizers) will remain in the study and be randomly assigned to receive placebo or St. John's wort. Patients not carrying a CYP 2C19 loss-of-function allele (i.e. clopidogrel normal metabolizers) will not require any further follow-up as these patients are considered to display a normal response to clopidogrel. On day 7 following the initiation of the study drug, platelet function testing will be performed. Following a 7 day washout period, patients will be crossed over into the other study group to receive 7 days of study medication. On day 21, the patients will undergo platelet function testing and the study medication will be discontinued.</detailed_description>
