	<detailed_description>The study involves tree MRI sessions, two FDG-PET-CT sessions and one FMISO-PET session. The FMISO-PET session is presently not carried out because of delivery problems. The production of 18F-fluoromisonidazol at The Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Denmark has not jet been approved by the Danish Medicines Agency.</detailed_description>
