	<brief_summary>The purpose of this 2-year pilot study is to explore the impact of deployment on the psychosocial and health characteristics and reintegration of Military Chaplains, specifically those of the Army National Guard (ARNG). This pilot will serve as the foundation for subsequent investigations of chaplains from multiple branches of the military. In addition to spiritual and religious support, Military Chaplains play a key role in the behavioral health of deployed service-members, routinely participating in suicide prevention training, conducting critical event debriefing, and identifying service-members at risk for combat and operational stress reactions1. A high risk group for exposure to trauma2, Military Chaplains have suffered brain injuries, gunshot wounds and blast injuries in OEF/OIF Theater3. In addition, many report combat related stress issues such as compassion fatigue, PTSD, and reintegration issues3. While the traumatic experiences of OEF/OIF deployed troops have been well documented, the effects on military chaplains caring for these service-members have received little attention in the research to date. We are collaborating with the National Guard Chaplain Corps Leadership on this program of research. The aims of this 2-year pilot cross-sectional study focus on describing and exploring deployment and its impact on psychosocial, health characteristics and reintegration of ARNG chaplains using a mixed method approach (web-based survey, in-depth interviews, social network analysis).</brief_summary>
