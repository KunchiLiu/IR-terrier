	<brief_title>Spine Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) for the Assessment of Osteoporosis on Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to measure bone mass in children with SLE using different measurement techniques. Children with chronic illnesses are at risk of bone fragility. This is important because bone fragility can result in childhood fractures especially children with SLE. Therefore better diagnosis technique can lead to better management of bone health.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For SLE subjects: Subjects age 521 drawn from rheumatology clinic at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia diagnosed with SLE for at least 1 month. Also subjects with no known vertebral compression fracture of L2. For Control subjects: Subjects age 521. Controls will be a 50% male/female. For SLE subjects: Subjects with SLE will be excluded if they have conditions or drug exposure unrelated to SLE and known to impact growth or bone health. For Control subjects: Chronic disease or syndrome known to affect growth or bone health, prematurity (&lt;37 weeks gestation), or use of any medication known to affect growth.</criteria>
