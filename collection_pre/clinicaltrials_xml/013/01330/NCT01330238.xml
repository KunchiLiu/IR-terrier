	<brief_summary>Modic changes are associated with low back pain (LBP) both in clinical and general population-based samples. Type I changes are regarded as more likely to be painful than type II changes. Several studies suggest that type I changes are inflammatory in nature.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Zoledronic Acid in Modic Changes-related Low Back Pain (LBP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>So far, no treatment exists for LBP due to Modic changes. Bisphosphonates could be effective in this specific low back disorder through two mechanisms: 1) they could consolidate vertebral bodies thereby improving the tolerance for mechanical load and 2) they could diminish inflammation as observed recently in case of ibandronate in an experimental model.</detailed_description>
