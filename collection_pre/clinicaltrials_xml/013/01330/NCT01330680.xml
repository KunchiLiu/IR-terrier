	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular and neuropsychologic effects of coffee are still debated. The precise mechanism underlying the actions of caffeine on the cardiovascular and neuropsychologic systems is incompletely understood and a considerable variability in the response to coffee drinking was observed, in part ascribable to a genetic trait. The aim of the study is to evaluate acute cardiovascular and neuropsychologic effects of coffee and explore whether such effects are influenced by the genetic asset of caffeine metabolism (by a polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 1A2), adenosine metabolism (by polymorphisms of adenosine receptor and adenosine monophosphate deaminase) or catecholamine receptors (by polymorphisms of adrenergic receptors).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Determinants of Cardiovascular Response to Coffee Drinking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coffee is among the most widely consumed beverages worldwide. Despite the relationship between coffee consumption and the incidence of cardiovascular disease has been studied extensively, the effects of this drink on the cardiovascular apparatus and its role as a risk factor for coronary heart disease are still debated. Moreover, the effect of coffee on attention, sleep changes, anxiety and panic disorders was studied but a great variability was observed. Many of the known or suspected cardiovascular and neuropsychologic effects of coffee have been attributed to caffeine. The main mechanism of action of caffeine is to antagonize adenosine receptors; a secondary effect is the inhibition of phosphodiesterases, with the subsequent accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and a intensification of the effects of catecholamines. It is also well known that there is a considerable variability in the cardiovascular and neuropsychologic response to coffee drinking, explaining the inconsistency between different effects observed in the various studies. This variability may have a genetic basis. The aim of the study is to evaluate acute cardiovascular and neuropsychologic effects of coffee and explore whether such effects are influenced by the genetic asset of caffeine metabolism (by a polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 1A2), adenosine metabolism (by polymorphisms of adenosine receptor and adenosine monophosphate deaminase) or catecholamine receptors (by polymorphisms of adrenergic receptors).</detailed_description>
