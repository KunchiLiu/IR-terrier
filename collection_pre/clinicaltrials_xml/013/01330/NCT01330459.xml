	<brief_title>Hydrocodone For Pain Control in First Trimester Surgical Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to conduct a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of 120 women undergoing elective first trimester surgical abortion. These women will be premedicated with either two tabs of 5/350 hydrocodone/acetaminophen or 2 tabs of a placebo. All subjects will receive ibuprofen and lorazepam preoperatively and a PCB. This study will examine the incremental benefit of HC/APAP over this standard medication regimen. Randomization will be stratified into two groups. Subjects less than 8 weeks gestation will comprise the early gestational age group. Subjects between 8 weeks 0 days and 10 weeks 6 days will comprise the late gestational age group. The investigators will be assessing patient perception of pain, nausea, satisfaction, and anxiety at multiple points during the clinic visit using 100-mm visual analogue scales (VAS).</detailed_description>
