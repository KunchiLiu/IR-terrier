	<brief_title>Efficacy of Intraoperative Surgical Scrubbing in Reducing Bacterial Load After Nail Removal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators conducted a controlled, prospective randomized study to examine the antiseptic efficacy of intraoperative scrubbing methods during nail avulsion surgery. The investigators compared intraoperative antiseptic scrubbing using 0.9% saline solution and 0.1% polihexanide. Swab samples were taken from each patient at 5 distinct stages throughout the surgical procedure, and bacterial culture analysis was performed (positive culture rate, total inocula count, reduction of bacterial load, and identification of specific microorganisms).</detailed_description>
