	<detailed_description>Kyphosis is usually a developmental deformity of the spine in the sagittal plane. Once diagnosed, serial X-rays are used for followup. These are usually required at yearly intervals. SPINESCAN® is a computerized digital inclinometer, design for evaluating angular spine deformities. Patients examined in the spine clinic with recent X-rays will be examined with SPINESCAN® and it's results compared with the classical radiological assessment.</detailed_description>
