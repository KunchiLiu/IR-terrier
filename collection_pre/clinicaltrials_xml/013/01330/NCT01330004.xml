	<brief_summary>Hyper- and hypotension are important predictors of survival in non-ESRD (end stage renal disease) population. In dialysis patients, however, it has been shown that higher blood pressure levels may actually be beneficial to patient outcomes. Dynamics of blood pressure evolution over time has not been previously studied in dialysis population. The investigators aim to understand how both blood pressure levels and blood pressure changes over time predict patient survival.</brief_summary>
