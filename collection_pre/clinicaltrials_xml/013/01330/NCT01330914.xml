	<brief_summary>Obesity is a chronic illness of staggering proportions. Because weight loss through diet and exercise is difficult to attain and maintain, there has been escalating interest in bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Gastric bypass surgery results in long-term weight loss, dramatic improvement in comorbidities such as diabetes, and decreased mortality. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that gastric bypass may have negative effects on bone health. Because of the serious consequences of osteoporosis and fracture, this is of great concern. This study of the effects of gastric bypass on calcium metabolism and the skeleton may positively impact the clinical care of gastric bypass patients by their surgeons, primary care providers, and endocrinologists. Further, the knowledge gained may inform future investigation into the relationships between obesity, weight loss, and bone biology.</brief_summary>
