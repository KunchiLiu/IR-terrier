	<criteria>Written informed consent. Age &gt; or = to 18 years. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of conventional chondrosarcoma of any grade. Surgically unresectable or metastatic disease. Any number of prior treatment regimens, including treatment naive subjects. Prior treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is permitted. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Measurable or evaluable (nonmeasurable) disease per RECIST guidelines version 1.1. Adequate organ system function determined within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50% or the institutional LLN within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Females must either be of nonchild bearing potential or have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Prior treatment with pazopanib. Mesenchymal, dedifferentiated, and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma subtypes. Prior malignancy (Note: subjects who have had another malignancy and have been diseasefree for 3 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible). History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, unless previously treated, asymptomatic, and off steroids and antiseizure medication for 6 months prior to first dose of study drug. Clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may increase the risk for GI bleeding. Clinically significant GI abnormalities that may affect absorption of investigational product. Presence of uncontrolled infection. Corrected QT interval &gt; 480 msecs using Bazett's formula. History of certain cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months. Poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure of &gt; or = 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of &gt; or = 90 mmHg]. History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, or untreated deep venous thrombosis within the past 6 months. Prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug and/or presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. Hemoptysis in excess of 2.5 mL within 8 weeks of first dose of study drug. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other condition that could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications for at least 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of study treatment. Radiation therapy, surgery (except major surgery), tumor embolization, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy, or hormonal therapy within 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anticancer therapy that is &gt; Grade 1 and/or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to pazopanib or excipients that contraindicates participation.</criteria>
