	<brief_summary>The study's chief objective is to observe the evolution of cellular (in terms of expression of transmembrane transporters and their transcriptional regulators) and viral resistance (in terms of development of mutations in the HIV genome that may confer resistance to future treatment for HIV) in HIV-infected patients with lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study team will take two or three tubes of blood on three occasions during the course of chemotherapy. The total amount of blood required for this research project is 64mL (approximately 4 tablespoons). This will allow better understanding of the changes that take place in the blood and the HIV virus itself. It is hoped that this will provide new insights that may aid the understanding and treatment of HIV patients with lymphoma.</detailed_description>
