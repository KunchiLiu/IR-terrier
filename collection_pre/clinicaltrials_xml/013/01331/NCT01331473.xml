	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of new ischemic brain injury detectable on MRI after carotid artery stenting between patients treated with proximal cerebral protection (Gore Flow Reversal System) and without cerebral protection. Secondary Objective: Impact of MRI-morphology of atherosclerotic plaque to the rate of new hyperintense diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) lesion on the post-treatment scan and to the rate of ipsilateral stroke or death.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female ≥ 18 years old; Suitable/Eligible for carotid artery revascularization; Significant artery stenosis in symptomatic patients defined as ≥ 50% of the artery diameter (%DS) or asymptomatic ≥ 80 %DS by angiography. Symptomatic is defined as a carotid artery stenosis associated with ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (TIA), amaurosis fugax, ischemic stroke or retinal infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment. Adequate clinical conditions to perform DWMRI. Ability of the individual to understand the character and the consequences of clinical trial. Signed and dated informed consent provided before the beginning of any intervention. Negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) and contraception use for any woman of childbearing age. Systematic contraceptives (oral, implant, injection) and diaphragm or condoms with spermicidal are considered reliable. Women who have undergone bilateral oophorectomy or/and hysterectomy or women status postmenopausal for at least two years are eligible for this trial. Intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, or stroke with mass effect demonstrated on CT scan or MRI within 30 days of the index procedure. Persisting ischemic stroke (defined as either a score &gt; 15 on the NIH stroke scale, a Rankin score &gt; 3 or a Barthel score &lt; 60 measured within one week prior to study entry). Intracranial mass lesion (i.e., abscess, tumor, or other infection). peripheral vascular, supraaortic or internal carotid artery tortuosity precluding the use of catheterbased techniques required for successful results. Lactation. Arteriovenous malformation in the territory of the target carotid artery. Any disease or medication that affects local hemostasis, Participation in other clinical trials during the present clinical trial or within the last month. Medical or psychological condition that would not permit completion of the trial or signing of informed consent.</criteria>
