	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess the impact of three months of treatment with an active vitamin D analogue on a risk marker for excess overall mortality and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality in Type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease. The hypothesis is that active vitamin D analogue treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetic kidney disease.</brief_summary>
