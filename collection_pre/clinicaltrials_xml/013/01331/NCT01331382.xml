	<brief_summary>Resveratrol is associated with a plethora of physiological effects in humans, including modulation of cerebral blood flow, despite apparently poor bioavailability. This study investigated whether the physiological effects of resveratrol could be affected when co-supplemented with piperine, an alkaloid which may be able to enhance the bioavailability of resveratrol.</brief_summary>
