	<brief_summary>To evaluate COPD-related clinical outcomes and total healthcare utilization in commercially insured (at least 40 years with a subanalysis of those aged 65 years and older) COPD population associated with the use of fluticasone/salmeterol combination (FSC) 250/50mcg compared to other initial maintenance therapies (IMTs), specifically, tiotropium bromide (TIO), and either ipratropium bromide or ipratropium bromide/albuterol (IP). This is a hypothesis testing study Ho: There is no difference in time to first COPD-related events between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Ha: There is a difference in time to first COPD-related events between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was: Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Ha: There is a difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes and Costs Associated With Initiating Maintenance Treatment With Fluticasone Propionate 250mcg/Salmeterol Xinafoate 50mcg Combination (FSC) Versus Anticholinergics Including Tiotropium (TIO) in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All population i.e. at least 40 years: Each initial maintenance treatment (IMT) cohort (FSC 250/50mcg dose only, IP, and TIO) includes patients aged 40 years and older with at least 9 months of continuous enrollment (6 months pre-index and at least three months post-index) with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD [International Classification of Disease, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 491.xx, 492.xx or 496.xx]. Patients are observed such that everyone provides minimum 6 months of pre index baseline data and minimum 3 months post index (risk analysis) and minimum 12 months post index for cost analysis. Patients must receive either a 30-day supply of FSC or IP or TIO as the initial IMT medication, indicating "intent to treat." Patients may not also have a prescription filled for the other IMT medication within 60 days of the index date, or for the combination therapy budesonide/ formoterol (BFC), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a long acting beta agonist (LABA). Six months of observation (continuous enrollment) prior to the index date is assessed to confirm that the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as to identify baseline characteristics and covariates. Cost analysis was done using a 12 months fixed follow up period. Outcome measures are assessed during the post-index period Elderly cohort 65+: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged 65 years and over except comparison was FSC vs. TIO only. 75+ cohort: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged 75 years and over except comparison was FSC vs. TIO only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria IMT Cohorts (subjects selected by order of criteria) claim for one of the study medications and must not receive another study medication within 60 days of the initial maintenance therapy, indicating "intent to treat." at least one COPDrelated ED or one COPDrelated hospitalization, or two COPDrelated outpatient visits (OV) associated with primary or secondary diagnosis for COPD (ICD9CM code 491.xx, 492.xx or 496.xx), at any time during the observation period (July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2008) in the database. Aged 65+ years on the index date or aged 40 and over for the subanalysis. Continuous enrollment in a health plan for at least 6 months prior (preindex) to initiation of IMT and at least three months after the first initiation of IMT (postindex). at least one prescription claim in the preindex and each year of the postindex period for which they have followup. Exclusion Criteria All Cohorts primary or secondary diagnosis of respiratory tract cancer (larynx, trachea, or pleura). (ICD9CM codes 161, 161.X, 162, 163, 163.X, 231, 231.X). In the preindex period, no claims for any of the cohort IMT medications, nor for any other Advair or budesonide/formoterol fixed dose combination, FSC combination medications, and may only have respiratory medication pharmacy claims for drugs included in the preindex severity of illness assessment (Methylxanthines, Leukotriene Modifiers/Inhibitors, Omalizumab and Mast Cell Stabilizers).</criteria>
