	<brief_summary>The aim of this research was to determine the existence of a correlation between the degree of temporomandibular dysfunction and cervical posture in different occlusal classes in adolescents. A cross-section, observational study was carried out, in which 296 adolescents took part. For the evaluation, the patients were divided into groups according to the presence and severity of the temporomandibular dysfunction, using a questionnaire and occlusal Angle classification. The posture analysis was carried out using photogrammetry and the software AlcimageÂ® to measure the predefined angle based on the protuberances of the Spinous Process of the 7th Cervical Vertebra (C7), Manubrium of the sternum and Mentum Vertex.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The evaluation of signs and symptoms of TMD was obtained from a Questionnaire (15) which includes information regarding difficulties opening the mouth and movement of the mandible, pains in the head, nape of the neck, neck or joint regions, noise in the temporomandibular joints, and the habit of clenching or grinding the teeth. The questionnaire is comprised of 10 questions with possible answers of yes (10 points), sometimes (5 points) and no (0 points). For each question, only one answer can be checked. The total score is used to classify the severity of the TMD as severe (70 to 100 points), moderate (45 to 65), mild (20 to 40) and no dysfunction (0 to 15). The clinical (visual) assessment of head posture was conducted using a postural grid. Each subject was asked to remain in his or her normal posture, in a standing position. The self balance position was used to standardize the posture of each subject, asking them to look straight ahead, parallel to the floor, keeping the gaze horizontal</detailed_description>
