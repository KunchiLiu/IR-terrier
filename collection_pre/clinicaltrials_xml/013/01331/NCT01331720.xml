	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of 5 mixed protocols of ovarian hyperstimulation with urinary gonadotrophins to achieve clinical pregnancy in females undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (IVF/ICSI) (in-vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection). Study hypothesis: mixed protocols with urinary FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and urinary hMG (human menopausal gonadotropin)should be more effective than monotherapy.</brief_summary>
