	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of high exposure to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) from the use of Asacol with clinical and intermediate markers of male fertility, including semen quality, sperm DNA damage, transcript profiles of sperm mRNA and sncRNAs, and reproductive hormones. Hypothesis 1: High exposure to DBP from the use of Asacol is associated with decreased sperm concentration and motility, and increased sperm DNA damage. Hypothesis 2: High exposure to DBP from the use of Asacol is associated with decreased serum testosterone, altered LH:testosterone ratio, and decreased inhibin-B. Hypothesis 3: High exposure to DBP from the use of Asacol is associated with altered transcript profiles of sperm mRNAs and sncRNAs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesalamine and Reproductive Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 2 ways you can participate in the study. OPTION 1 involves 6 one-hour visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Andrology Clinic over a 9 month period. At each visit you would be asked to fill out questionnaires and to provide a urine, semen, and blood sample. Following Visit 2, you are asked to switch your brand of mesalamine medication. After 4 months, you change back to your original brand of medication. The change in medication will be done in consultation with your primary GI doctor. If the cost of co-payment is greater for the new brand of medication, we will provide compensation to cover the difference. In the case you do not have prescription drug health insurance coverage, the study will reimburse up to $4000 to cover the cost for Asacol, Pentasa or Lialda medication taken during your study participation. OPTION 2 involves 4 one-hour visits to MGH Andrology clinic. At each visit you complete questionnaires and provide a blood, urine and semen sample. You are eligible for Option 2 if you are currently taking Asacol or Asacol HD and do not want to change your medication.</detailed_description>
