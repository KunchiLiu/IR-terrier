	<brief_summary>The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary artery disease has led to a significant reduction in morbidity but there are further demands on DES performance. Such demands are an optimized performance in very challenging coronary lesions; third generation DES were developed in an effort to further improve DES performance in such challenging lesions. Two CE-certified third generation DES (Resolute Integrity and Promus Element stents) are currently available; there are no data that indicate an advantage of one of these DES over the other.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Minimum age of 18 years; Coronary artery disease and lesion(s) eligible for treatment with drug eluting stents according to clinical guidelines and/or the operators' judgement; Patient is willing and able to cooperate with study procedures and required followup visits; and patient has been informed and agrees on the participation by signing an EC approved written informed consent. Participation in another randomized drug or device study before reaching primary endpoint; Planned surgery within 6 months of PCI unless dual antiplatelet therapy is maintained throughout the perisurgical period; Intolerance to a P2Y12 receptor antagonist that results in the patient's inability to adhere to dualantiplatelet therapy, or intolerance to aspirin, heparin, or components of the two DES examined; Known pregnancy; Life expectancy of less than 1 year.</criteria>
