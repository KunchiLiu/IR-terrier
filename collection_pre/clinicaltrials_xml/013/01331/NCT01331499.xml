	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare standard of care hemostasis techniques with and without the use of Aquamantys in reducing peri-operative blood loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salient Aquamantys Spine Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of Aquamantys in reducing peri-operative blood loss compared with standard electrocautery Secondary objectives include : - Rate and volume of transfusions - Evaluating the reduction in hemoglobin and hematocrit values post- operatively - LOS costs, and operative time - Gathering operator feedback on qualitative criteria, including ease of use and surgical visualization between the two treatment groups</detailed_description>
