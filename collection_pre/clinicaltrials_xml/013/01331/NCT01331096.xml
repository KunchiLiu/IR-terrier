	<brief_summary>Patients in Pisa will undergo thyroid gland surgery. In the protocol group anesthesia will be performed using an automated anesthesia delivery system; preoperative and intra-operative assessment of patients will be performed via video-conferencing from Montreal, which will also monitor and control anesthesia delivery via distant Internet connection - as supervision of functioning of the automated anesthesia delivery system. In the control group anesthesia will be performed in a standard fashion with manual control of the syringe pumps infusing anesthetics drugs. The hypothesis is that Tele-anesthesia, considered as preoperative assessment and anesthetic control of an automated anesthesia delivery system is feasible and reliable via standard means of internet communication (distant control via virtual network) and performed as well or even better than manual control of the anesthetic drugs infusion.</brief_summary>
