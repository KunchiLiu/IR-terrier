	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1, open-label pharmacokinetic study where up to 40 subjects with advanced solid tumors (up to 6-10 with normal renal function and up to 18-30 with varying degrees of renal dysfunction) will receive weekly doses of AMG 386 intravenously. The primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single agent AMG 386 in subjects with various degrees of renal function. Once the AMG 386 PK characterization is complete in the first 5 weeks of the study, all subjects will be allowed to continue to receive AMG 386 weekly only or subjects in group 1, 2 or 3 can opt to receive AMG 386 weekly in combination with paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.</brief_summary>

Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence (men, women); vasectomy or a condom with spermicide (men) in combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or IUD (women). Women who are lactating/breastfeeding. Women with a positive pregnancy test.</criteria>
