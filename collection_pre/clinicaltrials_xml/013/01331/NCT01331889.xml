	<brief_summary>Rapid infusion of red blood cells is known to result in hyperkalemia in the body. However, potassium concentration in the blood mixture (usually made of RBC, FFP and normal saline) in the reservoir of rapid infusion system and its effect on the plasma potassium change during rapid transfusion are unknown. This study is designed to investigate these changes while massive transfusion is performed during liver transplantation surgery.</brief_summary>
