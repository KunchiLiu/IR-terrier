	<brief_summary>Childhood tuberculosis (TB) accounts for 11% of the total 9 million annual TB cases and the difficulty of its diagnosis is increased in case of HIV infection in children. The aim of this study is to improve TB diagnosis in HIV-infected children by developing a new diagnostic algorithm incorporating new tools available such as: - interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), as alternative to the tuberculin skin test - alternative specimen collection methods such as string test (or Enterotest (R)), nasopharyngeal aspirates and stools samples, as alternatives to gastric aspirate - the Xpert MTB/RIF assay</brief_summary>
