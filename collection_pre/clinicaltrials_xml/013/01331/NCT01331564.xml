	<detailed_description>This study seeks to expand the understanding of how to slow the accumulation of weight in childbearing women. The intervention goals are to decrease the prevalence of excessive pregnancy weight gain and mean weight retention in the first 18 months postpartum in socio-economically and racially/ethnically diverse sample of 1,641 pregnant women. Women will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Intervention Group 1 will receive the intervention program only during pregnancy (e-intervention 1). Intervention Group 2 will receive e-intervention 1 plus intervention for 18 months postpartum (e-intervention 2). Control women will receive non-weight related content during both time periods at the project website. The primary hypotheses for the randomized controlled trial are: H1: The proportion of women in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 who gain more weight in pregnancy than is recommended by the IOM will be 33% less than the proportion of the women in the Control Group who gain excessively and H2: The Control Group will have a higher mean weight retention at 12 months postpartum than Intervention Groups 1 and 2.</detailed_description>
