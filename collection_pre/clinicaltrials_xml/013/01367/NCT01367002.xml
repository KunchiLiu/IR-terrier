	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to estimate whether the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy improves progression free survival when compared to paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in Uterine Serous Papillary Carcinoma (USPC) patients overexpressing Her2/neu at 3+ level by immunohistochemistry (IHC)or positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With and Without Trastuzumab (Herceptin) in Uterine Serous Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized Phase II evaluation of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel with or without Trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with HER2/neu+ advanced stage/recurrent disease with an emphasis on determining the progression free survival in USPC patients and assessing immunologic markers predictive of trastuzumab response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have advanced (stage IIIIV) or recurrent histologically confirmed USPC with measurable disease. Patients must harbor a tumor HER2/neu+ based upon IHC staining score of 3+ or 2+ with confirmed gene amplification by FISH Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancers, significant history of cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable medical issue, brain leptomeningeal, prior therapy with trastuzumab, uncontrolled seizure disorder, seropositive for HIV, active hepatitis, hemorrhagic diathesis or requiring supplemental oxygen.</criteria>
