	<brief_summary>In the following randomized non-crossover study, the investigators test the hypothesis that directly measured mucosal pressure differ between the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Supreme and the i-Gel in paralyzed anesthetized females. Thirty females aged 19-65 years were randomly allocated to receive either the size 4 LMA Supreme or i-Gel for airway management. Microchip sensors were attached to the LMA Supreme/i-Gel at four locations corresponding to the A, base of tongue; B, distal oropharynx; C, hypopharynx; and D, pyriform fossa. Insertion success rate and oropharyngeal leak pressure were also measured.</brief_summary>
