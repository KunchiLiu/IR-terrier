	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether a technology-enhanced version of an established behavioral treatment protocol, Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC; McMahon &amp; Forehand), enhances the engagement and treatment outcomes of lower income parents of 3 to 8 children with externalizing problems in treatment. It is predicted that families in both the HNC and technology-enhanced HNC (TE-HNC) programs will evidence significant improvement in parenting behavior and child externalizing problems; however, it is predicted that parent-child dyads in the TE-HNC program will require fewer sessions, will be more likely to be retained in the program, will be more likely to remain engaged in the program (e.g., practicing skills between sessions etc.), and will be more likely to have active involvement from their coparenting partners (i.e., other adults and family members who participate in childrearing).In turn, it is expected that the TE-HNC program will boost treatment outcomes.</brief_summary>
