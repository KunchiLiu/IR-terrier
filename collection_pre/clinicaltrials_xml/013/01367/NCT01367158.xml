History of any meningococcal vaccine administration; 2. Current or previous, confirmed or suspected disease caused by N meningitidis; 3. Household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with any laboratory confirmed N meningitidis infection within 60 days of enrollment; 4.

Antibiotics within 7 days prior to enrollment or blood draw; 6. Pregnancy or nursing (breastfeeding) mothers; 7. Females of childbearing age who had not used or did not plan to use acceptable birth control measures, for the duration of the study.

If sexually active the subject must have been using one of the accepted birth control methods at least two months prior to study entry; 8. Any serious chronic or progressive disease (eg, neoplasm, diabetes, cardiac disease, hepatic disease, progressive neurological disease or seizure disorder; autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, blood dyscrasias, bleeding diathesis, signs of cardiac or renal failure or severe malnutrition). 9. Known or suspected impairment/alteration of the immune system, immunosuppressive therapy, including use of corticosteroids in immunosuppressive doses or chronic use of inhaled highpotency corticosteroids or immunostimulants within the previous 60 days. Use of topical corticosteroids administered during the study in limited areas (ie, eczema on knees or face or elbows) of the body was allowed; 10. Receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives, or a parenteral immunoglobulin preparation within the previous 90 days; 11. History of severe allergic reactions after previous vaccinations or hypersensitivity to any vaccine component; 12. Individuals who received any other vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study or who were planning to receive any vaccine within 4 weeks from the study vaccines. 13. Individuals participating in any clinical trial with another investigational product 30 days prior to first study visit or had intent to participate in another clinical study at any time during the conduct of this study. 14. Individuals who were part of study personnel or close family members conducting this study. 15. Individuals with medical history or any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the results of the study or posed additional risk to the subjects due to participation in the study.</criteria>
