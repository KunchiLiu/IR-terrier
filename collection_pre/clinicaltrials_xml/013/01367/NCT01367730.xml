	<brief_summary>In the context of male osteoporosis, we hypothesize that regional changes in trabecular bone, as well as changes in cortical porosity will play a major role, and thus also affect bone strength. In developing therapeutics the response of individual compartments, regional variations post-therapy will have considerable impact on selecting the therapies as well as monitoring response to therapy. This study, a precursor to other therapeutic trials, will lay the ground-work for the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Bone Micro-Architecture Using HR-pQCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will recruit 80 subjects who will be stratified into groups based on their T-scores. All subjects will be imaged at Baseline and 12 months. Measures of bone micro-architecture in the tibia and radius using peripheral computed tomography, bone strength measures through finite element analysis will be obtained at all time points. DXA measures at the spine, femur and forearm will be obtained as reference measures. In addition whole body DXA scans will be performed for assessment of body composition.</detailed_description>
