	<brief_summary>To test the hypothesis that adding estradiol (E2) to progesterone supplementation later in the luteal phase of in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles, rather than earlier in the luteal phase, improves clinical pregnancy rates (PRs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timing of Estrogen Support During the Luteal Phase of in Vitro Fertilization (IVF)/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) Cycle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies reported that elevated E2 may have a detrimental effect on endometrial receptivity and embryo. This conflict was the starting point of our study. The investigators thought that this luteal decrease in E2 level could be prevented by adding estradiol just before the receptivity window is open, instead of adding earlier in the luteal phase which could result in defective embryo implantation.</detailed_description>
