History of hepatobiliary disease; or AST, ALT or direct bilirubin greater than the upper limit of reference range at screening. Positive screening test for HIV antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody. Abnormal screening ECG: including machineread QTc &gt;450 msec, QRS &gt;110 msec, intermittent bundle branch block, frequent premature atrial or premature ventricular contractions, or any rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm which is interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant. History of sensitivity to a similar study drug (e.g., Karo Bio KB2115 or Metabasis MB7811), or a history of important drug or other allergy (except for untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing).
