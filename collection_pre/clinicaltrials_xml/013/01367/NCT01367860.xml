	<brief_summary>Approximately 300,000 patients undergo open surgical procedures to treat symptoms caused by disc herniation. Among the various surgical techniques practiced the percutaneous discectomy occupies its space since the first description of the technique by Hijikata, 1975. Throughout, many techniques have been described. Studies indicate that the treatment was successful for pain and disability resulting from herniated disc associated with radiculopathy small. However, some methods remove very small amounts of tissue with little change in volume of the disc. Thus, studies on the cadaver with Percutaneous Diskectomy by SpineJet ® showed more macroscopic changes of the disc with a predictable amount of removal and significant disc material. The Percutaneous Diskectomy by SpineJet ® is a new technique of percutaneous diskectomy which creates a suction effect in tissues adjacent to the exit point of the fluid and the opening point of the collector. However, no studies have examined the effect of the Percutaneous Diskectomy by SpineJet ® in humans about the disk size after treatment or measures of disc degeneration by imaging methods or how these characteristics might correlate with clinical outcomes. Thus, the study will compare outcomes of patients with contained or extruded disc herniation, with complaints of radiculopathy, concordant with the imaging findings. With treatment by surgical technique or the traditional by SpineJet ®, in order to determine whether percutaneous discectomy with SpineJet ® will produce results comparable to open microdiskectomy.</brief_summary>
