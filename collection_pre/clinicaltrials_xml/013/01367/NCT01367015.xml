	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare early versus late initiation of enteral feeding in premature growth restricted babies below the gestational age of 35 weeks born to mothers with prenatal absent or reversal of end diastolic flow in the umbilical artery. Normally the blood flow from the mother to the baby brings all the nutrients required for growth and the very vital oxygen required for survival. These deprived babies with poor blood flow adapt to the not so conducive uterine environment by certain adjustments in blood supply to internal organs. This permits the best possible blood flow to brain heart etc., which are the vital organs and whose adequate functioning is required for survival. As a consequence, the gut (intestines) gets poor blood supply and hence its appropriate functioning may be jeopardized. Such 'premature growth restricted' babies are at increased risk of further growth faltering if not fed adequately as also to a condition called 'Necrotising enterocolitis' if fed liberally like other healthy neonates, characterized by abdominal distension, blood in stools and inability to feed for longer durations thereby further affecting growth. In the past such babies (after birth) were not fed for days together which compromised their growth even further. It is not clear whether continuing to withhold feeds for prolonged duration will prevent NEC but lead to growth faltering and initiating feeds early will potentiate NEC with further compromised growth and increased morbidity. There are no randomized trials on feeding strategies in this group of neonates and hence the investigators planned to carry out this study on comparison of early versus delayed initiation of feeding in preterm SGA infants with AREDF.</brief_summary>
