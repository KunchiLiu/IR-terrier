	<brief_summary>Cardiac MR (CMR) will be used to assess myocardial activation and hemodynamics in patients with CRT. Goals are to demonstrate that - differences in Left ventricle (LV)- right ventricle (RV) pacing delays cause differences in myocardial activation - differences in LV-RV pacing delays cause differences in LV/RV hemodynamics and to use these data to optimize CRT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac MR (CMR) in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Non-responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CMR will be performed in patients under CRT who are currently not responding to CRT. Different LV-RV delays will be programmed during CMR and LV function and different dyssynchrony parameters will be assessed. Results will be used to determine the optimal LV-RV delay, and CRT-devices will be reprogrammed accordingly. Improvement in NYHA-class/conversion to therapy responder will be determined clinically after 3 months.</detailed_description>
