	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety of topical norepinephrine in head and neck cancer patients who are receiving treatment with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or decrease the severity of the radiation-induced alopecia experienced by these patients.</brief_summary>
