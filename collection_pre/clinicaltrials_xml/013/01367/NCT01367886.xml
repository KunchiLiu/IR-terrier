	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the use of a new technology (urine proteomics) - the study of proteins in the urine to identify urine markers of overactive bladder (OAB) from a simple voided urine specimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Urine Proteomic Studies of Overactive Bladder in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are: 1. to improve the diagnosis of overactive bladder using a non-invasive technology (urine proteomics) and 2. to study how potential urine biomarkers changes with overactive bladder symptoms after patients have been treated with fesoterodine, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of overactive bladder.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For healthy volunteers the inclusion criteria are: 1. Females ≥ 18 years old 2. Not experiencing overactive bladder symptoms 3. Not experiencing frequency or urgency For overactive bladder patients the inclusion criteria are 1. Females ≥ 18 years old 2. Overactive bladder symptoms for ≥ 3 months before screening ) Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIS) &gt; 3/year For healthy volunteers the exclusion criteria are: 1. Overactive bladder symptoms, such as frequency and urgency 2. Intermittent/unstable use of bladder medications 3. Pregnant women or women unwilling to use contraceptives 4. Neurological conditions: stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's, spinal cord injury 5. Significant pelvic organ prolapsed (grade 3 or above based on physical exam) 6. Lower urinary tract surgery within past 6 months 7. Known history of IC or pain associated with OAB 8. Urinary retention requiring catheterization, indwelling catheter of Selfcath 9. Recurrent UTIS &gt; 3/year For overactive bladder patients the exclusion criteria are: 1. Contraindications to Fesoterodine use such as hypersensitivity, GI and urinary retention, and Glaucoma 2. Intermittent/unstable use of bladder medications 3. Pregnant women or women unwilling to use contraceptives 4. Neurological conditions: stroke, MS, Parkinson's, spinal cord injury 5. Significant pelvic organ prolapsed (grade 3 or above based on physical exam) 6. Lower urinary tract surgery within past 6 months 7. Known history of Interstitial Cystitis (IC) or pain associated with OAB 8. Urinary retention requiring catheterization, indwelling catheter of Selfcath 9. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIS) &gt; 3/year Deferral Criteria: Treatment with OAB medications within 2 weeks before baseline visit. If patient is currently on OAB medications the patient will be asked to stop OAB medication for 2 weeks and return for baseline visit.</criteria>
