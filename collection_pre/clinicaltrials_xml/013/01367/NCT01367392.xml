	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the ActiSightâ„¢ Needle Guidance System with CT-guided percutaneous (through the skin) liver biopsies and ablations . The device used in this study is designed to assist the physician in guiding the needle towards the suspected area. This device does not change the procedure of liver biopsy or ablation. The only difference is that a small adhesive pad is placed on the skin and a miniature video camera is attached to the end of the needle. This camera does not enter the body.</brief_summary>
