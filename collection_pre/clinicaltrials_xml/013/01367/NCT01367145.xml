	<brief_summary>The principal aim of the study is to determine the effects n3-PUFA on top of standard therapy on surrogate markers of disease severity and/or prognosis in patients with PAD. Treatment duration will be 3 months, final follow-up is planned at 6 months after inclusion. Primary outcome parameter is endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation using brachial artery ultrasound. Secondary outcome measures comprise maximum and pain-free treadmill walking distance, pulse wave velocity, whole blood viscosity, platelet activation and plasma markers of inflammation.</brief_summary>
