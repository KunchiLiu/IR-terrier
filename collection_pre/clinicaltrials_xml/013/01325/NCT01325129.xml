Our Own Study showed a Benefit towards Much Lower Pain and Better Cosmesis in Adolescents when Treated with Elastic Stable Intramedullary Nailing. The First 20 Patients Treated with this Method will be examined for Functional (CONSTANT and MURLEY-Score) and Cosmetic Results as well as Ultrasound-Morphology of both clavicles and Patients`satisfaction (CSS-8). Further on, all complications and problems will be documented.</brief_summary>
