	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to provide proof that a MRI based preoperative radiochemotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma allows limiting RCT to high risk patients without increase of locoregional recurrence rate and decrease of overall survival provided there is a high quality of mesorectal excision.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The criteria for application of RCT is the distance of the tumor from mesorectal fascia in preoperative MRI of the pelvis. In case of a T 4 tumor or a tumor with a distance of 1mm of less form mesorectal fascia long-course radiochemotherapy is applied followed by surgery, in all other cases primary surgery is done.</detailed_description>
