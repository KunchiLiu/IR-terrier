	<brief_summary>Healthy males are randomized to isometric exercise for three months with either extra protein or extra calories in the form of a fast food meal/day in order to study if increase in muscle mass increases resting metabolic rate and if this is affected by presumed increased caloric intake as compared with only proteins. Body-composition was measured with Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbimetry (DEXA) and RMR was measured by registration of CO2 production and O2 consumption.</brief_summary>
