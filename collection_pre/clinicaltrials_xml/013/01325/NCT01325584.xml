	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to make Omegaven速 available to cancer patients with liver disease and to determine if Omegaven速 can improve or prevent further liver disease. The study will also look at the effects Omegaven速 has on immune function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compassionate Use of Omegaven速 in the Treatment of Parenteral Nutrition Induced Hepatic Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This compassionate use study will include patients with advanced cancer requiring PN for long-term nutrition support who have developed PN-induced hepatic injury or who have existing hepatic dysfunction. Therapy with Omegaven will be provided at an initial dose of 0.1 g/kg body weight (1ml/kg) and increased to 0.2 g/kg body weight (2ml/kg) on day 2 or 3 of treatment. For patients &gt; 120% ideal body weight, adjusted body weight will be used. The infusion rate will not exceed 0.5mL Omegaven/kg body weight/hr (corresponding to 0.05g fish oil/kg/hr). Omegaven will be co-administered via a y-site infusion, with containers being changed every 12 hours. The patient may receive other lipids to meet Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) and/or additional calorie needs. Patients will receive the initial infusion of PN containing Omegaven at Midwestern Regional Medical Center (MRMC) in the infusion center to observe for adverse reactions. If an adverse reaction is observed, IV steroids &amp; benadryl will be administered &amp; Omegaven will be discontinued. Patients will continue to receive infusions at CTCA for the first 2 to 3 days of dosing. After tolerance is established, patients will receive treatment at home with Coram. All study patients will have a Screening Visit; Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 visits; and weekly visits for one month (see Table 2).</detailed_description>
