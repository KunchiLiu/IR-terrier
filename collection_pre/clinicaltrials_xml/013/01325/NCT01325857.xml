	<brief_summary>This study was designed to investigate the analgesic effect of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block in patients undergoing robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy. The investigators hypothesized that bilateral superficial cervical plexus blockade would reduce the patient's pain score by more than 10 (on a VAS scale of 0~100) compared to a placebo group and control group.</brief_summary>
