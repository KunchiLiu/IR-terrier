	<brief_summary>The risk for recurrence after ventral hernia repair is often based on reoperation rates with short follow-up rather than recurrences identified by clinical examinations. The purpose of current study is find the real incidence of recurrences 3 years after ventral hernia repair and to compare with the reoperation rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reoperation Rate Versus Clinical Recurrence After Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>all patients in a restricted area (all patients in the part of Denmark called Zealand) who had a ventral hernia repair in 2007 (appr. 1200 patients). The patients will be sorted by a questionnaire and if the patients are suspicious for recurrence they will be offered a clinical examination.</detailed_description>
