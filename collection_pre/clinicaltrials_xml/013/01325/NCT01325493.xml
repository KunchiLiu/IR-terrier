	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Establish whether ketamine can decrease opioid consumption and modulate the onset of opioid tolerance and prevent opioid-induced hyperalgesia in pediatric subjects, ages 10 years to 18 years, undergoing posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation.</brief_summary>
