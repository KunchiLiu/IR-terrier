	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. Surgical removal of the entire prostate (prostatectomy) is one option among the various ways to treat prostate cancer. The use of robot assistance for prostatectomy has become common place, but its effectiveness has not been compared to standard open prostatectomy in trials carried out at more than one medical institution in which participants are identified and followed forward in time. Robot assisted and standard open prostatectomy health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes have not been compared in a prospective, multi-centered study. Prostatectomy can have side effects that can change with time. This research study seeks to determine how common and how long-lasting such side effects are; to find out what features of individual men's cancers and what features of the treatments affect those side effects. This study also seeks to identify factors that affect the quality of prostate cancer care by looking at how satisfied men are with their prostate cancer care. Through these findings, this study aims to allow treatment side effects to be anticipated more accurately for individual patients, and to provide a means for determining the quality of prostate care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will follow your prostate cancer treatment outcomes and health related quality of life following prostatectomy by asking you direct questions, collect information from medical records and phone interviews. Information about your prostate cancer treatment, and related health concerns, and information regarding the cost of care, may also be collected from your medical record, other medical center sources, and your primary care provider (PCP). Clinical information will be collected: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 6 month, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after your prostatectomy; once a year thereafter for possibly up to 12 years. You will be asked to take part in six telephone interviews regarding quality of life, possible therapy side effects, and satisfaction with prostate cancer therapy. Each phone interview should last 15-25 minutes. All questions are voluntary. The phone interviews will be conducted: prior to beginning treatment (prostatectomy); 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after prostatectomy; 10 additional phone interviews may be conducted (once a year thereafter, for possibly up to 12 years).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Early stage prostate cancer (AJCC [2002] clinical stage &lt; or = T2NXMX; T stage is based on rectal exam findings alone). Gleason score based on local pathology within 12 months of registration.
