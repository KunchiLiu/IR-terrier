	<brief_summary>Menopause is the milestone of a more broaden condition that can last up to 10 years. The first menopausal symptoms usually appear around the age of 42 and are characterized by a gradual decline in thyroid and gonadal function with a progressive increase of plasmatic luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Recent studies have shown that myo-inositol and melatonin play a major role in ovarian homeostasis. In particular, it has been demonstrated that myo-inositol and/or melatonin supplementation lead to an increase of oocyte quality. Additional studies focused on postmenopausal women have shown that myo-inositol is able to ameliorate the metabolic syndrome that often affects these patients, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether myo-inositol and melatonin might play a positive role in regulating hormonal levels during menopausal onset.</brief_summary>
