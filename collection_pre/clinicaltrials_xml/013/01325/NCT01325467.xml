	<brief_summary>This will be a registry study that will enroll patients referred for an ECG treadmill test with nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The high frequency QRS (HFQRS) information will be recorded and analyzed automatically and simultaneous with the standard ECG signals by the HyperQ System. Results of subsequent tests performed on each patient will be collected and used to enhance the reliability of designating each patient as a CAD-negative (i.e., no significant coronary artery disease) or a CAD-positive (i.e., significant coronary artery disease).</brief_summary>
