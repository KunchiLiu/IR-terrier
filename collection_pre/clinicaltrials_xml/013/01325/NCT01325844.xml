	<brief_summary>This study was designed to investigate the effects of epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia during laparoscopic surgery. The investigators hypothesized that epidural anesthesia will effectively block the activation of the sympathetic nervous system during surgery, thus activating nitric oxide and reducing splanchnic ischemia and decrease in postoperative renal function.</brief_summary>
