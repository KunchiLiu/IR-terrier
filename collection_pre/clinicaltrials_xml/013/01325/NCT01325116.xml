	<brief_summary>ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common presentation of heart attack constituting approximately 30% of all cases. Clinical guidelines around the world support the prolonged use of secondary preventative medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, beta-blocker and angiotensin blockers with the highest recommendations. While in-hospital and discharge prescription rates are excellent, adherence to these essential life-saving medications is far less than ideal, even a few months following hospital discharge. The investigators plan to capitalize on the existing structure of the SMART-AMI project already underway in LHIN IV to undertake a randomized controlled trial evaluating a reminder sent on behalf of the interventional cardiologists, delivered by mail, at 1, 2, 5, 8, and 11-months post-discharge, reviewing the evidence for life-saving cardiac medications and urging long-term adherence to secondary preventative cardiac medications. This will be sent to the family physician and the patient, using audience-appropriate language. If the DERLA-STEMI project is accepted by physicians and patients, found to be both feasible and effective, then this simple and low-cost intervention will be studied in all patients with an abnormal coronary angiogram.</brief_summary>
