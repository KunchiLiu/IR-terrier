	<brief_summary>Oxytocin (OT) - a neurohormone and neuromodulator which is mainly synthesized in the hypothalamus - is a key mediator of complex social and affective behaviors, including emotional empathy. Recently, several theoretical studies suggested that PTSD patients have abnormal functioning of the OT system. According to these theories, dysfunction in the oxytocin system may modulate the interpersonal impairment that characterizes PTSD, and therefore intranasal OT may potentially relieve these symptoms. The main goal of this study is to examine the effects of administration of nasal OT on empathic abilities among PTSD patients. Another goal of this study is to examine the relationship between empathic abilities and the ability to retrieve autobiographical memories among PTSD patients.</brief_summary>
