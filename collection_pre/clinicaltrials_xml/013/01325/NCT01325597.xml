	<brief_title>Effects of Functional Electrical Stimulation and Inspiratory Muscle Training in Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess the effects of the functional electrical stimulation (FES) associated with inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on functional capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure (HF). A randomized clinical trial with 60 HF patients (functional class II-IV) will be randomly assigned to the FES, IMT, IMT associated with FES or control group. FES will be applied at 15 Hz, 0.4 ms pulse width, 10-s contraction time, 50-s resting time and maximum tolerable intensity, 3 sessions per week, for 12 weeks. The IMT will also be performed for 12 weeks, 5 sessions per week, with an intensity of 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. Acute and chronic effects of interventions on functional capacity, quality of life, peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, endothelial function, autonomic control and oxidative stress will be analyzed in these patients.</detailed_description>
