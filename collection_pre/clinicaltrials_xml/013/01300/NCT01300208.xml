	<criteria>Key Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus or sub acute lupus erythematosus for &gt; 16 weeks prior to screening and consistent histological findings on skin biopsy based on Gilliam classification who are candidates for systemic therapies (as determined by the Investigator) Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, have active skin lesions of sufficient severity at Screening and Baseline (a Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index Activity Score of ≥ 10) All subjects taking hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine or quinacrine during the study must have documentation of an ophthalmologic exam performed within 24 weeks of the Baseline Visit. Must meet the following laboratory criteria: White blood cell count ≥3000/mm3 (≥ 3.0 x 109/L) and &lt; 14,000/mm3 (&lt; 14 x 109/L) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500 cells/μL (1.5 x 109/L) Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (≥ 100 x 109/L) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (≤ 132.6 μmol/L) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin &lt; 2mg/dL Hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL Key Exclusion Criteria Participation in multiple CC11050 cohorts or previous exposure to CC11050 Presence or history of SLE based on investigators' clinical evaluation where subject exhibits medically significant (as determined by the Investigator) LErelated pleuritis, pericarditis, neurologic, renal and/or other major SLErelated organ system involvement(SLErelated to SLE joint involvement is acceptable). Use of topical or any local therapy known to possibly benefit discoid lupus erythematosus or SCLE sub acute lupus erythematosus within 2 weeks of the Screening Visit Use of concomitant disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with the exception of antimalarials within 4 weeks of screening Use of topical or any local therapy known to possibly benefit discoid lupus erythematosus or SCLE sub acute lupus erythematosus within 2 weeks of the Screening Visit Use of immunosuppressives (eg, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, etc.) within 4 weeks of screening</criteria>
