	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of a future Nordic intervention trial, including vigorous activity and a high intake of whole grain rye, among prostate cancer patients on active surveillance. Additionally, to investigate effects of the lifestyle intervention according to cancer progression, the metabolic profile, inflammation and quality of life among prostate cancer patients on active surveillance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study on a Nordic Lifestyle Intervention Trial Among Men With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the present feasibility study it will be established whether it is possible to enroll participants for this particular kind of intervention among this particular patient group, and if compliance with the intervention is possible to gain by the tools planned: individual counselling with a dietician and a physiologist, interviews on diet, exercise tests and diaries on diet, exercise and steps taken. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate if we are able to detect effects of the lifestyle intervention according to cancer progression, the metabolic profile, inflammation and quality of life among the participants (24 men) within the short intervention period (6 months) for this particular feasibility study. Biomarkers of effect and compliance are measured in blood, urine and prostate tissue samples. Metabolomics and the following biomarkers are measured in blood and urine samples: Alkyl resorcinols, enterolactone, tnf receptor 2, e-selectin. ICAM1, IL1-alpha, IL6, triglycerides, HDL/LDL, s-insulin, HbA1c, C-peptide, CRP, IGF1, GLP1, cholesterol, cathepsin and glucose.</detailed_description>
