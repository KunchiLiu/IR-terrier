	<brief_summary>The study's hypothesis is that there are some patients who come for surgery who have asymptomatic clots in their lower extremities upon their arrival to the hospital for their surgical admission. We will be performing duplex studies of the subjects' legs before their surgery to determine how often clots are present. We will also perform duplex scans of the legs after the subjects' surgeries to determine what factors (surgical, anesthetic, co-morbidities)are correlated with the development of DVTs.</brief_summary>
