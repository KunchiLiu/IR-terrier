	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis is that endothelial function, apolipoprotein levels and adiponectin levels are accurate predictors of underlying cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage liver disease, in whom standard tools for the diagnosis of and screening for cardiovascular disease are of limited utility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Endothelial Function, Apolipoproteins and Adiponectin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is looking at using a noninvasive test called a reactive hyperemia peripheral artery tonometry (RH-PAT) to check endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be an indication of future heart disease or metabolic disorders. Adiponectin is a hormone associated with heart disease. Apolipoprotein levels, are established risk factors for coronary artery disease in the general population. Our group would like to see if there is a link between endothelial function, adiponectin, apolipoprotein levels and posttransplant heart disease complications. The study would be taking these results to find new clinical procedures for patients that are at potentially higher risk of heart problems during and after their liver transplant procedure.</detailed_description>
