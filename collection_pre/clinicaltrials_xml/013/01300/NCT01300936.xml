	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure abdominal wall strength both preoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing ventral/incisional hernia repairs. The investigators hypothesize that abdominal wall strength is improved in hernia repairs that reapproximate the rectus musculature to the midline. Abdominal wall strength measurements would be obtained utilizing various abdominal strength testing.</brief_summary>
