	<brief_title>Impact of a Computer-Assisted SBIRT Program in an HIV Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the study are: 1. To assess the feasibility of conducting SBIRT using (1) a patient self-administered intervention embedded in a web-based Personal Health Record (PHR) compared to (2) a provider-administered SBIRT intervention guided by the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) during clinic appointments. 2. To examine the acceptability of web-based PHRs to conduct and communicate SBIRT compared to EMR-activated SBIRT conducted by clinic staff, from the perspective of the patient and the provider. 3. To assess the impact of SBIRT on risky drug and alcohol use in an HIV/AIDS population and subsequent effects on sexual risk behaviors and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence.</detailed_description>
