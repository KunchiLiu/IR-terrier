	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, pilot-study to evaluate the effect of Interleukin-1 blockade on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. Subjects will undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and after 2-weeks treatment with anakinra (recombinant human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of heart failure Recent echocardiogram documenting left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% High sensitivity Creactive protein &gt;2 mg/L. Recent changes (previous 3 months) in HF maintenance medications (betablockers, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, vasodilators, cardiac glycosides, diuretics) Hospitalization for worsening HF or acute decompensated HF within the previous 12 months Anticipated need for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or automatedimplantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) Angina or electrocardiograph (ECG) changes that limit maximum exertion during cardiopulmonary exercise testing or baseline ECG changes that limit the ability to detect ischemia (i.e. left bundlebranch block). Recent (&lt;14 days) use of antiinflammatory drugs (not including NSAIDs), chronic inflammatory disorder (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), malignancy, active infection, or any comorbidity limiting survival or ability to complete the study Severe kidney dysfunction (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min) Coagulopathy (INR &gt;1.5), thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000/mm3), or leukopenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,500/mm3) Pregnancy (female patients will be required to take a urine pregnancy test) Latex or rubber allergy Inability to give informed consent</criteria>
