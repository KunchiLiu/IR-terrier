	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to try to learn more about how small molecule kinase inhibitor medications work in treating lung cancer. Crizotinib (PF-02341066) is a drug that has been shown to shrink tumors in some patients with lung cancer. While the investigators know how this drug works to stop the growth of tumors that depend on change in the gene named ALK (also called EML4-ALK), the investigators do not know why the drug stops working. The investigators would like to examine the tumor to help us better understand why crizotinib has stopped working as well as it once did. The tumor will be examined with multiple tests to look for the reason that crizotinib stopped working.</brief_summary>
