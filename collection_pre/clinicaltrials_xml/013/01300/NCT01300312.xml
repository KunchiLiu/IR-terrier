	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Study the Effects of a Fixed Dose Combination of Diclofenac and Eperisone Hydrochloride With Plain Eperisone Hydrochloride in Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an observer-blind, prospective randomized, controlled study to evaluate efficacy and safety of fixed dose combination of eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and diclofenac sodium 50 mg three times daily with plain eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg three times daily in patients with musculoskeletal spasm associated with low back pain. A total of 240 adult patients of either sex, 120 patients in each arm, who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in this study. The patients will be evaluated at Days 3, 7 and 10 of the study visit for efficacy and safety. The efficacy evaluation includes objective parameters like Finger-to-Floor distance, Lasegue's sign, tenderness of par vertebral muscles, lumbar and dorsal hypermyotonia, leg tendon reflexes, need for rescue medication and subjective parameters like improvement in lumbar cinesalgia, pain in lower extremities, sensory disturbances of lower limb, and Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (PGART). Patients will be evaluated for safety on the clinical adverse events reported during the study period, sedation on drowsy alert scale and Global Assessment of Tolerability to Therapy (PGATT). The patients will also be evaluated for laboratory safety as assessed by measuring laboratory parameters for hemogram, renal and hepatic parameters.</detailed_description>
