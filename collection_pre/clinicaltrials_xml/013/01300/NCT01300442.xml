	<brief_summary>Transcutaneous electrical diaphragmatic stimulation (TEDS) has been used to improve respiratory muscle strength in patients with respiratory muscles weakness. However, this physiotherapeutic resource has not been studied in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) yet. The objective of this study is to evaluate the respiratory pattern during the session of TEDS besides its effect in respiratory muscle strength and in spirometric variables as much healthy patients as in COPD patients. Methods: healthy and COPD patients are selected and submitted to TEDS treatment. The plethysmographic analysis (LifeShirt System - VivoMetric), respiratory muscle strength and spirometry will be made. The hypothesis is that the TEDS can helps COPD patients that shows respiratory muscle weakness.</brief_summary>
