	<brief_summary>The Spaeth-Richman Contrast Sensitivity (SPARCS) test is a new method of assessing contrast sensitivity. The test is performed on any standard computer with internet access. Patients will be tested with SPARCS and with the standard Pelli-Robson contrast test.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To test a new method of determining contrast sensitivity that does not require visual acuity and tests various areas of the visual field. Hypothesis: A method of determining contrast sensitivity that does not require letter recognition (as in the Pelli-Robson test) eliminates the confounders of literacy and pattern recognition, and will permit a more valid determination of contrast sensitivity. Patients will perform SPARCS and Pelli-Robson twice; once each with two separate observers for reproducibility and intra-observer reliability. The order of testing will be randomized to SPARCS, Pelli, Pelli, SPARCS or Pelli, SPARCS, SPARCS, Pelli.</detailed_description>
