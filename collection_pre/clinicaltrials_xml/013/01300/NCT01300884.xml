	<brief_summary>Hypotheses: High definition manometry (HDM) is safe and feasible in humans; HDM accurately characterizes anorectal anatomy and function in healthy humans; HDM provides comparable information regarding the structure and function of the anorectal region, to that obtained from ano-rectal manometry and anal ultrasonography (AUS), in patients with fecal incontinence or constipation. Methods: 20 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with fecal incontinence, 20 patients with constipation will be recruited. Because anorectal disorders are more common in women, the investigators will recruit approximately 8 men and 12 women in each group. Each subject will undergo anorectal manometry, anal ultrasound and high definition manometry. Data Analysis: Spearman correlational analysis will be performed to compare the parameters listed above. Also, the diagnostic yield of anal ultrasonography vs HDM in identifying anatomic sphincter defects will be assessed.</brief_summary>
