	<detailed_description>Two investigative centers will enroll 40 subjects in the United States. Subject participation in the 5 visit study will last 4 months. At Visit 1, following informed consent, a medical, migraine, and medication history will be collected and a physical and neurological exam with vital signs will be performed. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be completed. A Lifestyle Choices for Better Migraine Management Questionnaire (Lifestyle Questionnaire) will be completed. Eligible subjects then complete a 1-month Baseline Period and treat migraine with their current preferred treatment of choice, documenting headache severity and associated symptoms in a 30-day Baseline Diary. At Visit 2, the Baseline Diary will be reviewed and a pregnancy test will be collected from all subjects of childbearing potential. Vital signs will be collected and Adverse Events documented. Subjects continuing to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to Treximet or naproxen and provided with study medication to treat on 14 or fewer days per month. Subjects will be encouraged to treat their migraine attacks within 1 hour of onset of headache pain and while the pain is still mild. Subjects will view an educational digital video disc (DVD) concerning lifestyle modification, receive a copy for home viewing, complete the Lifestyle Questionnaire, and receive 3 copies of the Lifestyle Questionnaire for weekly completion between Visits 2 and 3. The Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire (MIDAS) will be completed and a 30-day Treatment Period Diary will be dispensed. At Visits 3 and 4, Adverse Events will be collected, completed Diaries will be reviewed, and Drug Accountability performed. Pregnancy tests will be collected from all subjects of childbearing potential. Vital signs will be collected. Completed Lifestyle Questionnaires will be collected, a Lifestyle Questionnaire will be completed in the office, and 3 copies will be dispensed for weekly completion between visits. Study medication for the following month will be dispensed with a 30-day Diary. At Visit 5, Adverse Events will be collected, completed Diaries will be reviewed, and Drug Accountability performed. Pregnancy tests will be collected from all subjects of childbearing potential. Vital signs will be collected. Completed Lifestyle Questionnaires will be collected and a Lifestyle Questionnaire will be completed in the office. Subjects will complete the MIDAS before exiting the study.</detailed_description>
