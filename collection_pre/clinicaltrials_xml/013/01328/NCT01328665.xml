	<brief_summary>This project evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention sought to reduce the physical effects of stress related to those issues that individuals cannot successfully communicate with anyone about. To do this, the investigators will be implementing a writing intervention over the course of the 6-week study. The investigators will be asking all participants to complete questionnaires over the course of the study period. The investigators are also asking participants to provide a small blood sample (from a fingerstick procedure) at two times during the study as well as saliva samples during that same time. The primary research question asks if this intervention procedure is effective. The investigators are evaluating total cholesterol, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, and cortisol.</brief_summary>
