	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare asthma-related exacerbations (emergency department (ED) or inpatient (IP) visit) and related cost in pediatric patients aged 4-11 years that received either fluticasone propionate 44 mcg (FP44) or budesonide (BUD) or montelukast (MON). This retrospective observational cohort analysis utilizes a large managed care database with linked pharmacy and medical claims. Patients with ≥ 1 pharmacy claim FP44 or BUD or MON between January 1, 2000 through June 30, 2008 (4-11 years old at time of index) with ≥ 1 diagnosis for asthma (ICD-9 493.xx) in the pre-index period and continuously eligible to receive healthcare services for 1-year pre-index and at least 30 days post-index. Dose of each inhaled corticosteroid was not known in the database. Follow-up was defined for each patient as the period beginning with the index date and ending with the last date of continuous claims history, switch to another asthma controller medication, or claim for an asthma related event (ED/IP visit or OCS use) post-index, whichever occurred first.</brief_summary>
