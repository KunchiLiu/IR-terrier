	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CTP-499</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, single ascending dose administration study of four doses of CTP-499. Following dosing safety and tolerability will be assessed. Blood and urine samples will be taken for pharmacokinetics (PK) and bioavailability. Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature), clinical laboratory findings, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examination findings. The plasma concentration time data for CTP-499 and its metabolites will be analyzed using noncompartmental methods. Actual dosing and sampling times will be used for analysis. The primary pharmacokinetics parameters are: Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUClast and AUCinf for plasma; relative bioavailability; and Ae and CLr for urine.</detailed_description>
