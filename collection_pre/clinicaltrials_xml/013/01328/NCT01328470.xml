	<brief_summary>Impaired renal function is associated with reduced responsiveness to clopidogrel. There are no studies which have shown a means by which to overcome platelet hyporesponsiveness in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this study was to determine the functional impact of cilostazol in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Platelet Inhibition According to Clopidogrel Dose in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of this study is to evaluate the effects of platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel or cilostazol in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis. The differences in platelet activation markers are also evaluated before and after clopidogrel or cilostazol administration. The investigators will perform a prospective, randomized study to compare the degree of platelet inhibition and platelet activation markers by adjunctive cilostazol (100 mg twice daily) compared to clopidogrel (75 or 150 mg/day) in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis.</detailed_description>
