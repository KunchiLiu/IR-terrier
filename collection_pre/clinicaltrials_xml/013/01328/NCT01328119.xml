	<brief_summary>Rationale: The mortality of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis remains high. This may at least be partly due to the insufficient removal of (especially protein-bound) uremic toxins which have been associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is unknown whether the combination of long-hour haemodialysis (HD) with convection increases the removal of these toxins. Long-hour HD and long-hour haemodiafiltration (HDF) may also improve haemodynamic stability which is an important factor in treatment quality. The investigators aim to study the removal of uremic toxins in long-hour HD and HDF and to compare the haemodynamics between 4-hour and 8-hour HD and HDF. Objectives: The primary aim is to study the removal of (especially protein-bound) uremic toxins in 4-hour and 8-hour HD and HDF. A secondary aim is to compare the haemodynamic response between 4-hour and 8-hour HD and HDF.</brief_summary>
