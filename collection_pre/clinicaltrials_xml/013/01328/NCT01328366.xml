	<brief_summary>The impact of psoriasis on an individual's emotional and social well-being goes beyond skin symptoms of the disease. Data suggests patients with severe psoriasis experience a greater prevalence of depressive symptoms, mood disturbances, anxiety and even suicidal ideation. Given the nature of the disease and the treatment failures which are required before a patient commences a biologic therapy such as adalimumab, the patient's mental health at initiation of biologics is an important consideration for clinicians. This study seeks to explore if adalimumab treatment of psoriasis leads to a positive impact on psychosocial factors and disease-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Psychosocial Factors Associated With Severe Psoriasis Following Treatment With Adalimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multi-center, prospective, post-marketing observational study of participants with severe chronic plaque psoriasis who began adalimumab therapy in the United Kingdom. Although 153 participants enrolled in the study, data was only analyzed on 143 individuals and there were no interventions or changes to participant management for the study. Prior to initiating adalimumab therapy (baseline), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Self-Administered Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SAPASI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Cutaneous Body Image (CBI) scale, Short Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) (female participants) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (male participants) questionnaires were completed by participants and at 4 weeks, 16 weeks and 6 months following initiation.</detailed_description>
