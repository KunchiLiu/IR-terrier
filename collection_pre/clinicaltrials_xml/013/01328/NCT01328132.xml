	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to assess the effect of hyperoncotic albumin on vascular hemodynamics and oxygen delivery after orthotopic liver transplant. The secondary aim is to try to identify the dominant physiological mechanism so that we will be able to better identify patients that may benefit from the use of albumin (25%) boluses in addition to standard care in patients following liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
