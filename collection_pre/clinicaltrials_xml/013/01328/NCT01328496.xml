	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related/sibling donor (MSD), matched unrelated donor (MURD) or killer-immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) ligand mismatched haploidentical donor identified, will receive an umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) using a myeloablative preparative regimen. The preparative regimen includes fludarabine (75 mg/m2), fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) (10.0 Gy), and cyclophosphamide (120mg/kg) with mesna. Fludarabine will be given once a day at 25 mg/m2 for three days on day -10 to day -8, TBI will be given twice a day at 150 cGy for four days on day -7 to day -4, and cyclophosphamide will be given once a day for at 60mg/kg for two days on day -3 and day -2. Post-transplantation immunosuppression with cyclosporine and MMF will begin on day -3. Cord Blood infusion will occur on day 0 and G-CSF will start on day +1.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objectives is to estimate the event-free survival (EFS) at one-year post-transplant for research participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using single unit umbilical cord blood (UCB). Secondary objectives are: - Describe the clinical outcome of patients undergoing a double unit UCBT. - Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) of patients enrolled in the research arm. - Estimate the incidence and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment among patients enrolled in the research arm. - Estimate the incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) and transplant related morbidity in the first 100 days after transplantation among patients enrolled in the research Exploratory Objectives are: - Assess the relationship between pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) with transplant outcomes. - Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) and spectratyping. Immunophenotyping and functional assays of T, B and NK cells and lymphocytes will also be evaluated. - Evaluate the determinants of engraftment.</detailed_description>
