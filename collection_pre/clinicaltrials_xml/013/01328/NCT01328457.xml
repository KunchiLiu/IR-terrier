	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with PMIM in patients with visceral leishmaniasis within the VL-endemic region of Bangladesh at EOT (21/22 days after treatment begins), and at 6 months after end of treatment (Day 202/203, -15 to +30 days).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Effectiveness Study of Paromomycin IM Injection (PMIM) for the Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safe, effective and affordable treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that are widely available to the poorest populations are urgently needed in Bangladesh in areas where the disease is endemic. Paromomycin IM Injection (PMIM) was approved for the treatment of VL in August 2006 by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), and it offers an attractive alternative to treatments that are currently available.</detailed_description>
