	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer mortality in Asia. Most patients present with intermediate or advanced disease. Percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) are not considered as a curative treatment and have achieved very limited success in eradicating large HCC. With the development of new radiotherapy (RT) technique, RT can be more safely given to patients with larger tumor burden. Thus, TACE combined with RT has been suggested for treating large HCC. Based on the results of these studies, RT could achieve a tumor response rate of 50 % to 70 %. However, it has not been definitively shown to prolong the overall or disease-free survival due to lack of a phase III clinical trial. In contrast, a retrospective clinical investigation with molecular study suggests that sublethal dose of RT promoted HCC growth outside RT field. Two phase III trials were shown to be efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with advanced HCC. Median overall survival was significantly 2 to 3 months longer in the sorafenib group than that in the placebo. It is interesting to recognize the combined therapeutic effect of RT with sorafenib. Based on several preclinical experiments, tumor angiogenesis inhibitors seem to be synergistic with irradiation when using before RT, concurrently with RT, or after RT. Thus, the investigators design a single-arm phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of combined RT with sorafenib. The eligibility criteria are patients with unresectable HCC; good performance status; no prior radiotherapy for the liver; clinical measurable tumor; good liver function and good compliance. After entering this study, the testee will receive RT to hepatic tumor with concurrently sorafenib with a dose of 400 mg twice daily. Hepatic RT will be performed with a daily fraction size of 2.0 to 2.5 Gy to a total dose of 46 Gy to 60 Gy. After RT, maintenance sorafenib with a dose of 400 mg twice daily will be ongoing. Sorafenib will be continued until the occurrence of clinical or radiologic progression, or the occurrence of either unacceptable adverse events or death. Minimum maintenance duration of 6 months is recommended, but not mandatory.</brief_summary>
