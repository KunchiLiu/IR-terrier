	<brief_summary>Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) has been world-widely used in clinical practice in treating patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The efficacy and safety of Cypher SES (Cordis, MA) has been proved by several randomized clinical trials. Here the investigators design a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical study in purpose of identifying the non-inferiority in the efficacy and safety in treating CAD patients by Firebird 2 SES (Microport, Shanghai), comparing with Cypher SES.</brief_summary>
