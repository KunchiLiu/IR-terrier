	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ExAblate for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Women, seeking treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomata will be eligible for the study.Women who agree to participate will sign an informed consent and will be randomized to ExAblate treatment or myomectomy. All patients will be followed through the 36 month visit. Follow-up visits/telephone calls will be completed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months post treatment. Patients will be evaluated by assessing their overall physical and mental health as well as for device/procedure related adverse events.</brief_summary>
