	<brief_summary>This study is adaptive design and it consists of stage I and stage II. Stage I is multi-center, parallel-group, single-blind, phase II study to determine the adequate dose of GCPGC in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. 2 Different doses of GCPGC will be investigated in a total of 60 Breast cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy. Stage II is multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind,phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once per cycle GCPGC in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia compared to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). A total of 120 patients receiving chemotherapy will participate into this phase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GCPGC in Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GCPGC ia a solution for containing pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) which has long half life compared to filgrastim, resulting in dosing advantage.</detailed_description>
