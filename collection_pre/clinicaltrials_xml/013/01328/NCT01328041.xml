	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adults with current or historical failure on an integrase inhibitor (INI) containing regimen. The study will assess DTG 50mg twice daily administered initially with the current failing ART regimen but then with an optimised background ART regimen (OBR) after Day 7. The first analyses will be conducted after the last subject enrolled has completed 24 weeks. Subjects may remain on study after Week 24.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Dolutegravir in HIV-infected Subjects With Treatment Failure on an Integrase Inhibitor Containing Regimen.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ING112574 is a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, single arm study to assess the antiviral activity and safety of DTG containing regimen in HIV-1 infected ART-experienced adults with historical or current evidence of resistance to RAL or ELV. Initially, a minimum of 100 subjects will be enrolled to receive DTG 50mg twice daily with the current failing regimen for 7 days but with OBR from Day 8. Subjects must also have documented genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to at least one compound in two or more of the other approved classes of ART but must also be able to include at least one fully active drug in the OBR to be started Day 8. The first data cut will take place after the (approximate) 100th subject enrolled completes the Week 24 visit. Enrollment will continue until a further 50 to 100 subjects have been recruited. All subjects who successfully complete 24 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to DTG until it is locally available as long as they continue to derive clinical benefit. ViiV Healthcare is the sponsor of this study.</detailed_description>
