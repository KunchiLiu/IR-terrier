	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and PK profile of ABT-199 under a once daily dosing schedule. Two arms will be implemented for dose escalation: Arm A, CLL/SLL subjects and Arm B, NHL subjects. Arm A is designed to enroll approximately 116 subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL and Arm B is designed to enroll approximately 95 subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL. Fifty-six subjects were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled in Arm B during the dose escalation portion of the study, with the objective of defining dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the MTD. Once the MTD is declared for the arm, approximately 60 additional CLL/SLL subjects in Arm A and approximately 20 additional DLBCL subjects and 20 additional follicular lymphoma subjects in Arm B will be enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study at the recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) and schedule.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have either: (Arm A) relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and require treatment in the opinion of the Investigator. Subject must have relapsed following or be refractory to standard treatments such as fludarabine based regimens (F, FC, FR, FCR) or alkylator (chlorambucil, bendamustine) based regimens. In addition, there are no other curative options, and the subject has exhausted options that would be considered standard of care, or (Arm B) relapsed or refractory NHL and require treatment in the opinion of the Investigator. Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of NHL as defined in the World Health Organization classification scheme, except as noted in the exclusion criteria. Subject must have relapsed following or be refractory to standard treatments such as RCHOP, RCVP, or fludarabine based regimens. In addition, there are no other curative options, and the subject has exhausted options that would be considered standard of care. Subjects with other lymphoproliferative diseases can be considered in consultation with the Abbott medical monitor. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score less than or equal to 1. Subject must have adequate bone marrow independent of growth factor support per local laboratory reference range at Screening. Subject must have adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory reference range at Screening. CLL subject has undergone an allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant or NHL subject has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant or has been diagnosed with PostTransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease, Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkittlike lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. Subject has tested positive for HIV. Subject has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater or equal to 2. Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity, results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea or anginal pain. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study. Subject has received a monoclonal antibody for antineoplastic intent within 8 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.</criteria>
