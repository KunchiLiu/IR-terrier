	<brief_summary>Although laryno-pharyngeal reflux (LPR) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) differ in symptoms and treatment, they are diagnosed by the same standard 24-hour pH monitoring system which measures liquid reflux in the esophagus. The investigators are evaluating a new 24-hour pharyngeal pH monitoring system by Restech which can measure acid exposure in the airway and can be used specifically for LPR diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Restech device is more effective than standard pH monitoring in predicting the response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) acid suppression therapy using Dexlansoprazole in patients with symptoms and/or manifestations of LPR.</brief_summary>
