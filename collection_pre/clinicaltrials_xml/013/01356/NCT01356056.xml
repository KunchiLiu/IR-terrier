	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to design, implement, and clinically assess a portable, user worn system for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms. The current standard in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a subjective, qualitative ranking system. The main goal of this research is to develop a quantitative system, Kinesia HomeView, to assess tremor as well as different features of bradykinesia in a home based system which can capture those symptom changes over the course of a day and aid in evaluating treatment protocol efficacy.</brief_summary>
