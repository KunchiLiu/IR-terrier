	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Pharmacist Intervention on Medication-related Problems in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: End stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence in Taiwan ranked first and prevalence ranked second in the world from 2002 to 2005. Several foreign researches had reported that hemodialysis (HD) patients often require 12 medications to treat 5 to 6 comorbid conditions. Besides, ESRD is a lifelong disease and rates of compliance may diminish overtime. Thus, HD patients may be at particular risk for drug related problems, durg-drug interactions and noncompliance. Our aim is to analysis the effect of pharmacist in medication-related problems in ambulatory hemodialysis patients. Methods: This study is a randomized double-blind, active controlled trial. The investigators will invite and communicate with HD patients to find medication -related problems. After pharmacist evaluation, pharmacist will do pharmaceutical interventions to resolve medication-related problems, drug-drug interactions etc. in experimental group. In the active control group, pharmacist in this study will not do pharmaceutical interventions. The investigators will monitor each patient in a two-week period for medication-related problems. Our primary outcome is the amount of unresolved medication-related problems in each group after two weeks. Blind outcome assessor will evaluate the amount of unresolved medication-related problems in each case as well as compliance in these patients after two weeks. The investigators suppose that clinical pharmaceutical intervention will reduce the amount of unresolved medication-related problem in experimental group. On the other hand, patients without clinical pharmaceutical intervention will have more unresolved medication-related problems.</detailed_description>
