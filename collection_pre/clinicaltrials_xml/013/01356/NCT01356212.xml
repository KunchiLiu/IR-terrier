	<brief_summary>This was a randomised three-way crossover design study. The study consisted of three study periods each separated by a minimum 44 hour washout period. During the course of each study period, scintigraphic images were acquired at planned intervals after dosing. Subjects were able to leave the clinical unit after the completion of study specific procedures at 6 hours post-dose. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether any of the radiolabelled ketorolac formulation was deposited in the lungs of healthy volunteers following nasal inhalation under three different conditions (gentle sniff-inhalation with subject standing, vigorous sniff-inhalation with subject standing, gentle sniff-inhalation with subject semi-supine). The secondary objectives were to determine the deposition pattern of radiolabelled ketorolac solution in the nasal cavity, and clearance of the radiolabel over a six-hour period.</brief_summary>
