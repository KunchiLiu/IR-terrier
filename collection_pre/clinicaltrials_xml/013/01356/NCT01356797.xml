	<brief_summary>Background: Selective unilateral spinal anesthesia is the gold standard spinal anesthesia technique for knee arthroscopy. Selective sensory spinal anesthesia has recently been validated for this surgery. Both selective techniques are specially indicated for ambulatory surgery because of PACU fast track, low discharge home time and high patient satisfaction. This study compares both spinal techniques for knee arthroscopy surgery.</brief_summary>
