	<brief_summary>Each potential subject will be screened before the start of the study to determine their eligibility for participation. Just prior to vaccination, a 10 mL venous blood sample will be taken from each eligible subject, for baseline titration of circulating anti-HA antibodies. Immediately thereafter, each subject received one dose of vaccine (0.5 mL) by intramuscular injection into the upper arm. Subjects will be asked to stay at the site for 30 minutes post-vaccination to observe for immediate reaction. Subjects will be monitored for adverse events during the study. At three weeks (±3 days) after the vaccination, subjects will be asked to return to the site for final collection of blood samples.</brief_summary>
