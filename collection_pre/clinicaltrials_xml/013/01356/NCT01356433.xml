	<brief_summary>Subclinical inflammation is a common phenomenon in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). This is because various pro-inflammatory cytokines are promoted due to metabolic acidosis, volume overload, and / or non-sterile dialysate. As important antioxidants, vitamin C was prominently consumed by oxidative stress and inflammation. So patients receiving dialysis therapy usually had a low plasma vitamin C level. It was documented that inflammation was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis. But the relationship between plasma Vitamin C and each of inflammatory markers and prealbumin was lacking. Because vitamin C had anti-inflammation effect on behalf of its electron receiving ability, the investigators made a hypothesis that vitamin C supplementation can reduce inflammation status in patients on maintenance dialysis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Oral Vitamin C Supplement on the Inflammation Status in Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective A cross-over study is designed to elucidate if oral vitamin C supplementation can reduce inflammation status in maintenance dialysis patients with low vitamin C level and high CRP level. Patients, Methods and Expected results Patients About 100 dialysis patients were recruited. Patients will be divided into two groups, and will be followed for at least 6 months. Methods Arm 1(50cases): is given oral vitamin C 200mg per day in the first 3 months, then stop oral VitC for the next 3 months. Arm 2(50cases): is not given vitamin C in the first 3 months, then switch to receive oral VitC 200mg per day in the next 3 months. The demographics were recorded. Plasma Vitamin C was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum albumin, prealbumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, hemoglobin will be measured. Expected results There may be positive effect of vitamin C supplementation on inflammation in maintenance dialysis patients with vitamin C deficiency and high CRP level.</detailed_description>
