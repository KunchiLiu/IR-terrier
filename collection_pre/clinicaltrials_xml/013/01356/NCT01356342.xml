	<brief_summary>This is an open study of the use of AdimFlu-S (2010-2011 season) vaccine in young subjects aged between 6 months old to 18 years old. All participants will be divided into three age cohorts. First, participants aged 6 through &lt; 36 months will receive 2 doses of 0.25 mL vaccine separated by 4 weeks. Second, participants aged 3 through &lt; 9 years will receive 2 doses of 0.5 mL vaccine separated by 4 weeks. Third, participants aged 9 through &lt; 18 years will receive one dose of 0.5 mL vaccine. Safety outcomes included immediate reactions at the time of vaccination, solicited local and systemic reactions within 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events. Sera prepared from blood samples will be collected from each subject immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after each vaccination. Anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibody titers will be determined using the WHO haemaglutination inhibition reference technique. The analysis will be observer-blinded. All participants will be followed, either by clinical visit or by telephone contact, for 6 months after the first vaccination for safety reasons.</brief_summary>
