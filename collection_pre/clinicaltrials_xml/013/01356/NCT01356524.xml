	<brief_summary>In Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) there is a need for luteal support using progesterone, estrogen and probably human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The optimal route of administration and dose has not yet been determined. The aim of the study is to investigate whether high levels of mid-luteal serum progesterone are related to higher pregnancy rates in ART cycles. We also plan to investigate whether using higher doses of vaginal progesterone results in higher pregnancy rates.</brief_summary>
