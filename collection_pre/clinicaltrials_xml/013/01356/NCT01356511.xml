	<brief_summary>The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 11 well-known hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of high-dose dexamethasone compared to conventional dose prednisone for the first-line treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia(ITP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-dose Dexamethasone Versus Conventional Dose Prednisone for Initial Treatment of Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 300 adults with ITP from 11 medical centers in China. Part of the participants are randomly selected to receive high-dose dexamethasone treatment and the other part are selected to receive conventional dose of prednisone treatment. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of high-dose dexamethasone compared to conventional dose prednisone for the first-line treatment of adults with ITP.</detailed_description>
