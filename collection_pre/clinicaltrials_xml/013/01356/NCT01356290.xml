	<brief_summary>Patients with relapsed medulloblastoma have a very poor prognosis whether treated with conventional chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, irradiation or combinations of these modalities. Antiangiogenetic therapy has emerged as new treatment option in solid malignancies. The frequent, metronomic schedule targets both proliferating tumor cells and endothelial cells, and minimizes toxicity. In this study the investigators will evaluate the use of biweekly intravenous bevacizumab in combination with five oral drugs (thalidomide, celecoxib, fenofibrate, and alternating cycles of daily low-dose oral etoposide and cyclophosphamide), augmented with alternating courses of intrathecal etoposide and liposomal cytarabine. The aim of the study is to extend therapy options for children with recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma, for whom no known curative therapy exists, by prolonging survival while maintaining good quality of life. The primary objective of the MEMMAT trial is to evaluate the activity of this multidrug antiangiogenic approach in these heavily pretreated children and young adults. Additionally, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), as well as feasibility and toxicity will be examined.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Relapsed or progressive medulloblastoma (at least one site of untreated recurrent disease) Histological confirmation of medulloblastoma at diagnosis or relapse Female or male, aged from 0 to &lt;20 years (at time of original diagnosis) Participants must have normal organ and bone marrow function (ALT &lt;5x institutional upper limit of normal, creatinine &lt;1.5x institutional upper limit of normal for age, WBC &gt;1000/mm3, platelets &gt; 20,000/mm3. Patients with values less than WBC 2000/mm3 or platelets 50,000/mm3 will require initiation of treatment with etoposide and cyclophosphamide at a lower starting dose as defined within the protocol. Karnofsky performance status ≥50. For infants and children less than 12 years of age, the Lansky play scale ≥50% will be used Written informed consent of patients and / or parents Active infection VPshunt dependency Pregnancy or breast feeding Conventional chemotherapy, antiangiogenic treatment or complete irradiation of all disease for current relapse (surgery may be performed before antiangiogenic treatment; patients with sites of disease not irradiated are still eligible for the protocol) Known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs in the protocol Active peptic ulcer Any significant cardiovascular disease not controled by standard therapy e.g. systemic hypertension Anticipation of the need for major elective surgery during the course of the study treatment Any disease or condition that contraindicates the use of the study medication/treatment or places the patient at an unacceptable risk of experiencing treatmentrelated complications Nonhealing surgical wound A bone fracture that has not satisfactorily healed</criteria>
