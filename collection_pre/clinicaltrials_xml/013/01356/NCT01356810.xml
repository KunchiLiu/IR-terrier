	<brief_summary>Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with an acute onset and fluctuating course which is presented in 15 to 20% of patients admitted to general wards. It is a potentially life - threatening complication which can be prevented. It is the objective of this randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether a multicomponent environmental intervention could reduce the incidence of delirium in a general medical ward.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 287 patients 65 years of age or older who had been admitted to a general medicine ward and who were at risk of delirium were studied. Eligible patients were randomized to a multicomponent environmental intervention or standard care. Both groups were well balanced in patients characteristics and followed during the full hospital stay by a group trained in the application of the confusion assessment method to detect incident delirium.</detailed_description>
