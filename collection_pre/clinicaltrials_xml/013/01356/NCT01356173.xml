	<criteria>Histologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy or NHL without leukemic phase that has progressed or failed to respond to at least one prior regimen and/or are not candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit Evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 or IWG response criteria for patients with NHL and/or the following: prostate cancer patients with nonmeasurable disease are eligible if they have two rising prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels &gt;= 5 ng/mL measured &gt;= 2 weeks apart that meet the PSA, and Working Group criteria for progression prior to initiation of study treatment, and ovarian cancer patients with nonmeasurable disease are eligible if they have two rising CA125 levels greater than the ULN &gt;= 2 weeks apart prior to initiation of study treatment. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at screening Life expectancy of &gt;= 12 weeks Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for both men and women while participating in the study and for 90 days after the last dose of GDC0349 Willingness to provide archival tumor tissue Leptomeningeal disease as the only manifestation of the current malignancy History of Type 1 or 2 diabetes requiring daily medication Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or treated brain metastases that are not radiographically stable for &gt;= 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment Active congestive heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication Uncontrolled ascites requiring weekly largevolume paracentesis for 3 consecutive weeks prior to initiation of study treatment Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics Patients requiring any daily supplemental oxygen Uncontrolled hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia Any condition requiring anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin, or antithrombotics. Prophylactic anticoagulation and/or local application of thrombolytic agents for catheter patency may be allowed for patients with normal INR and with prior approval from the Medical Monitor Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Any other diseases, active or uncontrolled pulmonary dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, that may affect the interpretation of the results, or renders the patients at high risk from treatment complications Significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks prior to initiation of GDC0349 Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to initiation of GDC0349 Treatment with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (except GnRH agonists or antagonists for prostate cancer), immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation therapy (except palliative radiation to bony metastases) as cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Kinase inhibitors, approved by national regulatory authorities, may be used up to 2 weeks prior to initiation of GDC0349, provided that any drugrelated toxicity has completely resolved and prior approval is obtained from the Medical Monitor. Palliative radiation to bony metastases within 2 weeks prior to initiation of GDC0349 Treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to initiation of GDC0349 Unresolved toxicity from prior therapy, except for alopecia and Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy Pregnancy or lactation</criteria>
