	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a study to provide evidence about the comparative effectiveness of mailed, tailored intervention materials on cancer prevention behavioral outcomes. The investigators will send out three (3) tailored mailings for participants who are assigned to the intervention group. Second, during the eligibility screening, the investigators will be assessing the relative yield and functioning of two risk assessment tools (BRAT and FEARS) on determining an individual's level of risk for skin cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate the impact of a mailed, tailored intervention, on the skin cancer prevention and skin self-examination behaviors of high-risk and moderate-risk adults. Participants will be recruited in primary health care setting (Penn Radnor Clinic) after their scheduled appointment. During Phase I of this study, patients will be screened for their level of risk for skin cancer. They will be asked to complete a survey as well as undergo a quick skin exam administered by the research staff. Moderate- and high-risk persons will be invited to enroll in Phase II of the study, and will then complete a baseline survey either in person, over the phone, or via mail after they have consented. After completing a baseline survey, these participants will be randomized to receive tailored materials, including personalized risk feedback, or to a control group that will receive generic educational materials. Participants will then be re-assessed at follow-up approximately three (3) months later via a mailed survey. The intervention consists of one to three sets of intervention materials, depending on if they are randomized to the generic group or the tailored group. The first mailing will be sent out approximately two weeks after a participant completes the baseline survey, and is designed to educate participants on ways to prevent skin cancer though personalized behavioral changes. The second mailing will be sent out two weeks after the first mailing, and is designed to provide a guide to participants on steps to complete a skin self exam. Finally, the third mailing will be sent out two weeks after the second mailing, and will provide medical information to the participants regarding types of skin cancer along with tips to remember that encompass information from previous mailings. Finally, the participant will complete a follow-up survey approximately one (1) month after the last mailing has been mailed.</detailed_description>
