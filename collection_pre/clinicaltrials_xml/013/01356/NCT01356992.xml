	<brief_summary>This non-inferiority study aims at comparing Versa® to the reference enoxaparin (Clexane®, Sanofi-Aventis) in patients with high-risk unstable angina and NSTEMI. The main justification is the search for scientific evidence to prove the Versa® effectiveness for this new therapeutic indication, since it is a product with potential for reducing costs, with effectiveness and safety comparable to the reference drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patients With High-risk Acute Coronary Syndrome Without ST-segment Elevation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To be included in this study, the eligible patients must meet all criteria below: IC signature; The research subject must agree about following all instructions and perform the procedures and study visits; Men and women over the age of 18 and below the age of 75; History of angina of rest with a minimum duration of 20 minutes in the last 24 hours at the beginning and at least for 10 days. Patient Randomization up to 6 hours after the arrival at the emergency sector. Evidence of NSTEMI or unstable angina due to one or more of the following criteria: 1. Dynamic alterations on the T-wave (ST-segment depression or elevation &gt; 1 mm, and/or T-wave inversions which are solved at least partially when the symptoms are relieved) or 2. Unevenly ST-segment (depression or elevation) in a transitional way under continuous derivations (V1+V2 or V3+V4 or V5+V6 or D1+AVL or D2+D3+AVF) or 3. Biochemical alteration on the myocardial necrosis markers (CKMB mass, troponin T or I and CPK), with the appearance of enzymatic curve, characterizing myocardial injury or 5. Pulmonary Edema; or 6. Angina associated to murmur of mitral regurgitation; or 7. Angina with heart sound to cardiac auscultation or throes; or 8. Angina with hypotension; The patients who meet anyone of the criteria below will not be eligible for the study: 12-derivation-ECG with persistent ST-segment elevation; Diagnosis of angina by secondary cause (e.g., anemia, fever, hypovolemia, dehydration, use of cocaine); Use of non-fractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparin in the prior 48 to the randomization; Concomitant diseases, such as severe renal failure (creatinine clearance lower than 30ml/min.) and hepatic, or other significant comorbidities under investigator judgment; Recent hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (last 12 months); Patient scheduled for cardiac surgery of myocardial revascularization; Use of drugs, alcohol abuse; Pregnancy or lactation; Recent neurosurgery or ophthalmic surgery (last 3 months); History or diagnosis of coagulopathy; Medical record containing allergy, hypersensibility or intolerance to any of the drug components to be used on this study, which is judged as clinically significant in the main investigator's opinion; Recent participation (last 12 months) in a clinical study.</detailed_description>
