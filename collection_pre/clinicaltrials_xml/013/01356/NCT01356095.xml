	<brief_summary>Despite increased emphasis on evidence based practice in recent years a gap remains between evidence and practice, particularly in resource poor countries. Few studies to date have examined the use of knowledge translation strategies to improve health care outcomes in low income countries. However, given that the majority of health care in these settings is provided by workers with less training and limited resources, the theoretical potential for knowledge translation strategies to improve health care delivery and outcomes by integrating best evidence into routine practice may be greatest in these settings. Knowledge translation (KT) is an approach to changing health care provider behavior to reduce the gap between evidence and practice in health care delivery. There has been a tendency for knowledge translation interventions to employ generic, "off the shelf", strategies, and apply them to deal with specific issues. This generic approach, fails to recognize the variability in the specific characteristics of health care settings, in terms of their patient populations, health care systems, and health care providers. These characteristics, whether they function as barriers or facilitators to change, make a generalized approach to KT ineffective, where a tailored strategy, which specifically adjusts its approach to measured local barriers and facilitators may achieve better alignment of practice to evidence. This is likely to be particularly true in low income countries where the majority of health care is provided by non-physician health care workers, working within a wider range of health care systems, with variable and unique patient populations and resource constraints. Given the potential to significantly impact health care outcomes at relatively low cost, further research is needed both to develop methods for identifying potential barriers and facilitators to KT strategies in specific resource poor settings, and to evaluate the effectiveness of KT strategies tailored to address the identified barriers. This study will assess the effectiveness of a two part knowledge translation intervention tailored to address factors identified in a previous study as functioning as barriers and facilitators to treatment adherence among patients on treatment for tuberculosis or combined tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment, targeting improved patient adherence and health outcomes, in a specific low income country.</brief_summary>
