	<criteria>Symptomatic with a regurgitant or stenotic pulmonary valved conduit. Angiographic evidence of coronary artery compression. RVPA pulmonary conduit size that is either too large or too small to accommodate the SAPIEN THV. Thrombus or intracardiac mass in the right atrium, right ventricle, and/or pulmonic valve. Severe coagulation problems and/or unable to tolerate anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy. Active bacterial endocarditis or other active infections. Illeofemoral venous stenosis that may prevent the placement of the introducer sheath and/or central venous vascular tortuosities that may prevent advancement of the delivery system to the heart or into the pulmonary artery. Presence of any prosthetic valve in the tricuspid position. Unstable coronary artery diseaserelated angina. Placement of the SAPIEN THV in pregnant females.</criteria>
