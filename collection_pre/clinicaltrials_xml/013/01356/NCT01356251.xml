	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to learn about how mesothelioma affects patients' emotional and physical well-being. Also, the investigators would like to learn more about what patients need and how they deal with this illness. This information can help us find ways to lessen physical and emotional strains. Part of the study tests an alternate way of giving emotional support through the Internet. By providing support online, patients can participate in the comfort of their home.</brief_summary>
