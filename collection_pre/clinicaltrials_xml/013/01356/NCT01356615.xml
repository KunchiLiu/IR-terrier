	<brief_summary>Low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) as well as Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is used as anticoagulation during hemodialysis (HD) therapy. In this study the investigators have compared clinical efficacy and safety of LMWH and UFH, and their effect on lipid profile.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this prospective, randomized, cross-over study the investigators compared the safety, clinical efficacy of Clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi-Aventis) with unfractionated heparin in 27 chronic HD patients. Group A received Clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi-Aventis) and were followed up for 3 months and then crossed over to Unfractionated heparin for a further 3-month period. Group B received Unfractionated heparin first and then crossed over to Clexane, each followed up for 3 months. Heparin anticoagulation, clinical clotting and hemorrhage were evaluated by visual inspection after blood draining of the air trap.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients in end stage renal failure requiring maintenance dialysis were recruited into the study Patients with known bleeding disorders Subjects receiving oral or other forms of anticoagulant therapy (e.g. warfarin, aspirin) or drugs that could affect heparin activity (e.g. digitalis, tetracyclines, and antihistamines) were also excluded. Subjects continued their usual medication (including lipidlowering therapy ) and were treated in the normal manner by their caring physicians during the study.</criteria>
