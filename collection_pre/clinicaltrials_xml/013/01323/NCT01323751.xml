	<criteria>Patient has relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM with measurable disease parameters according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria Refractory is defined as experiencing less than minimal response (MR) to or progressive disease (PD) within 60 days after completion of the most recent antiMM regimen Relapsed is defined as experiencing PD that requires therapy but which is not refractory following the achievement of stable disease (SD) or better to the most recent antiMM regimen. Patient received at least 2 prior regimens for MM. Patient received prior treatment for MM with a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, unless not a candidate for a proteasome inhibitor or an immunomodulatory drug. Patient either is not a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), has declined the option of ASCT, or has relapsed after prior ASCT. Patient is ≥18 years of age. Patient has a Karnofsky Performance Status score of ≥70 Patient has adequate bone marrow reserve, as evidenced by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥1.0x109/L. Platelet count of ≥ 75x109/L in patients in whom &lt;50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells and ≥50x109/L in patients in whom more than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells. Patient has adequate renal function (calculated creatinine clearance of ≥30 mL/min according to the CockroftGault) Patient has adequate hepatic function (serum bilirubin values &lt;2.0 mg/dL and ALT and/or AST values &lt;3 × the upper limit of normal ULN). Patient has a corrected serum calcium ≤ULN. Exclusion Criteria Patient has received any of the following therapies: Radiotherapy or systemic therapy within 2 weeks of baseline Prior peripheral autologous stem cell transplant within 12 wks of Baseline. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. Prior treatment with an HDAC inhibitor. Patient has an active systemic infection requiring treatment. Patient has a history of other malignancies unless has undergone definitive treatment more than 5 yrs prior to study and without evidence of recurrent malignant disease (excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin; superficial carcinoma of the bladder; carcinoma of the prostate with a current prostatespecific antigen &lt;0.1 ng/mL; or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). Patient has known or suspected HIV, positive for hepatitis B or is known or suspected to have active hepatitis C infection. Patient has a history of significant cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, respiratory, or inflammatory illness including recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months)or stroke; hypertension requiring &gt;2 medications for adequate control; diabetes mellitus with &gt;2 episodes of ketoacidosis in the preceding 12 months; or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring &gt;2 hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months. Patient has a QTcF value of &gt;480 msec; family or personal history of long QTc syndrome or ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular bigeminy; previous history of druginduced QTc prolongation Patient has &gt; Grade 2 painful neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy Patient has a history of allergic reaction attributable to bortezomib or other compounds containing boron or mannitol (Phase 1b and 2a only)</criteria>
