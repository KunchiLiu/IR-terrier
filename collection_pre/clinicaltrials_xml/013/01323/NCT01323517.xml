	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see the effect of adding a systemic study drug, Ipilimumab, to two standard chemotherapy drugs, Melphalan and Dactinomycin. The study drug Ipilimumab is an antibody to a normal protein found in the body, CTLA-4. This protein normally allows the immune system (the body's natural defense system that helps fight infections) uses to quiet an immune response. The study drug works by blocking this protein and allowing the immune system to become more active. This study will investigate the effects, of combining ILI (using two standard drugs to treat melanoma, Melphalan and Dactinomycin), with the study drug, Ipilimumab on advanced Melanoma cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willing and able to give written informed consent. Histologic diagnosis of melanoma with in transit metastasis Stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV Required values for initial laboratory tests: WBC ≥ 2000/uL ANC ≥ 1000/uL Platelets ≥ 50 x 103/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 3.0 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN, (except patients with Gilbert's Syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL) No active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. Karnofsky performance status ≥60 Men and women, ≥ 18 years of age. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopause is defined as: Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL. Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab. Any other malignancy form which the patient has been diseasefree for less than 2 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. GuillainBarre Syndrome). Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea. Patients with underlying heart conditions who are deemed ineligible for surgery by cardiology consult Any history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior CD137 agonist or CTLA4 inhibitor or agonist. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL2, interferon, or other nonstudy immunotherapy regimens; immunosuppressive agents; other investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), who: are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation of study drug, or have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or are pregnant or breastfeeding. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 8 weeks after ipilimumab is stopped. Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be enrolled in the study.</criteria>
