Subjects were not to have donated blood within 90 days prior to study initiation. Subjects were not to have had an abnormal diet or substantial changes in eating habits within 30 days prior to study initiation. Subjects were not to have had treatment with any known enzymealtering agents (barbiturates, phenothiazines, cimetidine etc.) within 30 days prior to or during the study.
