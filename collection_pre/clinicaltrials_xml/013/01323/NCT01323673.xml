	<brief_title>Ethanol-Free Clobetasol Propionate Foam 0.05% (Olux-E Foam) vs Vehicle Foam in the Treatment of Chronic Hand Dermatitis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. Clobetasol propionate foam 0.05% (Olux-E), a Class 1 corticosteroid, is formulated in an ethanol free petrolatum base that provides the benefits of a super-potent corticosteroid combined with moisturizing ingredients in the treatment of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. The current study is designed to show efficacy and safety in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic hand dermatitis.</detailed_description>
