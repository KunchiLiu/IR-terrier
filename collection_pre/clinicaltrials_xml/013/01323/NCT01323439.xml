	<brief_summary>Ten study centers from US are anticipated to participate for this evaluation. Published literature on coils with electrolytic, thermal or hydraulic detachment will serve as the basis for control comparisons to the Axium™ MicroFX™ Detachable Coil System for patients undergoing embolization of intracranial aneurysm. Comparison will be based on criteria evaluating the safety of the procedure, the reliability of detachment, the occlusion stability and the packing density impact</brief_summary>
