	<brief_summary>Multi-center, prospective nonrandomized study of treatment for 1 and 2 level degenerative disc disease between L2 and S1. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 2 years. The primary objective of this study to measure fusion success in patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease using the ATB and ALIF/FRA Spacer. The Secondary objective is evaluation of the patient's quality of life, pain and function.</brief_summary>
