	<brief_summary>The actually most accepted method of effective smoking cessation is based on structured consultation and medical care in combination with supportive medical treatment. A group of experts developed the concept "EINFACH ERFOLGREICH RAUCHFREI" ("EASY EFFECTIVE SMOKELESS") for general practitioners providing a structured compendium for negotiation. Physicians who have implemented this concept will conduct this non-interventional study. The implementation of the scheme will be investigated under general practice conditions and the applicability of the concept has to be assessed by the physicians. In addition further knowledge of smoking cessation in would-be non-smokers which decided to quit, supported by medical treatment with NICORETTE®-products, will be documented for a large patient collective under real practice conditions. To answer all above mentioned questions for a sufficient number of patients a multicenter, prospective non-interventional study design was used for this trial as only this instrument detects characteristics of the physicians' treatment without any further input or other influences.</brief_summary>
