	<brief_title>Krill Oil Study Compared to Fish Oil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids into the blood following consumption of krill oil compared with fish oil and placebo. An additional purpose is to evaluate the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of consumption of Krill Oil and Fish Oil to a placebo product. It has been shown that the ingestion of Krill Oil leads to better absorption of omega-3 fatty acids compared to ingestion of Fish Oil. It was also shown that consumption of krill oil and fish oil result in a favorable modification of lipid profiles. Therefore, it is anticipated that consumption of these krill oil and fish oil will improve lipid profile, as well as other health-related markers and will be safe and well tolerated.</detailed_description>
