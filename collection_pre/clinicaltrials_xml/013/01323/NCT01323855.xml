	<brief_summary>This is a two part study to compare the PK of preladenant administered to participants with CRI to the PK of preladenant administered to healthy participants. Part 1 will compare the PK of participants with severe CRI to healthy participants. Part 2 will compare the PK of participants with moderate CRI and participants with mild CRI to healthy participants. The primary hypotheses are that the plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity after single dosing (AUC0-âˆž) of preladenant in participants with either severe, moderate or mild CRI is similar to that of matched healthy participants.</brief_summary>
