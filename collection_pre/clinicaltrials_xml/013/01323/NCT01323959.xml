Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study and receive the booster vaccine, if the subject: practices/has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and agrees to continue adequate contraception during the entire booster epoch. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the booster dose of the study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster dose. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to booster vaccination, or planned administration during the active study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or poliovirus since the dose received in study NCT01277705. In Germany, previous dose of a monovalent vaccine against pertussis is allowed for subjects in the Group C. History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or poliomyelitis diseases following the receipt of booster dose in study NCT01277705. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficiency condition based on medical history and physical examination. Occurrence of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an earlier immunisation against diphtheria and/or tetanus. Occurrence of any of the following adverse event after a previous administration of a DTP vaccine: Hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine, encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within seven days following previous vaccination with pertussiscontaining vaccine, fever ≥ 40°C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause, collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination, convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster dose or planned administration during the study period. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
