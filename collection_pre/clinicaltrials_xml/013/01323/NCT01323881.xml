	<brief_summary>This pilot sham-controlled study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation given as a facilitatory intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS1200, 1200 stimuli/session) paradigm to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients with first-ever, MRI-confirmed monohemispheric ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory, and NIH Stroke Scale motor arm score 1-2 with recordable active motor thresholds (aMT) of the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) between 2-4 weeks after the stroke onset, are randomized into two groups to receive either iTBS1200 or sham stimulation over the ipsilesional M1 hand region for 10 daily sessions in 2 weeks. All have standardized medical and intensive rehabilitation treatments. The outcome measures included Action Research Arm test (ARAT), Fugl-Meyer test (FMT), aMT and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of ECR.</detailed_description>
