	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a treatment with TMC435 in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in patients who did not clear their hepatitis C infection with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone within a previous trial conducted by Tibotec, or who participated in Tibotec trials in which antivirals directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV) were evaluated for short periods of time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of TMC435 in Combination With Peginterferon Alfa-2A and Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Virus Genotype-1 Infected Patients Who Participated in a Control Group of a TMC435 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a roll over trial of TMC435 for patients with genotype-1 HCV infection who participated in the control (placebo; substance containing no active medication) group of a TMC435 trial or who received a treatment for up to 14 days with antivirals directed against HCV in a previous Tibotec trial. Patients in this study will receive TMC435 in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin (Copegus) followed by peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. The total treatment duration will be 24 or 48 weeks, depending on how the patients respond to treatment and which was their previous response to peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. The study doctor will inform each patient about how to take their study medication and when they should stop taking it. After a patient stops taking study medication, they will contiue to come to the doctor's office for study visits until 24 weeks (in some cases up to 48 weeks) after end of treatment. The total duration of the study is 78 weeks (including screening). Patients will be monitored for safety throughout the study. Study assessments at each visit may include but are not limited to: blood and urine collection for testing, electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments (a measurement of the electrical activity of the heart) and physical examinations. TMC435 will be taken as an oral capsule of 150 mg once per day. Peginterferon (Pegasys) will be given as an injection of 180 Âµg once each week. Ribavirin will be taken as tablets (Copegus) twice each day and the dose will depend on patient's body weight.</detailed_description>
