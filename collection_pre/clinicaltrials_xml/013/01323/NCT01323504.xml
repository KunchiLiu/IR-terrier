	<brief_summary>It is estimated that 800,000 people in France suffer from peripheral artery disease (PAD), of whom 1-2% present the most severe form critical limb ischaemia (CLI). In this situation, the patient frequently presents painful non-healing ulcers and focal gangrene. Wound care is generally associated with increasing pain. Pain relief may be challenging in spite of major analgesics. Several studies in this country and elsewhere assessed the usefulness of music for chronic or acute pain relief during care. However, no data are published regarding the interest of music therapy for pain relief during local care in PAD patients.</brief_summary>
