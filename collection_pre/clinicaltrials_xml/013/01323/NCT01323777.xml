	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR® +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL Models SND1T3, SND1T4, SND1T5, and SND1T6 when implanted to replace the natural lens in Japanese cataract patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR® +3.0 D Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lens (IOL) Clinical Study in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants completed a preoperative examination of both eyes, implantation of the IOL at the operative visit for each eye, and up to 8 postoperative visits: Day 1-2, Day 7-14, and Day 30-60 after each implantation, and Day 120-180 and Day 330-420 after second eye implantation. The second implantation occurred within 30 days of the first.The primary eye was defined as the eye with higher astigmatism, with the other eye defined as the secondary eye. If both eyes had the same level of astigmatism, the first implanted eye was set as the primary eye.</detailed_description>
