	<detailed_description>Components of evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatments from current manuals developed for depression and anxiety will be used to construct the 8-week treatment program. The flexibility of modular based treatment allows patients and counselors to personalize interventions and skills for managing anxiety and depressive symptoms. The first treatment session will be in-person. All following sessions will be provided by telephone. Caregivers will have the option of being involved in 2 ways throughout treatment - as a "coach" to facilitate use of new skills by their loved one with PD and as a recipient of stress- management support. The scope of caregiver involvement will vary across patients, based on their preference. Involved caregivers will be given the opportunity to participate in 1 telephone-based stress-management session and 1 follow-up call scheduled individually during the first 4 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
