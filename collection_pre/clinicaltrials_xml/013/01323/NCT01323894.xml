	<detailed_description>Our previous work is investigating the viral (Adv-BMP-2) administration for the development of a model to generate bones for possible use in clinical settings; the non-viral and viral administrations will be compared for best osteogenesis effects. The first year purpose: The best concentration of canonical Wnt3a will be investigated in promoting the osteoblastogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells.</detailed_description>
