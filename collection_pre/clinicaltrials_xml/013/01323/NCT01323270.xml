Vaccination with any diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or poliomyelitis virus vaccine within 5 years of the first study vaccination. A previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccinerelated component. Contraindication to vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or poliomyelitis virus vaccine. Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate intramuscular injection.
