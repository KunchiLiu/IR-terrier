	<brief_summary>Major abdominal surgery is associated with postoperative pain. Transversus Abdominis Plane(TAP) block has been shown to reduce pain and opioid-requirements after abdominal surgery. However a single block has a short effect of up to 12 hours depending on the type local-anesthetics used. With this study we wish to investigate the possibilities to place a TAP-catheter in order to prolong the the effect of the TAP-block by giving repeatedly bolus-injections in the TAP catheter and to study the pain and the opioid requirements of patients undergoing elective colon-resection when given a TAP-catheter preoperatively. Our hypothesis is that it is practical and technical possible to place bilateral TAP-catheters pre-operatively and that pain and opioid-requirements will be low.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain is a major challenge in the work of anesthesia. Epidural catheter is the golden standard for postoperative pain management after major abdominal surgery. However a number of patient have absolute or relative contraindication to the placement of an epidural catheter. It is therefore necessary to find a good alternative to epidural catheter. Transversus abdominis plane(TAP) block has been shown to provide analgesia of the abdominal wall and reduce opioid-requirements and pain after abdominal surgery. However the effect of a TAP block is limited to the time of efficacy of the local analgesic used. Placing a TAP-catheter in order to prolong the effect of the TAP-block by repeatedly bolus-injections in the TAP-catheters has only been sporadically described and so far never investigated in a systematic way. We will investigate the practical and technical possibility to place bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP-catheters pre-operatively on patients undergoing elective colon-resection. Further more we will evaluate the pain and opioid-requirement postoperatively.</detailed_description>
