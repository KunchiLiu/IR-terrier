	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether remote ischemic conditioning can improve the outcome after renal transplantation with deceased donor. Remote ischemic conditioning is performed on the patient receiving a kidney from a deceased donor. Remote ischemic conditioning is done during the operation by inflating a tourniquet on the patients leg before opening the blood circulation to the kidney. The study focus on both the immediate kidney function after the transplantation, but also on the extended kidney function one year after the transplantation.</brief_summary>
