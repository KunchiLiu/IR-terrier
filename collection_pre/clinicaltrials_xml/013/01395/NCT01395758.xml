	<brief_title>Erlotinib Plus Tivantinib (ARQ 197) Versus Single Agent Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label Phase 2 study designed to compare treatment with erlotinib plus tivantinib (ARQ 197) versus single agent chemotherapy in subjects with previously treated KRAS mutation positive NSCLC. Eligible subjects are randomly assigned to receive erlotinib plus tivantinib or one of three (based on Investigator's decision) single-agent chemotherapy agents including pemetrexed, docetaxel, or gemcitabine.</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2 8. Male or female subjects of childproducing potential must agree to use double barrier contraception, oral contraceptives or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 90 days after the last day of treatment 9. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 10. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ 5 × ULN with metastatic liver disease 11. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN 12.

Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (transfusion is allowed at least 7 days prior to randomization) 16. Subjects must agree to allow testing for cMet status if archival and/or fresh tissue biopsy samples are available. 1. Previous receipt of erlotinib or other EGFR 2. Previous receipt of any cMET inhibitor or other cMETtargeted therapy, including ARQ 197, MetMab, crizotinib 3. Prior receipt of chemotherapy agent selected for administration in this study (e.g., if subject was treated with gemcitabine, he is not eligible to receive gemcitabine in this study but eligible to receive pemetrexed or docetaxel). 4. Inability or unwillingness to receive ARQ 197, erlotinib, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and/or pemetrexed including contraindications, hypersensitivity, or prior administration 5. Receipt of any antitumor treatment for NSCLC within 3 weeks (2 weeks for radiotherapy) prior to randomization 6. Pregnant or breastfeeding 7. Significant gastrointestinal disorder that could, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with the absorption of ARQ 197 and/or erlotinib 8. Any other significant comorbid conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would impair study participation or cooperation 9. Other malignancies within the last three years, with the exception of adequately treated intraepithelial carcinoma of the cervix uteri, prostate carcinoma with a PSA value &lt; 0.2 ng/mL or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 10. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 11. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization 12. History of cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure defined as Class II to IV per New York Heart Association classification; Active coronary artery disease; Previously diagnosed bradycardia or other cardiac arrhythmia defined as ≥ Grade 2 according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, or uncontrolled hypertension; Myocardial infarction that occurred within 6 months prior to study entry (myocardial infarction that occurred &gt; 6 months prior to study entry is permitted) 13. Clinically unstable central nervous system metastasis (to be enrolled in the study, subjects must have confirmation of stable disease by MRI or CT scan within 4 weeks of randomization and have CNS metastases well controlled by steroids, antiepileptics or other symptomrelieving medications) 14. Known EGFRmutation positive status</criteria>
