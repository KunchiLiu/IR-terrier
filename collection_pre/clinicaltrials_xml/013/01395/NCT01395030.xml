	<brief_summary>Altered choline phospholipid metabolism is a recently recognized hallmark of cancer and potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in a number of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The feasibility of detecting HCC on the basis of measuring the phosphorylation rate of choline in-vivo has been shown using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and the investigational tracer compound [18F] fluorocholine (FCH). This Phase 2 study will evaluate the diagnostic performance of FCH PET/CT in patients undergoing surgical resection as treatment for HCC. Since the molecular signaling alterations leading to enhanced choline metabolism in tumors are not fully elucidated at this time, this study will also collect frozen tissue specimens for whole-genome gene expression profiling to elucidate genes and signal transduction pathways related to altered choline metabolism in HCC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomic and Imaging Study for Patients Undergoing Surgery for Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty (80) human subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who meet selection criteria will undergo PET/CT imaging with 18F-fluoromethylcholine (FCH or 18F-choline) prior to surgical hepatic resection. The PET/CT will measure the dynamic tissue delivery and uptake of 18F-choline in the liver, as well as its static distribution in this organ after a fixed period of time. Kinetic modeling will be performed using the PET/CT data to quantify parameters related to 18F-choline delivery, uptake, and phosphorylation. The imaging findings will be compared with histopathologic diagnosis following surgery to estimate the detection rate and other diagnostic parameters of PET/CT for HCC. Tumor and liver tissue samples will also be obtained following surgery for gene expression analysis. These results will be correlated with the imaging findings. The surgical procedures are clinically warranted and not considered a part of the investigation.</detailed_description>
