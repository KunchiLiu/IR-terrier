	<brief_summary>Despite the availability of effective anti-tuberculosis agents that exist to treat this illness, hepatotoxicity during first-line drugs anti-tuberculosis medications (ATT) such as isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA) is not uncommon and limit their use. There is no consensus on method of the reintroduction of anti-TB medications. The risk of reintroducing of a anti-TB medications could be hazardous. There are several differences between the guidelines from the ATS, BTS and the Task Force of the European Respiratory Society, the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease about the methods of reintroducing of anti-TB medications. The investigators plan to do a prospective study to evaluate the outcome and safety of reintroduction of anti-TB medications after resolution of hepatitis during anti-TB treatment among TB patients in the investigators hospital.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reintroduction Regimens After Hepatitis During Anti-tuberculosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading health problem in both developing and developed countries. Despite the availability of effective chemotherapeutic agents that exist to treat this illness, hepatotoxicity during first-line drugs anti-tuberculosis medications (ATT) such as isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA) is not uncommon and limit their use. In the case of confirmed moderate or severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity, treatment should be interrupted and reintroduced after the hepatotoxicity has resolved. There is no consensus on method of the reintroduction of anti-TB medications. The risk of reintroducing of a anti-TB medications could be hazardous. There are several differences between the guidelines from the ATS, BTS and the Task Force of the European Respiratory Society, the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease about the methods of reintroducing of anti-TB medications. We plan to do a prospective study to evaluate the outcome and safety of reintroduction of anti-TB medications after resolution of hepatitis during anti-TB treatment among TB patients in our hospital.</detailed_description>
