	<brief_summary>The ability of pioglitazone (PIO) to alter the effects of opioids in humans has not been characterized in a controlled laboratory setting. Accordingly, the proposed investigation seeks to examine the effects of PIO on oxycodone, one of the most commonly used and abused opioid drugs in the U.S. (Davis et al., 2003). More specifically, the primary aim of this investigation is to characterize the subjective effects of oxycodone under maintenance on various doses of PIO (0, 15, and 45 mg) in non-dependent, prescription opioid abusers. Secondary aims of the study are to examine the influence of PIO on the analgesic, cognitive, and physiological effects of oxycodone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 9-week investigation will use an inpatient/outpatient design in which participants will be maintained on ascending doses of pioglitazone (3 weeks on placebo followed by 3 weeks on PIO 15 mg followed by 3 weeks on PIO 45 mg). At the end of each maintenance period the effects of oxycodone (0, 10, and 20 mg) will be examined during a single laboratory session using a cumulative dosing procedure.</detailed_description>
