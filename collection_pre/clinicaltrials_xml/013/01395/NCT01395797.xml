	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed research is to improve the effectiveness of treatments for opioid and for nicotine dependence by testing a novel pharmacological strategy. Specifically, pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma receptor (PPARÎ³) agonist, will be used as an adjunct to agonist-based treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone for Heroin and for Nicotine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although treatments for opioid and for nicotine dependence exist, these medications are not universally effective as many patients are unable to stop using or relapse rapidly, suggesting that treatment with a single agent alone is insufficient to facilitate cessation of use in many patients. Targeting additional pathways that may contribute to the maintenance of drug-taking behaviors or relapse may be a more effective strategy to treat individuals resistant to first-line approaches.</detailed_description>
