	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Clinical Trial for Treatment of Aromatic L-amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) Deficiency Using AAV2-hAADC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is an enzyme responsible for the final step in the synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. AADC deficiency is a rare genetic disorder. Taiwanese carry a high prevalence of AADC deficiency due to the founder mutation IVS6+4 A&gt;T, and patients usually die before the age 5-6 years due to severe motor dysfunction. Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 (AAV2) driven human AADC (hAADC) has been tested in both animal models and Phase I clinical trials of Parkinson disease. We have done a compassionate treatment of 8 patients with AADC deficiency by AAV2-hAADC and demonstrated a result that among the treated patients, 4 could stand with support, 3 could sit with support, and there was no virus-associated toxicity. The longest follow up has exceeded 4 years. This study is to prove the safety and efficacy of AAV2-hAADC treatment for patients with Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A definitive diagnosis of AADC deficiency, including a CSF study showing decreased levels of HVA and 5HIAA, and an elevated Ldopa level, and the presence of at least one AADC gene pathologic mutation. 2. The patient must have clinical symptoms of AADC deficiency, include hypotonia, dystonia, and oculogyric crisis. 3. The patient must be older than 24 months of age or has skull bones suitable for surgery. 4. The parents of study participants must agree to comply in good faith with the required baseline and followup assessments. 5. The parents or guardians must understand and sign their child's informed consent form. Exclusion criteria 1. Other significant medical or neurological conditions which would create an unacceptable operative risk. Each case will be individually reviewed and the final decision shall rest with the Primary Investigator. 2. Preexisting immunity to AAV may limit AAVmediated gene delivery. Patients with antiAAV2 antibody titer higher than 1.0 OD will be excluded. 3. The patient cannot take medicines that will alter the effect of this clinical trial.</criteria>
