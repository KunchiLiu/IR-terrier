	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to conduct a pilot test of a new tracer in healthy human volunteers to define normal tracer biodistribution (where the tracer goes), stability (how much metabolises), pharmacokinetics (how much stays in which organs and for how long), and radiation dosimetry (organ radiation dose). The same radiopharmaceutical will then be tested in cancer patients.</brief_summary>
