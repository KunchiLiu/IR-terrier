	<brief_summary>Remote Ischemic PreConditioning (RIPC) will improve the postoperative pain experience in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Although abdominal surgery can be a lifesaving procedure many people have a significant amount of postsurgical pain. Severe postsurgical pain may lead to chronic pain in some people. "Remote Ischemic Preconditioning" may reduce the amount of postsurgical pain. Remote ischemic preconditioning is done by inflating a balloon (very similar to a blood pressure cuff) on the leg until it blocks blood flow for a few minutes. The cuff is then deflated and blood flow resumes. The process is repeated up to three times. This procedure causes the body to increase its natural pain relief system that may help to decrease the amount of postsurgical pain.</brief_summary>
