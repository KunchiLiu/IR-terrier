	<brief_summary>Balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures has been shown to be successful in providing acute pain relief, enabling improved function, and restoring of vertebral body height. However, limited prospective data exists in the investigation of unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty as a sufficient alternative to bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of unipedicular and bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty.</brief_summary>
