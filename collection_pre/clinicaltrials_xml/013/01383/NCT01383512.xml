	<brief_summary>Upper limb motor control after a stroke may be improved with rehabilitation robotics at a subacute stage. The aim of this multicenter controled randomized single blind study is to define the place of rehabilitation robotics at this phase of the rehabilitation process. Both groups will realize the same time of rehabilitation. The cost benefit ratio will be compared in each group through medical assessment of improvement and definition of the costs due to the rehabilitation process.</brief_summary>
