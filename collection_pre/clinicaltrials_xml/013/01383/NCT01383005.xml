	<brief_summary>Both twice-a-day (BID) and once-a-day (QD) dosing are approved in Europe for the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r; Kaletra®). Since once-a-day dosing is actually a driver for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients to request a specific antiretroviral, the aim of this study is to assess both patient's perception of and adherence to Kaletra once-a-day, as well as with which factors they are related.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Perception of QD (Once a Day) Dosed Kaletra (Tablets)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, post-marketing, observational, cross-sectional (single visit) study in HIV-infected patients treated with a combination of antiretroviral treatment (ART) containing LPV/r 200/50 mg tablets dosed QD for at least 12 weeks to assess the participants' satisfaction and adherence level with LPV/r QD ART as measured by specific validated participant questionnaires. As this is a non-interventional study, the decision to enroll a participant was separate from the decision to treat the subject with LPV/r. Prescription of LPV/r and duration of treatment were the responsibility of the treating physician. In addition, the overall study population was compared to Cohort 2 (394 patients on LPV/r BID for ≥3 months to &lt;2 years) from KAPITAL2, a post-marketing observational, cross-sectional, single visit, multicenter, national study.

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Men or women aged 18 years or older, HIVinfected. 2. Patients who were under LPV/r Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) for 3 to 24 months before study visit: Cohort 1: patients on LPV/r QD since they started the LPV/r regimen and who were naïve to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy.* Cohort 2: patients who previously started on LPV/r BID (maximum of 24 months before study) and switched to LPV/r QD (at least 3 months before the study visit).* 3. Patients who were able to complete questionnaires by themselves. 4. Patients who signed/dated informed consent to participate in the study. NOTE: Patients who were taking LPV/r QD should have had no more than 3 protease inhibitor mutations by the time the treatment with this LPV/r dosing was initiated. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients who were on LPV/r monotherapy or bitherapy or on BID dosing at time of study visit. 2. Patients who were using another LPV/r formulation different from 200/50 LPV/r mg tablets. 3. Patients who were participating in any other clinical trial or postmarketing observational study (PMOS). 4. Patients who were unable to read and/or write. 5. Patients who were under treatment interruption. Patients who have stopped LPVtherapy for more than 3 months in the 12 months preceding study visit.</criteria>
