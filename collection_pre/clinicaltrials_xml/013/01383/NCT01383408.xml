	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that specially trained sniffer dogs are capable to discriminate breath samples of patients with lung cancer and healthy individuals. So far it is not known whether this differentiation is specific for lung cancer or just identifies any form of (solid) tumor. Therefore, the dog's ability to differentiate between lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer is tested.</brief_summary>
