	<brief_summary>This is a 2-group RCT in 380 tobacco-using medical patients that will compare a single session, computer-directed 5 A's intervention for smoking (experimental condition) to screening and resource provision (control condition). Follow-up visits will occur at 1 and 3 months post study enrollment. Measures will focus on tobacco use and related psychosocial outcomes (e.g. mood, stress). We will compare resources used and economic costs needed to implement each intervention. The Investigators hypothesize that patients receiving the computer-directed intervention will have significantly higher tobacco abstinence rates at 3 months post study enrollment compared to the control group. If indeed the computerized intervention increases tobacco abstinence rates compared to the control group, this intervention could be used to increase access to treatment for the millions of US smokers, ultimately reducing tobacco mortality and morbidity rates in this country.</brief_summary>
