	<criteria>Study participants must have a cataract for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior IOL implantation has been planned in at least one eye. Study participants should be capable of achieving better than 20/30 Snellen best corrected distance vision after cataract extraction and IOL implantation. The surgeon may use the Mentor Potential Acuity Meter (PAM) laser interferometer, McIntyre Pinhole, or his/her judgment to estimate the patient's potential acuity. Concurrent participation or participation in the last thirty days in any other clinical trial. Known steroid IOP responder Taking medications that may affect vision, IOP or ease of cataract surgery (e.g., Flomax, Glaucoma mediations, etc.) Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.) Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease Corneal abnormalities (e.g., stromal, epithelial or endothelial dystrophies) Pseudoexfoliation Ocular hypertension IOP &gt;25 mmHg by tonometry or glaucomatous changes in the optic nerve</criteria>
