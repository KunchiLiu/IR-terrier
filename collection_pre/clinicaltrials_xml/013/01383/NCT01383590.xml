	<brief_summary>Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Cat-PAD is a novel synthetic, allergen derived peptide desensitizing vaccine currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy. At present, the efficacy of immunotherapy (peptide or otherwise) can only be established at the conclusion of therapy. The aim of this study is to identify changes in potential biomarkers after peptide immunotherapy that may be subsequently developed as biomarkers that equate with clinical efficacy.</brief_summary>
