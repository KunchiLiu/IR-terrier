	<brief_summary>This is a two part study. Part A is a multiple-ascending dose study in up to 6 different groups of healthy subjects, with approximately 12 subjects in each of the groups. Part A will allow investigation of up to 6 different doses of LY2979165. The drug will be administered for a total of 14 days. Subjects will be resident in the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) until Day 15. Part B will investigate a dose of LY2979165 previously administered in Part A in up to 12 subjects. The drug will be administered for a total of 14 days. In addition to the same assessments as would have been completed in Part A, subjects in Part B will also have cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from the lower lumbar region of their spine.</brief_summary>

If this situation arises, inclusion of an otherwise suitable subject may be at the discretion of the sponsor. Intended use of herbal supplements or prescription medications, other than stable doses of thyroid or estrogen hormone replacement, within 14 days prior to dosing or during the study. If this situation arises, inclusion of an otherwise suitable subject may be at the discretion of the sponsor. Have donated blood of more than 450 mL within the last 3 months Subjects who meet at least 1 of the following criteria (1 unit = 12 oz or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits): a) subjects who have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week (males) and 14 units per week (females), b) subjects unwilling to stop alcohol consumption 48 hours prior to dosing until the completion of the 14day dosing period, or c) subjects unwilling to limit alcohol intake to no more than 3 units per day at other times during the study. Cigarette consumption of more than 10 cigarettes per day or unable/unwilling to abide by CRU smoking restrictions during admissions Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study Additional criteria for Part B: Abnormalities in lumbar spine previously known or determined by screening lumbar xray (if conducted). History of clinically significant back pain, back pathology and/or back injury (for example, degenerative disease, spinal deformity or spinal surgery) that may predispose to complications or technical difficulty with lumbar puncture Have evidence or history of significant active bleeding or coagulation disorder or have taken nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or other drugs that affect coagulation or platelet function within 14 days prior to lumbar catheter insertion Have an allergy to lidocaine (XylocaineÂ®) or its derivatives Have medical or surgical conditions in which lumbar puncture is contraindicated</criteria>
