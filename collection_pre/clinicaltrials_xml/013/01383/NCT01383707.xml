	<brief_summary>The multicenter, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized, two-stage Simon's design, phase II study (The CLMO-001 Trial) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 (Levofolinic acid, 5-Fluorouracil [5-FU] and oxaliplatin) in participants with colorectal cancer and liver metastases. Participants will receive combination therapy of bevacizumab 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous (IV) dose and mFOLFOX-6 every 2 weeks during Cycles 1-5 and Cycles 7-12. Participants will receive mFOLFOX-6 alone (without bevacizumab) on Cycle 6. In between Cycle 6 and 7, participants will undergo liver surgery if operable. Thereafter participants will receive bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) alone for 52 weeks (26 cycles) after the end of the post-operative phase (maintenance therapy). At the end of the preoperative treatment phase (Cycles 1-6), participants showing different alternative conditions admitted by the protocol will undergo different management (alternative study designs 1 to 3).</brief_summary>
