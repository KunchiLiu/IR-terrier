	<brief_summary>This comparative pilot study is designed to compare the rates of gastric emptying and by inference rates of digestion of challenge meals. Two types of meal will be compared, chocolate mousse style dessert and chocolate bars. The information from this study will then be compared to the elicitation times for both objective and subjective symptoms in the allergic patients who have been challenged in a different study using the same two meals.</brief_summary>
