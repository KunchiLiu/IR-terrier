	<brief_title>"Becoming Parents": A Hospital-community Partnership</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transition to parenthood is potentially a stressful life event for many new parents, which, if not properly managed, could have adverse effects on their mental health, marital satisfaction, and parent-child relationships. The proposed programme, "Becoming Parents", aims to turn the challenges of the transition into opportunities of learning and support for these parents. Building on our experience of instituting a pioneering programme to support new fathers prenatally, "Becoming Parents" has an extra component of support for new parents in the postnatal period using trained volunteers from the community networks. Through "Becoming Parents", seamless antenatal-postnatal care based on a hospital-community partnership will be provided to 125 expectant couples in a target community which is known for its high risks for postnatal depression, child abuse and intimate partner violence. In addition to addressing the health promotional needs of the target community, "Becoming Parents" will also illustrate how a community's capacity for health promotion can be maximized through the collaboration of healthcare providers and network of community partners in helping couples function more optimally during their transition to parenthood.</detailed_description>
