	<brief_title>Nuevo Amanecer: Promoting the Psychosocial Health of Latinas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention for newly diagnosed Latina breast cancer patients. In our prior work, the investigators established the appropriate content of the intervention, the need for early intervention, and the value of culturally competent peer support. In this study the investigators will adapt an evidence-based CBSM intervention designed to meet these needs. This study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a wait-listed usual care control group to adapt the intervention and test its effectiveness in improving breast cancer specific quality-of-life, and decreasing anxiety and breast cancer specific distress. The new, adapted intervention will be called "Nuevo Amanecer" (A New Dawn).</detailed_description>
