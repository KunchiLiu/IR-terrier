	<brief_summary>Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen derived peptide desensitising vaccine currently being developed for treatment of cat allergy. At present, the efficacy of immunotherapy (peptide or otherwise) can only be established at the conclusion of therapy. No reliable predictive biomarkers of clinical efficacy currently exist. Identification of surrogate biomarkers of clinical efficacy, would facilitate clinical development of peptide immunotherapy vaccines, in addition to providing an improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of efficacy, thus providing new leads for therapeutic intervention.</brief_summary>
