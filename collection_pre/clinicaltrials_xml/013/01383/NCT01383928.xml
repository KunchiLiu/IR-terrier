	<brief_summary>This will be a phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study using the oral formulation of IXAZOMIB administered twice weekly in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. Both phases of the study will include patients who have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and have not previously received systemic treatment. Both the phase 1 and the phase 2 portions of the study will include induction therapy consisting of 1 year of therapy followed by maintenance therapy that will continue until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance therapy will be IXAZOMIB alone on Days 1,4,8, &amp; 11 of a 21-day cycle.</brief_summary>
