	<criteria>Patients who were diagnosed with HRS type 1 according to the diagnostic criteria of HRS and whose serum creatinine value (SCr) doubled at 2.5 mg/dL or greater within 2 weeks or whose 24h creatinine clearance (Ccr) decreased by half at less than 20 mL/min. Patients should meet all the following 5 criteria: [Modified International Ascites Club's Diagnostic criteria of HRS] 1. Chronic or acute liver disease with advanced hepatic failure and portal hypertension. 2. Low glomerular filtration rate (SCr &gt;1.5 mg/dL or 24h Ccr &lt;40 mL/min) 3. Absence of shock, ongoing bacterial infection, current or recent (within 2 weeks) treatment with nephrotoxic drug 4. No sustained improvement in renal function (decrease in SCr to 1.5 mg/dL or less or increase in 24h Ccr to 40 mL/min or more) following diuretic withdrawal and expansion of plasma volume with 1,500 mL/24h of isotonic saline for 24 to 48h. 5. Protein urea &lt;500 mg/dL, and no ultrasonographic evidence of obstructive uropathy or parenchymal renal disease Age; 20 to 79 years Cr value ≥5 mg/dL ChildPugh Score ≥14 Fulminant hepatitis Septic shock Hepatocellular carcinoma that does not meet the Milan Criteria Acute renal failure caused by contrast medium Chronic renal failure Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50/min) Hyponatraemia (serum Na &lt;120 mEq/L) Ischemic heart diseases (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction), heart failure or clinically relevant arrhythmia Poorcontrolled hypertension Arteriosclerosis obliterans or peripheral vascular disorder Cerebrovascular disorder Respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Pregnant or possibly pregnant women and patients who or whose partner desire pregnancy during the study period Patients considered by the investigator or subinvestigator as unsuitable to participate in the study</criteria>
