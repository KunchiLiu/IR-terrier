	<brief_summary>This study is open to patients that have been diagnosed with non-squamous Stage III Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and will have surgery to remove the tumor. The purpose of this study is to: - Test a combination of two chemotherapeutic drugs along with radiation therapy, when given prior to surgery and see what effects (good or bad) it has on someone with this type of cancer. Chemotherapeutic drugs selectively destroy diseased cancer cells and tissues. - Test the safety of different dose levels of radiation when given with each combination of chemotherapy; - Determine what side effects are associated with combining radiation with these two chemotherapy combinations.</brief_summary>
