	<brief_summary>Premature infants with chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) are commonly treated with inhaled steroids, an optional treatment according to textbooks and guidelines . However, the evidence supporting this treatment in spontaneously breathing infants is limited, and based on only two randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) with relative small number of infants . The Cochrane review concluded that these studies do not allow firm conclusions with regard to the efficacy of inhaled steroids in non-ventilated infants . Thus, there is no doubt that there is a need for more RCT in order to ascertain the role of inhaled steroids in infants with BPD. Because of its physical properties that theoretically make QVAR an attractive therapy in infants and studies showing it to be as effective as and with similar safety profile as other inhaled steroids in children, the investigators hypothesized that inhaled QVAR will be an effective therapy in infants with BPD.</brief_summary>
