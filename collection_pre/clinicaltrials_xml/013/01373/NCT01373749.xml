	<brief_summary>Nitro Oxide (NO) inhalation was recognized as an effect treatment of Neonatal Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension (PPHN), while the safety of NO long term application was under investigation. Several research suggested too much NO2 was generated in the lung after long term (&gt; 72h) use of NO inhalation, which cause bad effects on PS production. Sildenafil was proved to be effective to PPHN as NO. This medication has a similar clinical effect but need monitoring of blood pressure. The possible hypotension effect restrict the dosage of sildenafil, which limit the usage of sildenafil in severe PPHN. But we recommend sildenafil to The purpose of the study was to establish if NO continued with sildenafil has the same effect as single NO inhalation.</brief_summary>
