	<brief_summary>Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) has been world-widely used in clinical practice in treating patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The efficacy and safety of Excel SES (JW Medical, Shandong, China, MA) with biodegradable polymer has been proved by several clinical trials. Here the investigators design a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical study in purpose of identifying the non-inferiority in the efficacy and safety in treating CAD patients by Firebird 2 SES (Microport, Shanghai) with durable polymer, comparing with Excel SES.</brief_summary>
