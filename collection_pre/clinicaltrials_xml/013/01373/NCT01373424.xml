	<brief_summary>Dystonia is a disorder characterized by excessive involuntary contraction of muscles with repetitive and patterned movements. The isolated dystonias are the most common type of dystonia and include Limb dystonias (like writer's cramp), Cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis), Laryngeal dystonias (like spasmodic dysphonia), and Craniofacial dystonias (like blepharospasm). The purpose of this study is to create resources to help learn more about the isolated dystonias, myoclonus dystonia, and dopa-responsive dystonia and to develop and validate various dystonia rating scales.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Dystonia Coalition Natural History and Biospecimen Repository for Isolated Dystonias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This collaborative, international effort has one primary goal. This is to create a biospecimen repository and associated clinical database to be used as a resource for dystonia and related disease research. Across sites, the investigators hope to enroll at least 5,000 adult patients. Subjects of this study will be asked to complete a neurological exam which will be video recorded, complete some questionnaires, and donate a blood sample. A study visit will take between 45 minutes and 1 hour. All subjects will be asked to return every 1, 2, 3, or 4 years for a one hour follow-up visit. People may participate in this study without agreeing to participate in the follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
