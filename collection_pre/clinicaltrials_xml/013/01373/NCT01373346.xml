	<brief_summary>We grafted the concept of metabolic surgery (long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction) into gastric cancer surgery. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction after gastrectomy in non-obese type II diabetes with gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Long Limb Roux-en Y Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type II diabetes in the world is increasing rapidly, and it is known that patients with type II diabetes with morbid obesity that underwent bariatric surgery have resolution of impaired glucose metabolism. In Asia, most type II diabetes are not morbidly obese and still, it is controversy whether metabolic surgery is effective or not in non-morbid obese patients. As life expectancy is increased, the number of patients with gastric cancer and T2DM is increased as well. Recently, we studied the outcome of T2DM after gastrectomy and conventional reconstruction in non-obese gastric cancer patients.(Kim JW et al, World J Gastroenterol 2012;18:49) The study was a large-series retrospective study including about 400 patients and the result regarding DM improvement was not satisfactory. Based on our previous results, it is needed to find more effective way to resolve the type II diabetes in gastrectomized patients with gastric cancer.</detailed_description>
