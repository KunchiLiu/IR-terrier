	<criteria>Subjects must have a clinical indication for 123IMIBG imaging to evaluate for the presence, extent, or status of neuroendocrine tumors; subjects must be able and willing to comply with study procedures. Subjects with history of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt; 3.0 mg/dL [265 Âµmol/L]) and inability to be withdrawn from medications known to interfere with 123IMIBG uptake; Subjects unable to tolerate lying supine; Subjects pregnant or breastfeeding, unless the information to be gained outweighs the possible hazardous effects of 123IMIBG administration. Where the assessment of the risk/benefit ration suggests the use of 123IMIBG in nursing mothers, the breastfeeding should be discontinued for at least 48 hours postinjection.</criteria>
