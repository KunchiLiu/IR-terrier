	<brief_summary>Dystonia is a disabling movement disorder characterized by repetitive patterned or sustained muscle contractions causing twisting or abnormal postures that may afflict 250,000 people in the U.S. While the pathophysiology of dystonia remains uncertain the treatment is rather rudimentary. A better understanding of neural mechanisms of dystonias is not only an invaluable prerequisite for developing better treatment options but also a step toward better understanding of the complex network of basal ganglia. In this study I will investigate if there is any difference between the dopamine receptors and dopamine in people with dystonia and healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
