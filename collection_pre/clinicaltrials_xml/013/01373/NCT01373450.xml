	<brief_summary>This was a four-period crossover study to assess the glycemic effects of a single dose of oxyntomodulin (OXM) on the glucose levels in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences consisting of 4 treatment periods, with a 7-day wash-out between each treatment period. The primary hypothesis was that during graded glucose infusion (GGI) oxyntomodulin (OXM) is neutral or better than placebo (Pbo) at lowering ambient plasma glucose levels, and at significantly enhancing insulin secretion.</brief_summary>
