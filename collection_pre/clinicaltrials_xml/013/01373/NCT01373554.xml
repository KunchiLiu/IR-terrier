	<brief_summary>Dithiolethiones, a novel class of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, prevent insulin resistance through AMPK-dependent p70 ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) inhibition. And it is well known that the modulation of S6K1 by oltipraz inhibited the development of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia through the AMPK-S6K1 pathway.Also some research reported that LXRg (a member of the nuclear hormone receptor)-mediated increases in SREBP-1c (the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c gene) promote the expression of lipogenic genes and enhance fatty acid synthesis and oltipraz inhibits LXRg and SREBP-c. Therefore, Oltipraz inhibits fatty acid synthesis through AMPK-S6K1 pathway and LXRg-SREBP-1c pathway in liver.</brief_summary>
