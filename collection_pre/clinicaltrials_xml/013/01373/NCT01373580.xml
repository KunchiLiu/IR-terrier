	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Evaluate a Corneal Inlay for the Improvement of Near Vision in Presbyopic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The loss of near vision and the ability to perform tasks that require near vision is part of the normal aging process. This natural transformation in the eye occurs as a result of the loss of accommodation of the crystalline lens, a condition known as presbyopia. Presbyopia, characterized by a progressive, age-related loss of accommodation (i.e., the lens ability to focus clearly over a wide range of distances), is most prevalent of all visual deficiencies, affecting 100% of the population over the course of a normal life span. Loss of accommodation begins early in life and, for an emmetropic eye, generally culminates in a complete loss of functional near vision. ReVision Optics has developed the Raindrop corneal inlay for the correction of near vision. The Raindrop is a 2mm corneal inlay, as small as a pinhead, thinner than a human hair and about 1/500th of a droplet of water. The inlay is the same refractive index as the human cornea. The inlay is placed in the non-dominant eye,centered over the pupil after a corneal flap (LASIK)has been made. The Raindrop is expected to provide presbyopic subjects with improvement of near and intermediate vision.</detailed_description>
