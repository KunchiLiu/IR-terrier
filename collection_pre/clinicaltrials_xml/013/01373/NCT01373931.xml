	<criteria>Are overtly healthy females, as determined by medical history and physical examination As it is possible that LY2216684 may cause the oral contraceptive (OC) tablet to be less effective than usual, subjects will be required in addition to use double barrier methods of contraception from the Screening until 2 months after the post study followup. Additional barrier methods of contraception may include the following: a nonhormonal intrauterine device with spermicide; female condom with spermicide; contraceptive sponge with spermicide; diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide; a male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom with spermicide; a sterile sexual partner; or abstinence (subjects reporting abstinence who become sexually active while on the study must agree to use other additional barrier methods of contraception).
