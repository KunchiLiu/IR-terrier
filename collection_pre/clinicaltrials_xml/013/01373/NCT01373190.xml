	<brief_summary>The specific aim is to determine if there are patterns of temperature differences in the abdominal and back regions of individuals with partial/focal onset epilepsy as compared to a non-epileptic control group. The hypothesis is that individuals with partial/focal onset epilepsy will have colder recorded temperatures in the abdominal area than individuals in a matched control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thermographic Examination of Skin Temperatures in Individuals With Focal Onset Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept of "Abdominal Epilepsy" has been described in the neurology literature. The present study seeks to amplify understanding of this clinical entity by measuring abdominal area and low back skin temperature changes which may be affected through the function of the abdominal ganglia, specifically the Celiac, Superior Mesenteric and Inferior Mesenteric Ganglia. This not an intervention study. It is study comparing abdominal area and low back skin temperature in individuals with the Partial/Focal Onset Epilepsy with a match control group of individuals with no epilepsy history. The implications of the outcome of the finding any significant temperature changes between the experimental and control groups is great enough to warrant the highest level of scientific scrutiny that this registration permits.</detailed_description>
