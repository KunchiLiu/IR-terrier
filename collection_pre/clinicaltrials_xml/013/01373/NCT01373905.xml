	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a severe lung disease caused by a variety of direct and indirect issues. It is characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma leading to impaired gas exchange and persistent hypoxemia. This condition is often fatal, usually requiring mechanical ventilation. Recruitment maneuver aimed to enhance the effect of mechanical ventilation.The objective of this study was to compare safety and efficacy of two lung recruitment maneuvers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stepwise Positive End Expiratory Pressure Elevation For Lung Recruitment in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), protective lung strategy and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) therapy should be started as early as possible to avoid lung damage by high pressures, volumes and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Recruitment is a strategy aiming at re-expanding the collapsed lung tissue and then maintaining an adequate level of PEEP to prevent subsequent de-recruitment. The objective of this study was to compare safety and efficacy of two lung recruitment maneuvers (RM): stepwise PEEP elevation with determination of the alveolar collapsing pressure versus sustained lung inflation in ARDS patients</detailed_description>
