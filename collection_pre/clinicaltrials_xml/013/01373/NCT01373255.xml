	<brief_summary>Placenta accreta is a relatively rare event, in which the placenta is abnormally implanted into the uterine myometrium. The most significant complication is intense bleeding, mainly during labor. The most important risk factors are previous cesarean delivery, placenta previa, and advanced maternal age. Cesarean hysterectomy is the recommended management. During the recent years, inserting intravascular balloon catheter for occlusion and/or arterial embolization, was introduced as an adjuvant therapy in order to minimize blood loss during cesarean hysterectomy or in conduct with conservative management with the intent of avoiding hysterectomy in selective cases. Contradicting reports exist regarding the effectiveness and safety of the catheters in cases of placenta accreta. The objective of this study is to estimate the efficacy of the balloon catheters among women diagnosed with a placenta accreta.</brief_summary>
