	<brief_summary>Drug-eluting stents effectively reduce restenosis but may increase late thrombosis and delayed restenosis. Persistent polymer could be responsible. Local delivery of paclitxel from a polymer-free Yinyi stent (Dalian Yinyi biomaterial research and development co.ltd) may prevent these complications.</brief_summary>
