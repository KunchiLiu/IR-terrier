	<brief_summary>Delayed ischemia caused by cerebral vasospasm remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A great deal of drugs has been tested in the last years. Phase II randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. Clinical, double blind, randomized controlled trials with placebo. Discussion: Even though some articles have shown that statins provide better prognosis, some issues remain in debate, e.g., treatment duration and the choice of the statin.</brief_summary>
