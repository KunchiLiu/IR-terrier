	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of Osseospeed™ TX 6 mm implants in a Chinese population by evaluation of marginal bone level alteration, implant stability and implant survival in the posterior mandible and maxilla up to 3 years after loading. The hypothesis is that one stage surgery using 6 mm OsseoSpeed™ TX implant in the posterior region is safe and predictable.</brief_summary>
