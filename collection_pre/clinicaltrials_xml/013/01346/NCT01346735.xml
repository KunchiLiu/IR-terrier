	<brief_summary>Most literature on ICU infections and the resistant patterns comes from the western literature. This data may not truly reflect the incidence, epidemiology and resistance patterns in developing countries such as India. However, empiric antibiotic therapy is generally initiated using western guidelines. This can potentially lead to inadequate, inappropriate and ineffective empiric antibiotic therapy for ICU infections in the Indian setting. Hence in this multi-center observational study, we seek to: 1. To determine the incidence of ICU-related infections (VAP, CAUTI and CRBSI) in India 2. To explore the microbiology, resistance and treatment patterns of these infections</brief_summary>
