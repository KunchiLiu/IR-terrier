	<brief_summary>Development of New-Onset Diabetes after Transplantation (NODAT) is common and serious complication after kidney transplantation. Patients who develop NODAT are at increased risk for loss of the transplanted organ and for diseases of the cardiovascular system. It is believed that in many patients the development of overt NODAT is preceded by a phase of impaired glucose tolerance that is called pre-diabetes. This study aims at improving glucose metabolism in patients after kidney transplantation who are in a pre-diabetic metabolic state. Patients who exhibit impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) after kidney transplantation are randomized to either receive vildagliptin (Galvus), pioglitazone(Actos) or placebo for three months. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with vildagliptin or pioglitazone leads to improved glycemic control compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
