	<brief_summary>This study aims to characterize clonal evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using different approaches and to identify a possible association with disease progression, i.e. therapy initiation. 1. Samples This monocentric study is carried out using representative bioarchived leukemic samples with a diagnosis of CLL, either at diagnosis or at evolution. These bioarchived samples were collected locally at our center during years of diagnostic activity, and were accurately pathologically, cytogenetically and molecularly characterized. 2. Clinical data The clinical data were retrospectively collected through collaboration with the referring physicians. 3. Methods Samples will be investigated by means of (1) conventional cytogenetics, (2) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and (3) SNP-arrays. After analysis of the array data sets, significant results will be validated and in addition, results will be correlated with clinical data.</brief_summary>
