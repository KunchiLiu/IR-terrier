	<brief_summary>The study was designed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of DTap-IPV with DAPTACEL® + IPOL® as the 5th dose booster in children ≥ 4 to &lt; 7 years of age in the US and Puerto Rico who were previously vaccinated with DAPTACEL® and/or Pentacel® vaccines only. Primary Objectives: - To compare the pertussis [Pertussis Toxoid (PT), Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA), Pertactin (PRN), and Fimbriae Types 2 and 3 (FIM)] booster responses and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) following DTap-IPV vaccination to those elicited following DAPTACEL® + IPOL® vaccination when administered as a 5th dose. - To compare the diphtheria and tetanus booster responses and GMCs (as measured by ELISA) following DTap-IPV vaccination with those elicited following DAPTACEL® + IPOL® vaccinations when administered as a 5th dose . - To compare the Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine booster responses (as measured by neutralizing assay) following DTap-IPV vaccination with those elicited following DAPTACEL® + IPOL® vaccinations. Observational Objectives: - To compare the polio (types 1, 2, and 3) geometric mean titers (GMTs) following DTap-IPV vaccination with those elicited following DAPTACEL® + IPOL® vaccinations. - To assess the safety of DTap-IPV vaccine or DAPTACEL® + IPOL® vaccine when administered as the fifth dose booster vaccine in participants previously vaccinated with DAPTACEL and/or Pentacel vaccines.</brief_summary>
