	<brief_title>Drug Interactions Between Silimarine and Darunavir/Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The silimarine is the main component of milk thistle (Sylibum marianum), a medicinal herb which, due to its attributed hepatoprotective properties, is widely used by HIV infected patients 15 patients on stable antiretroviral therapy including darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a day during four weeks will be enrolled. After their inclusion in the study, patients will receive treatment with silimarine (150 mg every 8 hours) from day 1 until two weeks later (day 14). On days 0 and 14, blood samples will be drawn immediately before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after the administration of darunavir/ritonavir, and darunavir and ritonavir concentrations in plasma will be determined by high performance liquid chromatography using a validated method.</detailed_description>
