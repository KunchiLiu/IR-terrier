	<brief_title>Prospective Study of Cionni Ring and In-the-bag IOL Implantation for Subluxated Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction of endocapsular stabilising devices have significantly improved the management of zonular weakness, allowing for in-the-bag IOL implantation. The Cionni modified capsule tension ring (M-CTR) has an anterior eyelet that provides for fixation of the capsular bag without violating its integrity. Adult and pediatric studies have shown the usefulness of the M-CTR to manage zonular weakness. However, there are very few prospective studies that show the outcomes following implantation of the M-CTR and in-the-bag IOL on a longterm basis. Therefore, the investigators decided to carry out this study to report the intraoperative performance and postoperative outcomes on a longterm basis following M-CTR and in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.</detailed_description>
