	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to detect if there are any differences in the coding region of SLC12A3 gene in individuals who have had hyponatremia associated to the use of thiazides, and those thiazides consumers without hyponatremia that have demonstrated good tolerance to the drug.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Case Control study to compare the coding region of SLC12A3 gene in individuals who have had hyponatremia associated to the use of thiazides, and those thiazides consumers without hyponatremia that have demonstrated good tolerance to the drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients older than 21 years, belonging to one of the following groups: 1. Patients who have had Thiazide induced hyponatremia with serum sodium lower than 125 meq/L included in the Institutional Registry of Hyponatremia (Cases) 2. Patients with good tolerance to chronic treatment with Thiazides tha never had associated hyponatremia (Controls) 2. Patients with normal serum sodium measurements before the start of the Thiazides 1. Refusal to participate or to the informed consent process 2. Unclear cause of hyponatremia, or other hyponatremia cause concomitant to Thiazide diuretics 3. Patients related to other individuals already included in the study</criteria>
