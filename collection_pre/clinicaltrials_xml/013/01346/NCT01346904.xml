	<brief_summary>Glaucomatous damage not only occurred to retinal ganglion cells in the eyes, but went across optic nerves, visual chiasm, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and finally the visual cortex; the neural degenerations could be identified through the whole visual tract, which suggests the central nerve system may play a vital role in the progression of glaucoma. The investigators used MRI to investigate changes of visual pathway in vivo.</brief_summary>
