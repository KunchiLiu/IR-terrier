	<brief_summary>Approximately 10-27% of patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries develop a catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in the post operatory period, as bladder catheterization is a common practice in gynecologic surgery. Cranberry products provide alternative means for preventing CAUTI and could result in decreased use of antimicrobials. In this pilot study we will enroll 200 women post gynecologic surgery and randomize them to take either cranberry powder capsules or placebo powder capsules. The low risk of harm associated with using cranberry to reduce UTI coupled with its potential benefit makes it a desirable intervention for the prevention of CAUTI. The conduct/ results of this pilot /feasibility study will prepare us for the conduct of a large scale clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cranberry products prevent bacteria that cause UTI, especially Escherichia coli, from adhering to bladder cell wall thus preventing infection. Adherence of type 1 pili is inhibited by the fructose and of p pili by the proanthocyanidins present in cranberry.</detailed_description>
