	<brief_title>Aesthetic Evaluation of Two Piece 3mm Implants for Single Tooth Replacement of Maxillary Laterals and Mandibular Incisors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this research study is to examine the aesthetics (the appearance of the implanted tooth and gums) as well as the soft tissue loss over a three-year period. This study involves replacing a missing small front tooth with a dental implant, abutment, and crown. A titanium dental implant acts as the replacement for a tooth root. An abutment is made of titanium which is either gold or silver in color and cannot be seen; but may affect the way the gum looks. An abutment is the component that attaches the crown to the implant post. A crown (which acts as the tooth replacement) is made of metal and/or porcelain and attaches over the abutment. The dental implant and the abutments used in this study have been approved by Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of replacing the small teeth in the front of the mouth. The abutment is made in two colors (either gold or silver) and you cannot choose. For each subject this is decided by chance. You will have an equal chance of getting a gold or silver-colored attachment. You will know which color the abutment will be once you have consented to be in the study and registered. You will know the color of the abutment before the implant is placed. The abutment is covered by the crown. You will be in this study for about three years. There will be approximately 60 subjects who will participate in this study in different centres, in Canada and the USA.</detailed_description>

A minimum of premolar occlusion is required. A minimum mesiodistal and buccallingual distance of 5mm is required Rampant caries or unstable periodontal disease of the remaining dentition. Any systemic or local disease or condition that may compromise postoperative healing. Longterm use of systemic corticosteroids or other medications that may compromise postoperative healing.
