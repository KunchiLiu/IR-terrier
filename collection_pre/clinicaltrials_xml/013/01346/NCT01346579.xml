	<brief_summary>This research trial studies phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation analysis in tissue samples from older patients with stage I breast cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with stage I breast cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Older Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: To assess the relapse free-survival difference between patients with PIK3CA mutated and wild-type (WT) tumors and therefore validate PIK3CA mutation status as an important biomarker in women 70 years or older diagnosed with breast cancer. OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via mutation analysis of PIK3CA.</detailed_description>
