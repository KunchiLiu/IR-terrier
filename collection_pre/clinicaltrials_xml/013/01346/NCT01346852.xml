	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the predictive ability of three asthma risk markers: the ratio of controller medication to total asthma medication, an albuterol only marker, and an oral corticosteroid use marker, as well as to compare the precision of these tools between adult and pediatric patient populations. This retrospective longitudinal analysis will use 2 different databases: a large managed care database and a large fee for service Medicaid database.</brief_summary>
