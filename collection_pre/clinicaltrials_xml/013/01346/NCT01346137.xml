	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators propose to evaluate a COX-2 inhibitor(meloxicam) to assess its effect on follicular development and find out if this regimen delays or blocks ovulation while maintaining ovarian cyclicity. The investigators intend to administer 15 mg or 30 mg of meloxicam per day for 18 days starting on day 5 after onset of menses during 3 continuous cycles. The 3 treatment cycles will be preceded and followed by control cycles with no treatment. Ovulation or lack there of will be monitored by transvaginal ultrasound examinations (TVUs), estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone levels in multiple blood samples in each cycle. The investigators will recruit a total of 56 women. Each woman will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 dose regimens of meloxicam, with 28 women assigned to each of the 2 dose regimens. Participating women will demonstrate an ovulatory cycle before starting meloxicam treatment and will be protected from pregnancy by prior sterilization.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In a recent study, following follicular development by daily ultrasound examinations in 22 women, meloxicam was administered when the dominant follicle reached a diameter of 18 mm (Jesam, Salvatierra et al. 2010). Results from this study indicate that meloxicam 30 mg given for five days in late follicular phase was more effective at delaying follicular rupture than 15 mg. Follicular rupture was delayed more than 48 hours in 11/22 (50%) volunteers in the group treated with 15 mg/day and in 20/22 (91%) volunteers in the group treated with 30 mg/day.</detailed_description>
