	<detailed_description>Prospective Evaluation of a RIsk Score for postoperative pulmonary COmPlications in Europe (PERISCOPE) is a multi-centre, international observational study of a random-sample cohort of patients undergoing a nonobstetric in-hospital surgical procedure under general or regional anaesthesia during a continued 7-day period of recruitment. Participating centres throughout Europe will contribute routine clinical data describing all eligible patients who undergo surgery during a continuous week (7-days) at convenience of every department within a period of two months from May 1st to July 1st 2011. A questionnaire of around 50 items will be filled during the pre, intra and postoperative periods. The follow-up will end at discharge. The aim of the PERISCOPE study is to validate a simple score to predict postoperative pulmonary complications(PPCs). This score has recently been published in Anesthesiology and you can access linking to: http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2010/12000/Prediction_of_Postoperative_Pulmonary.20.aspx TIMEFRAME Participants will be followed for the duration of in-hospital stay, an expected average of maximum 5 weeks.</detailed_description>
