	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Acupressure wristbands may prevent or reduce nausea and caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether standard care is more effective with or without acupressure wristbands in controlling acute and delayed nausea. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well acupressure wristbands work with or without standard care in controlling nausea in young patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupressure in Controlling Nausea in Young Patients Receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) in the acute phase provided by a 5-HT3 antagonist combined with acupressure versus placebo acupressure in children 4 to 18 years of age being treated with chemotherapy including cisplatin ≥ 50 mg/m2/dose, ifosfamide plus etoposide/doxorubicin, or cyclophosphamide plus an anthracycline. Secondary - To compare the control of CIN in the delayed phase provided by a 5-HT3 antagonist combined with acupressure versus placebo acupressure in children 4 to 18 years of age being treated with chemotherapy including cisplatin ≥ 50 mg/m2/dose, ifosfamide plus etoposide/doxorubicin, or cyclophosphamide plus an anthracycline. - To compare the control of chemotherapy-induced vomiting and retching (CIV) in the acute and delayed phases provided by a 5-HT3 antagonist combined with acupressure versus placebo acupressure in children 4 to 18 years of age being treated with chemotherapy including cisplatin ≥ 50 mg/m2/dose, ifosfamide plus etoposide/doxorubicin, or cyclophosphamide plus an anthracycline. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according chemotherapy regimen and anti-emetic Regimen 5-HT3 agonists (ondansetron or granisetron.) Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients wear Sea-Band acupressure wristbands on each wrist beginning approximately 30 minutes prior to the first cisplatin-containing chemotherapy course and continually for 24 hours after the last chemotherapy dose (acute phase), and for a maximum of 7 days or until the next chemotherapy course starts (delayed phase). Patients are allowed to take bands off intermittently (up to 4 times a day, for no more than 15 minutes each time) to relieve pressure or to bathe. Patients also receive standard of care anti-emetic prophylaxis comprising granisetron, ondansetron, or dexamethasone during chemotherapy according to institutional or physician preference. - Arm II: Patients wear placebo wristbands on each wrist and receive standard of care anti-emetic prophylaxis during chemotherapy as patients in arm I. Patients, parents, or guardians are instructed to complete an impatient and an outpatient diaries on nausea severity and the time of each emetic episode. Patients, parents, or guardians also complete a questionnaire about acupressure at the end of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 4 to 18 years of age, inclusive. The patient's cognitive ability must be considered by a parent or healthcare professional to be at least at a 4 yearold level. Newly diagnosed (i.e., not relapsed) with any malignancy. Patients are not required to be registered on a COG therapeutic trial. The patient's current chemotherapy treatment plan must include at least 1 course of cisplatin at ≥ 50 mg/m2/dose or ifosfamide plus etoposide or doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide plus an anthracycline. Patients may have previously received other chemotherapy. The patient's current treatment plan must include an antiemetic regimen with either ondansetron or granisetron on a scheduled basis. Patients may also receive dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis during the acute phase at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients ≥ 12 years old may also receive aprepitant in conjunction with dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients needing antiemetic treatment for breakthrough nausea/vomiting may also receive antiemetic agents on an as needed (PRN) basis. The patient (parent/guardian) must be Englishspeaking (i.e., able to read and speak in English) since the PeNAT has been validated only in English. All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent (patient assent is also recommended when applicable according to each institution's policy). EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Prior history of acupressure use. Scheduled use of antiemetic agents other than ondansetron, granisetron, dexamethasone or aprepitant. Patients may receive other antiemetic agents PRN for breakthrough nausea/vomiting but not on a scheduled basis</criteria>
