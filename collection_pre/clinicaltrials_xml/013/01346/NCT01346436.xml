	<brief_title>Value of Robotic Rectopexy for the Treatment of Complex Pelvic Floor Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic floor dysfunction is a common pathology. The management can be medical or surgical, depending on the location or the severity of the disease. Since the large use of laparoscopy for the treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction, interesting and encouraging results have been published. However, so far, a laparoscopic approach has some technical disadvantages like a poor ergonomy, a 2 dimensional vision, an unstable camera and the use of straight instruments. To overcome these natural limitations, robotics has been gaining increasing acceptance in general surgery. Several groups have reported their encouraging experience with robotic rectopexy. Yet, these studies were not randomized or double blinded. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of robotics for complex pelvic floor dysfunction and to compare the outcomes to the laparoscopic approach.</detailed_description>
