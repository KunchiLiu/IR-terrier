	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposal is to demonstrate that, in patients with disease of the pancreatic head with very high-risk of complications of pancreatojejunal reconstruction (soft pancreas and pancreatic duct diameter &lt;3 mm), total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (IAT) is associated with a lower morbidity (in terms of surgical or medical complications) and mortality compared with pancreaticoduodenectomy and pancreatojejunal anastomosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Islet Autotransplantation in Patients at Very High-risk Pancreatic Anastomosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complications of the pancreatic anastomosis still represents a significant risk for death after the resection of the pancreatic head. In an effort to decrease morbidity and mortality, the referral of patients who need a pancreaticoduodenectomy to institutions (and surgeons) performing a high volume of this surgical procedure has been championed. Nonetheless, the role of prophylactic medications and the best surgical technique(s) for the removal of the pancreatic head are still debated. However, very few prospective randomized clinical trials have been conducted to compare different surgical techniques. Our study will address for the first time the role for preemptive total pancreatectomy and IAT in selected patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy that are considered high risk for pancreaticojejunostomy disruption (eg, small pancreatic duct, soft pancreas). The information expected is the identification of total pancreatectomy and the IAT as the standard treatment in a subgroup of patient with pathologies of the pancreatic head at high risk for leakage of pancreatic anastomosis. Ultimately this project will lead to reserve more innovative cell therapy for patients with the highest risk of anastomosis failure reducing pancreatojejunal reconstruction related morbidity and mortality</detailed_description>
