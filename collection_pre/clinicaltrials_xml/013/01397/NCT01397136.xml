	<brief_summary>In the present project we propose to deeply characterize nuclear and/or mitochondrial DNA in embryo culture medium, in order to investigate whether both cell-free nucleic acid types may provide additional, reliable, predictive parameters for embryo viability and implantation potential.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>We will enroll in the study only embryos obtained from fresh gametes. It is to note that we currently transfer more than one embryo (with a maximum of 3, according to patient's age) and we will follow such criteria alongside the project. Consequently, we will take into consideration this aspect in correlating DNA parameters with embryo's outcome. We will exclude cryopreserved embryos, in order to avoid potential biases due to cooling/defrosting procedures.</criteria>
