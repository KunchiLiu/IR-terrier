	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm parallel group study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of each of three dose levels of ADS-5102 oral capsules, an extended release formulation of amantadine, dosed once daily for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The novel pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) higher amantadine plasma concentrations during daytime hours when dyskinesia as well as motor and non-motor symptoms of PD are most problematic, ii) low amantadine plasma concentrations overnight, which may reduce the sleep disturbances and vivid dreams occasionally associated with amantadine, and iii) a reduced initial rate of rise in plasma concentration, which is expected to improve overall tolerability of amantadine.</brief_summary>
