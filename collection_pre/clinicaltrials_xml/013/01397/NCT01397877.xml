	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the clinical efficacy of BKM120 as monotherapy in the treatment of initial or recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer after first line radio chemotherapy. Clinical efficacy will be determined by the non-progression rate at 3 or 2 months depending on the group of patients. The primary endpoint is the non-progression rate at 3 months (12 weeks) for the patient group whose disease is painless (low grade tumor = stratum 1) and the non-progression rate at 2 months (8 weeks) for the group of patients with an aggressive disease (high grade tumor = stratum 2). Disease progression is defined by the RECIST 1.1 criteria</brief_summary>
