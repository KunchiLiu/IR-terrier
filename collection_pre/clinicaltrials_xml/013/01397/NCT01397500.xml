	<brief_summary>Growth hormone and gonadotropin deficiency after brain injury (traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, subarachnoidal hemorrhage): the effects of hormone replacement on cognition, quality of life and body composition Randomized, controlled, 3 arm (group 2: double-blind; groups 1 and 3: open), multi-center, pilot study (Phase II)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Treatment in Growth Hormone and Testosterone Deficient Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of growth-hormone replacement on cognition, quality of life, body mass index, body composition and reorganization of brain activity of hypopituitary patients in a stable, chronic phase after brain injury compared to control patients and the influence of testosterone replacement in gonadotropin deficient patients compared to placebo treated control patients.</detailed_description>
