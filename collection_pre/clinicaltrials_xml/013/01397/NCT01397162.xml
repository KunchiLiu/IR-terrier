	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess and compare efficacy and safety of BI 54903 at 3 doses twice daily (b.i.d.) and fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler (HFA MDI) at a dose of 88 mcg b.i.d and placebo b.i.d. over an 8-week treatment period in asthmatic patients aged 12 to 65 years inadequately controlled on short-acting-beta-agonist (SABA) prn therapy only as demonstrated by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) range10 to 25% and an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-6) equal or greater than 1.5 at time of randomization</brief_summary>

The initial diagnosis of asthma must have been made before the age of 40 years 4 All patients must be on a maintenance treatment with either lowdose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus longactingbeta agonist (LABA) or mediumdose ICS without LABA, stable for at least six weeks prior to Visit 1 5 All patients must have a prebronchodilator FEV1 of not less than 60 to 90% of predicted normal and an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ6) mean score of less than 1.5 at the prescreening Visit 1 6 All patients must have an improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) not less than 12 % above baseline and an absolute change of at least 200 mL within 1530 min after administration of 400 mcg salbutamol/albuterol hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler (HFA MDI) 7 Patients must be neversmokers or exsmokers with a smoking history of less than 10 packyears and smoking cessation at least one year prior to screening 9 Patients must be able to use Respimat® inhaler and metered dose inhaler (MDI) correctly 10 Patients must be able to perform all trialrelated procedures including technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and electronic peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements, and must be able to maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with significant pulmonary disease other than asthma or other significant medical conditions (as determined by medical history, examination and clinical investigations at screening) 2. Patients with a clinically relevant, abnormal screening haematology and/or blood chemistry finding 3. Patients with a history of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (URTI/LRTI) in the past four weeks prior to the prescreening Visit 1, and during prescreening and runin periods 4. Patients with any exacerbation of their underlying asthma during the eight weeks prior to the prescreening Visit 1 5. Patients with active allergic rhinitis requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids 6. Any of the following criteria are met during the prescreening / runin period (Visits 1 6):in clinic prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 %) predicted less than 40%; more than 12 puffs rescue salbutamol/albuterol HFA MDI per day for &gt; 2 consecutive days;exacerbation of asthma 7. Patients with a history of pneumonectomy or who are planning to undergo thoracotomy for any reason 8. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior to the first screening visit 1 9. Patients with two or more hospitalizations for asthma within the previous 12 months 10. Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction during the last twelve months or known coronary heart disease that requires treatment 11. Patients with a history of hospitalisation due to heart failure in the past twelve months 12. Patients with myocarditis or any unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or a change in drug therapy within the past year 13. Patients with significant alcohol or drug abuse in the opinion of the investigator within the past two years 14.

Patients suffering from narrow angle glaucoma with a history of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and/or cataracts 16. Pregnant or nursing women 17. Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control 18. Patients who have been treated with antiImmunoglobinEantibodies (e.g. omalizumab, Xolair®) or other immune system modulating antibodies such as tumor necrosis factoralpha blockers within six months prior to Visit 1 19. Patients who have been treated with the following drugs during the past four weeks prior to Visit 1 or are foreseen to need this during the study:Nonselective betablockers (topical cardioselective betablocker eye medications for nonnarrow angle glaucoma are allowed; Oral or other systemic corticosteroids; Oral betaagonists; Changes in allergen desensitisation therapy in last 6 months; Immune system modulating agents such as methotrexate or cyclosporine; Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 such as antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole), antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin) or antiretroviral drugs; Patients who have been treated with leukotriene modifiers, chromones or theophylline within two weeks prior to Visit 1; Patients who have been treated with tiotropium within 3 weeks prior to Visit 1</criteria>
