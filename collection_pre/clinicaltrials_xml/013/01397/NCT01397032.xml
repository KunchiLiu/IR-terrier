	<brief_summary>Children with social anxiety will be randomly assigned to either Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) designed to direct attention away from threat or a placebo control condition not designed to change attention patterns. Outcome measures will be depression and social anxiety symptoms as measured by gold standard questionnaires as well as diagnosis of social phobia disorder and symptom counts derived from structured clinical interviews with children and their parents. We expect to see significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms in the Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) group relative to the placebo control group.</brief_summary>
