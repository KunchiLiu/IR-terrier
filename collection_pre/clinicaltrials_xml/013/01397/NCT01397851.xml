	<detailed_description>The study evaluates whether the sourcing of insecticide-treated nets and their distribution to smallholder farmers for free would be a profitable investment for a cotton outgrowing agribusiness in Zambia. The study therefore carries out a major net distribution through the existing distribution channels of a cotton outgrowing agribusiness, evaluates the impact of this distribution on smallholder cotton yields, and values the profitability implications for the outgrowing agribusiness.</detailed_description>
