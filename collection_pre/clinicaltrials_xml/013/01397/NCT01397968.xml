Subject has had greater than 2 allergic reactions to an AED or one serious hypersensitivity reaction to an AED. 4. Subjects taking felbamate with less than 18 months continuous exposure. 5. Subjects receiving phenytoin, phenobarbitone or metabolites of these drugs. 6. No active suicidal plan/intent or active suicidal thoughts in the past 6 months. 7. History of suicide attempt in the last 2 years; not more than 1 lifetime suicide attempt. 8. Subject meets criteria for current major depressive episode (within 6 months). 9.
