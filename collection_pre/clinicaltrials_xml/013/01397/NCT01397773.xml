	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to measure Pentraxin-3 levels in patients on hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and those in the pre-dialysis period; and to compare these groups with the control group; so as to investigate the eligibility of it as a reliable marker of inflammation; relationship with other inflammatory markers and carotis intima media thickness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pentraxin-3 in Chronic Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators planned to involve four group of patients: Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, pre-dialysis and the control group; with about 25 patients planned to be involved in each group. The laboratory parameters to be measured are Pentraxin-3, C-reactive protein (CRP), high sensitive CRP, fibrinogen and interleukin-6. Concomitantly, carotis intima media thickness will be measured in the radiology clinic. Statistical analysis will be carried on by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 13.0. The variables acting on the inflammatory parameters and the correlation between them and carotis intima media thickness will be studied.</detailed_description>
