	<brief_summary>The additional effect of inspiratory muscle training as an adjunct to a general exercise training program in patients with COPD with inspiratory muscle weakness will be studied. The main hypothesis is that inspiratory muscle training combined with an exercise training program improves functional exercise capacity more than an exercise training program without the addition of an inspiratory muscle training program.</brief_summary>
