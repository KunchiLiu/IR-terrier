The first 75 patients who consent will be enrolled in the study, the randomized clinical trial of pregabalin in early-onset fibromyalgia. After a study subject has been enrolled, they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. All subjects will be randomized, 1:1 either to the pregabalin group (group A) or the placebo group (group B).
