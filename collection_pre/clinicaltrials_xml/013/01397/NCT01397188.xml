	<brief_summary>PiCCO has become a widely used haemodynamic monitoring device in the management of shock patients in ICU patients nowadays. But the effects on outcome of use of Picco, such as hospital mortality, vasoactive agents-free days, intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilation-free days and change of lactate and BNP in shock patients has not been determined. Patients will be randomly assigned to a Picco group or the control group, hospital mortality, vasoactive agents-free days, intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilation-free days and change of lactate and BNP will be observed. The conclusion will supply evidence for the clinical effectiveness of Picco in shock patients.</brief_summary>
