	<brief_title>Psoriasis and Climate Therapy- Effect of Motivational Follow- up Calls on Clinical and Health Economic Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A chronic condition such as psoriasis requires a high level of self- management and requires for many patients behaviour change to improve health outcome. Changing behaviour is a challenge that requires a commitment by the patient to implement successfully. Motivational interviewing is a patient centered directive counseling technique that focuses on assisting patients to identify their problems and involves exploring ambivalence in an empathic manner. It is a well-known method of counseling, and is considered to be a useful intervention strategy in the treatment of lifestyle problems. This study is a randomized controlled trial using telephone motivational interviewing. The counseling intervention comprises 6 telephone calls during a 12 week period, after attending 3 weeks of supervised climate therapy on the Canary Islands</detailed_description>
