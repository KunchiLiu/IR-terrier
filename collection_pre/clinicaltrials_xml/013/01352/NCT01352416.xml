	<brief_title>Suppression Of Atrial Fibrillation With Ranolazine After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center, double blind, prospective, randomized study for patients who are scheduled for elective cardiac surgery (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft [CABG], or valve or CABG and valve). All patients who meet criteria will be prospectively enrolled in a randomized fashion. Patients enrolled will be assigned to receive twice daily identical capsules containing either placebo or ranolazine. Study drug will be initiated 2 days before surgery. Patients will receive study drug throughout their hospitalization and be kept on it for a full 2 weeks post operatively. Patients will be seen in 2 weeks and receive a 30 day follow up contact visit.</detailed_description>
