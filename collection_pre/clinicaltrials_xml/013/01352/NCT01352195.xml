	<brief_title>Extended Self-Help for Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a randomized 3-arm design, with 660 smokers recruited into each condition. The three conditions will include: (1) Usual care (UC), which will comprise a single smoking cessation booklet developed by NCI; (2) Standard Repeated Mailings (Stand-RM), which will be the same 8 Forever Free booklets (edited for cessation) distributed over 12 months as in our preliminary studies; and (3) Intensive Repeated Mailings (Inten-RM), which will add two additional booklets to extend the intervention out to 18 months, plus additional monthly contacts. Assessments will occur at six-month intervals, through 30 months. An overview of the design is depicted in Table 4, which will be referenced throughout the remainder of this proposal.</detailed_description>
