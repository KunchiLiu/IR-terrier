	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to assess whether wound closure with skin adhesive or running stitches combined with skin adhesive will be superior to standard wound sutures. This is a split-wound study that will compare two methods of skin closure within one standard closure technique, thereby providing an internal control of running stitches within each wound. The investigators plan to measure outcomes by assessing for scar appearance, the incidence of wound opening, scar elasticity and subject satisfaction.</brief_summary>
