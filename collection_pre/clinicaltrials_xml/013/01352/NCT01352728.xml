Disease must not be amenable to potentially curative surgery 3. Without prior systemic nor transarterial treatment 4. Prior surgery or local therapy is allowed but the target lesion must have not been previously treated 5. ChildPugh stage A liver function 6. ECOG performance 02 7. Life expectancy longer than 12 weeks 8. At least one measurable treatment lesion according to modified RECIST criteria 9. Adequate haematological, hepatic and renal function 1. Contraindications to TACE treatment: Main portal vein thrombosis or occlusion Evidence of biliary obstruction Presence of extrahepatic disease 2. Diffusetype HCC 3. Major surgery &lt;4 weeks or radiation therapy &lt;2 weeks of starting the study treatment. 4. Any form of prior transarterial therapy or systemic therapy for HCC. 5.
