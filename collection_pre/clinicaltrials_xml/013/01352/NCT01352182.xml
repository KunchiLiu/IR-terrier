	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Study of Pioglitazone in Adolescents With Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among adults and children. Few clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefit in sepsis. Severe sepsis is a systemic inflammatory syndrome in response to infection that is associated with acute organ dysfunction. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) is involved in the regulation of the sepsis-induced inflammatory response. The central hypothesis is that pioglitazone reduces the inflammatory responses in children with severe sepsis and septic shock.</detailed_description>
