	<brief_summary>Investigating effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral based teacher training under routine care conditions by comparison of a baseline-interval with no special intervention to a following interval of PEP for the kindergarten teachers only each focussing on one child (3-6 years old) that the teacher herself indicated as "needing special attention for externalising behaviour". Effects on child symptoms and teachers behavior and burden within intervention-period are expected to be stronger than those during waiting-period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of the Teacher Module of the Prevention Program for Externalizing Problem Behaviour in Preschoolers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Findings of the PEP-efficacy-study based on a randomised controlled sampling ((ISRCTN CCT-NAPN-18918) using combined training-modules for parents and teachers showed positive effects on children's behaviour in the intervention-group. These effects in teacher's view were stronger than in the control-group but could not be proved to be statistically significant. Moreover after this first step of evaluation there remain unanswered questions concerning the stability of effects after transferring the program in routine care. Therefore the study is continued by an effectiveness-study.</detailed_description>
