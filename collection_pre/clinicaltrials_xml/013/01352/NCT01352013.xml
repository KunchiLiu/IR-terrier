A diagnosis of FM according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria(Wolfe et al., 1990) Negative urine pregnancy test at enrolment and willingness not to become pregnant for the duration of the study. Pain levels of at least 4 on 10cm VAS at the time of recruitment. Ability to communicate in English or in French. Willing to sign an informed consent. If the patient is taking medication or natural health product (excluding omega3 containing products) to treat fibromyalgia, she must be on a stable regimen for a minimum of two weeks before recruitment and be willing to keep this stable medication or natural health product regimen throughout the study period. If the patient is using other therapies to treat fibromyalgia such as TENS, acupuncture, exercise, psychotherapy, massage, physiotherapy, etc, she must be doing so for a minimum of two weeks before recruitment and be willing to continue those therapies throughout the study period. Use of anticoagulants (Coumadin® or Plavix®), having a bleeding disorder or being scheduled for a surgical procedure. This is because omega3 fatty acids can prolong bleeding time, although doses we propose to use are safe (see Risks section) Allergy to fish, olive oil, medium chain triglycerides, lemon, green tea, vitamin E or tylenol Past (within the last year) or present specific dietary supplementation with omega3 fish oil or other natural health products containing omega3 fatty acids (e.g. flax seed oil, krill oil, etc) or regularly eating more than two fatty fish meals/week (salmon, mackerel, sardine, flounder, herring, or any other fish considered to have a high level of omega3 fatty acids).
