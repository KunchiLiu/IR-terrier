	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether alteration of signal transduction components after antidepressant targeting, predict antidepressant responsiveness in advance before the appearance of the drug effects until 4~6 weeks after drug administration, or represent the clinical status of depressed patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether antidepressants effect on signal transduction in peripheral lymphocyte and to determine whether the signaling differences between drug responders and nonresponders predict the antidepressant response or represent the clinical status of depressed patients.</detailed_description>
