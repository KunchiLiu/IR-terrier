	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this proposal is that combining plerixafor, an inhibitor of stromal cell derived factor - 1α (SDF-1α), with decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, as induction and postremission therapy for older patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) will improve treatment outcomes via mobilization of leukemia stem cells and alteration of the pharmacodynamics of decitabine. The protocol will establish the safety and feasibility of combining two different doses of plerixafor with a fixed dose and schedule of decitabine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Unequivocal pathologic diagnosis of AML (≥ 20% blasts in the bone marrow based on WHO criteria) excluding: i) acute promyelocytic leukemia t(15;17)(q22;q12); PMLRARA; ii)acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1RUNXT1; iii) acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16)(p13.1;q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFBMYH11. AML patients with an antecedent hematologic disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)are eligible for treatment on this trial provided that they have not received prior treatment with decitabine or prior cytotoxic treatment for AML. AML patients with therapyrelated myeloid neoplasms (tMN) are eligible if they have not received chemotherapy (not including hormonal therapy) for their primary malignancy or disorder for &gt;6 months. Age ≥ 60 years. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Prior treatment with decitabine Prior treatment with plerixafor Ongoing treatment for another malignancy. Patients with goodrisk molecular or cytogenetics features Patient has a medical condition or illness considered by the investigator to constitute an unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment. Patient has a psychiatric disorder or altered mental status that would preclude understanding of the informed consent process and/or completion of the necessary studies. Patient has an inability or unwillingness, in the opinion of the investigator, to comply with the protocol requirements.</criteria>
