	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to validate Near-Infrared (NIRS) monitoring in patients undergoing circulatory arrest. This study will compare two-wavelength NIRS INVOS System, Somanetics; Troy, MI) with four-wavelength NIRS (Nonin Medical, Inc; Plymouth, MN) to determine which modality best correlates with jugular venous oxygen saturation</brief_summary>
