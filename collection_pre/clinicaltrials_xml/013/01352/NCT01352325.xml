	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of system constellations in a monocentric, single-masked randomized controlled trial. The method of system constellations refers to an approach which integrates ideas from family systems therapy with elements from psychodrama. The constellations are conducted in a group based seminar-setting, each seminar lasting three days. Based on the model of a general psychotherapy and the consistency theory, the effects of system constellations on psychological functioning are explored. It is predicted that participation in a system constellation seminar changes the level of psychological functioning at 4 months.</brief_summary>
