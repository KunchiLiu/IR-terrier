	<brief_summary>Assessing the precise MIC for the Ceftriaxone using E-test. To determine what proportion of susceptibility reports will be reclassified based on the new CLSI guidelines.Antibiotic susceptibility reports of blood cultures, urine cultures,aseptic body fluid cultures growing Enterobacteriaceae organism generated by the Phoenix machine will be obtained on a daily basis.MIC for Ceftriaxone will be noted.If the MIC is &lt;=2 for Ceftriaxone,those cultures would be used to run an additional test - E- test.E-test gives us more precise MIC values compared to Phoenix machine.We will analyze the data collected over 2 months. We will determine the proportion of susceptibility reports reclassified based on the new CLSI guidelines.</brief_summary>
