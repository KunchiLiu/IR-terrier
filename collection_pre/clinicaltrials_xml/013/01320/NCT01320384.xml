	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare, in patients with acute respiratory failure/acute lung injury the efficacy of three different methods of oxygenation to prevent endotracheal intubation : 1. conventional oxygen therapy (O2 conventional) 2. high flow nasal oxygen therapy (O2-HFN) 3. association of high flow nasal oxygen therapy with non invasive positive pressure ventilation (O2-HFN/NPPV).</brief_summary>
