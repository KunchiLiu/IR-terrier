	<brief_summary>Compound HP802-247 comprises two topical sprays, administered sequentially right after another; these deliver a suspension of fibroblasts and keratinocytes to the wound surface. HP802-247 is the subject of a larger Phase 2 multi-center trial for treating venous leg ulcers. The present study will enroll up to five patients who are suffering venous leg ulcers, have failed a prolonged course of standard wound therapy and one or more advanced technologies, but who would not qualify for the Phase 2 study.</brief_summary>
