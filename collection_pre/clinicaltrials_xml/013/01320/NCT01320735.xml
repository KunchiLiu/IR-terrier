	<brief_title>Observational Program to Assess Use of Intermittent Adjuvant Deprivation Therapy With Leuprorelin (Lucrin Depot) in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer (PCa) in Russia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants started hormone treatment with Leuprorelin 3.75 mg once every 28 days, subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM). Duration of induction therapy was at least 6 months (6-9 months) during which PSA and testosterone levels were measured every 3 months. When PSA decreased by greater than 90% from baseline (PSA less than 10 ng/ml) or became lower than 4.0 ng/ml (for 2 consecutive measurements made at least 2 weeks apart) the participants were included into intermittent hormone therapy regimen group (IAD). Participants with PSA decrease not achieved greater than 90% or less than or equal to 4.0 ng/ml were given either continuous hormone therapy (CAD) or chemotherapy. Therapy was stopped if participants had PSA decrease greater than 90% from baseline or values less than 4.0 ng/ml after 6-9 months of continuous hormone therapy. PSA and testosterone were measured every 4 weeks. If PSA became greater than or equal to 10.0 ng/ml, hormone therapy was resumed until PSA was less than 4.0 ng/ml for 2 consecutive measurements made at least 2 weeks apart. Duration of hormonal therapy cycle was at least 3 months. Then intermittent treatment was performed according to a similar scheme. PSA and testosterone levels were determined every 12 weeks when hormone therapy was administered and every 4 weeks after it was stopped. The treatment was carried out for 2 years or until Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC) developed.</detailed_description>
