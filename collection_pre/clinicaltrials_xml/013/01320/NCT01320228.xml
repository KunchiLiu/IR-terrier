Secondly, effect on food intake, anthropometry, Quality of Life and cardiovascular risk markers will be evaluated. The trial is designed as a randomised 2 x 2 factorial 13-weeks parallel intervention, in which 72 obese participants will be randomised to supplementation with flaxseed fibres and/or dairy calcium concentrate (Capolac) in addition to treatment with Alli ®: 1. Alli® (60 mg t.i.d) plus placebo (rice flour) 2. Alli® plus 5 g flaxseed fibers 3. Alli® plus 1200 mg Ca from Capolac 4. Alli® plus 5 g flaxseed fibers and 1200 mg Ca from Capolac</brief_summary>
