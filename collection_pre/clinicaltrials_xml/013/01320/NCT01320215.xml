	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare 30-day complication rates associated with promontofixation for pelvic organ prolapse performed via a robot-assisted laparoscopic technique versus a non-robot-assisted laparoscopic technique. Secondary objectives include comparing technical data, anatomical correction, prolapse recurrence, incontinence, quality of life and medico-economic data between the two techniques.</brief_summary>
