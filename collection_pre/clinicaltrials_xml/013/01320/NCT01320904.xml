	<detailed_description>Abstract: Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative and debilitating change that affects the synovial joints. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) combined with closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises in patients with knee OA. Methods: Nineteen patients with knee OA were enrolled and randomized into two groups: group I was treated with CKC + NMES, and group II was treated with CKC + NMES placebo. Both groups underwent 20 sessions of mini-squat exercises at 30 degrees of knee flexion that were associated with and interspersed with NMES for 5 minutes at a frequency of 40 hertz (Hz), 10 minutes at 70 Hz and an addition 10 minutes at 150 Hz, for a total of 25 minutes. The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 17.0. Data were expressed as a frequency, mean and standard deviation and were statistically analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test. The investigators also used an unpaired Student's t-test and Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests with a level of significance of P &lt; 0.05.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients with grade I or grade II knee OA (based on the KellgrenLawrence classification; which was diagnosed by a medical traumatologist; radiographic changes that demonstrated a reduced joint space in at least one of the compartments of the knee; subchondral bone sclerosis; consent to participate in the study patients who had grade III and grade IV knee OA (based on the KellgrenLawrence classification); who were involved in another rehabilitation program outside the center; who presented with clinical symptoms that would prevent them from participating in the exercises; who had heart disease; cardiac pacemakers; periarticular metal implants; who experienced changes in sensitivity; who had a previous history of knee injury (meniscus, ligaments, sprains); who had uncontrolled diabetes; neurological disorders with cognitive impairments; rheumatic diseases; history of knee trauma in the last six months; prior knee surgery; three consecutive unexcused absences.</criteria>
