	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that: (1) gait stability will be increased when wearing an ankle-foot orthosis (plastic brace supporting the foot and ankle); (2) an attention demanding task will decrease gait stability and (3) the improvement in gait stability due to ankle-foot orthosis use will be greater during an attention demanding task.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of an Ankle-Foot Orthosis on Gait While Performing an Attention Demanding Task</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A quasi-experimental, randomized 2 x 2 factorial within subjects study with the factor of walking condition (2 levels, walking with and without ankle-foot orthotic device) and attention condition (2 levels, walking with and without attention task).</detailed_description>
