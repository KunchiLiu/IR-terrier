	<brief_summary>This is a clinical study involving patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances ('train-track braces'). A new type of train-track has recently been marketed. Over 4 million patients worldwide are wearing on of these appliances; this system is considerably more expensive than a normal train-track. However, there is little evidence to support its use. The effects of three different types of train-track will be assessed with respect to the quality of Orthodontic tooth movement produced. Furthermore, the impact of the different train-tracks on daily life of orthodontic patients will also be measured. Consequently, the investigators will be able to inform orthodontists' decisions relating to the choice of train-track they recommend for their patients. In addition, should the more expensive appliances demonstrate objective or subjective advantage, a significant efficiency saving may develop.</brief_summary>
