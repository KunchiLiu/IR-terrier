	<brief_title>Study in Allergic Adults to Support the Development of Immunological Assays</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a clinical study in which there is no vaccine administered. It is designed for research purposes such as developing immunological assays.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects (except the condition studied in the ALLERGY group). A male or female between, and including 18 and 45 years of age at the time of study start. Subject presenting moderate to severe clinical symptoms of allergy within the week before enrolment (only for ALLERGY group). Subjects suffering from seasonal allergy to birch pollen previously documented by a medical history (only for ALLERGY group). A positive skin prick test response realised and/or a positive test for specific IgE against birch within the last 5 years (only for ALLERGY group). Any known or clinical signs of anaemia or any condition that would preclude the drawing of blood as described in the protocol. Receipt of blood products 120 days prior to study visit. Receipt of immunoglobulin 120 days prior to study visit. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days preceding the study visit. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at the time of the study visit, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history. Any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Administration of systemic or inhaled antiinflammatory medications and, in particular, inhaled corticoidsteroids and cromoglycates within 30 days preceding the study visit. Purely local medications such as intranasal steroids or systemic symptomatic medications such as antihistamines and beta agonists are allowed. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the study visit. Pregnant or lactating female. Any past or current birchspecific immunotherapy (only for ALLERGY group). Any allergic disease as established by medical history before study start (only for CONTROL group).
