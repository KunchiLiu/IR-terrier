	<brief_summary>In this study the effect of piroxicam on the ovulation will be evaluated. Therefore piroxicam will be administered as a single-dose after onset of LH surge (luteinizing hormone, hormone which triggers ovulation). Additionally blood levels of endogenous hormones (hormones produced by your body) will be measured and transvaginal ultrasound examinations will be conducted at regular intervals. In addition the concentration of piroxicam in blood will be determined in regular intervals. With regards to the tolerability of the study drug subjects will be asked regularly how they feel.</brief_summary>
