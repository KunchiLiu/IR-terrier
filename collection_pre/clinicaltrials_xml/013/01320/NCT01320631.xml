	<brief_summary>The correction of the pelvic organ protrusion is aimed at restoring the pelvic floor functional status and ultimately improving the patient's quality of life. There are a few studies that have explored the effect of pelvic reconstructive surgery on female sexual function (1,2) but no studies have evaluated the male partner's sexual experience. The investigators intend to use a newly psychometrically validated questionnaire to capture this aspect. The sexual experience questionnaire (SEX-Q) is the first questionnaire to solely and exclusively combine functional and quality of life concepts (erection, individual satisfaction, and couple satisfaction domains) in a brief questionnaire, which allows a more focused and less burdensome evaluation of the sexual experience in men (3). Another issue is the density of the mesh material and if it can be felt vaginally even if it is not eroded and to what degree this might bother the male partner during intercourse.</brief_summary>
