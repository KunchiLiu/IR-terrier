	<brief_summary>Severe psoriasis has been demonstrated to be associated with decreased endothelial function and an increase risk of future coronary events. Although systemic therapy with immunomodulatory agents has been shown to improve psoriatic symptoms, its effects on systemic inflammation and endothelial function are unknown. In this study we want to assess the cardiovascular risks factors, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory markers before and after treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis with an FDA-approved biologic agent, adalimumab (Humira).</brief_summary>
