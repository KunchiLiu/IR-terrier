	<brief_title>A Trial in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Evaluating the Effects of Fenofibrate Versus Placebo on Macular Thickness and Volume</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is the commonest cause of adult onset blindness. Vision loss, which is irreversible, is a most feared complication of diabetes. A blood fat lowering drug called fenofibrate, available in Australia, has been shown to reduce eye damage in people with Type 2 diabetes by 35-40%, and to prevent eye damage in Type 1 diabetic animal models. This study will evaluate the potential benefits of oral Fenofibrate 145mg once daily for 12 months in 300 adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are at high risk of eye damage.</detailed_description>
