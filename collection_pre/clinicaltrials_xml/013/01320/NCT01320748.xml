	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether drug-dependent adults who participate in a dual processing relapse prevention treatment protocol that allows for sensory-based exposure experiences over 10-weeks in outpatient treatment will show significant brain change related to diminished cue reactivity, and greater improvement in self-efficacy, anxiety, somatization, and treatment retention, as compared to the standard care patients in a relapse prevention program.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The substance abuse literature consistently shows that negative emotional states and subjective stress are highly predictive of relapse and significantly influence behavioral motivation. From a neurobiological perspective, stress associated with withdrawal and substance abuse experiences stimulates chemical and hormonal changes in the brain creating a protracted hyperaroused state. Further, cognitive control resources (i.e., cognitive coping skills/relapse prevention training) have been shown to exert minimal impact on behavioral decision-making in the presence of intense affective material. Thus, implicit cognitive processes play a significant role in drug use behavior, decreasing self regulation capacities and increasing risk of. Specifically, high levels of stress can compromise prefrontal cortex functioning, with the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala functional changes related to increased cue reactivity. Taken together, the current literature strongly suggests that verbally-based therapies may have limited utility as a singular form of treatment in early substance abuse recovery, as the brain may not be functionally ready for executive level processing. Instead, the multidisciplinary substance abuse literature suggests that psychosocial treatment methods need to include a range of learning approaches that allow for visual-sensory processing, in addition to traditional verbal-based processing. Integrated multi-modal interventions are needed to offer opportunities for activation of these different brain regions to facilitate cognitive-affective balance in behavioral decision-making.</detailed_description>
