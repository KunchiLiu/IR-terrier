	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two parenting programs in reducing the ADHD symptoms and behavioral problems of preschool children with ADHD through a controlled study. One program is a home-based parent training intervention that is designed to enhance the parent-child interaction, constructive parenting skills, and the child's tolerance for delay. The other intervention is a clinic-based parent training program that focuses on reducing noncompliance in preschool children and improving parenting skills. Both programs consist of private weekly parenting sessions with Clinical Psychologists - once a week for 8 weeks. The sessions are 1-1.5 hours in length. Both programs use behavior modification as a means of improving oppositional and non-compliant child behavior. Both interventions also involve procedures that focus on improving children's attention. Neither program involves medication, and all families will receive one of the two parenting programs being evaluated. Study evaluations, as well as participation in the parenting programs, are provided at no cost to families. Evaluation and parenting sessions can be scheduled at times convenient to families.</brief_summary>
