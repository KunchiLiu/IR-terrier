	<brief_summary>This 5-year study addresses the unmet needs of adolescents with social phobia through the testing of a 12-week cognitive-behavioral, school-based group intervention delivered by trained school counselors compared to a nonspecific school counseling program. A secondary goal is to provide further examination of the efficacy of the CBT program delivered by school counselors as compared to the same program delivered by psychologists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder Delivered by School Counselors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have tested SASS, a school-based group CBT intervention for social phobia, and found it to be effective when delivered by psychologists (Masia Warner et al., 2005; Masia Warner et al., 2007). The proposed dissemination study extends this work through a controlled trial of SASS delivered by school counselors. The investigators will randomize 126 adolescents with social anxiety disorder, ages 14 through 17, to one of 3 treatments: 1) SASS delivered by school counselors (SC-SASS), 2) SASS delivered by psychologists (Expert-SASS), or 3) a manualized adolescent group counseling program specifically designed for school counselors, called Skills for Living (SFL). A comprehensive evaluation will include diagnosis, illness severity, scale ratings of social anxiety and depression, clinical global improvement, overall functioning, and school-relevant indices of function. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, mid-point (after 6 weeks of intervention), post-treatment, and 6 months following intervention completion.</detailed_description>
