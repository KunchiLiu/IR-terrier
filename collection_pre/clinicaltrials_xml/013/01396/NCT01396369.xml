	<brief_summary>PCOS is a disorder which is characterized by hyperandrogenism (high serum male hormone levels), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries (multiple follicles-over 12- in the ovary). There is no universally accepted definition for PCOS. The Rotterdam criteria require 2 of 3 criteria for diagnosis, including hyperandrogenism (clinical hirsutism or serum hormone measurement), oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, and ultrasound findings of polycystic ovaries. This study is a prospective randomized pilot study designed to evaluate the effects of flaxseed supplementation (with Brevail) on hormonal and lipid metabolism balance in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.</brief_summary>
