	<brief_title>A Novel Prosocial Online Support Group for Distressed Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychological distress is a significant problem among breast cancer survivors. Many survivors turn to the internet for information and support, yet few controlled studies have examined the effectiveness and safety of online support groups. The investigators are testing the potential efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of an innovative theory-based online support group (OSG) for breast cancer survivors. Members of the control group will participate in a standard OSG that encourages self-expression. Members of the experimental condition will participate in a prosocial OSG that provides structured helping opportunities and coaching on how best to give support to others. Participants will complete two telephone interviews and six weekly online support group meetings.</detailed_description>
