	<brief_summary>This study of 402 cases of stable angina subjects who were diagnosed as Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a randomized, blank controlled, multi-center clinical study. Subjects who are taking standard treatment with stable symptoms will receive a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) (Holter) examination. They will be randomly divided into two groups. The nicorandil group will receive nicorandil 5 milligram (mg) (3 times a day = tid) on top of the standard treatment for 12 weeks, while the control group will stay on standard treatment. Nitrates and beta blockers need to be maintained on a stable dose. Other drugs that do not affect the primary endpoint may be adjusted per investigators decision.</brief_summary>
