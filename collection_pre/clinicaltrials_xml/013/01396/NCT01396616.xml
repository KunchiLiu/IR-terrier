	<detailed_description>Among available methods for treating astigmatism in cataract surgery, the implantation of toric IOLs is an emerging technology that shows promising results. Similar to implanting a one-piece acrylic lens, toric IOLs provide good distance vision and, in many patients, freedom from spectacles for distance vision. A low absolute residual refractive cylinder has been associated with the implantation of toric IOLs, and the safety profile for toric IOLs has been good. As improvements with regard to rotational stability and treatment and cylinder power range are made, toric IOLs will emerge as an effective, safe treatment option for correcting astigmatism during cataract surgery. Further, to evidence on the safety and efficacy of TORIC IOL for patients having cataract associated with astigmatism served as the basis for us to identify the published literature on the safety and efficacy of TORIC IOL implantation in the treatment of cataract associated with astigmatism, thus provide a background for the development of clinical investigation plan for the present study.</detailed_description>
