	<brief_title>PREPARE: "Prediabetes Research and Education Promoting Activity &amp; Responsible Eating"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This community-based, healthy lifestyle project targets middle (30-59) and older (60+) adults with prediabetes - a population known to be at high risk for Type 2 diabetes development. This project aims to create, deliver and evaluate a six month interdisciplinary education and lifestyle improvement intervention that emphasizes goal-setting and self-management approaches to inform, engage, monitor and support adults with prediabetes in making positive lifestyle changes within the London (Ontario, Canada) community. Participants are encouraged to reflect on their current lifestyle, resources and barriers, increase skills, motivation, and awareness of community resources, and make positive lifestyle changes. Based on a solid partnership between both community - health service providers and Brescia University College, the Prediabetes Initiative aims at empowering individuals with prediabetes through self-management approaches to reduce behaviours known to contribute to Type 2 diabetes development.</detailed_description>
