	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between cardiovascular function of persons with post stroke conditions and their performance in three field tests. This is a validation study, aiming to determine during which of two activities VO2 measurements better express the functional restrictions caused by stroke, And to find out whether the Total Heart Beat Index can be used in the case of stroke survivors for the prediction of mechanical efficiency when measured during stair-climbing and of energy cost during treadmill walking. The hypothesis is that Stair Climbing (STC) is a more suitable form of exercise capacity testing compared to Treadmill Walk (TMW) since it potentially requires a greater amount of external work, and therefore will show stronger correlation with functional tests demonstrating the same ability, whereas TMW does not utilize the movement capability of participants to the fullest. Another hypothesis is that cardiac response to the exertion can be used as a predictor of those measures during these exertions in the post stroke population.</brief_summary>
