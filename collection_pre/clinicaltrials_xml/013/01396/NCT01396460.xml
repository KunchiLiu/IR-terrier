	<brief_summary>Through the values of respiratory quotient (RQ) it is possible to estimate the utilization of energy substrates by the body, or if there is a higher or lower fat oxidation. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGBP) there is a decrease in the values of RQ, which may be associated with increased lipid oxidation in the postoperative period. Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT) is an important part of Total Energy Expenditure. We would like to know how it functions among RYGBP patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the RQ and DIT of patients in the post operative phase and compare the result with a control group consisting of morbid obese population.</brief_summary>
