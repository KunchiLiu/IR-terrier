	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicentre, prospective phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HER2 positive adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab in Combination With Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin(XELOX) in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer(AGC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be administered 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy, unless withdrawn earlier due to unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or consent withdrawal. Patients will continue to be treated with trastuzumab alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal after finishing a maximum 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
