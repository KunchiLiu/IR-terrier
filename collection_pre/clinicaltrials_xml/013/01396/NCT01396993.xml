	<brief_summary>Breast conserving therapy (BCT) is the standard treatment for intraductal or invasive breast cancer patients. However cosmetic results, e.g. symmetry and nipple displacement, are sometimes poor reducing the quality of life. The use of immediate techniques for oncoplastic surgery (iTOP) seems to improve subjective cosmetic outcome. Oncologic safety of iTOP has been demonstrated by several authors using restrospective analyses. However, no prospective observational trial has been done to objectively evaluate cosmetic and oncologic outcome comparing BCT with iTOP. The aim of this study is to investigate this issue within a prospective non randomized observational trial at the Medical University Vienna.</brief_summary>
