	<brief_title>Nutritional Status and Prognosis in Heart Failure.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor, numerous studies have identified a better prognosis in overweight and obese heart failure (HF) patients. This paradox has been named "the obesity paradox". However, this paradox has been criticized because the parameter used to classify obesity, the body mass index (BMI), has several limitations. Obesity is defined as an abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, and BMI does not always reflect real body fat. What is more, patients with HF can have their body composition altered with hyperhydration or undernourishment. A pilot study proved that BMI does not indicate true nutritional status in HF. Thus, a further assessment of body composition of HF patients, analyzing the nutritional status rather BMI, could shed light on the obesity paradox. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status of a cohort of HF patients, its correspondence with BMI, and its significance in terms of survival.</detailed_description>
