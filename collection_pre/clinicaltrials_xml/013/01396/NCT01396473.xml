	<brief_title>Study on Out of School Nutrition and Physical Activity Environments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly half of Boston's school age children (49%) participate in out of school time programs, a critical time to intervene on physical activity and nutrition. Previous research has mostly focused on during-school-day efforts, or on child care policies and practices for very young children, leaving a gap in the knowledge of what might work with programs serving school-age children during out of school time. OSNAP aims to implement low cost and sustainable policy and environmental interventions to improve physical activity and healthy eating/beverage environments. Data will be collected via observations, plate waste and accelerometers on program policies, environments, practices and behavioral outcomes related to physical activity, beverage, snack and screen time outcomes.</detailed_description>
