	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Raltegravir+TDF+3TC in HBV/HIV Co-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are in total more than 72939 HIV infected people reported in Yunnan, the largest number for any province in China. About 800 HIV inpatients are admitted to our hospital every year, amongst them about 10% co-infected with HBV. HIV and HBV co-infection patients must receive two drugs active against both HIV and HBV, for example Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)+ lamivudine (3TC) or TDF+FTC. TDF and 3TC are nucleotide analogues that can inhibit both HIV and HBV DNA polymerases (Dore, Cooper et al. 2004). Combination therapy could decrease drug resistance. In China, TDF is a second-line drug of the national free ART program; however FTC is not in the list of free drugs. There is likely higher risk of causing drug resistance in treating HBV or HIV infection with 3TC or TDF monotherapy than combination therapy. Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, and does not significantly inhibit human phosphoryl transferases including DNA polymerases α, β, and γ, and may have less adverse effects. In chronic HBV infection, HBV-DNA does integrate into human DNA which results in difficulty eradicating HBV from the patient's body. In this pilot study, the investigators would examine the safety and efficacy of integrase inhibitor-Raltegravir in the control of HIV/HBV co-infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent HIV1 infection, documented in patient medical record. Acceptable forms of documentation include positive HIV antibody or detectable HIV RNA HIV1 antiretroviral therapy naïve Chronic HBV infection, defined as HBsAg positive &gt;6 months. Both HBeAg positive and negative subjects will be eligible Detectable HBV DNA ( &gt; 300 copies/ml) Serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) of ≤ 50 ng/ml within 4 weeks of study entry, or if elevated &gt; 50 ng/ml, an imaging study demonstrating no evidence of hepatic tumor within 4 weeks of enrollment Allergy or sensitivity to study drug Pregnancy, breastfeeding or unwillingness/inability to adhere to contraceptive methods for the duration of the study (Female study volunteers must not participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant). If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study volunteer must use the following forms of contraception while receiving studyspecific medication(s) and for 30 days after stopping the medication. One of the following methods MUST be used appropriately: (1)Condoms* (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (2)Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; (3)IUD; (4)Hormonalbased method.Condoms are recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV transmission. Prisoners or subjects who are incarcerated Receipt of the following drugs with antiHBV activity within 90 days prior to study entry or anticipated receipt during the course of the study including: ADV, telbivudine, alpha interferon, and other investigational agents with antiHBV activity Active opportunistic infection Other causes of chronic liver disease identified (autoimmune hepatitis, haemochromatosis, Wilsons disease, alfa1antitrypsin deficiency) Concurrent malignancy requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy Decompensated or Child's C cirrhosis Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with compliance or outcome of the study</criteria>
