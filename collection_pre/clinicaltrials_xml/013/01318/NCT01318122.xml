	<brief_title>Long-term Safety Study of Alogliptin Used in Combination With Thiazolidine in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, participants in the present study were enrolled from a core phase 2/3 thiazolidine add on study (SYR-322/CCT-004; NCT01318070).</detailed_description>
