	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Alogliptin Used in Combination With Sulfonylurea in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes in Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The present study was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin as an add-on to sulfonylurea in type 2 diabetic patients who had uncontrolled blood glucose despite treatment with an sulfonylurea as well as diet and exercise therapies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Had been taking a sulfonylurea for at least 4 weeks prior to the initiation of the observation period (Week 12). 2. Had been taking glimepiride at a stable dose regimen (1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day, once or twice daily in the morning or in the morning and evening, before or after meal) for at least 12 weeks prior to the initiation of the treatment period (Week 0). 3. Had glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.0% or more and below 10.0% at 8 weeks after the initiation of the observation period (Week 4). 4. Had an HbA1c difference between 4 weeks after the initiation of the observation period (Week 8) and 8 weeks after the initiation of the observation period (Week 4) being within 10.0%* of the value at 4 weeks after the initiation of the observation period (Week 8) (*rounded off to the first decimal place). 5. Was receiving specific diet and exercise (if any) therapies during the observation period. 1. Had taken other diabetic medications than glimepiride within 12 weeks before the initiation of the treatment period (Week 0).</criteria>
