	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. This was a phase 2/3, multicenter, open-label study, in participants who had completed the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea add-on study (SYR-322/CCT-005; NCT01318083) or the core phase 2/3 metformin add-on study (SYR-322/CCT-006; NCT01318109) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alogliptin administered as an add-on to a sulfonylurea (glimepiride) or metformin continuously for 40 weeks (52 weeks from the start of study treatment with alogliptin in the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea add-on study or the core phase 2/3 metformin add-on study).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Common criteria that applied to participants completing both the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea addon study and those completing the core phase 2/3 metformin addon study: 1. Had completed the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea addon study or the core phase 2/3 metformin addon study. 2. Was capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 3. Signed a written informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedure. Common criteria that applied to participants completing both the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea addon study and those completing the core phase 2/3 metformin addon study: 1. With clinical manifestation of hepatic impairment (eg, an aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase value of 2.5 times or more of the upper reference limit at Week 8 of the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea addon study or the core phase 2/3 metformin addon study). 2. With clinical manifestation of renal impairment (eg, a creatinine value of 1.5 times or more of the upper reference limit at Week 8 of the core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea addon study or the core phase 2/3 metformin addon study). 3. With serious cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disorder, or serious pancreatic or hematological disease (eg, a subject who requires hospital admission). Criteria that applied only to participants completing the core phase 2/3 metformin addon study: 1. With history or symptoms of lactic acidosis.</criteria>
