	<detailed_description>Allogeneic MSCs being used in current human clinical trials are nonclonal, i.e., such MSCs may have other types of cells in the final stem cell product. Some concerns exist about the heterogeneity of these nonclonal MSCs that are isolated and expanded by the conventional density-gradient centrifugation method. Recently, we developed a new protocol, called the subfractionation culturing method (SCM), to generate single-cell-derived clonal MSC (cMSC) lines from whole bone marrow aspirate without employing any centrifugation step for mononuclear cells and enzyme treatment process. This method allowed us to rapidly establish single-cell-derived human clonal MSC (hcMSC) lines from raw bone marrow aspirates and to establish a library of these hcMSC lines (Song et al., 2008). The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of allogeneic cMSCs established by the SCM and manufactured in GMP facility. This phase I clinical trial is a multicenter, single dose study of cMSC (1 x 10e6 cMSCs/Kg recipient's bodyweight). Clonal MSCs will be infused to acute or chronic GVHD patients via an intravenous injection. Every patients will receive the same treatment</detailed_description>
