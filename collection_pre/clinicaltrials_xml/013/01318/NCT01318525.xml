	<brief_summary>Acute liver failure is a rare but dramatic disease, often affecting young people, marked by the sudden loss of liver function in a person without preexisting liver disease. ALF-5755 has been shown to promote cell survival after apoptotic or oxidative stress, and liver cell regeneration in primary cultures and in vivo. ALF-5755 may become, in this dramatic disease with high unmet medical need, a future therapy for the treatment of patients suffering from severe acute hepatitis (SAH) and acute liver failure (ALF) not due to acetaminophen overdose, where liver transplantation is the sole treatment in the absence of spontaneous recovery. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ALF-5755 versus placebo. A minimum of 60 patients will be recruited into the study in the following two treatment groups: - Group A: approximately 30 patients will receive ALF-5755 - Group B: approximately 30 patients will receive placebo (physiological saline solution: 0.9% NaCl) Patients will receive 10 mg (25 ml) of ALF5755 or placebo every 12 hours over 3 days in slow intravenous infusions over 10 minutes using automatic syringes.</brief_summary>
