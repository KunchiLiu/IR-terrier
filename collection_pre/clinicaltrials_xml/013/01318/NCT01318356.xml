	<brief_title>The Qure Study: Q-fever Fatigue Syndrome - Response to Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Q fever fatigue syndrome (QFS) is one of the most frequent sequelae of Q fever, and constitutes a significant problem in the current outbreak of Q fever. QFS leads to substantial morbidity and has a high socio-economic burden, related to increased use of healthcare facilities and absence from work. It is envisaged that over 750 patients will become chronically fatigued due to Q fever in The Netherlands (20% of 4000 patients from 2007 until now). Although the outbreak appears to diminish, it is expected that Q fever will remain an endemic disease, and therefore this number will continue to grow. A vast medical consumption can be anticipated, stressing the need for an accessible and effective intervention and clear treatment guidelines. The study will contribute to a better understanding of effective treatment of QFS, providing evidence-based guidelines for general practitioners and medical specialists.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females who are 18 years or older Laboratoryproven acute Q fever since the year 2007 and/or positive serology fitting a past infection with Coxiella burnetii; AND being severely fatigued, defined by scoring 35 or higher on the subscale fatigue severity of the CIS; AND being fatigued for at least 6 months; AND disabled because of the fatigue, defined by scoring 450 or higher on the SIP Subjects must sign a written informed consent form. Fulfilling criteria for chronic Q fever, namely: IFA IgG fase I ≥ 1024, ≥ 3 months after acute Q fever and/or Positive Coxiella burnetii PCR on serum or tissue, 1 month after acute Q fever Acute Q fever in the setting of a prosthetic cardiac valve or aneurysm surgery or stenting necessitating prophylactic use of doxycycline; Pregnancy or unwillingness to use effective contraceptives during the entire study period; Imminent death; Inability to give informed consent; Allergy or intolerance to doxycycline; Somatic or psychiatric illness that could explain the chronic fatigue; Subjects who are currently enrolled on other investigational drug trials or receiving investigational agents; Receiving antibiotics for more than 4 weeks, potentially active against Coxiella burnetii, for any other reason since Qfever diagnosis; Subjects who are receiving and cannot discontinue barbiturates, phenytoin, or carbamazepine (these drugs may increase the metabolism of doxycycline and therefore reducing halflife of doxycycline); Moderate or severe liver disease (AF, ALAT, ASAT &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal). Current engagement in a legal procedure concerning financial benefits (only current involvement interferes with the effectivity of cognitive behavioral therapy. Once the appeal procedure ends, subjects can be included)</criteria>
