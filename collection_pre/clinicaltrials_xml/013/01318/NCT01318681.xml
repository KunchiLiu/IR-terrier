	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effects of Allergic Rhinitis (AR) on driving ability and memory functions. Our group has previously shown that patients suffering from AR symptoms perform less well on tasks requiring sustained attention compared to non symptomatic controls. Car driving is a typical behavior that is susceptible for changes in sustained attention and might therefore become worse under conditions when patients suffer from AR symptoms. We will compare the driving performance of untreated, symptomatic AR patients with the performance of symptomatic patients that have been treated with either a systemic AR medication (a pill) or a topical medication (nasal spray)</brief_summary>
