	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, multicenter, parallel-group study to evaluate the analgesic activity of ATx08-001, a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulator (SPPARM), in subjects with moderate-to-severe postherpetic neuralgia pain. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo or Atx08-001. Study drug will be administered orally twice a day for 7 days. Subjects will be evaluated for neuropathic pain intensity at regular intervals over a 6 hour period on Day 1 following the first dose of study drug. They will then be discharged from the clinic and will complete diary assessments of pain severity twice a day at home. Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic on Day 8 to complete their last set of pain evaluations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Analgesic Activity of ATx08-001 in Subjects With Postherpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aestus has identified a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulator (SPPARM), with promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain. PPARs are nuclear receptors that control many cellular and metabolic processes and are readily modulated by a variety of different drugs. Drugs modulating this target have been shown to improve blood glucose levels and levels of blood lipids, and may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of ATx08-001 at doses of 2.5 mg bid and 7.5 mg bid compared to placebo for the control of moderate-to-severe postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain. The secondary objectives are: - To determine the approximate time to onset of analgesia following administration of study drug - To determine the approximate duration of analgesia following study drug administration - To determine the percentage of treatment responders among subjects receiving ATx08-001 Subjects will be given a diary and instructed to record their postherpetic neuralgia pain severity on a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS - 12) "over the past 12 hours" on a 0 - 10 scale with "0" being no pain and "10" being the most severe pain the subject could imagine, each morning and night for three consecutive days prior to returning for the Treatment Visit. The Treatment Visit will consist of an in-clinic 6-hour observation period. To be eligible for dosing, immediately before dosing subjects must report a baseline score of 4 or greater on the following Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS-NOW) question: "How would you rate your pain RIGHT NOW using a zero to ten scale, where zero equals no pain and ten is the worst pain you can imagine." Qualified subjects will be administered study drug followed by a 6-hour observation in-clinic period. In addition to the Baseline pain intensity assessment conducted just prior to drug administration (Time 0), pain intensity scores (pain right now) will be assessed using the NPRS-NOW at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours following study drug administration. Pain relief compared with Baseline will be assessed at those same time points using a 5-point numerical pain relief (NPR) scale, where 0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, and 4 = complete relief. Subjects will be discharged from the clinic at the end of the 6-hour observation period and will be instructed to record postherpetic neuralgia pain severity (NPRS-NOW scores) and pain relief (PAR scores) at 8, 10 and 12 hours following dosing in a diary.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Is able to provide written informed consent prior to study entry Is male or female, 18 85 years of age Has a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia that has been present for at least 3 months since the resolution of the skin rash (shingles), and has been associated with at least moderate pain Has a body mass index (BMI) between 17 and 36, inclusive Has on average postherpetic neuralgia pain severity of at least "4" on the 11point NPRS12 scale over three days prior to the Treatment Visit. At the Treatment Visit, entry into the study for dosing will require a baseline score of 4 or greater on the following 'Numerical Pain Rating Scale' (NPRSNOW): "How would you rate your pain RIGHT NOW using a zero to ten scale, where zero equals no pain and ten is the worst pain you can imagine." If the subject fails to qualify for the Treatment Visit because of a baseline pain score below 4, he or she may return on any day within a fourteen day period to attempt to qualify again. A subject will be allowed a maximum of two reassessments to qualify on the basis of the NPRSNOW scale. Female subjects must be of non childbearing potential (defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile [bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy]) or must be using adequate contraception (practicing one of the following methods of birth control): Total abstinence from sexual intercourse (minimum of one complete menstrual cycle before study entry), A partner who is physically unable to impregnate the subject (e.g., vasectomized) Contraceptives (oral, parenteral, or transdermal) for 3 consecutive months prior to study drug administration, Intrauterine device (IUD), or Double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream) If female of childbearing potential, subject must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening Able to communicate meaningfully with the study observer and staff No known allergies to study medication Has another source of moderatetosevere pain apart from the postherpetic neuralgia that might be confused with the PHN pain Is actively abusing alcohol or drugs Is unable to refrain from alcohol for a period beginning 24 hours prior to the treatment visit until the end of the study Is scheduled to undergo any surgical procedures during the period of study duration Has a history of any active serious medical conditions including cancer (with the exception of benign uterine dysplasia or removed skin carcinomas), cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, hematologic, neurologic or psychiatric disease that would contraindicate study participation Has moderate to severe (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3 or 4) heart failure defined as heart failure which significantly limits physical activity by provoking fatigue, palpitations or dyspnea.

A fixed scheduled regimen of another type of analgesic, e.g., nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or an adjuvant analgesic will be allowed as long as the dose and schedule of administration were not changed for at least 2 weeks prior to dosing.
