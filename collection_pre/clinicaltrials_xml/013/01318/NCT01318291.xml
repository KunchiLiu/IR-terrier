	<brief_summary>The most common reason why insured In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) patients drop out of treatment is the distress caused by the treatment. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a combined Cognitive Coping and Relaxation Intervention (CCRI) in reducing drop out behavior in IVF patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Psychological Intervention on Drop-out Rates in IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention participants will be given a packet containing the CCRI, which consists of two intervention components tailored to the Stimulation Phase and Waiting Phases of IVF. The cognitive component of the CCRI is the PRCI intervention (Boivin &amp; Lancastle, 2008) tailored to the stimulation/waiting phases of an IVF cycle. The PRCI intervention consists of a series of ten statements that facilitate the use of cognitive reappraisal coping, a form of coping that helps people think more about the positive aspects of a difficult situation and dwell less on problems or uncertainties of the future. The relaxation components of the CCRI consists of techniques that have been used for two decades in the mind/body infertility program as well as in randomized controlled research trials. For the Stimulation phase, participants will receive instructions on how to do "mini relaxation" techniques which are specifically designed to reduce anxiety in the moment, for example feelings of tension, worry, and nervousness that might occur prior to and during Stimulation phase procedures (e.g. injections, blood tests, and ultrasounds). For the Waiting Phase the relaxation intervention will include a relaxation CD. The CD contains narrated instruction on how to elicit the relaxation response through several techniques This is a randomized, controlled prospective study conducted at a private academically-affiliated infertility clinic and includes women ages 44 and below scheduled to undergo their first IVF cycle. Subjects are randomized to a CCRI or a control group. The primary outcome measure is dropout rates.</detailed_description>
