	<brief_summary>This study will assess the residual neuromuscular blockade (NMB) Train-Of-Four (TOF) ratios at tracheal extubation when anesthesiologists have determined that full recovery of neuromuscular function has occurred using standard clinical criteria for participants whose non-depolarizing-induced NMB is either not reversed or reversed with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor administered as per standard routine care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an observational cohort study with a device intervention to determine in which cohort the subject is falling.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participant must be American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class 13. Participant must be scheduled for elective open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery that is anticipated to last less than 4 hours. Administration of general anesthesia and ≥ 1 dose of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers for endotracheal intubation or maintenance of neuromuscular blockade. Extubation must occur in the operating room (OR). Surgery readmission on the same hospital admission. Preestablished need for or expected to require postoperative mechanical ventilation. Conditions, surgical procedures or position that may interfere with the TOFWatch SX® operation, calibration or accuracy. Administration of sugammadex (Bridion®) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Participation in any other clinical trial. Member or a family member of the personnel of the investigational or Sponsor staff directly involved with this trial. Anesthesiologist use of objective neuromuscular monitoring during surgery (e.g. mechanomyography, electromyography or related method).</criteria>
