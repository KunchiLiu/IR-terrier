	<brief_summary>The main research hypothesis for this study is that, among patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have responded inadequately to treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs, the degree of improvement, as measured by the change from baseline of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)will be significantly greater among patients treated with EB-1010 (at the dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) than among those treated with placebo using the sequential parallel comparison design. The secondary research hypothesis for this study is that, among patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs, the degree of improvement in depressive symptoms, as assessed by the MGH Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (MGH CPFQ) will be significantly greater among those treated with EB-1010 (50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) than those treated with the SSRI paroxetine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must be able to give informed consent, (as required by IRB/IEC), prior to the initiation of any protocol required procedures. Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the prescribed dosage regimens, report for regularly scheduled office visits, and communicate to study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medication use. Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode as defined by DSMIVTR criteria, based on the SCIDCT29; their major depressive episode must be deemed "valid" using the SAFER criteria interview24 administered by remote, independent raters. Patients who have reported a history for the current depressive episode of an inadequate response to 1 and no more than 1 adequate SSRI or SNRI treatment. An inadequate response is defined as less than a 50% reduction in depressive symptom severity, as assessed by the MGH ATRQ administered by remote, independent raters. An adequate trial is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 8 weeks duration at least at the minimum dose as specified in the MGH ATRQ. Patients must have a 17item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) (whose score is derived from the HAMD28)20 score ≥ 18 during the screening phase to qualify for inclusion. The HAMD28 will be administered by the study clinicians at the screening and baseline visits, and by remote, independent raters during the screening phase at the time of the SAFER interview. Patients must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 1840. Patients must be able to be reliably rated on the psychiatric scales required by the protocol based on Investigator's judgment. Patients must be able to understand and read English. Placebo nonresponders are defined as those patients who failed to achieve at least a 50% decrease in their MADRS score at visit 8 (Week 6), AND have a MADRS score of = or &gt; 16 at visit 8 (Week 6) Men and women, ages 18 to 65 inclusive. Meet DSMIVTR criteria (by Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIVTR SCIDCT) for MDD, current. Treated with one of the allowed SSRIs or SNRIs at adequate doses (defined as 20mg/day or more of citalopram; 10 mg/day or more of escitalopram, 50mg/day or more of sertraline; 125 mg/day or more of venlafaxine; 60 mg/day or more of duloxetine) during the current episode for at least 8 weeks, with the same, adequate dose over the last 4 weeks. Between the screen and baseline visits, patients must be documented to have less than a 25% reduction in QIDSSR score. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. Adequate methods are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, an IUD, doublebarrier contraception, sexual abstinence. Form of birth control will be documented at screening and baseline. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ³ 12 consecutive months); or women on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of investigational product. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period [and for up to 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method that does not meet established and acceptable medical standards. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to investigational product administration. Sexually active fertile men not using effective birth control if their partners are WOCBP. Patients who do not report any prior inadequate response (equal or greater than 50% decrease in depressive symptom severity) or report an inadequate response (less than 50% decrease in depressive symptom severity) to more than 1 prior adequate trials of antidepressant treatments during the current depressive episode (including monotherapy treatment and distinct combination regimens) at a therapeutic dose (as defined by the MGH ATRQ)2223 and for an adequate duration (minimum 6 weeks for any monotherapy).
