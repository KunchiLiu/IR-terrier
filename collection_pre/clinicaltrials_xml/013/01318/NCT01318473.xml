	<brief_title>The Use of the ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System in Patients Undergoing CT-Guided With Lesions Smaller Than 15 mm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects who are scheduled for clinically indicated percutaneous chest aspiration/biopsy procedures will be screened for inclusion in the study. Within an 18-day screening period, eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study and undergo percutaneous chest aspiration or percutaneous biopsy utilizing the ActiSight™ Needle Guidance system using CT to guide the needle. Subjects will be followed-up for at least one hour at the clinic for safety and preliminary accuracy evaluations. An erect chest radiograph will be performed within 90 minutes of observation after the chest aspiration to detect the majority of post procedure pneumothoraces. A follow-up visit will be conducted within 7-10 days after the procedure day for safety evaluations.</detailed_description>
