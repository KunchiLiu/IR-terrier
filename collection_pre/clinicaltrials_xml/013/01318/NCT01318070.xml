	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The present study was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin as an add-on to pioglitazone in type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled blood glucose despite treatment with pioglitazone as well as diet and exercise therapies.</detailed_description>

Was receiving specific diet and exercise (if any) therapies during the observation period. 1. Had taken a diabetic medications other than pioglitazone within 16 weeks before the start of the treatment period (Week 0). 2. Had a history or symptoms of cardiac failure.</criteria>
