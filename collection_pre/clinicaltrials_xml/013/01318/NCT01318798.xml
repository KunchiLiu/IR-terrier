	<brief_summary>Post-operative acute renal failure is a severe post-operative complication and is associated with high mortality. The enhanced prediction score, including pre-as well as intra-operative predictors accurately predicted ARF following hepatic surgery. This prediction score allows early identification of patients at high risk of ARF and may support decision-making for protective kidney treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development and Validation of an Enhanced Prediction Score for Postoperative Acute Renal Failure After Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To enhance and validate an already pre-existing score accurately predicting post-operative acute renal failure (ARF) after hepatic surgery We will enhance a pre-existing score predicting ARF based on pre-operative as well as intra-operative predictors. Development process: we will identify the strongest predictors of ARF in a multivariable logistic regression model followed by a stepwise backward logistic regression analysis and bootstrapping. Validation process: we will perform an internal validation by calibrating the prediction model as well as by k-fold cross validation (c statistics) and bootstrapping. Additionally, we will calculate the discrimination by the area under the curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis: Furthermore we will perform a decision curve analysis to evaluate the clinical consequences of both prediction scores whether a patient with increased ARF risk would post-operative benefit of a treatment on the ICU.</detailed_description>
