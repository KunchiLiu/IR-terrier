	<brief_summary>This is a study of the safety and efficacy of a new surgical procedure using endoscopic instruments and a tunneling technique to reach the LES for dissection. We hypothesize that this technique provides an incisionless, less invasive option with similar functional outcome compared to standard Heller myotomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Myotomy of the Lower Esophageal Sphincter for Achalasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By the endoscopic creation of an esophageal submucosal tunnel the inner circular muscle layer can be easily visualized. In contrast to conventional Heller myotomy, the dissection of only the inner circular esophageal muscle layer leaves the outer longitudinal muscle layer intact. Thereby, post-interventional reflux disease should be avoided.</detailed_description>
