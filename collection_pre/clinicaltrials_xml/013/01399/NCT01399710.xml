	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: CT colonography accurately detects large polyps and masses. However, the test is less accurate in identifying lesions between 6 and 9 mm.Use of computer-aided detection (CAD) has shown promising results in providing uniform accuracy and improving CT colonography sensitivity. PURPOSE:This clinical trial compared the performance of CT colonography with unassisted and CAD-assisted reading in detecting patients with colorectal lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) as Second Reader in CT Colonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: multicenter, cross-sectional study. Each participant underwent CT colonography and colonoscopy on the same day. Expert readers interpreted CT colonography unassisted and then reviewed all colorectal lesion-like structures pinpointed by the CAD algorithm.</detailed_description>
