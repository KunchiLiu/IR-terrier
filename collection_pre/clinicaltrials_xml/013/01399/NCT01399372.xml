	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, vincristine sulfate, procarbazine hydrochloride, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer cells. It is not yet know whether rituximab and combination chemotherapy are more effective when given with or without radiation therapy in treating patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving rituximab and combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy works in treating patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine median progression-free survival (PFS) in both arms on an intent-to-treat basis. Secondary - To determine overall survival (OS) defined as the interval from randomization to death due to any cause. - To determine treatment-related neurotoxicity rates and disease-related cognitive deterioration in each arm, through the following methods: prospective formal neuropsychological evaluation, utilizing competing-risk methodology to account for death as a competing risk to neurotoxicity or cognitive deterioration from relapsed tumor burden/salvage treatment and incidence of clinically defined neurotoxicity as per investigator's assessment. - To determine if there exists differences between the two treatment arms in terms of health-related quality-of-life and symptoms over time. - To determine response (partial response (PR) and complete response (CR)) rate after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and after consolidation whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). - To determine chemotherapy-related toxicity, measured by Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE), v.4.0. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center recursive-partitioning analysis (RPA) classification for primary central nervous system lymphoma on age and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (Class 1: age ≤ 50 years vs Class 2: age &gt; 50 years and KPS ≥ 70% vs Class 3: age &gt; 50 years and KPS &lt; 70%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive rituximab IV over 5 hours or per institutional guidelines on days 1 and 15, methotrexate IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 16, vincristine sulfate IV on days 2 and 16 (courses 1 and 2 only), and procarbazine hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 2-8. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive consolidation therapy comprising cytarabine IV over 3 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive rituximab, methotrexate, vincristine sulfate, and procarbazine hydrochloride as in arm I. After completing chemotherapy (2-5 weeks later), patients without progressive disease undergo low-dose whole-brain radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 2.5 weeks (13 fractions total). Patients then receive consolidation cytarabine as in arm I. Patients may undergo blood and buccal sample collection for future correlative studies. Paraffin-embedded tissue block of primary tumor or a core tumor tissue punched from the tissue block, and cerebrospinal fluid may also be collected. Patients may also complete the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), the Trail Making Test Part A and Part B, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
