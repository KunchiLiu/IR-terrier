	<brief_title>Restricted Intravenous Fluid Regime Effects on Immunological Indicators of Elderly Patients Operated for Abdominal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative fluid administration is a common therapy in clinical practice, and recent regime has a history about 50 years. Recently, clinicians found that traditional regime had some disadvantages, for example, pulmonary edema, increased cardiac load, increased body weight. And thus, perioperative fluid restriction regimen has been suggested and proved could reduce cardiopulmonary complications and mortality rates after major elective gastrointestinal surgery. Patients were divided into two groups randomly and underwent restricted fluid regimen or traditional fluid regimen. We determined the complications and immunological function in two groups, and analyzed the relationship between complications and immunological changes. Based on this we decide the probable mechanism that perioperative fluid restriction effects on complications.</detailed_description>
