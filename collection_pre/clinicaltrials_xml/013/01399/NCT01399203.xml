	<brief_summary>To investigate the predictive value of the contrast media volume to creatinine clearance (V/CrCl) ratio for the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) (i.e., within 48-72 h) and to determine a relatively safe V/CrCl cut-off value to avoid CIN in patients following PCI</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Medium Volume and Contrast-induced Nephropathy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>contrast media volume to creatinine clearance (V/CrCl) ratios were obtained from consecutive consenting patients after unselective PCI. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the optimal sensitivity for the observed range of V/CrCl. The predictive value of V/CrCl for the risk of CIN was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.</detailed_description>
