	<brief_title>Paliperidone ER(Invega®) on Depressive Symptoms of Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, investigators are going to examine the effectiveness of Paliperidone ER on depressive symptoms toward schizophrenia patients who are previously unresponsive to other oral antipsychotics. In addition, the relationship between the change of depressive symptoms and adherence will be studied. Even though this study has a limitation of being designed as an open-labelled clinical study, it would be useful for clinicians because this study examines the influences toward adherence related to various factors and the changes of depressive symptoms related to switching to Paliperidone ER, which is well-proven medication.</detailed_description>
