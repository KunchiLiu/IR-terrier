	<brief_summary>the aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of BI 201335 given for 12 or 24 weeks in combination with PegIFN/RBV given for 24-48 weeks, according to re-randomisation of Early Treatment Success (ETS) patients at 24 weeks to stop PegIFN/RBV or continue PegIFN/RBV until week 48. If no ETS, then PegIFN/RB for 48 weeks, in HCV treatment-naive or relapsers patients coinfected with HIV</brief_summary>
