	<brief_summary>Standard therapy for gynecologic cancers involves the use of brachytherapy, also called internal radiation therapy or implant radiation. The treatment being studied consists of standard brachytherapy with the additional use of MRI to guide the insertion of radioactive applicators. The purpose of the study is to find out whether MRI-guided brachytherapy is practical and beneficial when compared to the standard CT-guided brachytherapy placement. The investigators are hoping that this MRI procedure will decrease the risk of giving too high a radiation dose to the bladder or bowel.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The insertion of the brachytherapy applicator will be administered in the Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Subjects will undergo an MRI scan in the AMIGO suite ensuring proper placement of the applicator. Subjects may have an optional FMISO-PET scan. Subjects will have a follow-up visit including physical exam, pap smear, and MRI of the pelvis and/or PET scan 90 days after treatment. Subjects will have a follow-up visit including physical exam, pap smear, and MRI of the pelvis and/or PET scan 180 days after treatment.</detailed_description>
