	<brief_summary>Constipation is a common problem in palliative cancer patients. However, there were insufficient randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to identify the "best" laxative or combination of laxatives in these patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in holistic approach is popular among cancer patients. More than half had received at least one form of TCM therapy according to the survey carried in 2008. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in compound formulation with nourishing and purging effects simultaneously may be more preferred to relieve constipation by local palliative cancer patients. TCM syndrome differentiated by collecting all symptoms and signs through the classic four diagnostic methods is the foundation for making diagnosis and prescription in TCM practice. The present study is the first local study to evaluate the bowel habits and TCM syndrome of advanced cancer patients with constipation. We hope that the results not only can shed light on patient's own reporting or experience of constipation and the effectiveness of current practice, but also can draw up a CHM formulation for advanced cancer patients with constipation.</brief_summary>
