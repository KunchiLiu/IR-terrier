	<brief_title>Evaluation of Ridge Dimensional Changes After Immediate Implantation and Efficacy of This Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>24 hopeless single root teeth will be selected. The horizontal and vertical measurements will be assessed in 12socket after immediate implantation and filling the gape with DFDBA. Horizontal dimensions (bucco-lingual) of alveolar ridge will be measured at 1,3 and 7 mm using caliper and CBCT , and vertical ridge dimensions at 8 points:(mid-buccal,mid-lingual,mesial,distal,disto-buccal-mesio-buccal,disto-lingual,mesio-lingual ) will be determined using a periodontal probe from the line connecting the two adjacent CEJs ,and dimensional changes will be measured after 3 months following implant insertion with the same device during the second stage surgery. The vertical and horizontal dimensions between the implant and alveolar crest and between the crest and base of the gap will be measured at 8 points:(mid-buccal,mid-lingual,mesial,distal,disto-buccal-mesio-buccal,disto-lingual,mesio-lingual ). The primary and secondary stability will be measured using Osstell at baseline and 3-month later. Twelve sockets will heal without grafting materials, soft and hard tissue measurements including horizontal and vertical ridge dimensions will be determined. All the measurement will be assessed using caliper and CBCT at the time of extraction and 3-month later at the time of implant insertion.</detailed_description>
