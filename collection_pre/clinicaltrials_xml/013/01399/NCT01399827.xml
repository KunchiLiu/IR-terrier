	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to a) assess the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) among stimulant treated Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) adults, b) assess the side effect profile of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of DESR among stimulant treated ADHD adults, c) assess effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on ADHD symptoms and associated features in stimulant treated ADHD adults, and d) predict value of fatty acids present in RBC cell membranes. This study will be a 12-week trial with adults 18-55 years of age with ADHD and symptoms of DESR.</brief_summary>

Those subjects treated with traditional ADHD pharmacotherapy must be on a stable, effective dose (per clinician evaluation) of an FDAapproved treatment for ADHD for at least one month at the time of enrollment. 4. A Deficient Emotional Self Regulation (DESR) Tscore on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive FunctionAdult Version (BRIEFA) Emotional Control Scale of at least 65 and/or a score of 99 or more on the DERS. Exclusion Criteria 1. For those subjects not treated for their ADHD at the time of enrollment, a history of nonresponse or intolerance to methylphenidate at adequate doses as determined by the clinician. 2. A history of intolerance to omega3 fatty acids as determined by the clinician. 3. Pregnant or nursing females. 4. Serious, unstable medical illness including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic (thyroid), neurologic (seizure), immunologic, or hematologic disease. 5. Glaucoma. 6. Clinically unstable psychiatric conditions including suicidality, homicidality, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or lifetime history of a clinically serious condition potentially exacerbated by a stimulant such as mania, or psychosis. 7. Tics or a family history or diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome. 8. Current (within 3 months) DSMIV criteria for abuse or dependence with any psychoactive substance other than nicotine. 9. Allergies to fish or shellfish; multiple adverse drug reactions. 10. Any other concomitant medication with primarily central nervous system activity other than specified in Concomitant Medication portion of the protocol. 11.
