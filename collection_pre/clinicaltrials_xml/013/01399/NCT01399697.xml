	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with methotrexate versus RoActemra/Actemra monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to methotrexate. All patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously (iv) every 4 weeks plus oral methotrexate for 16 weeks. Patients achieving low disease activity at Week 16 will be randomized to receive a further 12 weeks of RoActemra/Actemra treatment plus either methotrexate or placebo. Anticipated time on study treatment is 28 weeks.</brief_summary>
