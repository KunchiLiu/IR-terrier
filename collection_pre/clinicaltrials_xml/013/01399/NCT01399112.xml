	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to recruit patients who have experienced a recent first episode of psychosis who have a chart diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenifom, Schizoaffective Disorder, Psychosis NOS, or Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features and self identify themselves as a current cigarette smoker. Aiding this population with smoking cessation is crucial as the majority of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (50-90%) smoke, which is leading to early mortality. While these individuals can benefit from standard evidence-based treatment, these treatments are underutilized. Web based programs, such as the EDSS and thetruth.com, can provide education and motivational tools to help people with a recent onset of psychosis use evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. This study aims to test these two web-based programs among young people with a recent episode of psychosis for usability and likeability and to explore whether use of these two programs will motivate users to seek smoking cessation treatment or to engage in other quitting behaviors in the month following use of the programs. Information gathered from this proposal will be used to help the researchers decide whether either of these two programs will be reasonable to include in a larger study of a comprehensive treatment for individuals with first episode psychosis.</brief_summary>
