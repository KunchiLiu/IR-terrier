	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine whether clinical outcome following initial treatment of severe pneumonia with oral amoxicillin is as effective as the current standard benzyl penicillin. The study will also provide an estimate of the proportion of Kenyan children with severe pneumonia who fail treatment with a single antibiotic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amoxicillin Versus Benzyl Penicillin for Treatment of Children Hospitalised With Severe Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Case management for the treatment of childhood acute respiratory infections has been widely promoted in many developing countries for over 20 years. Despite this, pneumonia continues to claim over 1.5 million lives of children under five annually. The use of affordable, easily-administered, safe, effective treatments can potentially reduce the burden of childhood pneumonia. The WHO recommends the use of a single antibiotic for the treatment of severe pneumonia. Whereas in Asia, evidence from large randomized clinical trials has changed policy recommendations for treatment of severe pneumonia from parenteral penicillin to oral amoxicillin, there is little evidence to inform a similar move in African children where pneumonia is associated with poorer outcomes. In this study the investigators will investigate effectiveness of oral amoxicillin versus the current standard treatment, benzyl penicillin in severe childhood pneumonia using a randomized controlled non-inferiority design preceded by a pilot pre-intervention phase. The investigators will also collect observational data HIV-exposed / infected children with severe pneumonia. 594 children aged 2 - 59 months admitted with clinical signs of severe pneumonia to up to 7 hospitals in Kenya will be randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or injectable benzyl penicillin. They will then be followed up for the primary outcome of pre-defined treatment failure at 48 hours. The results of this trial will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of oral amoxicillin in the treatment of severe pneumonia in a population of Kenyan children and determine the practicability of conducting large pragmatic trials on pneumonia in Africa similar to those done in Asia.</detailed_description>
