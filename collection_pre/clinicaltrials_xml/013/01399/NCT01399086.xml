	<brief_title>Fulvestrant in Postmenopausal Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, there are no available data on the use of fulvestrant in the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer in current clinical practice in Greece. In view of this significant lack of knowledge, we designed this retrospective study in order to evaluate the effectiveness of fulvestrant in real-life settings, by obtaining data regarding the use of fulvestrant in current clinical practice among treating physicians in Greece. This retrospective study aims to address the following questions: - What is the clinical outcome of fulvestrant treatment in terms of TTP when used in metastatic breast cancer in a real life clinical setting? - What is the positioning of fulvestrant in the hormone therapy sequencing in metastatic breast cancer in Greece? - What are the other clinical outcomes (ORR, duration of response, CBR) of fulvestrant treatment in metastatic breast cancer in a real life clinical setting and what is the relation between clinical outcomes and fulvestrant's position in the treatment sequence? - What is the usual duration of fulvestrant treatment in metastatic breast cancer in the real life clinical setting and which are the reasons for treatment discontinuation? - Treatment failure with fulvestrant: what is the next step in sequencing according to patients' breast cancer treatment history?</detailed_description>
