	<brief_title>Cobalamin Absorption From Fortified Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is highly prevalent in the US and worldwide. Deficiency is most common in the elderly, with an average prevalence ≈25% over age 60 y. About 40% of older persons with low serum cobalamin have food cobalamin malabsorption (F-CM), in which gastric atrophy/achlorhydria and/or dysfunction is implicated. Because of the prevalence of deficiency in those over age 60 y, it is generally recommended that the elderly consume a higher proportion of their cobalamin from fortified foods than what is recommended for younger people. However there is considerable debate about whether crystalline cobalamin is absorbed as well by the elderly with F-CM as it is by younger people, especially if it is added as a fortificant to food. The data to be collected in this study will provide information useful to on-going deliberations concerning the future fortification of wheat flour with vitamin B12 in the United States.</detailed_description>
