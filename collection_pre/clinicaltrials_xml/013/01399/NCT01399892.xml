	<brief_summary>High fiber foods are recommended as a preferential source of carbohydrate by the Nutrition Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Dietary fibers may delay glucose absorption and reduce postprandial glycemic excursion. They also appear to have a beneficial effect on cholesterol levels. It has been shown, in few short term adult studies, that high fiber foods reduce postprandial blood glucose levels. The American Diabetes Association feels that there is little evidence confirming the positive effect of high fiber foods on blood glucose control. It is not clear whether a high fiber diet can improve glycemic control and/or reduce the risk of hypoglycemic events. Our hypothesis is that children with type 1 diabetes will benefit from having added fibers in their diet. The investigators plan to study blood glucose values using a continuous blood glucose monitor before and after dietary fibers are introduced. This will help us determine whether a diet rich in fiber should be recommended in all children with type 1 diabetes mellitus</brief_summary>
