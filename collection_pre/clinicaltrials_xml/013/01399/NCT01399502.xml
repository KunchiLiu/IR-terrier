	<brief_title>Promotion of Self-help Strategies for Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression symptoms are commonly experienced and disrupt day-to-day life. Increasing depression literacy and the use of effective self-help methods could improve depression across the community. The internet is an ideal promotional medium for health messages, because it is often used to search for information about mental health issues, and health messages can be widely disseminated at little cost. An email campaign could be a low-cost approach to improving self-help behavior and knowledge about depression in adults with depression symptoms.</detailed_description>
