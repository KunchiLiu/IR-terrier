	<brief_summary>In this phase I/II study,investigators are evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of the combination of BKM120, an oral inhibitor of PI3 kinase, and bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM. In the Phase I part of the trial, the optimal BKM120 dose to be administered with a standard dose of bevacizumab will be determined in patients with refractory solid tumors. Although it is unlikely that the concurrent administration of bevacizumab will alter the pharmacokinetics of BKM120, limited pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on all patients treated during the Phase II portion of the study. Assuming this combination is feasible, the Phase II portion of the study will proceed, using the doses determined in the Phase I portion. In the phase II portion, eligible patients will be limited to those with recurrent/progressive GBM following 1st line combined modality therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination of BKM120 and Bevacizumab in Refractory Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase I study of patients with advanced refractory solid tumors followed by a Phase II study for the second-line treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory glioblastoma multiforme. In the phase I part of the study the MTD of BKM120 when combined with bevacizumab was determined to be 60 mg/day. In the Phase II part of this study, patients with relapsed/refractory GBM following first line therapy are being treated with the BKM120/bevacizumab combination. Limited BKM120 pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed on all patients treated during this part of the study. Patients will be reevaluated for response to treatment after 2 cycles (8 weeks). Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment, with subsequent reevaluations every 8 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Two populations of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM will be treated in the Phase II trial: 1) patients with no previous exposure to bevacizumab (N= 55) and 2) patients who received bevacizumab as part of first-line combined modality treatment (N= 20).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I ONLY: Advanced, metastatic solid tumor that has progressed after standard therapy, or is a tumor type resistant to therapy, and for which bevacizumab is clinically appropriate. Patient may have measurable disease or nonmeasureable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria Phase II ONLY: Progressive GBM after treatment with surgical resection (if possible) and 1st line radiation/chemotherapy. No previous treatment with a PI3K inhibitor. Previous treatment with bevacizumab as a component of firstline therapy is allowed. At least one measurable or evaluable lesion definable by MRI scan. Disease must be measurable by RANO criteria. Archival tumor tissue available for correlative testing. ALL PATIENTS: Patient must be ≥ 4 weeks from administration of last dose of cancer therapy (including radiation therapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy). Patients who receive a small molecule targeted therapy as part of their first line treatment regimen must be ≥ 4 weeks or ≥ 5 half lives from administration of last dose, whichever is shorter. The patient must have recovered from or come to a new chronic or stable baseline from all treatmentrelated toxicities. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01. Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients with diarrhea ≥ grade 2. Patients with uncontrolled type I or type II diabetes mellitus, defined as a fasting plasma glucose ≥120 mg/dL. Patients who have received prior treatment with a P13K inhibitor. Treatment with therapeutic doses of coumarintype anticoagulants (maximum daily dose of 1 mg allowed for port line patency permitted). Patient has active cardiac disease including any of the following: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% as determined by Multiple Grated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) QTc &gt; 480 msec on screening ECG (using the QTcF formula) Angina pectoris that requires the use of antianginal medication Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions Supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication Conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker Valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function Symptomatic pericarditis Patients who are currently receiving treatment with medication with a known risk to prolong the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug. Patients with clinical history of hemoptysis or hematemesis (defined as having bright red blood of ½ teaspoon or more per episode) ≤1 month prior to study enrollment. Patients with any history of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) Patients who have received chemotherapy or targeted anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycinC) prior to starting study drug must recover to a grade 1 before starting the trial. Patients who have received any continuous or intermittent small molecule therapeutics (excluding monoclonal antibodies) ≤ 5 effective half lives prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy. Patients who have been treated with any hematopoietic colonystimulating factors (e.g. GCSF, GMCSF) ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study drug. Erythropoietin or darbepoetin therapy, if initiated at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment may be continued. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, intracranial biopsy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt or significant traumatic injury ≤ 28 days prior to entry.</criteria>
