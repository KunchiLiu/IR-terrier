	<brief_summary>Pre-portioned entrées are commonly consumed to help control portion size and limit energy intake. Few studies, however, have investigated the influence of the characteristics of pre-portioned entrées on energy intake. This study investigates how the characteristics of solid pre-portioned entrées, specifically, variations in their energy content and energy density influence energy intake over a day. The investigators hypothesize that reducing the energy content and energy density of compulsory entrées will act independently and add together to reduce daily energy intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Content and Energy Density of Pre-portioned Entrees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This experiment uses a crossover design with repeated measures within subjects. One day a week for four weeks, participants are provided with all of their foods and beverages for breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Across test days, the entrée at each meal is varied in both energy content and energy density between a standard level (100%) and a reduced level (64% of the standard). Following consumption of a compulsory entrée, a variety of unmanipulated foods will be served for ad libitum consumption. The order of experimental conditions is counterbalanced across the subjects.</detailed_description>
