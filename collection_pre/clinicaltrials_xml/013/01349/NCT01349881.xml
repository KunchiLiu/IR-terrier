	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the combination of eflornithine and sulindac will be effective in reducing a three-year event rate of adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers in patients previously treated for Stages 0 through III colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0820, Adenoma and Second Primary Prevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess whether eflornithine 500 mg or sulindac 150 mg are effective in reducing the 3-year event rate of high risk adenoma or second primary colorectal cancer in Stage 0, I II and III colon cancer patients. The primary hypothesis will test the main effect of each agent, as well as the comparison of placebo alone to the combination of sulindac and eflornithine.</detailed_description>
