	<brief_summary>Fasting during labour is a usual conduct in many hospitals around the world (due to the theorical risk of bronchoaspiration). There is little evidence supporting this conclusion. Besides, there are several studies that suggest that food intake during labour can be associated with shorter labours and a lower cesarean rate. The aim of the investigators study is to show if the oral intake of fluids during labour can reduce the first stage of labour with minimum risk to the patient.</brief_summary>
