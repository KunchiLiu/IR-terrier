	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a three times per week, 2 month robotic assisted treadmill gait training program, will beneficially affect the fitness, physical and psychological well-being, and the vascular and metabolic cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with complete motor Spinal Cord Injury (SCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Passive Gait Training in Complete Motor Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are a source of increasing concern among people with SCI and their health providers. The importance of physical activity in reducing the risk of heart disease in this population is indisputable, but exercise opportunities for persons with SCI are limited by physiologic and functional factors. Decreased functional muscle mass, impaired autonomic control of myocardial function, and decreased venous return limits training responses.</detailed_description>
