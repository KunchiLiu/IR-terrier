	<brief_summary>This study is designed to explore a new approach to help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) become more physically active. Through weekly telephone sessions with a health coach utilizing motivational interviewing, participants will be empowered to set goals for increased physical activity (emphasis on walking). The objective of the study is to determine if telephone-based health coaching is a reasonable and effective way to increase physical activity, as measured by a gold-standard activity monitor, in people with COPD.</brief_summary>
