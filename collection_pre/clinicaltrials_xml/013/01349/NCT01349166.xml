	<brief_summary>The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide. Because of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes, it is imperative to propose methods of prevention and this in early stage of abnormal glucose metabolism. This study will assess the beneficial effects of physical activity (acute and chronic effects) (the subjects being their own controls) on cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in 3 conditions : unstimulated (fasting and resting conditions) and stimulated conditions: postprandial response to a standardized meal preceded or not by an exercise bout. The investigators hypothesized that an acute bout of exercise will decrease the postprandial inflammatory response to a standardized meal and that this effect of exercise will be increased after 3 months of exercise training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of 3 Months of Supervised Exercise Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study over 4 months, open, nonrandomized. 45 overweight or obese male subjects will complete 3 experimental sessions (0700-1400h) before and after 3 months of supervised physical training. During a first session, subjects will remain inactive and fasted (basal conditions). During the second session a standardized meal will be offered (postprandial response to a standardized meal). The third session will consist in the realization of an exercise bout (60min at 60%VO2 max) followed by a standardized meal (same meal that the previous day). Several blood (catheter), salivary and urinary samples will be collected during the 3 sessions, throughout the experimental day.</detailed_description>
