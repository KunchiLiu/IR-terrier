	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Mesalamine is commonly used to induce and maintain remission in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Behavioral and psycho-social barriers to mesalamine adherence exist in patients with IBD. These factors can be identified using qualitative testing in order to develop a validated instrument to measure the "adherence profile" of an individual patient, and design appropriate behavioral interventions to reduce non-adherence. Objectives: To test a novel interview instrument that determines the medication adherence profile of patients with IBD prescribed mesalamine by correlating with objective measures of adherence</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adherence to Mesalamine Profile for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: 1. To test a novel interview instrument to classify patients into "adherence profiles" 2. To validate this instrument with quantitative scores of mesalamine adherence and objective testing. Study Design Rationale: Qualitative research design and prospective validation</detailed_description>
