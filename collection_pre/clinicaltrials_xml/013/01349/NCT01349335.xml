	<brief_title>Dose Exploring and Setting Study for Tolvaptan to Treat Hepatic Cirrhosis With Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tolvaptan is able to exert hydragogue diuretic effects (water diuresis) via inhibition of water reabsorption by renal collecting ducts without corresponding increase in electrolyte excretion. It has been confirmed that tolvaptan is able to increase urine volume without any adverse effects on renal functions.</detailed_description>
