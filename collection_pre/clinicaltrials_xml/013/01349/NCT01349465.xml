	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate durability of SVR in chronic HCV patients who achieved SVR in the previous study with TMC435-containing regimen and time for resistance associated mutations to return to baseline in chronic HCV patients who did not achieve SVR in the previous study with TMC435-containing regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-year Follow-up Study in Patients Previously Treated With TMC435-Containing Regimen for the Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-year follow-up study in patients who completed the last post-therapy follow-up visit of the previous Phase IIb [NCT00882908, NCT00980330] or Phase III [NCT01289782, NCT01290679, NCT01281839] study in which they received TMC435, in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. The entire study duration for each patients will be approximately 36 months. The medical follow-up of the patients will be performed according to the local standard of care. This study will evaluate the levels of hepatitis C virus in the blood circulation, as well as safety and alpha-fetoprotein testing and the change in sequence of HCV NS3/4A region over time in patients with confirmed detectable HCV RNA at last post-therapy follow-up visit of the previous TMC435 study. In this study the development of liver disease progression will also be assessed. No medication will be administered in this study.</detailed_description>
