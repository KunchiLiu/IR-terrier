	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Immunoglobulin Intravenous (Human) 10% (NewGam) in Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of NewGam in correcting the platelet count. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of NewGam. Safety will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, physical examination, evaluation of adverse events (AE) and laboratory parameters, and viral safety testing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age of ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years. 2. Confirmed diagnosis of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with a threshold platelet count &lt; 100x10^9/L) of at least 12 months duration. 3. Platelet count of no more than 20x10^9/L with or without bleeding manifestations. 4. Freely given written informed consent from patient. 5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative result on a pregnancy test (human chorionic gonadotropine [HCG]based assay) and need to practice contraception using a method of proven reliability for the duration of the study. 1. Thrombocytopenia secondary to other diseases (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] or systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) or drugrelated thrombocytopenia. 2. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV), antiD immunoglobulin or thrombopoetin receptor agonists, or other platelet enhancing drugs (including immunosuppressive or other immunomodulatory drugs) within 3 weeks before enrollment, except for: Longterm corticosteroid therapy when the dose has been stable during the preceding 3 weeks and no dosage change is planned until study Day 22. Longterm azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or attenuated androgen therapy when the dose has been stable during the preceding 3 months and no dosage change is planned until study Day 22. 3. Unresponsive to previous treatment with IGIV or antiD immunoglobulin.</criteria>
