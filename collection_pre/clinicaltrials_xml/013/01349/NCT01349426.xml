	<brief_summary>Surgical staplers have become standard for ligation, division, resection, anastomosis and closure in many surgical procedures. Staplers are utilized in thoracic surgery routinely for pulmonary parenchymal resection and closure, ligation of vessels and bronchi. In addition, closure of incomplete fissure/s is a frequent need in pulmonary surgery. Although generally safe and efficacious, staplers and staple loads are expensive, and can result in micro air leaks. The LigaSure Vessel Sealing System presents as a potentially faster and less expensive alternative to staplers. The LigaSure Vessel sealing system utilizes a combination of heat generated via bi-polar radiofrequency energy and precise jaw pressure to denature the collagen and elastin in tissue and blood vessels. The newly released Force Triad Generator and the Impact, a 10 mm jaw sealing device (Ligasure system, COVIDIEN Society) may offer improved performance in terms of tissue sticking due to an improved sealing algorithm, and to the jaw configuration of the Impact. The study main objective is to compare the quality of parenchymal pneumostasis after fissure closure achieved with staplers vs that achieved with LigaSure.</brief_summary>
