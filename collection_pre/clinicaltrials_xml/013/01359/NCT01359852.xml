	<brief_title>A Study of [11C]JNJ-42491293, a Possible PET Ligand for the mGlu2 Receptor, in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (volunteers will know the identity of assigned treatment) study in healthy adult volunteers and will consist of 4 consecutive parts, A, B, C, and D. Advancement to parts B, C, and D will occur only if the objectives of the preceding parts are met. Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited for each part of the study. This will be the first study in which 42491293 will be given to healthy adult volunteers. Part A will investigate the measurement of radiation (referred to as radiation dosimetry) of 42491293. Part B will measure the regional brain kinetics (activity) and binding properties of 42491293. Part C will assess the dose dependent blocking of 42491293 by 40411813 in brain tissues following single oral doses of 40411813. Part D will assess the 'duration of occupancy' of the metabotropic glutamate receptor-2 (mGluR2) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) site in the brain by 40411813 compared to peripheral clearance. In this study, 42491293 will be radio-labeled and evaluated as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for use in imaging studies of the brain to detect binding of 40411813, a compound being developed for treating patients with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. In Parts A,B,C, and D, [11C] JNJ-42491293 (300 to 370 MBq) will be dosed as an i.v. bolus injection. During Part C and D, JNJ-40411813 (up to 500mg) will be administered orally (by mouth) 1.5 to 3 hours prior to scheduled PET scans.</detailed_description>
