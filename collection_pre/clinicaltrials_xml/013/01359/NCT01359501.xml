	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effects of Chinese Medical Treatment on Leucopenia After Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in the Department of Breast Surgery in China Medical University Hospital, Taichung. One hundred newly diagnosed breast cancer patient (age ≧18, Stage I, II, IIIa) will be included. After the diagnosis, the patients will undergo operation. Then, each patient will receive one of the following protocol of chemotherapy according to her pathology report and overall evaluation: "FEC*6", "FEC*4+Taxotere*4", and "FEC*3+Taxotere*3". Every participator will start to take the powder of Chinese herb-LCH1 after her receiving first time of chemotherapy until she receives the next cycle.(While receiving "FEC", it will be 3 weeks. While receiving "Taxotere", it will be 4 weeks). Just before receiving the next cycle of chemotherapy, the blood of the participator will be sampled to check her CBC, GOT/GPT, BUN/Cr and tumor maker. The investigators also adopt the body constitution questionnaire (BCQ) to evaluate the Chinese medical constitutional status, the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23, and Karnofsky score to evaluate the quality of life, and to evaluate the adverse effects of the adjuvant chemotherapy with the NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0. Each participator will take the powder of Chinese herb-LCH1 from her first chemotherapy till 3 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy. Over all, it will take about 18 weeks (FEC*6) to 28 weeks (FEC*4+Taxotere*4) to complete the treatment. This study will also investigate the influence of the chemotherapy on the Chinese medical constitutional status, and in order to provide the basis for the complementary treatment for the breast cancer by adjusting and balancing the constitutional status of the patients.</detailed_description>
