	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether therapy with the combination of PSI-7977 and daclatasvir (BMS-790052) with or without ribavirin is effective in treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection when given for 12 or 24 weeks as measured by sustained virologic response with undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post treatment</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men and women, ages 18 to 70 years. Participants infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 2, or 3, with no previous exposure to an interferon formulation (ie, interferonalpha, pegylated interferonalpha) ribavirin, or other HCVspecific directacting antiviral (including daclatasvir and PSI7977). Patients should have chronic hepatitis C genotype 1a, 1b, 2, or 3 as documented by: positive test results for antiHCV antibody; HCV RNA; or a HCV genotype at least 6 months prior to screening, and HCV RNA and antiHCV antibody at the time of screening. Evidence of a medical condition associate with chronic liver disease other than HCV. History of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites requiring management with diuretics or paracentesis. History of hemophilia. History of torsade de pointes. Current or known history of cancer (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior to enrollment. History of gastrointestinal disease or surgical procedure (except cholecystectomy). History of clinically significant cardiac disease. Blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Poor venous access. Any other medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the candidate inappropriate for participation in this study.</criteria>
