	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Stimulation of the SPG at high frequencies (50-200Hz) is believed to cause a physiological parasympathetic block which decreases VMCA oxyHb concentration and cephalic vessel diameter. Stimulation of the SPG at low frequencies (1-60 Hz)is believed to cause a physiological parasympathetic upregulation which increases VMCA, oxyHb concentration and cephalic vessel diameter.</brief_summary>
