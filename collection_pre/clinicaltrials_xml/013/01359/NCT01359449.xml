	<brief_summary>The purpose for this study is to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of Menactra® administered between 12 and 18 months of age and concomitantly with routine immunization with two different provincial schedule Primary Objectives: - To describe the immunogenicity of Menactra® administered concomitantly with routine immunizations at 12 and 18 months in naïve or Menjugate-primed (MenC-primed) infants (measured by serum bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement [SBA-BR]) - To describe the immunogenicity of MenC administered concomitantly with routine immunizations at 12 months of age (measured by SBA-BR) Secondary Objectives: Safety - To describe the safety profile of Menactra® and MenC vaccines after each dose when given concomitantly with routine immunization. Immunogenicity - To describe the immunogenicity of both vaccines using serum bactericidal assay using human complement [SBA-HC] - To describe the immunogenicity of Pediacel administered at 18 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Two Doses of Menactra® or One Dose of Monovalent Meningococcal Group C Vaccine With Routine Immunizations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants depending on their groups will receive either two doses of Menactra vaccine concomitantly with the routinely recommended vaccines or one dose of MenC vaccine concomitantly with the routinely recommended vaccines and will be monitored for safety and immunogenicity. The duration of each subject's participation in the trial will be approximately 7 months.</detailed_description>
