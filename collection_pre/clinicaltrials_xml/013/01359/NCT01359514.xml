	<brief_title>Mechanism-based Choice of Therapy for Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic or idiopathic pain patients will be assessed with the variety of pain tests including the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and temporal summation (TS). Then, they will be offered on the double-blind design a several weeks treatment with either pregabalin or duloxetine. Patients will be followed-up weekly by phone for their pain relief and will be re-assessed in the lab toward the end of the treatment. The investigators suggest that patients with less-efficient CPM (deficient pain inhibition) will "earn" more pain relief from the treatment with duloxetine, while the patients with the enhanced pain summation will response better to pregabalin.</detailed_description>
