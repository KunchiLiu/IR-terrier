	<brief_title>An Assessment of SAFE (Swift Accountable Fair Enforcement) in Cochise County</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically, rates of failure on routine probation have been high. The result is that large numbers of probationers are ultimately revoked from probation and sentenced to long underlying jail or prison terms. Arizona is experimenting with alternatives to routine probation with the goal of reducing the overall burden of incarceration. Cochise County in Arizona is experimenting with innovative probation supervision practices. Subjects are assigned to one of three supervision conditions: Probation-as-usual (routine supervision with no deferred jail); discretionary deferred jail in response to probation violations; and Arizona's Swift, Accountable, Fair, Enforcement, or SAFE (SAFE involves non-discretionary deferred jail in response to probation violations).</detailed_description>
