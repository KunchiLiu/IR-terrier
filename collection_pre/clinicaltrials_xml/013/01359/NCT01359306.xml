	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors of right ventricular damage (RVD) assessed by wall motion abnormalities, edema, myocardial salvage and delayed enhancement (DE)cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and its prognostic significance. The investigators hypothesize that ischemia related changes of the myocardium are also visible in the right ventricle and that they have an impact on patient outcome.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Onset of symptoms &lt;12 h before angioplasty. STsegment elevation of at least 0.1 mV in ≥2 extremity leads or at least 0.2 mV in ≥2 precordial leads. Contraindications to CMR as implanted defibrillators, pacemakers, ferromagnetic intracranial metallic implants or pulmonary metallic splints and claustrophobia. A further exclusion criterion was prior fibrinolysis.</criteria>
