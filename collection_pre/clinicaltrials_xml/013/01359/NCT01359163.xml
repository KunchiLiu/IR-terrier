	<criteria>Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;45 kg (99 lbs). Healthy female subjects between the ages of 21 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing).
