	<brief_title>MI Mortality Risk and Between-hospital Risk Variation in the United Kingdom and Sweden</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limited evidence is available in comparing hospital level care and reference mortality risks between countries, due to the scarce availability of nationwide coronary heart disease data. The demographics and medical expenditure percentage are comparable in the United Kingdom and Sweden; however, the in-hospital case-fatality rates within 30 days after admission for acute myocardial infarction was greater in the UK than Sweden (6.3% versus 2.9%)(OECD, 2009). To investigate the discrepancy, the current study aims to compare the mortality risk differences and associated explanatory factors between the two countries. Results of the study can contribute to myocardial infarction care implementation in the UK and Sweden. The UK Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP)and Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions (RIKS-HIA) are few quality national registries currently available for acute coronary syndrome. Using data from the MINAP and RIKS-HIA, we propose to investigate (1)the survival trajectories for a reference patient with myocardial infarction and (2) hospital variability in myocardial infarction mortality rate in the UK and Sweden, adjusted for important patient-level and hospital-level covariates.</detailed_description>
