	<brief_summary>- Approximately 30% of all patients with cancer report levels of psychological distress indicative of the need for psychological intervention. - Research suggests that learning more adaptive coping strategies improves psychological adjustment to cancer. - It is imperative to develop cost-efficient, feasible psychosocial interventions. - The aim is to test the efficacy of the self administered format of a psycho-educational intervention (NUCARE) in reducing distress and enhancing adaptive coping strategies for cancer patients. It is hypothesized that: - patients would show significant reductions in distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) over the 6-week treatment period, and that treatment would produce superior results compared to wait-list; patients would maintain or even increase their improvement up to 3 months following treatment. - the treatment would enhance more adaptive coping strategies. - greater self-reported adherence to the treatment/homework would be associated with symptom improvement, more autonomous self-regulation and higher perceived competence for adhering to the coping intervention program.</brief_summary>
