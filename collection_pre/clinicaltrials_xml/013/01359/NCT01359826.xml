	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multi-system autoimmune disease impacting the physical, social, psychological health and quality of life of patients. Fatigue and pain are aspects of SLE patients which affect their health related quality of life (HRQOL). The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of milnacipran on fatigue in SLE patients with widespread pain (WSP) or fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). A secondary objective will be to determine the effect of milnacipran on pain and quality of life measurements. Fifty SLE male and female patients, 18 years and older, will be recruited for a 15-week study, in which patients will be receive 14 weeks of milnacipran 50-100 mg twice a day or placebo. Measurements of fatigue, pain, and HRQOL will be compared between the milnacipran and placebo groups at the screening visit, baseline visit, week number 6, and week number 14. Milnacipran has been shown to be an effective treatment for pain, fatigue and physical function in FMS patients. To date, no clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of fatigue in SLE patients with concomitant WSP or FMS. The investigators hypothesize, based on FMS studies, that the milnacipran treated patients will have less fatigue than those in the placebo group. In addition, compared to control arm, those treated with the study drug will have less pain and improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
