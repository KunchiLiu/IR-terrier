	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the Safety and Efficacy of Ciprodexa Foam (0.3% Ciprofloxacin, 0.1% Dexamethasone Otic Foam), used once-a-day for 7 days for the treatment of Acute Diffuse Otitis Externa, compared to Ciprodex otic suspension used twice daily for 7 days.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute otitis externa (AOE) is defined as a diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna and/or the tympanic membrane. AOE is one of the most common infections encountered by otolaryngologists, pediatricians and family physicians. Diagnosis of AOE requires rapid onset (generally within 48 hours) of symptoms and signs of ear canal inflammation which includes: A) otalgia (often severe), itching or fullness, sometimes accompanied by reduced hearing or jaw pain; B) tenderness of the tragus and/or pinna; and C) diffuse ear canal edema with or without erythema, sometimes accompanied by ear discharge (otorrhea).</detailed_description>
