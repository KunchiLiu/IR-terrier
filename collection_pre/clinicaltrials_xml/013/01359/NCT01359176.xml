	<brief_summary>Capnography is the non-invasive monitoring of the concentration or partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the expired respiratory gases; it is thus a non-invasive monitoring technique which allows fast and reliable insight into ventilation, circulation and metabolism. The capnogram is a direct monitor of the inhaled and exhaled concentration or partial pressure of CO2, and an indirect monitor of the CO2 partial pressure in the arterial blood. The purpose of this study is to create a waveform library by collecting CO2 waveform data from healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
