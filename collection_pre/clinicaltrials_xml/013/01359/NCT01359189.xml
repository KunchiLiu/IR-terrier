	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility, exploratory, and proof-of-concept study to evaluate rectal probe scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent (ProstaScint®) in patients with suspected primary prostate cancer. ProxiScanTM is a small cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera the size of a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies, Inc.To explore the adjunctive benefit/feasibility of PSMA distribution in the normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilizing TRUS and CT/SPECT hybrid imaging, biopsy negative patients will be considered as normal controls. Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology results will be correlated with ProxiScanTM, TRUS, and pelvis planar and SPECT/CT. Our hypothesis is that it will be safe and feasible to utilize a rectal probe scintigraphy (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific ProstaScint® uptake in primary prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a feasibility, exploratory, and proof-of-concept study to evaluate rectal probe scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent (ProstaScint®) in patients with suspected primary prostate cancer. ProxiScanTM is a small cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera the size of a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies, Inc. Due to its inherent small size, this camera is capable of potentially imaging of prostate cancer specific radiopharmaceutical uptake distributed within the prostate gland located closely adjacent to the camera head.In this study the investigators will enroll patients with a clinical suspicion and high likelihood of prostate cancer. A scintigraphic rectal probe (ProxiScanTM) will be used to detect ProstaScint® uptake in the prostate gland, in comparison to TRUS and pelvis planar and SPECT/CT. The incidence of biopsy positive prostate cancer in patients with suspected disease clinically can range from 25% to 40%; therefore up to 12 patients will be enrolled on this study. To explore the adjunctive benefit/feasibility of PSMA distribution in the normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilizing TRUS and CT/SPECT hybrid imaging, biopsy negative patients will be considered as normal controls. Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology results will be correlated with ProxiScanTM, TRUS, and pelvis planar and SPECT/CT. Our hypothesis is that it will be safe and feasible to utilize a rectal probe scintigraphy (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific ProstaScint® uptake in primary prostate cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Elevated PSA ≥ 4ng/mL and/or abnormal digital rectal exam suspicious for prostate cancer. Planned sextant prostate biopsy. Sufficient time period to complete the imaging protocol and 5 to 7 day safety followup assessment without prostate biopsy or therapeutic intervention. Patient is judged by the Investigator to have the initiative and means to provide written consent and be compliant with the protocol and be able and commits to make the required study visits. Ambulatory with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; or Karnofsky performance scale of ≥ 70. (seen appendix below) Patient is between 30 and 75 years of age. Patient or physician plans definitive concomitant chemotherapy, therapeutic radiation treatment, biologic treatment and/or local ablative treatment for cancer within the interval of study participation. Prior therapeutic pelvic irradiation. Recent prostate biopsy, within 1 month of study enrollment. Patient with contraindications to TRUSguided prostate biopsy (continuous need for anticoagulation, no rectum, etc.) Clinical evidence of prostatitis, or other benign prostate gland abnormality, that would explain elevated PSA and/or (digital rectal exam) DRE findings. Active malignancy or therapy for malignancy within 6 months, other than basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patient received a radiopharmaceutical which was within 5 physical halflives at the time of study imaging. Known history of humanantimurineantibodies (HAMA) or known allergic reaction to previously received murine based products.</criteria>
