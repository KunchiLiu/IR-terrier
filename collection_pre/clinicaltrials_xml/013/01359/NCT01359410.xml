	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial of stapled pancreatic transection versus mesh reinforced stapled pancreatic transection. For the duration of the study period, participating surgeons will utilize a standardized staple technique. Either a reabsorbable polytrimethylene carbonate mesh (SEAMGUARD速) or reabsorbable strips of bovine pericardium (PERI-STRIPS DRY速) will be used to reinforce the stapled pancreatic transection line in the test group. In order to have a uniform test method, the investigators will utilize a laparoscopic stapling device for both open and laparoscopic procedures and a uniform staple size (4.8mm).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reinforced Staple Line on Leak Rate in Distal Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic leak remains a significant cause of morbidity and extra cost following distal pancreatectomy. Historically, previous attempts to reduce the leak rate have met with limited success. To examine this problem the investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial of stapled pancreatic transection versus mesh reinforced stapled pancreatic transection. For the duration of the study period, participating surgeons will utilize a standardized staple technique. Either a reabsorbable polytrimethylene carbonate mesh (SEAMGUARD速) or reabsorbable strips of bovine pericardium (PERI-STRIPS DRY速) will be used to reinforce the stapled pancreatic transection line in the test group. In order to have a uniform test method, the investigators will utilize a laparoscopic stapling device for both open and laparoscopic procedures and a uniform staple size (4.8mm). A drain will be placed in the left upper quadrant at the time of resection. Drainage of the pancreatic resection bed is widely accepted and remains our current standard of care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must be 18 years or older and able to give consent. Any patient undergoing a distal pancreatectomy, laparoscopic or open, will be eligible for randomization. No exclusion is provided for primary diagnosis. In the event of a patient undergoing a planned resection of another organ or organs with only a possibility of a distal pancreatic resection (i.e. colectomy, hepatectomy, gastrectomy, nephrectomy), the patient will still be eligible for inclusion in the study. We expect that some patients will be randomized but not resected (ie metastasis identified). A few patients may not be stapled using the study device for technical reasons (ie the stapler does not fit). The data will be analyzed in an intenttotreatment approach. None specified</criteria>
