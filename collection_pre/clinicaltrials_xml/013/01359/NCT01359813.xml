	<brief_summary>Patients with cirrhosis present an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most frequent infection and induces severe circulatory dysfunction associated with renal failure in about 30% of cases. Renal failure is a reliable surrogate marker of in-hospital mortality in patients with SBP or with non-SBP infections. Albumin, as an adjuvant to antibiotherapy reduces significantly the rate of renal failure, in-hospital mortality, and overall mortality (Sort P, et al. NEJM 1999). However, little is known regarding the effect of albumin administration in patients with non-SBP infections. Two recent prospective studies demonstrated that non-SBP infections are associated with impairment of the effective circulating volume and precipitate renal failure whatever the presence of ascites. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of albumin, associated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, on occurrence or deterioration of renal failure and survival in septic (SIRS criteria required) cirrhotic patients with non-SBP infections and presenting with a Child-Pugh score &gt; 8.</brief_summary>
