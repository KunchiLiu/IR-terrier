	<brief_title>Topical Ganciclovir in Patients Receiving Penetrating Keratoplasty With Cytomegalovirus Endotheliitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we recruit 7 immunocompetent patients with unexplained graft failures, which mimicked herpetic anterior uveitis and graft rejection initially, were diagnosed as CMV endotheliitis after aqueous tapping for CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Topical ganciclovir was used to control and prevent the reactivation of CMV without systemic application and their clinical courses were presented after this treatment modality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of topical ganciclovir in patients with cytomegalovirus endotheliitis receiving penetrating keratoplasty at National Taiwan University hospital.</detailed_description>
