	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Primary long full coverage stenting is superior to primary short spot stenting in the treatment of long (≥80 mm) femoropopliteal artery lesions. Study design : - Prospective, randomized, multi-center study - A total of 220 subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease of lower limbs who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included. - Patients will be randomized in a two by two factorial manner according to the strategy of stenting (long versus short stenting) and the additional use of cilostazol. Each randomization of the enrolled subjects will be done 1:1. - Patients will be followed clinically for 1 year after the procedure. - Angiographic or CT follow-up will be performed at 1 year.</brief_summary>
