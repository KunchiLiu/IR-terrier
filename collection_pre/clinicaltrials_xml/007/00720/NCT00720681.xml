	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to review our experience with the operative management of acute diaphyseal fractures of the humerus via an anterolateral approach with the use of small fragment fixation at a Level I, urban, trauma center. We will report our clinical and radiographic results, complication rate and final range of motion. A standardized outcome measurement (DASH) will be reported. Muscle recovery of the triceps and biceps will be evaluated by a standard protocol, accomplished with the assistance of a licensed physical therapist. We hypothesize that open reduction and internal fixation of humeral diaphyseal fractures via an antero-lateral approach with the use of small fragment fixation is a safe and efficacious way to treat multiple trauma patients with these injuries.</brief_summary>
